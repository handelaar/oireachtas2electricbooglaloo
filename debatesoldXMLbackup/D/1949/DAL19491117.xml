      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether the Government will consider the desirability of commemorating the heroic lives of Lord Edward Fitzgerald and Robert Emmet by erecting memorials to them in the precincts of Leinster House; and whether the Government will recommend the setting up of a committee of both Houses of the Oireachtas to report on the matter.</P>

      <P>As I think the Deputy realises, the matter that he raises is one for the House itself&mdash;or for the two Houses&mdash;rather than for the Government or for any Minister.  I would, therefore, suggest that he should arrange to have the matter raised, in the first instance, at a meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether the Government have decided to acquire the new Córas Iompair Éireann building at Store Street, Dublin; and, if so, whether he will state what it is proposed to make of (a) the portion of the premises designed as a central bus station, and (b) the remainder of the premises.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is, no doubt, aware that Córas Iompair Éireann recently indicated that they did not now require the premises at Store Street for use as a central bus terminus and administrative offices.  In view of this fact, and as the Department of Social Welfare is in urgent need of more suitable and centralised <Col N="1018" /> accommodation for a Dublin staff which at present numbers approximately 1,300 and is spread over 13 buildings in Dublin, the Government have authorised the Minister for Social Welfare to take steps to purchase the Store Street premises for use as a central office for the Department of Social Welfare.  This will enable the buildings at present occupied by the Department to be made available or disposed of for other purposes.  The entire premises at Store Street will be used by the Department, the intention being that the ground-floor section should be adapted for office use.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare whether he is aware that widows resident in this country, whose husbands died in Great Britain since 1948 and who are in receipt of contributory pensions from the British Government, receive no allowances in respect of their children; and, if so, whether he will indicate when this anomalous situation first arose, and whether he will take steps, in consultation with the British Government, to remedy it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will no doubt appreciate that this is not a matter in which I have any functions, these pensions being paid direct to the beneficiaries by the British authorities without reference to my Department.</P>
      <P>I understand, however, that under the British scheme which came into operation in July, 1948, dependents' allowances are restricted generally to the only or eldest child of a widow. The expression &ldquo;child&rdquo; is defined as a person who would be treated as a child under the British Family Allowances Act and it is a condition for payment under that Act that the child be residing in Great Britain.</P>
      <P>My Department has been in correspondence with the British Ministry of National Insurance with a view to clarifying the position of widows living in this country who may be eligible for contributory widows' pensions from Britain.</P>

      <P>I am aware that representations referred to by the Deputy have been made to the authorities of University College, Dublin, and that, so far, the request made has not been acceded to.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, universities in this country are autonomous and all matters connected with examination papers would normally be entirely within their own jurisdiction and not subject to outside interference or suggestion.</P>
      <P>In so far as providing versions of scholarship papers in the Irish language affects the status and the progress of that language in the secondary schools I am having the situation investigated.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister consider it desirable that this constituent college of the National University, assisted and supported out of public moneys, should impudently pursue a course contrary to the educational policy not alone of this Government but of two previous Governments? Is the Minister aware that the request to set similar scholarship papers was acceded to by the two other constituent colleges of the National University, namely, University College, Galway, and University College, Cork? In view of that, will the Minister not agree that no excuse can be made for this anti-national Roundhead attitude <Col N="1020" /> displayed by the University College, Dublin, Academic Council?</P>

A grant towards the cost of maintaining the children on the mainland for the purpose of attending a national school thereon is available, and will be paid on application. Mrs. O'Sullivan was advised accordingly.</P>

      <P>At the present rate of bread consumption the full wheat requirements <Col N="1025" /> of the country are approximately 470,000 tons of dried wheat.  At no time has the intake of the millers reached ten barrels per acre of green wheat.  In recent years the mill intake of wheat has varied from two and a half barrels to six and a half barrels per acre.  When one takes into account the seed requirements and the variation in yields between different qualities of land and the variation in the mill intake from year to year it will be seen that any estimate of an acreage to provide full requirements would have to vary between rather wide limits.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he will indicate how he proposes to provide alternative work for those who may be disemployed by the proposed withdrawal of the subsidy on wheatenmeal, by orienting to mills where this commodity is produced, the assembling of wheat maize and compound feed manufacture, milling on commission and other cereal assembly work, in view of the fact that the number of persons engaged in these trades is already sufficient to meet current demands.</P>

      <P>In the reply given to Deputy Hickey on this subject on the 2nd November an indication was given in general terms of the measures that could be taken with a view to the safeguarding of the employment of workers in the wheatenmeal industry, should what I regard as the unreasonable fears of certain millers be realised. The Deputy is under a misapprehension in thinking that the maximum volume of employment in the handling and processing of cereals and other feeding stuffs has been reached.  A considerable expansion of this type of business is expected with the increase in the numbers of live stock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Parliamentary Secretary considered that in view of the fact that compulsory tillage is no longer in force and that there is a possible prospect of a decrease in output from the tillage acreage, the mills that had been handling the assemblage of seeds and other such activities will not have <Col N="1026" /> enough activities to contend with without taking into consideration the mills that will not now be engaged in the production of wheatenmeal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>As I told the Deputy, it is expected that with an increase in the numbers of live stock and a consequent rise in the use of artificial feeding stuffs the mills will have adequate work.

      <P>I am not aware that the Dublin Corporation are prepared to allot houses to families of members of the Defence Forces in the manner suggested. In the letting of local authority houses a statutory preference is required to be given to persons displaced from their dwellings by operations of the local authority under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts, and to families living in one room dwellings where one or more persons are suffering from tuberculosis.  Until these categories are properly rehoused I do not think that an amendment of the <Col N="1039" /> regulations which would give a priority to the claims of any other classes would be justified.</P>

As far as I am concerned in the Department of Health, I will do my best to ensure that hospital beds are provided out of the Hospital Sweep money but, as I made it clear yesterday to a deputation which saw me on this matter, considerable contributions have been given to the Dublin Corporation's responsibilities in the nature of hospital beds in Blanchardstown, in Ballyowen and in the new hospitals, St. Vincent's, St. Laurence's Hospital, St. Mary's Tuberculosis Institution, Crumlin Children's Hospital, all amounting to many millions of pounds to which the Dublin Corporation have to make no contribution whatsoever.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether he considers (a) the appointment of a resident medical superintendent at Galway Central Hospital a matter of urgency, and, if so, for what reasons, and (b) that a person lacking a competent knowledge of Irish could satisfactorily perform the duties of the new office, and, if not, whether he will declare such knowledge to be an essential qualification for the post.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider that the appointment of a resident medical superintendent in the Galway Central Hospital is a matter of urgency.  The reasons for this appointment were communicated in detail to the Galway County Manager in a letter dated the 22nd August, 1946.  Briefly, the appointment is being made because experience has shown that it is essential to the efficient functioning of the hospital that there should be on the staff a medical officer who will be responsible for (1) superintending the general management and administration of the institution; (2) exercising <Col N="1044" /> general supervision and control over all officers in the institution and seeing that such officers perform their respective duties; and (3) supervising all arrangements for the comfort and welfare of the patients.</P>
      <P>I am most anxious indeed that the person holding the post should have a competent knowledge of Irish and would be very glad if it were possible to obtain the services of such a person who, in addition, would possess the high technical qualifications and experience required.  My own experience and that of the previous administration has, unfortunately, shown this to be unlikely.  In the circumstances, I was very reluctantly obliged to refrain from declaring a competent knowledge of Irish to be an essential qualification for the post.</P>
      <P>The regulations prescribe, however, that subject to the other provisions&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  The best qualified candidate from amongst those who possess a competent knowledge of Irish will, if otherwise suitable, be recommended to the local authority for appointment to the vacant post.</P>
      <P>(b)  If no qualified and suitable candidate possessing a competent knowledge of Irish is available, the best qualified candidate from amongst those who possess a good knowledge of Irish will, if otherwise suitable, be recommended.</P>
      <P>(c)  If no qualified and suitable candidate with a good knowledge of Irish is available, the best qualified candidate, if otherwise suitable, will be recommended.</P>
      <P>The duties attaching to the office are concerned mainly with the medical administration of the hospital and do not include the treatment of patients. The ordinary doctor-patient relationship will not, therefore, exist between the resident medical superintendent and the patients.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (2), to insert before paragraph (b) a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>( ) the said articles shall provide that no remuneration shall be payable to any director other than the managing director so long as any advances from the Minister are outstanding;.</P>
      <P>The Minister has given us no precise information as to the functions which the proposed directors of this agency should perform or as to the remunerations they are to receive.  Deputy Cowan yesterday assumed that the directors would act as censors of the journalists employed by the agency, and have responsibility for approving of all material issued by them.  I assume that is not correct and that the directors will be concerned only with the business activities of the agency. If so, I think it likely that their directorial functions or duties will be very light.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The general type of supervision which they will exercise over the business of the agency will not involve frequent meetings or any great sacrifice of time and, in view of the fact that the future of the agency is very speculative and that the likelihood of its making profits <Col N="1051" /> or being in a position to repay the advances which it is to receive from the Exchequer is not very great, I think that the Minister should endeavour to ensure that we get directors who will discharge these light duties without remuneration or, in any event, that the remuneration should be conditional upon their making the agency a financial success.</P>

I do not know what Deputy Lemass intends to do but from his remarks some time ago, I thought we were going to have something in the nature of a miniature war.  However, wiser councils prevailed and Deputy Lemass and the Minister have arrived at the same decision&mdash;whether it was telepathy or not I do not know.

I am delighted to hear Deputy Cowan say &ldquo;Hear, hear&rdquo;.  I am sure that when it comes to taking big decisions Deputy Cowan will repeat that &ldquo;Hear, hear&rdquo;, in regard to decisions which are going to improve the standard of life in this country.  With reference to the precise information required by Deputy Lemass, I remember not very <Col N="1052" /> long ago seeking certain precise information in this House and, by the time I got it, I knew as much about the matter as when I started. I should like Deputy Lemass to give me some terms of reference, so to speak, with regard to this precise information.  Deputy Lemass probably knows more about this Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>In putting a proposition like this forward, one generally makes an estimate of what the initial cost is likely to be.  I am not talking about the £25,000, because I assume the Minister is not going to plunge and spend the whole of it at once.  Has he made out any estimate of what the expenses will be in the first year?  It would give some satisfaction to the House and the public in general if we could know how much money he expects to spend, anticipating even roughly how much he may expect to get in revenue, even if there is a marginal loss for the first year or so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it arises on this amendment.  There is a question as to remuneration and the amendment says it is not to be given until there is a balance struck.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister might answer the question put by Deputy Lemass.  The Bill provides that there are to be not less than three or more than five directors, including the chairman and the managing director, and the amendment provides that no remuneration shall be payable to any director, other than the managing director, so long as any advances from the Minister for Finance are outstanding. I take it that at this stage the Minister has in his mind some idea of the bones of this news agency, as to whether he is to appoint three or five directors, and whether those directors are to be paid or not.  The Minister ought to be able to indicate at this stage whether it is proposed to pay them and, if it is proposed to pay them, how much it is proposed to pay.  It might be unreasonable to tie the Minister down to the last shilling, but we could have a rough figure, within £100 or so, of the remuneration to be paid to those directors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If, as I suggested last night, those <Col N="1054" /> directors are to be civil servants, or if one of them is to be a civil servant, is he to be paid, in addition to his salary as a civil servant, out of the funds of this news agency?  That is important, because the qualification for being a director is to hold at least one share in the agency and it is provided in the Bill that that share will be paid by the Minister for Finance.  The whole thing, of course, is fictional.  The qualification for a director is the holding of at least one share and the Bill provides that that one share will be paid for by the Minister for Finance. The Minister ought to be able to say whether these are to be civil servants or whether some of them are to be civil servants.  If they are not to be civil servants, what are they to be paid? If they are to be civil servants, will they be paid anything in addition to their official salary?</P>
    <P>I make the suggestion at this stage that, if the Minister would give as much information as he possibly can to the House, he would probably facilitate the discussion of the Bill and the amendments.  If we are to be met, every time we ask for information, with a stone wall refusal to give the information, I think it is discourteous to the House and unfair to Deputies. I ask the Minister to indicate what he has in mind.  If he did indicate that, I might be able to take a different view.  But, as it is, and knowing how Acts have been used in the past to do things that were never in the mind of anybody who took part in the passing of these Acts, I feel that it is a wise thing that each Deputy should, in so far as he possibly can, obtain all the information that can possibly be got so that he will be clear in his own mind as to what exactly he is doing when he is passing the Bill or a section.  I feel for myself that if we are placed in blinkers, if we are denied information that it is reasonable to ask for, we may be doing something here that will be regretted in the future.</P>

They <Col N="1055" /> may be fictional snowballs, as Deputy Timoney calls them, but I think, like the snowball, that type of interruption melts before ordinary common sense. I certainly do not appreciate that it is any part of my duty on any Bill, no matter by whom introduced, to vote for it unless I know exactly what is intended by it.  If Deputy Timoney knows whether these people are to be civil servants or not, whether they are to be paid or whether they are not, it would be helpful if he would tell us.</P>

      <P>The common ground between Deputy Lemass and Deputy Cowan on this amendment appears to be the common desire to tie the Minister's hands.  That is applicable to this amendment as it was, without exception, to every other amendment that has been proposed here.  I would appeal to the House not to so emasculate this Bill that it cannot be utilised for the purpose for which it is intended. An attempt has been made in the House, since the debate on the Committee Stage started, so to emasculate the Bill as to make it useless to this or to any succeeding Government.</P>

Now, I do not think it is a bit unreasonable to ask that.  I do not think it is unreasonable for Deputy Cowan to ask if the Minister would indicate what would be the salary of the managing director and of the other two directors.  Will the Minister say now whether he intends appointing a journalist or journalists on the directorate?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should deal with the amendment first. The question is whether the directors will be remunerated or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that we will not have to enter into a discussion all over again to deal with some of the points that have been made by Deputies.  In the first instance, I am not aware that I refused to give any information to this House concerning any questions that were asked by any of the Deputies.  I cannot, however, keep on repeating the same information <Col N="1057" /> over and over again if Deputies choose to ignore the answers that I have given as well as the information that I gave originally.  I dealt with most of the matters that have been raised on the Committee Stage fairly fully on the Second Reading.</P>
      <P>Questions have been asked as to who the directors are likely to be.  I have not really considered the matter very fully yet.  Until the Bill was passed, I preferred to leave the provisions there in the form in which it is usual to find them in such Bills and without getting down to the consideration of the actual personnel.  I would say it is probable that one or two members of the board would be civil servants.  I would say that would be so in the normal course.  I do not want to be tied to that.  I would say that, in the normal course of events, somebody from the Department of External Affairs should be on the board and, possibly, somebody from the Government Information Bureau. But, again, I do not want to be tied to that.  It seems to me that it would make for co-operation and smooth working if that were done.  For these reasons it is very obvious that the question of the remuneration of the directors must vary in each individual case.  One assurance that I would certainly give the House is that no excessive remuneration will be paid to any of the directors or to anybody else in the employment of the news agency.  I can give that assurance to the House, and I willingly do so.</P>
      <P>With regard to the amendment, I do not think it can have been put down seriously.  In effect, it proposes that the directors should receive no remuneration at all.  As I indicated to the House.  I do not expect that the news agency for some considerable time will show any profit or will be in a position to repay any of the advances made.  Therefore, the proposal in the amendment in effect suggests that the directors should be on a voluntary basis.  I do not think that would be practicable.  It is not a proposal that was ever introduced in any of the various measures that were proposed to this House by Deputy Lemass or by the members of the last Government in introducing similar measures.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to correct the Minister on that.  It has been, I would say more often than not, the practice not to pay remuneration to the directors of State-sponsored companies in their initial stages.  I could name a large number of companies which functioned during the emergency the directors of which carried a heavy burden of responsibility and none of whom accepted remuneration. There is the case of Irish Shipping, Limited, the directors of which received no remuneration during the earlier years of the company's existence. I think most Deputies will know that it is a common practice in business for the directors of a new company not to accept their fees until the company has got over its initial difficulties and is beginning to cover its expenses, if not to make a profit. There is absolutely nothing unprecedented in the suggestion that the directors of this company should receive no fees during the stage in which the company is making losses. There are many examples of companies of that kind established by the last Government and numerous examples in ordinary commercial life.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite true that the legislation usually provided that the remuneration should be determined by Order of the Minister concerned or by the Minister for Finance.  In this particular case we are asking for information. We have not got the information. I gathered from the Minister's reply that these directors are going to be remunerated.  That was implied in his observations, if not stated directly. We got the assurance that the remuneration will not be excessive. What does the Minister mean by &ldquo;excessive&rdquo;?  Would he regard £100 a year in fees to a director as excessive or inadequate?  Can he give us some information as to what he has in mind, without committing himself?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quite prepared to admit that in a case of this kind it might be <Col N="1059" /> undesirable to fix a figure in the Bill, but it would not be unusual to fix a maximum figure in the Bill, and that assurance of having such a figure in the legislation would, ordinarily, be sought by the Dáil.  It is, I think, only reasonable to look upon this House as a gathering of shareholders.  We are the people who are being asked to provide the money which the company can lose, and we want some indication that that money is going to be usefully spent and not squandered unnecessarily. It seems to me that the putting of a board of directors on this organisation is like inverting a pyramid.  It seems to me that it could be run by one individual, a competent director and staff.  Why it must have a whole remunerated board of directors, plus an advisory committee to see how a limited number of officials work, I cannot understand.  If we are going to provide the money for this service, let us at least ensure that the bulk of the money will go on the service and not in paying salaries to people supervising the way in which other people work.</P>

      <P>I am agreeably surprised to learn from Deputy Lemass that we have such a large number of people in the business world who are so unselfish as to do all they can to get on the boards of new industries established in recent times, and then deny themselves the right to draw directors' fees.</P>

      <P>I admit you know more about this business than I do, but I am agreeably surprised to hear that. If that is so, why is there all this gate-crashing for representation on the boards of these new industries?  I have taken a very keen interest, a personal and a small financial interest, in some companies.  When you go around your constituency looking for people to put money into industry, the first thing you are asked is: &ldquo;What are you going to do in this yourself?&rdquo;  I have taken a nominal share, because that is all I can afford, in some industries established in my own area so that I would <Col N="1060" /> have a right to attend meetings and read the balance sheet.  I have read no balance sheets where the directors declined, for the reasons given by Deputy Lemass, to draw fees before the concern was paying.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister visualise that these directors will be whole-time, or will they be part-time? Are they going to give up their own businesses and become whole-time directors of this organisation, or will they simply be part-time directors and attend meetings weekly, fortnightly or monthly as the case may be?  That is something the Minister has probably thought out and I would like him to deal with it because it has a bearing on the amendment.  If these directors attend meetings weekly, fortnightly or monthly, then there will be no case for any remuneration at all beyond some out-of-pocket expenses if they happen to have to travel a long distance.  Will the Minister tell us whether he visualises that this will be a full-time job for the three or five directors?</P>

      <P>Of course it is not going to be a whole-time job.  It is going to be a part-time position the same as the boards of any other companies. At the beginning I imagine they will have to meet very frequently. As to their remuneration, I hope some of them may not have to receive any remuneration at all.  Deputy Lemass has asked me what I would consider excessive remuneration.  I am quite certain his views and mine on that point do not coincide, because I look upon many remunerations which were directly or indirectly sanctioned during his period of office as being excessive.</P>

It has been done and such cases are available.  I mentioned Irish Shipping, Fuel Importers and Grain Importers.  Even the directors of Fáilte Teoranta, who got nothing but abuse over the management of their hotels, got no fees.  There are people who are prepared to work as directors without fees.  I am not asking that they should work without fees in perpetuity.  I am asking that they should work without fees until it is clear that the concern is likely to pay its way.</P>

      <Col N="1067" /> In line 53, to delete the words &ldquo;two hundred and fifty&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;one hundred&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The formation of this organisation, which is termed a company in the Bill, should follow the ordinary lines of formation of such a company and the normal expenses of forming a company such as this, including the draft of the memoranda and the articles of association, the printing of them and registration fees.  I am not sure whether there are, in fact, any registration fees in a company of this kind &mdash;I do not think there are&mdash;but the normal costs of doing that would be well under £100.  That being so, to put in a section in the Bill giving permission to go as far as £250 seems to me to be excessive.  I do not know what the Minister has in mind.  I do not know whether he proposes to avail of the services of some of the solicitors in the service of the Departments of State to prepare or to do all the work necessary for the establishment and registration of this company.  If he does, the expenses should be very small, and should, in fact, be no more than the cost of printing.  I do not know whether the Minister visualises that, or whether he visualises the appointment of some solicitor for the purpose of forming this company, in which case the costs ought not to exceed £100.  However, as far as the amendment is concerned, I do not want to press it, because I do not think it is an amendment which is worth pressing.  At the same time, I should like to have an indication from the Minister as to whether he intends to have this company formed by one of the solicitors in the service of the State or whether it is his idea that some outside solicitor should be appointed to organise and run this.  I would ask the Minister to give some information on that point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of the section in relation to making available a sum not to exceed £250 is the standard provision made in all similar enactments. It by no means indicates that £250 will be spent.  It is a ceiling placed on the expenditure and I hope <Col N="1068" /> that the expenditure on the promotion of this company will be much lower than £250.  I do not want, on the other hand, to minimise the difficulties involved in the preparation of the memorandum and articles of association of this particular company.  I have had a look&mdash;I have not given the matter very careful consideration yet&mdash;at the way in which Reuter's and other news agencies are incorporated and they are extremely complex and complicated documents. I think, having regard to the complexities, it would probably be more satisfactory if some firm of solicitors practised and versed in the formation of companies and the drafting of memoranda and articles of association were employed rather than State solicitors who have not very much practical experience of that character in their State work.</P>

      <P>On the section you ruled out of order, Sir, my amendment, No. 20, and a similar amendment to Section 11 will, I understand, also be ruled out of order.  The purpose of the amendment was to get rid of the pretence that the news agency is to be financed by means of advances from the Exchequer on terms to be fixed by the Minister for Finance giving the impression that the news agency would at some time be able to repay.  It would be better and more straightforward to make provision for a grant to be voted for the purposes of the news agency.  Why is it necessary to have provisions here to finance the news agency by way of advances when the Minister knows quite well and has in fact admitted that the agency will never be able to repay?  If it ever gets to the position of making profits or accumulating reserves from which it could repay the obvious thing to do would be to reduce future advances. It would be much simpler and much more straightforward to provide in Sections 10 and 11 grants-in-aid out of voted moneys rather than this arrangement of making advances on the understanding that they would be repaid.</P>

      <P>I must say that when we come to this section we are concerned, as a Dáil, with authorising the Minister for Finance to make money available.  That is really what this section means, and without the authorisation in this section the Minister for Finance cannot make the money available.  If we are going to engage in this fiction, instead of granting money to the news agency and wiping off at the end of every year whatever the amount is, the Minister for Finance will have to account for it as money lent under certain conditions to this news agency.  That, I think, is undesirable from the point of view of the control of public finance. I think it is completely wrong to do it in that way.  We authorise the Minister for Finance to make available £10,000, £25,000, or whatever the sum of money is.  I think it would be much better if we authorised the Minister for Finance to grant that sum to be used to the best advantage by the news agency, but if we are going to have in the accounts of the Department of Finance sums of money lent to this news agency it suggests that these moneys are lent and will be repaid at some time.  At least, there is a claim to repay them but if we are reasonable about the situation we see that it would be impossible for this news agency to be in a position to repay money unless, under the memorandum and articles of association, <Col N="1070" /> they take powers of gold mining, as they may do.  These articles of association include everything, every possible thing that a news agency could do, and under one of these sub-heads they might, at some time, strike oil.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lehane I knows as well as I do that this news agency is never going to make a halfpenny and we should face up to that fact and get away from the fiction that this is money lent by the Minister for Finance that might be paid back at some time.  I look on that as a sort of immoral control of public moneys and I am surprised that the Minister for Finance would be a party to that in any way.</P>
      <P>Section put and agreed to.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete the word &ldquo;advance&rdquo; in line 2 and substitute the word &ldquo;grant&rdquo; and to delete sub-section (2).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it would be very desirable that we should insert in this Bill an overriding limit to the advances which may be made to the news agency.  That, I may say, is not unusual in legislation of this character.  In various Bills providing for advances to companies established to undertake particular work the Legislature has indicated how much it was prepared to risk in the venture.  That does not mean, and would not mean in this case, that the news agency might not get more money if it was doing good work and there was a desire to give it more money, but it would mean that it would only get more money following the introduction of an amending Bill so that both Houses of the Oireachtas would have an opportunity of getting a report on the work of the agency and some reasons why they should alter the limit fixed to the advances. It may be argued that as the money has to be voted by the Oireachtas now <Col N="1071" /> we would get that opportunity on the annual Estimate, but most Deputies know and even the newest Deputies in the House have learned by this that that safeguard is more apparent than real in so far as the Estimate for the Department of External Affairs or the Department of Industry and Commerce is discussed here in bulk and the discussion often ranges over a very wide field relating to the different sub-heads of the Estimate so that no single item is really adequately discussed or isolated for special examination.  The Minister need not be afraid that he is departing from precedent if he accepts this amendment or if he agrees to insert in the Bill some other limit.  I am not committed to the figure I have mentioned in my amendment, £10,000.  I think it is as much as I would be prepared to venture on this enterprise, without insisting upon getting a report on its progress before putting any more into it.  I cannot know what the Minister has in mind or to what extent £10,000 will meet his programme or fall short of it.  If he prefers to have some other figure, that is all right by me.  I think there should be in the section of the Bill a fixed sum and a legal obligation on the Minister to come back to the Dáil with an amending Bill, if he has to exceed that sum or if circumstances should arise which, in his view, justified him in exceeding it.  I am surprised, in fact, that the Minister for Finance did not insist upon such a limitation when the Bill was submitted to his Department for confirmation.  I cannot remember that I was ever able to get a Bill of this kind through without my colleague, the Minister for Finance, putting on a limitation.</P>

I am not aware that he had such limitations placed upon any similar legislation. The proposal contained in the amendment would be completely unworkable. As I pointed out to the House several <Col N="1072" /> times before, the company is not likely to be a paying proposition, the advances are likely to be outstanding and likely to be much greater than the sum suggested by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>As to the estimate of the cost, the amount provided for in the Estimates this year was £25,000. As I explained to the House, it is hoped that there will be, apart from whatever office there is in Dublin, an office in the United States and an office in England.  These will have to be provided for.  At the moment, and until the company has been set up and full investigation is made into the costs of establishing these offices, it would be very difficult to form any accurate estimate; but the House has at all times complete control of moneys, inasmuch as the moneys for the news agency will have been voted by the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has that in the Estimates.  I am sorry to interrupt, but I do not want the discussion to proceed on a wrong basis.  Not one <Col N="1074" /> penny can be given to this company that is not voted by this House annually in an Estimate.  Therefore, the House can regulate every year to a penny what it is going to give to the company.  That is the usual practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HarryColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all right, but as Deputy Lemass has pointed out, when the Estimates come up, it is very hard to deal with every item.  One has to take them in bulk.  In this case, there is no earthly reason why the Minister should not be prepared to give some figure which he thinks would meet him for a reasonable time.  Then, if necessary, he could come back to the Dáil for more, as has been done in several other cases.  I think it is our duty here, as representatives, to insist on some such provision.  If it is likely to be a success, I do not think this House will refuse the Minister the finances necessary to carry on.</P>

I do not think that can be advanced seriously. We have heard much smaller items than could possibly be involved in this dealt with on the Estimates from year to year.</P>

      <P>Perhaps.  The Deputy is entitled to the point of view that it has been unsatisfactory.  However, in the very limited experience that is available to me, I have heard Deputies on both sides of the House dealing at length with minute points of expenditure on the Estimates.  I think the whole objection to the section which it is sought to enshrine in this amendment is completely unreal and on a par with most of the other amendments that have been tabled.  The Dáil has ample opportunity, unlimited opportunity, to deal in detail with any money so expended on the discussion of the Estimate for the Minister's Department. To seek, either jocularly, like Deputy Cowan, or dramatically, like <Col N="1075" /> Deputy Lemass, to justify the amendment on the basis that there is no check over the expenditure and that it is necessary to put a ceiling to it is, to my mind, completely unreal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some doubts &mdash;perhaps the Minister will look into it &mdash;whether the procedure laid down in this section complies with the Companies Acts.  Sub-section (2) says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) The Minister for Finance may, from time to time as occasion requires, for the purpose of compliance with so much of the Companies Acts as requires that there shall always be at least seven members of the agency or for the purpose of providing a person appointed or intended to be appointed to be a director of the agency with the necessary qualifications, do either or both of the following things....&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Then follows provision for requiring a member of the agency to transfer all or any one or more of the shares in the agency for the time being held by him to the said Minister or any other person.  It does seem to me that this section drives or attempts to drive the proverbial coach and four through the provisions of the Companies Acts which have for their object the establishment of genuine companies.  I do not know whether the Minister has succeeded in achieving that object, but when any query has been raised before in regard to provisions such as these, the Minister's answer has been:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I am following precedent.  That was in an Act or in so many Acts introduced into this House by the Minister for Supplies or the Minister for Industry and Commerce.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that is a valid argument at all.  Many of us, including the Minister, were very critical of some of these companies which were formed and there has been substantial public criticism of them.  The section provides for the holding of shares in trust for the Minister for Finance and the obligation of the holder of the shares to transfer these shares to the Minister, if the Minister orders him to do so, or to somebody else.  The whole thing&mdash; and this is clearly set out in that section as well as in the other sections-is in this sort of state that, if anything <Col N="1078" /> of the kind were attempted by an individual company promoter outside, he would find himself in Mountjoy.</P>

      <P>The answer of the Minister to every query raised in regard to these sections is that it has <Col N="1079" /> been done in a previous Act.  Is this simply a case of precedent being followed or is there any good purpose behind the provisions in the section?  I can do no more than draw attention to it.  If the answer is that it is following precedent and if there are enough votes here to keep the precedent going, I suppose we will just have it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 25:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (3) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>( ) The names of the members of the advisory board shall as soon as practicable after their appointment be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and if either House, within 21 sitting days, by resolution, expresses disapproval of any member, such member shall forthwith cease to be a member of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1080" /> I am not altogether enamoured of the idea of having the names of the members of the advisory board submitted individually to the Dáil for approval, but perhaps on this amendment the Minister would give the House some idea of what he has in mind in his proposal to establish an advisory board at all&mdash;what its functions will be, what class of persons will act upon it, whether they will be remunerated as the company directors will be remunerated, or whether they will be expected to give their services without fee, and if it is intended that the House should have any function in regard to the advisory board.  It may be asking too much to require that the names should be formally submitted for approval here, but in so far as this board, as I understand it, is to exercise a sort of general supervision over the carrying out of the functions of the agency it could be described as the organ of the Oireachtas rather than the organ of the Minister.  Therefore the Oireachtas should have some right to influence the type of persons that go on it, if not to approve of the actual individuals themselves. I think the Minister in any event is setting up a top-heavy organisation. If the agency is to be limited in size and in functions to the extent he has indicated, then to give it an advisory board as well as a board of directors seems to be an unnecessary refinement.  I doubt very much if this advisory board will function at all. Again let the Minister benefit from my experience.  He will find that various measures for which I was responsible contained provisions for advisory boards and, after they met formally for the first time, we never heard of them again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>The advisory board visualised is intended to advise the news agency and to co-ordinate the work of the news agency with that of newspapers, journalists, broadcasting authorities and correspondents generally. I think it should be an extremely valuable board.  I do not agree with the Deputy that advisory committees or boards are valueless.  I have had experience of an advisory committee in my Department which has done invaluable work over the last 12 months, <Col N="1081" /> and I think that in the case of a news agency which is bound to have very close relationship with journalists, newspapers and the news world in general, it is essential that there should be a body representative of these interests, with all the skill and experience that they have gained in their profession, available to the agency for advice.  I think it should be a very useful body.</P>

I have had experience of advisory boards which are completely useless bodies, such as the Broadcasting Advisory Board.  I am not referring to the personnel of this board, but I do not know when the board last met.  I doubt if it met subsequent to its first meeting.</P>

There may be members who will not be resident in Dublin.

      <P>The amendment <Col N="1082" /> which I have down would confine membership of the board to working journalists having at least ten years' practical experience.  Looking at the whole thing in a realistic way, we have gone a certain part of the way now in establishing a news agency with directors, with practical working journalists as a staff, with the Minister for External Affairs and the Minister for Finance.  That is the construction right up to this and now we state that an advisory board of not more than seven members and representative of newspaper editors, journalists, correspondents, broadcasting authorities and such other persons as the Minister may think competent to advise the agency, shall be set up. Their function will be to advise and assist the agency in the conduct of its functions.  Clearly there is no commonsense in that.  If you have your directors, your staff&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I wanted to shorten the procedure by discussing my own amendment.  I say it would not be worth while using the time of the House to approve of that type of advisory board because, remember the board is to advise and assist the agency, not to advise and assist the Minister or to advise and assist the Government.  It is to advise and assist the agency which is set up with its directors and staff.  If the agency is selected from the competent people the Minister has in mind, it may very well take advice or not take advice. Generally, if the members of the agency are competent, they will not want advice nor will they want assistance. I do not think this board will perform any function whatsoever.  I think the Minister would be well advised to delete Section 17 altogether on the Report Stage and give the agency some sort of chance.</P>

There is no means by which the directors are bound to give them any information or consult with them.  The directors may simply meet them and say to them: &ldquo;We would like your advice this evening, ladies and gentlemen,&rdquo; and that is all.  There is no statutory obligation on the directors to give them any information. The Minister may say that in the normal way they should do it, but the advisory board will have no function except to come up and have a cup of coffee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is one of many provisions with some of which all of us will agree, but there are other provisions which we might reasonably have some doubts about.  For that reason it is no harm to get from the Minister some further information other than what he gave yesterday. Land Bills&mdash;and this is no exception&mdash; are generally involved and intricate pieces of legislation, and I would like, and other Deputies would like, to protest against the bringing before this House of a Bill which, unless they are trained legal experts, very few, if any, Deputies are capable of interpreting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I would be right in saying that one of the principal functions of this House is to frame the laws of the country and to do that Deputies must understand the Bills laid before them.  I think it is only fair that the land laws should be codified and laid before the House in such <Col N="1085" /> a way that ordinary Deputies can understand their meaning.  I think that would be only fair to all Deputies, irrespective of whether they are trained in law or not.  The more complicated the laws of the country are, the better for the legal profession, I suppose, as they will be needed to interpret these laws to the ordinary citizen.  I am sure the Minister will agree that the laws of this country should be such that the ordinary person, without the help of legal aid, should be able clearly to understand what they are.  I am sure the Minister will also agree that, after 60 or 70 years of land Acts, the land laws are so complicated and involved that, without a specialised legal training in them, a person could not understand them.  There are many legal people in this country, especially those practising in cities and towns, who know nothing whatever about the land laws and never had to bother about studying and interpreting them.  If they come up against the problem of the land laws, they are just as much at sea as ordinary people.</P>

      <P>There are a few matters, however, arising out of the Bill as to which I should like to have some more information from the Minister than he gave us in his introductory remarks.  He was so brief in introducing this fairly involved Bill, which will create many complications and problems when it becomes law, that we scarcely got as much information from him as he has already given us in the White Paper.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>We would like to have <Col N="1086" /> more information from the Minister on many aspects of this Bill.</P>
      <P>Section 5 is the first important section that I want to deal with.  It is under this section that the price of land that may be acquired by the Land Commission will be determined in future.  I understand that, at the present time, the formula under which the Land Commission determine the price of land is contained in sub-section (2) of Section 25 of the 1923 Land Act. It says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;As regards untenanted land the price shall, in default of agreement, be such an amount as may be fixed by the Land Commission (other than the Judicial Commissioner), or by the Judicial Commissioner on appeal from the Land Commission, and in fixing such sum regard shall be had to the fair value of the land to the Land Commission and the owner respectively.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is the formula under which land has been acquired in this country since 1923.  It will be agreed, I take it, as a result of the Minister's admission that the previous Government introduced no legislation that took away the people's title to their land.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;As regards untenanted land the price shall, in default of agreement, be such an amount as may be fixed by the Land Commission (other than the Judicial Commissioner) or by the Judicial Commissioner on appeal from the Land Commission.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>

I think that, when property is taken from an owner under the operation of State laws, he should get a fair, honest price for it, and I am contending that under Section 25 of the 1923 Land Act there was nothing to prevent the Land Commission, or the Judicial Commissioner, from giving a fair price for land.</P>

I propose to discuss later Section 23, but I do suggest that I may not be far wrong at all in saying that it is the manner in which Section 23 will be operated that may determine the market value of land in the future.  We all know that land values go up and down.  That has always been so, and this Bill will not prevent that happening.  I suggest to the Minister that the market value of land in a time of depression might be a most <Col N="1089" /> unjust price to pay to the owner of the land.  I also suggest to him that the market value of land in a time of inflation might be a very unjust price to pay either on behalf of the incoming tenant or the State.</P>
      <P>Has the Minister thought out all the problems that may arise in relation to market value?  Market value changes from day to day.  It will change in the way I have already mentioned&mdash;the activities of people coming from other countries to buy land here and because of inflationary tendencies that we may have no control over.  We may do a very serious injustice to the owners of land under that section.  It was said in the past that owing to the price-fixing by the Land Commission or the Judicial Commissioner, injustice was done to certain people.  I did not meet any of them.  I know of people who sold their interests to the Land Commission but I have yet to meet a person to whom an injustice was done by the Land Commission.  We heard here that certain injustices were done under Section 25 of the Land Act of 1923.</P>

That power may be useful to the Minister. He may not like to have that power.  Personally, I do not know whether or not he would like to have it for a long time.

      </P>
      <P>&ldquo;the determination (other than any determination arising in or being part of a rearrangement scheme) of the price at which land is to be sold to any such allottee&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is well aware of the powers he proposes to take under this Bill.  I am sure he has made up his mind before this that he had not sufficient powers.  He is proposing to give the Minister for Lands now certain powers and certain responsibilities that he had not got in the past.  The Minister may say that these powers are being taken only in regard to rundale holdings.  As I read this, those powers may operate in respect of any holding that may be acquired by the Land Commission.  This may make a big change in the future operation of the land laws.  We wonder if the Minister will not need the lay commissioners as he needed them in the past.  He is taking unto himself control of work that was formerly done by the lay commissioners.  I am sure the Minister fully appreciates the problems that have arisen in respect of the acquisition, division and price paid for land.  He may be wise in doing that.  He will know whether he is or not in the course of time.  It may prove to be a boon to the Minister and to the Land Commission. It may prove otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another interesting section. There are many interesting sections in this Bill.  There is the question of the lay commissioners and the Judicial Commissioner.  In the early years of the operation of the Land Act of 1923 the Minister will find, if he reads up the records, that there was little satisfaction with just one Judicial Commissioner operating the Land Acts then. Serious complaints were often made here as to the price paid for land and so on.  Under Section 5 the Minister is making a radical change in the manner in which the price of land acquired may be determined.  He is <Col N="1093" /> doing away with the lay commissioners. These lay commissioners acted as a safeguard when sitting with the Judicial Commissioner.  The Minister proposes doing away with these because he has no further use for them.  I question whether that is or is not wise. The Minister must know quite well that legal minds interpret the law very, very narrowly and they often take quite a different view from the view taken by the ordinary man in the street. They often make a very unwise decision.  I suggest that the lay commissioners would be a help and a safeguard to the community at large in that particular respect.  They would provide a safeguard to the owner of land, to the proposed allottee and also to the finances of the State, and the finances are, after all, an important matter.  The three main factors consisting in the acquisition, division and allocation of land would be better safeguarded under the lay commissioners than they would under the Minister.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will agree that Section 23 is a rather revolutionary innovation.  It has never appeared in any enactment up to this.  Ways and means may be availed of through the operation of the laws to determine the price of land acquired for the Land Commission or for a public authority. There were clauses in some enactments which acted as a guide to safeguard the interests of all the parties concerned.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister proposes to acquire an interest in land offered for sale, carrying with it vacant possession. It is the function of the Land Commission to grant new holdings to allottees.  The Land Commission may purchase such interest for cash and they may attend a public sale and bid by auction.  I wonder if the Minister has fully considered all the matters that may arise out of that?  I am sure he has given it some consideration. Has he foreseen or have his advisers foreseen all the problems and abuses that may arise under the provisions of that section?  To my mind very serious abuses can arise under it in many directions.  I will suggest a few to the Minister that occur to my mind. The Minister's officers visit a particular holding that may be offered for sale.  Immediately they do so the vendor, or the agent of the vendor, and everybody else becomes aware that the Land Commission are interested.  A number of things may happen as a result of that.  The public sale comes along.  Nearly all the vendors are honest people.  They fix a reserve price in their own minds and they tell the agent the reserve price.  There is nothing illegal or immoral if the vendor makes an arrangement with his legal adviser or someone else to have the price of that holding bid up to his reserve.  Will that not be bad?  Will it not be a danger to have such a scheme operating&mdash;to have the Minister's agents buying at public sales?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite possible that the fact that the Minister's agent or officer visits a particular holding and inspects it may damp the sale.  Other persons interested in purchasing the particular holding or piece of land will then and there decide that there is no use in bidding. They will think that if the Land Commission do not buy at the time of the sale they will take it compulsorily.  In that way damage may be done to the owner.  The principle of free sale may be damaged in that respect too&mdash;without that being the intention of the Minister.  Even with the best intentions in the world the Minister may do damage which I am sure he would not <Col N="1095" /> willingly do&mdash;he may damage the principle of the free sale of land.  When the prospective purchasers hear that the Land Commission are interested they will say that the State has a long purse and that there is no use in bidding against the State for a holding.</P>
    <P>Under this section the Minister is cutting out other possible purchasers. If the Land Commission interfere,  attend any sale, or inspect land offered for sale at the time, other purchasers have not a hope in the world.  They probably will not bid and you may do an injury to the vendor of that land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The reverse could be the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but it is a dangerous power for any Department of State to have.  I can see very many of the problems that may arise under the operation of that section.  The Minister and, indeed, other Deputies, may say that it is necessary in the West of Ireland where land is offered for sale to have that provision.  I think and believe&mdash;and I am sure Deputies on all sides of the House will agree with me&mdash;that whether it is the West of Ireland or the East of Ireland or the South of Ireland or anywhere else that is involved, the section will not operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another thing is that immediately a place is put up for sale, say, in a congested area and, indeed, it need not be a congested area at all, a local agitation starts&mdash;local interests, land hunger and landless men.  It is quite natural for any human being to acquire property if he can do so, and especially if he knows that he can get it for nothing through the operation of the Land Act.  It will compel the Minister for Lands, through agitation, to buy that farm at the auction.  He will have no option, none in the world.  That is one of the numerous dangers I foresee in this section.  Then, when the Minister has acquired the farm they will further agitate as to who should get it.  That will create other problems that will not solve congestion in the West.  I suggest that the Minister has very elaborate powers already for acquiring every acre of land in this country that he may need.  Remember <Col N="1096" /> that he is not amending, in this Bill, any of the powers of acquisition which he has; neither is he giving himself lesser powers.  He must have felt that he had sufficient powers, elaborate enough, to acquire land.  Otherwise he would have been advised that the machinery that was at the disposal of the Land Commission was too cumbersome and too slow, and that it did not enable the Minister nor the Land Commission to acquire the land needed for the easing of congestion fast enough.  But Section 23 of this Bill will certainly not solve the problem.</P>
    <P>Under Section 23, the Land Commission will acquire a holding without payment of stamp duty.  Take, for instance, the case of an ordinary farmer's son who desires to purchase a holding.  He has a few pounds which he gathered together over a long period of time, because he got no wages.  The father has a few pounds and the son is of a certain age and wants a holding.  The father decides to buy a farm if he can.  If that farmer buys a farm he will have to pay 5 per cent. stamp duty on the full purchase price of the holding. The Land Commission, when they buy, will pay no stamp duty.  I do not know whether they even pay fees to ordinary agents.  I do not know whether they pay solicitors.  However, under sub-section (4) of this section no stamp duty is payable.  The State agent has a 5 per cent. advantage straight away.  That is another disadvantage which the ordinary citizen suffers when buying in competition with the State.  No citizen can buy against the State if the State is so minded to purchase a particular holding.</P>
    <P>Other provisions arise out of that. Rights of way are dealt with but they are not dealt with in a manner that the ordinary citizen of the country might like.  There is special provision here to deal with the question of paths to wells and different matters of rights of way across holdings.</P>
    <P>I should like to have information from the Minister in regard to charges and equities in the case of, say, a holding acquired in this way.  Will the rights of people be safeguarded or not?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Another matter may arise under Section 23.  The Land Commission purchase a holding at a sale, by <Col N="1098" /> private or public treaty, it does not matter which.  They divide it among migrants and on the acquisition of that holding the existing annuities&mdash;assuming that they were subject to annuities as most of these small holdings are&mdash; are wiped out there and then at the State expense.  A new annuity is fixed which is half.  That holding becomes vested in a year or two in the tenant to whom it is given and the new tenant has all the rights of fixity of tenure and free sale.  He puts up that holding for public sale and the Land Commission may be forced by local agitation or otherwise again to acquire it.  Again the annuity is wiped out and a new one, half that, is fixed.  That could go on as a round robin and they could acquire the same holding 20 times in a century.  I put it to the Minister that that is another problem that may arise under Section 23 as there is no provision in the Bill to prevent the free sale of the piece of land that may be given to a migrant or to prevent the Land Commission from acquiring it a second or even a third time.  However, these are all matters of which I am sure the Minister is fully aware.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In introducing this Bill the Minister felt that the machinery at his disposal was not sufficiently loose and free to enable him to operate as fast as would be desirable.  I have no doubt that he believes that this machinery should be given to him.  There are many provisions in the Bill which we all agree the Land Commission should have to make for better working but there are some with which we may not altogether agree and which we may think dangerous.  These have been pointed out time after time to the Minister and the matter will come up again on the Committee Stage.  I believe that this is a Bill which should be amended drastically by this House and that the powers which the Minister proposes to take for himself should not be given to him.  The Minister or his agent may, under this Bill, attend a public sale and buy a farm on behalf of the Land Commission. That is most undesirable and if it were passed, he would have to answer 20 or 40 questions here.  He would be all day answering questions about to whom he gave land and what <Col N="1099" /> hope Johnnie So-and-So has.  It would create a difficult problem for the Minister and the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Lands lectured the previous Government for many years on the problems of land acquisition and division, but he has found now, since he has the responsibility, that the difficulties are much greater than he ever contemplated when he sat on this side of the House.  He has found that there is no royal road to provide land for all the congests of this country.  It just is not there.  A certain pool of land is available, but it is limited in extent.  By disturbing persons who have land which they are using to the best advantage of the community he may damage the structure of the State.  I am sure that the Minister appreciates that for the first time.  The problem of congestion, which it is agreed on all sides exists very considerably in certain areas, notably in the West and North and in the South to a smaller extent, will not be entirely relieved by giving new land in the East or Midlands to the congests. I am sure that the Minister, who is charged with the full and big responsibility of relieving congestion, appreciates that the organisation of industries in the congested areas would be a great help, side by side with the utilisation of the small pool of land which is available for congests.  At the same time as land division is going on and migrants are being put into rearranged holdings, the Minister should build up small cottage industries to give these people a better livelihood in their own districts.  The Gaeltacht industries are a part of the Minister's function and come under his jurisdiction.</P>

      <Col N="1100" /> There is another matter about which, however, there is nothing in the Bill. I would ask the Minister to bring in some provision to cover it.  It relates to this question of persons living on holdings of land whose dwelling houses are in bad condition and who, for some reason or another, have not proper title to their land and cannot get a loan from any loan department, either under the Small Dwellings Act or the Agricultural Credit Corporation, for the purpose of erecting a dwelling house they need to live in on that particular holding.  I suggest that the Minister should make some provision in this particular Land Bill to enable the Land Commission to make advances and charge those advances on that holding in the same way as the previous advances were charged.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>It might cost him more to establish title than what the land is worth.  It is something that needs more than a mere dismissal of it by saying that it cannot be done.  Quite recently, the Minister for Agriculture introduced and had passed through <Col N="1101" /> the House a Bill enabling his Department, with the aid of the Land Commission, to charge particular lands for the purpose of rehabilitation, draining and improvement, with a new annuity.  I am asking the Minister to make provision in this Bill to enable him to charge a new annuity and to make an advance, in cash or otherwise, to enable a particular person to erect a dwelling house for himself.  The Minister will agree that the tendency&mdash;which I have observed for many years&mdash;is for the existing holdings to get larger and for the number of holdings to become less and less.  I have suggested here before that, in spite of everything the Land Commission may do in creating new holdings, side by side with that each year many more holdings with homes are going out of operation and going into the ownership of larger farmers.  If a farmer requires an extra 50 or 100 acres and that is offered near him for sale, he will buy it and let the dwelling house fall.  There are less and less holdings in the country than there were ten or 20 years ago.  No matter how many the Land Commission may create, more are going out of existence.  There are many people whose dwelling house will go into serious disrepair, who have no means of erecting a new dwelling house, who cannot borrow money from any source in this State.  I would suggest to the Minister that he should seriously consider taking power&mdash;if the Land Commission has not got it already &mdash;to make an advance, where it is considered desirable, to any person in occupation of a holding, for the purpose of erecting a dwelling house or carrying out very substantial repairs to a particular dwelling house.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>When this country was ruled by British Ministers from the House of Commons in London, and when they passed certain land legislation in response to agitation from the people, they set up machinery here to suit their own requirements and to give effect, as far as that machinery could at the time, to the express wishes of the people responsible for the passing of that land legislation.  In setting up the machinery here, they took very good care to select as their servants <Col N="1102" /> here in Ireland commissioners or officials who would administer the policy that was very close to their own hearts.  That machinery for many years after we got our own Government was biased, in my opinion, in favour of the landowner.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that the Land Act passed by the British, and even some of our own land legislation since I became a member of this House, was definitely biased in favour of the landowner and compelled the Minister of the day, and Deputies of this House anxious to force the hand of the Minister, to go through every iota of that machinery so that a hole would be found in it to circumvent the landlord who was anxious to prevent the acquisition and division of that land to relieve congestion.</P>
      <P>I do not blame the civil servants or the commissioners who were put in positions by the British when they passed our first Land Acts.  Civil servants&mdash;whether senior, or getting the glorified title, which carries a good salary, of commissioners&mdash;are very jealous about surrendering their power.  Land commissioners under the British, and under our own Government even up to to-day, were generally selected from the ranks of the senior Civil Service or from members of the legal profession, brought in because the Government liked them personally or thought they had the necessary qualifications to administer the laws, passed here and previously, in connection with the relief of congestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I deny the right&mdash;and I will make this challenge in the future, as I have done in the past&mdash;of any civil servant, under any title he may get from this or previous Governments, to lay down public policy.  It is the duty of the Minister in charge of the Department of State to lay down public policy and it is equally the duty of the civil servant selected by the Minister, to administer the policy laid down by his Minister and the people responsible for the selection of that Minister in this House of Parliament.  We all know that the late Minister, Mr. Paddy Hogan&mdash;peace be to him&mdash;believed <Col N="1103" /> when bringing in the first Land Act that it would speed up the question of acquisition and division and solve, in his own time, I am sure, the problem of congestion.  Yet I am here to-day inquiring from the Minister to what extent the British in their day, and ourselves in our own time up to the present, have solved that problem.</P>
    <P>If you believe the agricultural expert of the Fianna Fáil Party, Deputy Corry, there is no more land left in this country for acquisition except the land that can be taken from small farmers.  That is not my opinion.  In my own constituency&mdash;and I have enough to do to mind my own constituency, without bothering about his, although he bothers about mine very often&mdash;that is not so.  I would ask the Minister, when replying to this discussion, if he can put his hand on the figures without any great trouble, to tell us what portion of the untenanted land of Ireland was divided during the period of British control, or up to the time of the passing of the 1923 Act; what portion of land has been divided since the 1923 Act and up to date; what portion of the untenanted land of Ireland still remains to be divided; and in what period he hopes to have that land divided and the problem finally solved.  These would be interesting figures, if he can put his finger on them.  We would be able to make up our own minds then as to the real cause of the long period of delay in solving a problem which should have been solved within the lifetime of a normal man.</P>
    <P>To the extent&mdash;and I congratulate the Minister on this&mdash;to which the Minister in this measure proposes to take power out of the hands of administrative officers&mdash;civil servants or lay commissioners, or whatever you like&mdash; and put that power into his own hands, I will shake hands with him.  This Bill in that respect is nearer to reality than any Bill that has been introduced in my time here.  I am not trying to pull his leg because the Minister has a big leg&mdash;he is a big man with a big mind&mdash;when I say that this Land Bill has all the appearance of a Bill that has been drafted by a man who is close <Col N="1104" /> to the minds of the people, much closer than the draftsmen who were responsible for drafting previous Land Acts. The only thing that requires to be done if the intentions of the Minister are to be put into effect is to ensure that the reorganisation of the Land Commission which is provided for by the Bill is as democratic as possible and that the Minister will have power to decide that the lay commissioners must do certain things.</P>
    <P>Will any Deputy say that a senior civil servant or a commissioner should be the person to decide whether 1,000 acres of land shall be set aside for breeding and training horses instead of being divided amongst congests? That is interpreting the public interest and the only person properly entitled to interpret public interest or to lay down policy is the Minister selected by this House in the knowledge that those who select him are the representatives of the people.  We should know more than a senior civil servant or a commissioner what the public interest means or how public policy should be laid down.  I do congratulate the Minister on that.  I do not blame the civil servant of to-day or the commissioners of to-day or the commissioners of yesterday for what has not been done by the Land Commission.  I blame the Minister of to-day and his predecessors.  The civil servants are very jealous of their authority and very careful about the way in which they discharge their responsibilities.  The only complaint I have against them is that they do it in red tape fashion and pay attention to the tradition of the Land Commission even as laid down by the British in their day.</P>
    <P>I can quote cases and give the names of estates in connection with which preliminary steps for acquisition were taken immediately after the 1923 Act was passed.  Several Acts have been passed since 1923 and these steps were renewed under different Acts and under different Ministers and even under different lay commissioners and officials.  Yet, the position in some cases in my constituency is the same to-day as it was 25 years ago.  Does that not prove that the land commissioners and those who work under them bear in mind what their predecessors <Col N="1105" /> did?  Although policy was supposed to have been changed, the administration is the same.  The untenanted land is still undivided.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wants one glaring case of that kind, let him look up the Alley estate, Knockaroo, County Laoighis.  I was informed after every Land Act was passed that steps would be taken to have that large acreage of untenanted land divided amongst the local people.  In that case there was an agitation in the days of the late Michael Davitt, and my own father told me last week-end that he remembers attending a meeting in the area with the late Michael Davitt in connection with the land war that was going on at that time in that particular area.  That land is still undivided. I hope that will not be the position after this Bill comes into operation and when the Land Commission has been reorganised for the purpose of carrying out the express wishes of the people in a democratic way.</P>
    <P>Deputy Aiken, when he was Minister for Lands, told me that a certain section of the 1936 Act&mdash;an amending Act&mdash;was brought in for the express purpose of making certain that that estate would be acquired and divided. Deputy Aiken was not the boss, although he was Minister at the time. There were other people.  That is why I hope Deputies on every side of the House will regard this measure in a non-Party fashion and give the Minister, who should decide matters of public policy, all the power he requires to carry out his own wishes.</P>
    <P>I know of individual applications of a minor character, involving small expenditure of public money, that have been made year after year as one Minister succeeded another.  Some of these cases are in the same state of suspended animation to-day as they were many years ago.  I brought a case to the notice of the Minister quite recently of a decent man in my constituency who got an uneconomic holding but who could not get a house on the holding which would have enabled him to get married and to go in and work the place.  He has to work it from his sister's place, which <Col N="1106" /> is four miles away, and he has had to drive cows to and from that place every day for the last 15 or 16 years. Although there has been a change in the officials since the time this man got that holding, the present officials are not prepared to change the decision made by their predecessors.  The policy is to stick to the old tradition and not to let down your predecessor. We have to get away from that, regardless of individuals.  I hope that in this Bill the Minister has power to direct the lay commissioners to do certain things that are in the public interest and the interest of smallholders; and, if he has not, I hope he will take it on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I do agree, of course, that we must have a judicial commission.  I would not dream of suggesting that anybody except a well-trained person, a High Court judge or Supreme Court judge, would be a proper person to decide questions of law, particularly questions of dispute over price.</P>
    <P>I do not want to put the Minister to too much trouble because I am a wholehearted supporter of this Bill.  I shall not assist Deputy Allen to butcher it and to butcher the most important parts of it.  But, I would like to hear from the Minister whether many cases have come under his notice since he came into office where the landowner has been agreeable to sell to the Land Commission and did not take the attitude adopted by the majority of landowners of putting the Land Commission to every trouble and expense he could think of.  How long, on the average, should it take the Land Commission to acquire and divide an estate where the landowner has expressed his willingness to sell?  On the other hand, how long, on the average, should it take the Land Commission to acquire and divide an estate where the landowner objects and makes use of every section of the Land Acts to pursue his objection?</P>
    <P>I know of a case where a landowner in my constituency&mdash;the Minister for Defence and my colleague, Deputy Flanagan, can confirm this&mdash;agreed about three years ago to sell his land to the Land Commission.  Last week, <Col N="1107" /> Deputy Flanagan put down a question asking if and when that estate was going to be divided, with the knowledge that the landowner had agreed so long ago to sell to the Land Commission. Here are we, the Deputies for the constituency, being badgered by our constituents, and properly so, in regard to the delay on the part of the Land Commission in connection with that estate and the Minister in that case was unable to say when that estate would be divided.  I think there has been something radically wrong with the machinery of the Land Commission in that case, and that is why I ask the Minister to tell me what is the average period it should take the Land Commission, if it is a properly organised Department, to deal with cases where the landlord is willing to sell and where the landlord is unwilling to sell.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission, apart from the heads, requires to be reorganised from top to bottom, or from bottom to top, whichever way you wish to take it.  It is the only Department of State I know of from which you get this buff-coloured acknowledgement of your communication&mdash;and you are a lucky man if you get a reply in six months.  I understood that, when the Minister for Finance took over control of that responsible Department, when this Government was established, he issued an instruction or advice to the heads of all Government Departments that members of the public and Deputies, anybody who thought fit to write in to or to telephone a Government Department should be treated courteously and should get an answer one way or the other within a reasonable time.  We get acknowledgements from the Land Commission, but it takes a hell of a long time to get a reply, and in some cases we never get a reply.  One is told that one's application is being dealt with in a sympathetic way.</P>

      <P>I further suggest that, if the answer is in the negative, a good and valid reason should be given for the commissioners' refusal to accede to a reasonable request.  I understand that the Minister for Finance issued that instruction when this Government took office, and I urge the Minister, before sanctioning the scheme of reorganisation, to make certain that it will be done in future.  There are enough officials in the Land Commission to deal with the business of that very important State Department in the same way as I see it being dealt with in other State Departments.  If the commissioners or chief officers have not got sufficient staff to enable them to do the work in a proper businesslike way, the businesslike way in which work is done in any well-run commercial concern, I urge the Minister to provide the necessary staff so that the work under this new scheme of reorganisation will be done better in future than it has been done up to the present.</P>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Corry's statements, the Minister can deal more effectively with Deputy Corry and Deputy Allen than I can.  It is not my job, but I thought it a very serious statement for Deputy Corry to make when he said that the only land remaining to be acquired is that owned by the ordinary farmer.  If that is so, we are wasting our time here.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Landlord&rdquo; is a word which is more understandable by those of us who are anxious to have the untenanted land which we see all around our constituencies acquired and divided in a reasonable time.</P>
      <P>I note that it is the intention of the Minister to secure power to pay gratuities to disemployed labourers.  I personally regret that the necessity for such a provision should arise and I have grave doubts whether it should arise in the same way in the future as it has arisen apparently in the past, because there was another way of settling the question.  During Deputy Moylan's term of office as Minister a Bill was brought into this House and passed to give power to the Minister &mdash;I voted for it and I regret to say that I knew that there were good reasons why I should do so&mdash;to dispossess people to whom land had been given and who never took possession of that land or made any attempt to work it.  In particular areas in my constituency there were decent young men, the sons of small farmers and labourers, who were quite willing to work the land if the commissioners had used more wisdom in the selection of the allottees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I spoke to the Minister quite recently, with others, about one estate divided 15 years ago, on which three allottees had houses built at the expense of the taxpayers and economic holdings provided for them, and who up to this day have not walked into the houses built for them or made any attempt to work these holdings.  We passed a measure empowering the Minister to dispossess about 1,500 such persons.  If 1,500 persons of that type get houses built and holdings given to them at the expense of the taxpayers, it is a very serious reflection on the <Col N="1110" /> judgment of the Land Commission inspectors responsible for recommend ing these people.  It is in the public interest that they should be dispossessed and the holdings given to good Irishmen who will try to make a living out of them.</P>
    <P>I want to put it to the Minister that the real cause of the failure of men who were herds or ploughmen employed by landowners in the old days to work land was the fact that they were not provided with sufficient working capital when given these holdings.  If in cases I know of good ploughmen, herds and agricultural labourers had been given sufficient capital to make a start at the proper time, there would be no necessity for the inclusion of this provision in the Bill authorising the Minister to pay gratuities to disemployed labourers.  I wonder is it too late for the Minister and his colleagues to do what has been so well done in other countries where activity of the same kind has been carried on, that is, to provide the labourers who lost their employment on the land acquired and divided with a minimum amount to enable them to purchase machinery and buy stock and make a decent start rather than to pay them compensation and to tell them to look for a job elsewhere, to look for their cards at the employment exchange and for a passport from the Department of External Affairs to enable them to go to work possibly for a farmer in Great Britain. I should prefer to see these people who have been working on the land given some chance of working land for themselves and providing a decent livelihood for themselves and their dependents. If that had been done after the first Land Act was passed by this House there would not be the same kind of story to tell about the failure of that class of people in the matter of the working of land as is to be told to-day.</P>
    <P>I am not going to take up the time of the House any longer because I am fully satisfied with the contents of this Bill and with the assurance given by the Minister that further legislation will follow.  I am very keen that the Minister should avail of his great knowledge of the people of the country <Col N="1111" /> and of his limited experience in the Land Commission to see that when this Bill becomes law, the Land Commission will not be worked under the type of machinery that was considered suitable for the working of that Department when the British Parliament passed the first Land Bill in the House of Commons.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that the Minister, in making his opening statement, told us very much more than was already in the White Paper.  For instance, when he was dealing with the question of market value, I think he might have given us an idea of how market value is to be arrived at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>In the same way as market value is arrived at at the present time and for a number of years past for unvested land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that was done under the old definition, namely, a fair price from the point of view of the Land Commission and the point of view of the purchaser.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  That is what has caused the trouble in regard to vested land and that is what is being repealed now in this Bill.  Market value was paid for unvested land since the 1923 Act but it was not paid for vested land and that is what gave rise to all the trouble.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>In administration, I assume that the inspectors had always in mind the principle that in fixing a price for the purchaser, the price must be such that the farmer would not be plunged into debt and such as would enable him to bring up his family in frugal comfort and with reasonable profits.  Under the former Administration that was one of the main objects and every inspector or valuer had to take that very carefully into consideration. If they are to arrive at the market value now, it must be according to the fluctuations which take place from time to time.  Looking back over the history of the value of land, we know that these fluctuations swung from very high to very low.  The Minister can recall a period, during and <Col N="1112" /> after the first war, when the price of land was very much inflated.  That was the market value then.  Afterwards there came a period when farmers were coming to all of us who represented rural areas, telling us that they had suffered very severely.  Some of them were &ldquo;broke&rdquo; because they had bought at a time when prices were very high.  Later the price of cattle and other produce fell to such an extent that they were not able to make ends meet.  I suggest that the standard &ldquo;market value&rdquo; by itself is swinging too much in one direction and that it would be fair that &ldquo;market value&rdquo; should be checked by some other considerations such as the old definition which protected both the State and the individual purchaser as well.</P>
      <P>Further, I would suggest that if there is a gap between what you might call the economic price to the purchaser of the farm and the amount that would be fair in cases of hardship to the vendor, the difference should be made up not by the imposition of a high rent or price which would be too difficult for the farmer to meet, but that the State should intervene and give compensation. There is reference to compensation for disturbance, and I think the Minister might have told us that he was taking that type of case into consideration.  He did mention that there was a small number of cases where there was real hardship to the vendor, but hard cases make bad law. I do not think the overriding definition should be determined by such hard cases, but that the State should allow for such elasticity as would enable it to deal with hard cases as they arise. A danger also arises once the State goes into the open market, as the State will have to now.  I gathered that it was implied by the Minister that the operations of the Land Commission will be largely concentrated on getting rid of rundale holdings and placing migrants on other holdings.  If that is done on a wholesale scale, it means that the Land Commission will have to go into the open market to a very considerable extent and that in itself will enhance the value of land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then again on the question of market value, rich people come along here from other countries and buy farms.  I <Col N="1113" /> know one county where about 34 such farms were bought.  They do not regard these purchases from the economic point of view.  They regard these lands rather as residential farms and they give fancy prices for them.  That can influence the whole standard of prices and the market value.  We ourselves, in regard to house property, had to put on a high tax in order to stop inflation of the price of property of that type and it had the desired effect.  Do I gather from the Minister that he would not like farms to be sold from the Land Commission to foreigners, that he would confine it to nationals?  In answer to Deputy Lehane, I gather that he said something of that sort, that the Land Commission would not allow farms to be sold to outsiders?</P>

      <P>That is a matter that will have to be taken into account.  To quote a speech of Lord Rugby on one occasion, he said that these fellow-countrymen of his were coming over to this country and buying property here and that some people regarded it as the retreat from Moscow.  If you do get a number of rich people buying land in that way, it is going to inflate the price.  I, therefore, suggest that there should be some controlling phrase governing the definition of &ldquo;market value&rdquo; which will protect the purchasing farmer.</P>

      <P>If farmers are buying land that is going to affect prices and the value of land will go up as a result of the general lay opinion in the matter.  Then, again, I think it is a weakness in the Bill that you should be reducing the number of commissioners on the Appeal Board.  However clever the Judicial Commissioner may be&mdash;like the professor of classics on a famous occasion who, when he made a mistake when writing on a blackboard, said he was <i>ex-officio</i> ignorant in mathematics&mdash;if a man has concentrated on being an expert in law, he is not necessarily a good valuer of land.  It is much more likely that your lay commissioners will be experts from the point of view of fixing the value of land.  For that reason, I think it is throwing a tremendous responsibility on the Judicial Commissioner to ask him to decide questions as to the value of land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>

      <P>Unless you are able to elaborate this definition so that it will be very much clearer to people what market value means, I think you will find that the number of cases that will come before the Judicial Commissioner in future will be much greater than in the past.  I think the Minister might have been a little more frank with the House in pointing out the extra power which he himself is taking with regard to rearrangement schemes.  He is taking very large powers with regard to rearrangement schemes.  In that case he can himself appoint a senior inspector to fix the price and to decide who are to be the allottees.  In that <Col N="1115" /> case, also, he need only get the consent of one commissioner and not two, as in excepted cases, so that he is taking very great power for himself.  He may claim that he is going to expedite the work, but I think that in these two matters he is taking very dangerous power unto himself.  He will be responsible not merely for the price fixed, but also for the allottees who are to receive the land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>Except in the case of rearrangement schemes, which are not excepted matters.  They bear on rundale and, obviously, on migrants.  The only other point I should like to make is to emphasise a point made by Deputy Moylan.  I do think that, even if you have commissioners who are only used for the purpose of appeals, some of them who have experience could be employed very well in helping to consolidate the Acts which have gone before, because consolidation is really needed.  I am perfectly sure that the officials of the Land Commission would be delighted to see that that work had been done.  It would simplify the work of everybody very considerably and save headaches all round if the Minister would direct that a consolidation Bill should be given very special attention and introduced in due time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I subscribe thoroughly to the last suggestion made by Deputy Little.  I think a consolidation Act is long overdue.  Like many other Deputies.  I welcome the Bill with this reservation&mdash;I should like the Minister to realise that to me at any rate it is a positive reservation&mdash;that I look upon this Bill as a step in the right direction. <Col N="1116" /> I am not going to weary the House by airing many of the views I have already aired on other occasions as to the administration of the land law.  Part of it is a bad legacy and, in the main, efforts at amendment of the land law have only added confusion to something already confused.  I feel that the Minister in this Bill may be possibly making more difficult the ultimate codification in a reasonable way of our land law.  I must confess, as a practitioner of a number of years' standing, that I find each new amendment or each new regulation under the Land Acts only more confusing.  Beyond two specific powers given in this Bill, I do not feel that there is any radical change being made, except possibly a question of interpretation which is dealt with.</P>
      <P>I am not going to be tempted, as at one stage I was, to follow the rather tragic, pathetic, calamitous, stupid argument of Deputy Allen to its logical conclusion.  Whether he was deliberately mischievous or just plain dumb, he started off by telling the Minister that he is taking certain powers under Section 10 and quoted paragraphs (b), (c) and (d).  The actual opening words of Section 10 designate these clearly as excepted matters with which the Minister cannot deal. Yet Deputy Allen has the audacity, the crass impudence, to suggest that the Minister is acquiring this power under the Bill when the actual opening words of the section designate these specifically as matters excepted from the purview of the Minister. That is sufficient for Deputy Allen's rambling, wandering statement which was purely obstructive rather than constructive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He asked me specifically if I could give him some definition of &ldquo;untenanted land.&rdquo;  If he reads Section 73 (2) of the 1923 Land Act he will get, basically, a definition of &ldquo;untenanted land&rdquo; and it still stands with the exception of tenancies which may have been in being at the passing of the 1923 Act which a decision of the Supreme Court held to be such. Untenanted land, as it implies, is land in regard to which there is no contract of tenancy and of which the owner in occupation is owner in fee <Col N="1117" /> simple, or under a fee farm grant, or any lease for lives or for a term of years of which 60 years is unexpired.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen has practical experience as an auctioneer in his own constituency and, therefore, the definition of untenanted land should not present to him any of the difficulties which he has been airing in the House.  I do want to say at the outset that we are all a little bit dishonest and inclined to be political on a land matter.  The land problem is of vital importance to the economic structure of our country, and so it should be moved, if possible, from a Party political level.  From my limited experience, I want to point out to the Minister some of the difficulties that can and must inevitably arise under the land system as it is, and will be when this Bill is passed.  The only real difference which the passing of this Bill is going to make is contained in Sections 5 and 23.  Section 5 will compel the Land Commission to pay the market value for land.  I can, to some extent, appreciate certain of the difficulties which are presenting themselves in a genuine way to the mind of Deputy Little as to how market value is to be determined.  I think that, when the section comes to be operated, that difficulty will simplify itself.</P>
    <P>We have to draw a distinction between market price and market value. I want seriously to sound this note of warning for the Minister, that he will have to consider what has been urged upon him from all sides of the House, namely, the detrimental effect, from an inflationary point of view, which the arbitrary buying of holdings by wealthy foreigners could have.  That may not have reached very alarming proportions so far, but it is something which the Minister will have to watch because of its possible reaction in inflating prices.</P>
    <P>I think that Deputy Little was honest in the submission that he made on that point.  If anything of that kind were to occur it might result in very grave hardship to the person who, ultimately, was put in possession of a farm that had been purchased by the Land Commission.  I wonder if it would not be more reasonable to assume that, under the operation of <Col N="1118" /> this section, there may be infinitely more goodwill found than heretofore as between the Land Commission and the person selling the land.  I say that because the person whose land is going to be acquired will not be subjected to an arbitrary price different from that for unvested land.  That person will be met on the basis that, no matter what the technicalities behind the scenes are, the value of land itself, whether it is vested or unvested, is going to be the same.</P>
    <P>Fundamentally, there was at one time, possibly, a reason for a difference in price as between vested and unvested land.  That was a difference that could be legitimately argued and was properly argued.  It was that, in the main, the people in this State were reentering their own, that tenants were being replaced on land which was formerly theirs but which had been acquired, through confiscation or plantation, by the foreigner.  I think that in the main that stage has passed.  If it has not passed, I would urge on the Minister that, on the Committee Stage, he should make a reservation to himself that he could still pay not anything like the real value for a holding that could be acquired by the Land Commission, where it is still in the possession of the seed or generation of planters, to meet the claims of evicted tenants in the locality.  I think that the acquisition of the type of land that Section 23 contemplates for the benefit of migrants will be from decent Irish men who are properly in possession of it but may want to sell it.  It may be necessary, in the national interest, for the Land Commission to acquire some of that land in order to give decent people a chance of living on the soil of Ireland.</P>
    <P>This Bill is revolutionary in the steps it takes under Section 5.  I think that, possibly, our doubts and our fears in regard to the section may be allayed when the Bill has been in operation for some time.  I think the Minister will have to be very careful to see that some basis is found on which to determine the real value of land. That should not be left completely to be settled in a situation in which you had either inflation or deflation.  A situation of that kind should not influence <Col N="1119" /> the Land Commission in the price they would pay.  I wish the section good luck.  I think that Deputy Little was honest in his submissions in trying to point out the dangers which he could conceive in regard to this section.  I, too, can see dangers in it, but possibly youth makes me optimistic. I am of opinion that, if the section is given a chance, the difficulties that genuinely seem to arise at this stage will resolve themselves in practice.</P>
    <P>The section of the Bill which merits the serious consideration of the House is Section 23.  Deputy Allen excelled himself on it.  He was lachrymose as to what was going to happen under it. He did not know whether he was going to stand on his left foot or his right foot when speaking on it; he did not know whether the poor person whose land was being sold was going to be mulcted because the Land Commission was going to bid for it.  People, he said, would not dream of bidding against the State, and he did not know whether the Minister, on behalf of the State, would not be mulcted by people running up the price on him so that he would have to pay an exorbitant price for the land.  I think that Deputy Allen, possibly, and to some extent Deputy Little have missed the real essential.  Deputy Little's submission was, possibly, due to an oversight, but Deputy Allen's was mischievous.  The section puts no compulsion on the Land Commission to bid.  If it finds that the price is too high it can withdraw from the contest.</P>
    <P>Some people seem to think that the only agency through which the Land Commission can act under this section is going to be composed of either rogues or fools.  I am content to believe that they will be neither.  I am satisfied that the agent buying on behalf of the Land Commission, or the person designated to do so by the Minister, will be a rational being, and that normally he will be authorised by the Land Commission to give for the land what is considered to be a reasonable price.  If he is outbid at the auction he can withdraw and let the land go to the highest bidder.  I cannot see, under this section, <Col N="1120" /> any reason for alarm.  I think it is a very good idea, and a bold experiment if it comes off, for the Land Commission to buy land in the open market, It will make for infinitely more content among the people whose land is taken in that way, because they will then feel no grievance as to price.</P>
    <P>I do not believe there is any danger of Deputy Allen's left-legged idea of land being deflated to little or no value. His fears that the Land Commission will frighten other bidders are airy, fairy fears.  This is a section that has to be put into effect cautiously, I will admit, but in my optimism I am prepared to think it is a section that will work extremely well.  It will relieve the heartache and burnings that we Deputies have to face over people who are quite anxious to get rid of big holdings but are afraid the Land Commission will not give them value.</P>
    <P>Taking Deputy Little to be a reasonable person making reasonable submissions, I question him as to why he is apprehensive that the Judicial Commissioner might have an increasing number of determinations of price to deal with. He made no solid case.  Surely, if the situation arises that a person will get a more equitable price for his land, as Section 5 will ensure, and if the Land Commission in the future, with regard to migrants, can go into the open market and buy their holdings, those two things must logically and rationally lead to a better degree of satisfaction as to price and, therefore, inevitably the appeals that will go to the Judicial Commissioner for determination must decline.  The appeal in the main will be because the price is too low.  What appeal will any person have if the Land Commission buy in the open market? It will wipe out that type of appeal and I think the Judicial Commissioner can look forward to many happy years of lean work.</P>
    <P>I do not like being facetious, but I have often felt that the best description one may give of the &ldquo;lay commissioners&rdquo; in the Land Commission is the &ldquo;delay commissioners&rdquo;.  I am glad the Minister is improving this cumbersome procedure and we will not have that anomaly any more where you have lay commissioners excluded from acting as lay commissioners because as <Col N="1121" /> lay commissioners they are members of an appeal tribunal.  It is an amazing situation.  It must have been a tortuous brain that conceived it.  Fortunately, we have a fairly active brain operating to remove it.</P>
    <P>People seem to be anxious to see difficulties and dangers in this Bill.  I have one great hope for it and that is, that the clarity of some of its sections will remove some of the difficulties and dangers and some of the extraordinary juxtapositions that exist.  It will ensure that there will be no more general outcry, no more wails of widows or anybody else that the Land Commission have practically robbed them of their heritage, because this Bill will enshrine one principle, that there will be no more virtual confiscation price for land when it is resumed or ac-acquired, as there was in the old days, in so far as this Bill tends to establish the principle that a man selling his land, whether to the Land Commission or to anybody else, can go into the open market and get the best price. As long as it ensures that principle, you are making a realistic advance in settling land problems.</P>
    <P>In my own constituency I know people anxious to vacate fairly substantial farms, people who, when this Bill becomes law, will without hesitation offer them to the Land Commission. These people may, through economic circumstances, old age, lack of a young family coming up, or possibly lack of younger people in farming as a livelihood, find themselves in the position where it would be infinitely better if they could get rid of the land.  They will be happier and they will have a real appreciation of the Minister because he is now assuring them that they need not be afraid there will be any arbitrary price imposed on them or that the Land Commission will pay only what they feel like paying for the holding.</P>
    <P>I do not think this Bill goes half far enough.  It is only still scratching at the problem.  There is a wealth of confusion in our land code.  There is every necessity, not only for codifying land legislation, such as Deputy Little pleads for, but also for reasoned minds to address themselves to the problem of clarifying as well as codifying the <Col N="1122" /> law.  I suggest that the Minister, before he takes his next step in relation to the land code, should deal with everything in a careful way and not content himself with one small sphere, such as he does in this Bill.  I trust he will deal with the whole matter on the basis of simplifying the method of making good your title and, above all, he should bring about a more speedy method of vesting.  I regret that this Bill does not deal with that problem. I think perhaps some of the worst delays in vesting may be offset when Section 5 becomes operative because then the people controlling credit will know that unvested land and vested land rank <i>pari passu</i> so far as price is concerned.</P>
    <P>I wholeheartedly support this Bill because it is a step in the right direction. I think the Minister is working along the right lines.  I think he should ensure that economic holdings, upon which the State has spent money, will never under any circumstances, if offered for sale, be allowed to pass into the hands of an alien who might thereby benefit but that those who suffered under the old order of &ldquo;to hell or to Connaught&rdquo;, will be given an opportunity of coming back into the enjoyment of the land of Ireland.</P>

      <P>This problem of land and the various Land Acts governing it has been one of the most debated problems throughout the country. People will naturally look at this Act to see if there is in it any improvement on previous Acts.  From a cursory glance at the Bill it appears to me that the Minister is anxious to take more control himself.  That is my personal view.</P>

      <P>That may be a good thing and it may be a bad thing.  I dare say every man ought to be boss in his own house.  As a nation we are susceptible to likes and dislikes.  Governments can change overnight.  Taking the long view, I feel that the lay commissioners acted impartially in the acquisition and distribution of land. Admittedly the machine may have been <Col N="1123" /> slow.  No matter how fast the machine may go, the fact remains that we have not sufficient land for everybody.  No matter how willing and anxious the Minister is, he will not be able to please everybody.  Under this Act the Minister is doing away with the lay commissioners. I think the lay commissioners were very sound because they did not act from political motives.  They decided each case on its merits.</P>
      <P>I come now to deal with the market value of land.  I think that if a man decides to sell his land, because of economic circumstances or for any other reason, and the Land Commission decides to acquire that land he should be given the value of the land on the open market.  The only difficulty is as to how the Minister will determine the market value.  Land normally goes to the highest bidder. The possibility is that, if it is known generally that the Land Commission intends to buy, the seller may have other bidders there for the purpose of running up the price.  That is only human nature.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have studied it. I come now to deal with the question as to whether or not the Minister is taking too great powers under Sections 5 and 10 of this measure.  Every native Government has done its utmost <Col N="1124" /> to deal with the land problem.  The difficulty is to decide whether to rush matters or to let events shape their own course.  Possibly the Fianna Fáil Government made some mistakes in allotting land to people who did not deserve it or who did not make good tenants.  No matter how careful the inspectors may be, that can occur. Naturally if that does occur steps must be taken to remove such people. So far as I can see the Minister is abrogating more power to himself under this Act to settle any friends he likes on land than any of the powers taken by the Fianna Fáil Government under the 1933 Land Act.</P>
      <P>It was often stated to the Fianna Fáil Minister, in relation to the 1933 Act, by Deputies who were then on the Opposition side of the House that the Fianna Fáil clubs did this, that and the other but, under that Act, the Minister was actually a Minister and the Commissioners were there to carry out the Act as laid down to them. I see that under this Act the Minister can settle up a few friends and that he will have more power to do so or, if any other Deputy should go to him, that he will have more power than the Fianna Fáil Minister had or than he himself has had hitherto.</P>

      <P>It is long over-due. That system has been responsible for a good deal of trouble in families and between neighbours.  I hope that the Minister, under this Act will divide land and, further, I should like to see <Col N="1125" /> a section in this Bill to the effect that roads would be provided in such a way that the Land Commission could hand them over to the various county councils.  I should like to see a section in this Act dealing with that problem because the position all over the country, even under the last Land Act, is that the roads that were made through holdings or through estates, either for sub-division or for ordinary holdings or for farms, were not what they should have been.  I hold that any Department of State responsible for land division should see that they make a perfect road through the land and that, in conjunction with the Minister for Local Government, the Minister for Lands should have a provision in this Bill which would ensure that that road would be taken over by the various county councils.  That is a point that has been neglected, notwithstanding the fact that the roads were made. They were reasonably good roads too &mdash;at least, they looked all right for a while.  I became a member of this House in 1944 and, since then, I have made more representations about bad roads through holdings of land than, possibly, any other Deputy in that period.</P>

      <P>The Minister must agree with me that there is definitely a problem there.  If he states that there is not a problem there, all that I can say is that he has changed very much since he was sitting on this side of the House.  I heard him, when he was a member of the Opposition, making several representations in this House regarding the problems of bad roads, Land Commission roads and so forth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The land of this country should be divided, as a matter of national policy, amongst the very best applicants. Another matter which has often been discussed in this House is the question of the size of holdings.  I realise that in the Minister's county and in other western counties the problem of small uneconomic holdings is ever present and has been in existence for hundreds of years.  The same can be said in <Col N="1126" /> regard to other parts of Ireland also. My sizing up of the whole matter is this: is it not better to give a man an economic holding than to try and give him nine or ten acres of land and leave him hanging in mid-air, as it were, so that he is neither a farmer nor a labourer?</P>

      <P>The problem is not so bad in County Dublin because, with a few acres, a man could develop a market garden and, possibly, make some kind of a living for himself.  But down the country, and even in parts of my own constituency in County Dublin, the position is quite different, because these people will have to try to make out a living for themselves, to keep a horse or two horses, or maybe a tractor, and a few cows on, say, only 22 statute acres of land.  I do not think, taking the long view, that the State is any better for that condition of affairs.  I have come across a number of such cases in my constituency. These men are out looking for work on the roads and, if they have a family, they are up against it.  If you are giving a holding at all the very least should be one of approximately 35 acres.</P>

      <P>I am taking into consideration the number of uneconomic holdings I know in that part of the country where I was born and, again, that I have come to know since I came to Dublin.  I realise that the problem is there.  I do not want to suggest any more at the moment but I feel that if you give a man a nice holding of land he has a chance of making a living on it.  In that way you are keeping him off the labour market &mdash;and that is an important point.  If he is industrious and goes in, say, for dairying or for market gardening, or such like, he will employ a man.  On the other hand, if you give him 15 or 16 acres he will employ nobody and, <Col N="1127" /> in addition, he himself will try to get a job that some other labouring man should get.  If I were to make the same statement among the congests of Mayo they would say I was their enemy but, truly, that is the position as I see it in County Dublin.</P>
      <P>Another problem which has often been brought to my attention in County Dublin and especially in respect of areas where there are a lot of council cottages and where the people there find it rather difficult to get milk sometimes&mdash;take, for instance, the north-west part of County Dublin&mdash; is the problem of cow parks.  I should be glad if the Minister would consider feasible applicants and, if there should be any land adjoining council cottages, I think he should seriously consider giving these people a park for milch cows.  It has been the practice in certain parts of the country long before the Land Commission came into being.</P>

      <P>Before migrants come into a parish the land in it should be divided among the uneconomic holders of the parish.  I must speak for my own people in County Dublin where there are a large number of small uneconomic holdings, 750 holdings of under 10 acres and over 500 of under five acres.  We escaped the migrants over the years of Fianna Fáil and during the period of the previous Government.  I think there were only 11 in all those years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am hardly able to look after County Dublin without going there.  You had more land in Meath than we have in County Dublin. Only that these people are so industrious and carry on market gardening they would not have a living, although their proximity to the city has helped <Col N="1128" /> them.  I would ask the Minister to deal justly with such people and not to be influenced in a national question of this kind by political motives.  The Minister knows of the problem as he was born in an area where it existed.  Before migrants are put into an area I should like to see the uneconomic holders with four or five acres looked after.  People in County Dublin who have small uneconomic holdings look forward to the acquisition by the Land Commission of certain lands that have not been worked satisfactorily</P>
      <P>There is another point about which I see nothing in the Bill and for which the Minister and the Land Commission should be responsible, the problem of water on land.  I hold that in law the Land Commission is the landlord of all the land in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not talking about drainage.  I am talking about bringing water into land where no drainage is needed at all.  We have that problem in North County Dublin where farmers had to draw water three and four miles last year and it was not the first year they had to do it.  The Land Commission should sink a pump when giving land if there is no water on it.  The most essential thing for cattle is pure clear water.  I have already approached the Minister on this subject and asked him in a question here if he would consider introducing some scheme, as he is in charge of that Department for the time being, to encourage farmers to sink pumps. Many small farmers cannot afford to spend £300 or £400.  They can go to another Department and get a loan but few farmers like to put a millstone round their necks by getting a loan of £400 or £500.  In certain areas which I can point out to the Minister there is no water.</P>

      <P>I am not saying that the problem has not been there for some time, but when we are introducing new legislation we should do this in ordinary justice, because what is the use of dividing land unless you see there is water on it if the tenant has to draw water two, three or four miles when a dry season comes?  Shortage of water and bad water is responsible for cattle dying of disease.  The time has come to handle that problem which is getting more acute as time goes on.  The Minister and the Land Commission are in charge of the lands of this country.  They are collecting annuities and they should see that the land is in perfect order as far as water is concerned.</P>

      <P>I appeal to the Minister not to reduce the number of lay commissioners.  That is the only assurance we have that every case will be considered on its merits and that no political influence will be responsible for a Minister wavering from one particular man to another, or buying land from a particular man because he did not like him, and giving it to another, saying: &ldquo;Take this fellow's holding.&rdquo;  Under the old system, there was a greater chance of ordinary common law and justice existing all round.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. B. Maguire Mr. B. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>Coming from the country, I am naturally interested in any proposals regarding the acquisition or division of land.  It is a national problem that affects the lives of our people more intimately than any other subject.  Our people have a tradition in land and associations so deep and so general with it that there is hardly a <Col N="1131" /> person&mdash;no matter what occupation he may have in the course of his life&mdash;who has not close contact with land, either directly or through his father or grandfather. Proposals to deal with land arouse feelings that no other subject could arouse in the minds of our people in general.</P>
      <P>In my opinion, the present Bill is a much needed one.  It introduces the possibility of the Government acquiring land for sub-division or the creation of new holdings.  It gives them a power that had faded out and become obsolete over a number of years, due to the emergency period and the economic conditions prevailing since then. The Land Commission, having acquired all the estates which the landlords owned and sold them to the existing tenants, gradually moved on towards acquiring large properties of several hundred acres, which were apportioned out into new holdings &mdash;or sometimes used for the enlargement of uneconomic holdings&mdash;and after a time, when those estates of comparatively vast areas were exhausted, we came to the point where in order to acquire land, they had to use their powers of compulsory acquisition and pay a price as award to such owners. Our original plans were to acquire big estates from owners who had no popular claim to the ownership and, accordingly, prices were regulated for the award.  At the time prices were thus fixed, conditions were different in many ways from what they are to-day. We had reached the stage when the Land Commission, carrying out a useful national work of providing land for the landless and adding to the uneconomic holdings so as to make them economic, have been forced to pay a price to the owners that was out of touch with modern prices and with justice.  Therefore, a Bill of this nature became essential, as it empowers the Minister, through the Land Commission, to pay a reasonable price according to prevailing prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There arises one danger, which seems to be very serious, in this proposal. It is proposed to go into the competitive market in the purchase of land.  If, as a State entity, the Land Commission become competitors for <Col N="1132" /> the purchase of land, then if they desire to acquire a particular farm no private owner may venture to buy against them.  Under such conditions, I can see a person willing to sell his farm, offering it through the good agency of his friends as competitors, asking the Land Commission, with the State funds behind them, to pay a price far beyond the economic value. They would thus acquire a heavy liability and future rents, demanded necessarily from the tenants who are allotted a portion of that estate, will be proportionately high and uneconomic in the various changes and exigencies of farm economy.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, I notice that the Bill says that the Land Commission shall determine the market value.  Let us say they determine that it should be something below what, in the ordinary way, a farm would make in fair, open competition where there are fair, open buyers.  There is no such thing as a fair value for land.  Within a mile of the City of Dublin, an acre may make a few hundred pounds.  Even that applies to lands adjoining remote towns in the country, where it may be useful for grazing or building.  Within a quarter of a mile from that, there may be a fine farm of many acres, which would realise only £20 per acre, though equal quality land and agriculturally as good as that which fetched the £200 an acre because of its proximity and because of the competition. Therefore, there is no such thing as a fair price for land.  It varies according to location and competition. The man&mdash;whether it be the Minister or members of the Land Commission&mdash; who could determine a fair price for land is not to be found.  Prices so vary that, if the Land Commission are going into competition, there is the danger that those who are selling may find advocates who realise that the value of the farm is a very high price, more than normally would be received in the market, and the Land Commission may pay far too much.  Bordering tenants may see that land offered as part allotment to their holdings or as new holdings.</P>
    <P>Again, if the Land Commission determine the price, should any farm be offered, medium or large, the competition <Col N="1133" /> is destroyed, as there are always in a district people who will say: &ldquo;The Land Commission are buyers, and if they buy, I will get portion of it.&rdquo;  In their own way, these men can destroy the possibility of any outside competition and ensure that only the Land Commission shall be the buyer. In that respect, I see in this Bill a danger that that big charter of liberty which was secured during the days of land agitation&mdash;free sale&mdash;may be destroyed. It can happen.</P>
    <P>Unless the operation of this Bill is very carefuly watched and very carefully handled by the Minister and the Land Commission, the right of free sale may easily be destroyed.  In that way, the small farmer and the farmer with the medium-sized farm may find, if he wants to put it on the market, that he is restricted to the price that the Land Commission in their wisdom may determine is the fair price.  Do not destroy the right of free sale or you will destroy a very important asset to the farmers of this country.  As this Bill stands it has within it that danger. I would like to see greater security than is provided in this Bill that the right of the farmer to sell in a competitive market to the best buyer he may find will be retained.</P>
    <P>I have already said that I approve of the Bill in so far as it is necessary to bring up the price of land in view of the reduced value of money since ten or 15 years ago and thus make it possible, in a legitimate and a just way, for the Land Commission to acquire lands, where they may be acquired, at a fair price and thus improve the conditions of that needy section of the community, the men who have no land and men who have uneconomic holdings. There is a danger that in doing that we may go too far.  We are giving powers in this Bill which, I am sure, will be very discreetly exercised by the Land Commission or by the present Minister or his successors but it still destroys that right, which is a vital thing to the farming community, that, if they have land to sell, they can freely offer it and secure the benefit of free competition in a price that is not measured by some valuation of what is a fair price.  The competitive price is the price that every person wants to <Col N="1134" /> get when he goes on the market whether he is selling a hen, a pig, a cow or anything else.  Competition should rule the price.  If the price is fixed, there is no such thing as competition. What business man will venture to put money in a business if there is no speculation that it may improve in price and that he will get a better price for it when he wants to sell it than he paid for it?  What man will put a pound on a horse if he does not feel that he may get £2 in return? What man will speculate on the stock exchange without the incentive of potential return?  This Bill is destroying that incentive as far as land is concerned and the position must be clarified in the interest of every small, medium and large farmer who holds land.</P>
    <P>As regards the purpose of the Bill, the Minister is asking for powers to acquire land.  His own intimate knowledge must have convinced him long ago that those best fitted to use the land to the best advantage are those who have traditional knowledge of land, namely, the men in the congested areas.  These men have struggled against adverse conditions and have laboured in good periods and bad periods.  They have reared large families on what are regarded as uneconomic holdings.</P>
    <P>Since the time when Cromwell drove our people from the rich lands and scattered them around the coast, south and west, they have continued to eke out an existence in conditions that could hardly be credited.  They have acquired keen knowledge of the land and they have worked out an economy in using the land that can now be useful to the nation.  Under the most trying conditions they have persevered. They have endured adverse weather. They have worked land that is not productive at all without artificial means. That work entailed manual labour on the part of the man and his family. They reared large families.  They always observed what was natural and right and, guided and supported by Providence, survived.  These are the people to whom the Land Commission and the State should turn their attention.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1135" /> I have listened to appeals that land should be found for landless men.  By all means, if land is available.  But, the first consideration is to provide land for those whose holdings are uneconomic.  If it is intended under this Bill to purchase land at the expense of the State and to pay a fair price for it, I would strongly urge on the present Minister to use the nation's wealth to undo the slums which exist, which were the creation of Cromwell in the past and which are a national disgrace. I would ask him to undo the neglect of his predecessors and give these people a fair share of the soil which is theirs and which they are capable of working to the best advantage. It is an economic thing.  It is a national thing.  It is a just thing.  I recommend it to the Minister as a first claim in this proposal to acquire land. I recommend that he should give the land to those who are first entitled to it, who owned it in the centuries gone by but who were banished from their land by force.  They have succeeded in surviving and in rearing large families under conditions in which only supermen could have succeeded.</P>
    <P>In that connection the Minister should have a survey made of the congested areas.  There is some useful land there but there are also so-called farms in these areas that could not be regarded as agricultural farms.  There are vast areas which would be useful for afforestation.  Let a survey be made of these areas with a view to discovering what land is useful for agricultural purposes and development.  Let these areas be used for whatever number of families they can maintain and let the rest of the land be used for forestry.</P>
    <P>Such a survey should be made quickly and before we proceed in a big way to operate this Bill.  It is probably the last opportunity any Minister will have of dealing finally with the awful problem of the slums in congested areas.  If this opportunity is used merely for the purpose of gaining political advantage, of providing a farm allegedly for some landless men, then you will have used <Col N="1136" /> up all the available land and will still have left behind the dreadful blot of these slums around our coast.  We are asked from time to time to vote money for the clearance of slums and the provision of houses.  We strike our breasts and feel that we are noble creatures because we engage in that work of providing clean houses, but we have yet to have a Minister who will tackle this problem.  This Minister is probably the last Minister in whose hands a solution of the problem will rest.  He is dividing practically the remnant of the land of the country.  Are we to leave behind for all time this black mark on our national standard?</P>
    <P>Let me suggest again to the Minister that a survey be made of the congested areas around our coast and find out what area of suitable agricultural land is available.  Let us work out how many families that land will maintain in decent comfort and let the balance of the land be used for forestry, and let us then migrate, in so far as land is acquired elsewhere, the remnant of that struggling population who have survived in spite of every hardship and inconvenience. These are the people who will revivify agriculture, if you give them suitable farms.  You will never have to be ashamed of what you have done and they will repay you and the nation whatever money is spent on such development.  I appeal to the Minister with his knowledge of conditions in the west to do what is fair in this matter, in the light of his knowledge, a knowledge which is superior to that possessed by any of his predecessors.</P>
    <P>The size of farms is a debatable question and I do not know that it is possible to define an economic holding. It varies in different districts and according to the quality and ability of the person working it.  I hope the Minister will give full consideration to these points, because this is, as I say, the last opportunity we have to solve to any extent the problem of the uneconomic holder.  I hope that he will utilise to the utmost all the land available in order to reach a final solution of the problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MatthewOReilly" hpid="Mr. M. O'Reilly Mr. M. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to <Col N="1137" /> see such enthusiasm again for land division.  During the war, it was quite natural that no land could be divided, and I am glad that the Minister has now introduced a measure which will give a great number of people throughout the country hopes of getting a home on the land.  We heard here on many occasions that the misfortune in this country was that the people were inclined to leave the land.  I do not think that any Deputy has had that experience.  The people were quite anxious to remain on the land, if they got the opportunity, and anybody who reads the history of the land movement will come to the conclusion that, so far as the various Governments in power were concerned, they passed sufficient Land Acts.  I remember going to the trouble of reading over all these Land Acts and reading about the introduction of the earlier Acts in the British House of Commons.  On every occasion, the Minister introducing the measure said that it was the ultimate and final Act, that it was going to solve everything.  The Minister has admitted already that this Bill is not going to solve all our troubles and difficulties.</P>
      <P>We here have had a very peculiar problem to solve.  On the Continent, the people took the land by illegal means from the feudal landlords, but we are not in exactly that position. Our land was entirely conquered and and the conquerers exploited it to the full, which in itself has tended to make the Land Acts fairly involved.  In that connection, I agree with many of the speakers that one of the things that would be very advantageous and that would give rise to more appreciation of the Minister's work is an effort on his part to consolidate the Land Acts. Any of us who made a serious endeavour to interpret this measure will know the difficulties and labour attaching to it.  We have even heard some of the lawyers here expressing doubt as to the meaning of several phrases, so that it is no wonder that the ordinary people and Deputies will find it very difficult to understand even this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding that, great interest is taken in the country in land division, <Col N="1138" /> and, so far as the statement made here about a flight from the land is concerned, I say that there is no flight from the land.  Conditions on the land, however&mdash;let us realise it&mdash;day by day are becoming more uneconomic.  That position has existed here possibly from the time of the first world war when certain financial conditions brought about a collapse and complete chaos. I do not think this country ever properly recovered from it.  However, the Minister is determined to make a new effort.  That effort has been made in many countries and in this instance it represents an attempt on the part of the Government to buy land.  The proposal may be surrounded by more choice words than I can use but the real truth is that the Minister, representing the Government, is going to buy land.</P>
    <P>Quite recently I heard some discussions in regard to Government purchases and I think it was admitted that, in almost every single case in which Governments engaged in the purchase of houses, produce, or commodities of any description, their efforts met with complete failure.  I hope that the Minister will not meet with similar misfortune in this instance. At the same time the purchase of land is a matter that is very involved. I do not believe for one moment that the Minister would ever allow himself to be led into any wrong actions but we do know that there are people in this country who gamble in land, who are adepts in selling land, and that they will not be one bit shy or afraid to lead the Minister into difficulties.  I take it the Minister proposes to buy land at public auctions, and public auctions are occasions on which the art of &ldquo;puffing&rdquo; has reached a very high degree of efficiency. If a man gets to know that the Minister is interested in the purchase of certain land, I think there is hardly a Deputy in this Dáil who cannot visualise what is going to occur. The Minister is going to be an extra buyer, with a good deal of money behind him&mdash;in fact, with the State behind him.  To my mind, that will be a very dangerous position.  Things, of course, may work out all right but it <Col N="1139" /> is not my experience, and I think it is not the experience of other Deputies, that when a Government embarks on the purchase of land or of any commodity, its efforts are ever attended by success.  It is admitted, I think, that the Minister is going to pay more for land; if not, there is no virtue in this proposal.  I think he mentioned the fact that he was going to be merciful to owners of land, that he is going to give them every chance, insinuating that we gave them no chance, that we bought land at the lowest possible price.</P>

      <P>What is going to happen to the tenants?  We know who regulates the price of land at the present time and I think that in future the same people are going to regulate the price.  The price of land is regulated here by the British Government at the moment.  Later on, if control is removed from the price of cattle, the price of land here will be regulated by what the public in Great Britain will pay for our cattle.  The value of land will fluctuate according to that.  When land was producing food here during the war, and in fact before it, I think the Minister will admit that, down in Mayo, land for conacre was fetching from £8 to £10 an acre whereas the best land around Tara was not making more than £5 an acre at the same time. The Minister will not deny that nor will he deny that that may be the case again.  At the moment there is something of a boom in the cattle trade. I think that the Minister for Agriculture definitely intends to develop that trade and has taken elaborate steps towards that end.  I imagine that some <Col N="1140" /> difficulty will arise between himself and the Minister for Lands because if a high price prevails for cattle&mdash;and it is not so much a question of high prices as the profit that can be made out of the trade&mdash;land for grazing and fattening cattle will go up in value.  The value of land is determined by what it can be let or set at.  There will be many fluctuations in that respect.  How is the Minister going to manage his tenants if the tenants on any one estate have to purchase at a very high price, because it is the tenant who is going to purchase?  The Minister does all the writing, but it is the tenant who is going to pay.</P>

      <P>The Minister states there is no relation at all between the price paid for land by the Land Commission and the annuity the tenant will have to pay.  I cannot follow that.  If that is the case it makes matters much worse, because every man who has land for sale will say: &ldquo;It is not going to hurt my neighbours in any way because they are not going to pay in proportion to the price I will get.  We will make the Minister pay all he can.&rdquo;  That is going to inflate the price.  That is one of the dangers attached to the action of the Government in entering into a business of this kind.  All I can do is to wish the Minister the best of luck. The principal object of the Land Commission always was to relieve congestion. I hope that when the Minister does start to operate all these Land Acts, he will adhere to that principle and relieve all uneconomic holders.  It is very objectionable to a Deputy from Meath, when there are uneconomic holders in Meath, to see migrants coming in there.  I am sure that the Minister when he starts to divide the land will adhere to the principle of satisfying all the local uneconomic applicants before he starts to bring in any migrants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MatthewOReilly" hpid="Mr. M. O'Reilly Mr. M. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I only want to have that confirmed.  It is not that the people in Meath have any objection to migrants.  The only objection they have is when they are left without land and migrants are brought in.  As I said, the success of land division depends entirely on the Minister for Agriculture.  If the Minister for Agriculture decides, as he may do, to purchase abroad all the feeding-stuffs needed here&mdash;and that happened before&mdash;it is quite obvious that the value of land is going to drop. I hope that the Minister for Lands will keep in close touch with the Minister for Agriculture and try to relate the price that he pays for land to the policy <Col N="1142" /> which is going to be pursued by the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
      <P>Before 1850 we supported a big population on the land.  The population rapidly decreased, and it decreased for no other reason than that the land was limited to the production of cattle. There was no employment for the people.  If he cannot grow his own foodstuffs, if it is not economic for him to do so, there will be no occupation for the small farmer.  Our principal aim should be, if we settle the people on the land, to have economic conditions such as will allow them to get a reasonable living on the small farms.  That, of course, is going to be a big problem in the near future.  At the moment, as a result of the war, Great Britain is unable to purchase abroad.  Owing to monetary regulations, we are not able to purchase quite an amount of foreign foodstuffs.  That does act as some protection for the small farmer and other farmers.  But, to my mind, the day that we cease to produce food here for the people the value of land will fall.  I hope that in the near future the Minister for Agriculture will be compelled to see that that valuable food is grown here.  If it is, the value of land will be kept up.  If it is not, the value of land and the value of stock will fall.  The production of food for the people takes up a certain amount of land which tends to make land scarcer and more valuable.</P>
      <P>I hope that the Minister will have good luck in this effort.  As I said, it is the first time in any Land Act that the Government has had the courage to take power to buy land and I hope that nothing will happen to upset that. I hope that the land that the Minister will be able to give the tenants will not be too dear, that the price will not be so high that they will be inclined to leave it on his hands.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  I suppose it is not the last Bill we shall have so far as land division is concerned. If this House is noted for anything, it is for the number of Acts it passes, each one of which is supposed to be final.  I do not know, however, that there is any such thing as perfection in this world.  However, the Minister has faced up to his responsibility. <Col N="1143" /> I am satisfied that he is the right man in the right place, because he has a gigantic task in front of him. I am glad that under this Bill there is going to be justice for the land owner whose land will be taken and justice for incoming tenants.  What more do we want under any Act than justice?  I am satisfied that under this Bill many landholders who were in fear and trembling that their land would be acquired will have their fears allayed, and that quite a number of fairly large farmers who are not financially strong will offer part of their holdings to the Land Commission for which they can get a fair market value and thus be able to restock the rest of their holdings.  That, in itself, will be an immense improvement so far as my county is concerned.</P>
      <P>In my county and in the Midlands generally there is a fear of invasion from the West which up to the present had been on a fairly big scale. Knowing that the Minister comes from a congested area, I say God help us in the Midlands if he gets his way. The purchase of land at the market value is a good thing, but I would ask the Minister to be cautious about it. I would not like him to go wholesale into the purchase of land at market value.  I believe he has power to purchase large holdings openly and above board, to tell the people that the land is needed, pay them the market value and take over the holdings. There will, however, be such things as a backhand pull, puffers, etc. However, I know the Minister is a man who will be able to handle the situation properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When big holdings are on the market I ask him to step in in time and acquire them and not allow them to go, as they have in the last four or five years, into the hands of foreigners. Large holdings of 600, 700 and 800 acres have gone into the hands of foreigners who, I admit, have spent a large amount of money and give a fair amount of employment.  At the same time, that is not quite sound economically. Middle class peasants are the people whom we want on the land here, because they will give a fair <Col N="1144" /> amount of employment and do a fair amount of tillage.  The whole idea of the large landholders who come into this country is to turn the farms into grass or establish stud farms.  That has gone too far.  We should have a full investigation into what these people who have come in here in the last few years are doing with the land. Some of these men purchase 1,500 acres of land and say they are running a stud farm or going in for blood-stock and that the land should not be acquired.  I do not say that men who have lived in County Meath all their lives should be touched, but these big landholders who come in here get away scot-free.  I ask the Land Commission to have a full inquiry with regard to these people who came into the country during a number of years past and see if they have acquired too much property in this State.  As I said, they give plenty of employment, but nationally it is unsound and will react against this country.</P>
    <P>I am glad that under this Bill there will be a remodelling of the Land Commission which is long overdue, because it is a cumbersome body.  For over 25 years we have been dividing land and turning it into economic holdings.  Unfortunately, we are only half through the work yet.  I am satisfied that there was something wrong at the top in connection with the Land Commission. We got our freedom through revolution and that revolution should be carried through in many directions.  We should have a more revolutionary approach to the question of land acquisition and division.  I believe there was far too much of a conservative outlook at the top in the division of land in the past. I hope that we are getting away from that.  In connection with land division, we want a new national approach, and men of national vigour to take over the work and bring it to a speedy conclusion. During the last 25 or 30 years land division, which has not yet been completed, has caused a good deal of wrangling, anger, cattle driving and misery.  All that was because the Land Commission did not take effective steps to complete the job in five or six years. I know it is a huge job, but it is one that should be approached in a big way.  We were told two, three, or four <Col N="1145" /> years ago that vesting would be almost completed within three or four years. These years have now passed, and yet the work is not done.  I am afraid three or four more years will have passed before many of the new tenants who have had holdings for the past 25 years will have their land vested in them.  There are many in my county who have been in the occupation of land for 20 and 25 years, and it is still not vested.  That is a shame and a disgrace.  It is unfair to those people that they should be left in that position. They have no title to their land to enable them to go into a bank as independent men and raise some money to stock the land.  Most of them require capital to stock their land and so make it of some use to them.  As long, however, as their land is not vested by the Land Commission they cannot raise the capital they require for the successful working of their holdings.  Many of those tenants are in dire need for want of capital.  They cannot set their land on the 11 months' system because they are not allowed to do so.  If the land was vested in them, these men would prove to be good tenants.  The result of all this is that we have a list of evictions ready in my county.  Many of them are justified but many of them are unjustified.  I say that it is disgraceful to see people being evicted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>If they get title by having the land vested in them they will be able to get the capital to work it.  I am not blaming the Minister.  I believe that he has the right outlook, but the fact is that many men in the midlands and in County Meath got land &mdash;I do not care how they acquired it&mdash; but they had not a &ldquo;bob&rdquo; in their pockets.  The Land Commission, with their eyes open, gave them these holdings. Is it fair now that those people should be evicted after being in possession <Col N="1146" /> for ten or 15 years?  The Land Commission was responsible for most of those wasters who got land.  They slipped it across the Land Commission, and the latter knew well what they were doing.  There were three or four people on home relief who got land. They said they would not be able to work it, but the Land Commission said to them to take it, that they would be able to get on all right.  Some of these men are now being evicted.  The Land Commission almost stuck it down their necks.  I think that these evictions should be cut out.</P>
      <P>The division of land should be considered more from the national point of view.  What we want in this country is a middle-class peasantry.  The position in my county is that when a war is over every man who can possibly do so gets out of tillage and puts his land back into grass.  Who can blame him when grass pays him better?  If you had a good middle-class peasantry, people with holdings of from 30 to 50 acres of land, they would have to till a fair proportion of it whether they liked it or not.  It is that type of farming that would give the country a properly balanced national economy.  It is bad from the economic point of view, to see vast tracts of land going back into grass.  The small man must feel dissatisfied when he sees the big fellow, with all his land in grass, getting the big cheques for the cattle that go off that land to the market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will need to handle the position carefully.  If our national economy is properly handled it can do an immense amount of good, but if not it can do an immense amount of harm. There are parts of Dublin, Meath and Westmeath which are naturally suited for the development of the live-stock industry.  Is it not a pity to see that land hacked up to relieve congestion? In my county there is a fair amount of land that could be acquired for the relief of uneconomic holders and suitable landless men.  I do not want, however, to see that land torn up into small patches.  If that is done it will react not only on County Meath but on the West of Ireland, where the Minister comes from and where the people of Meath go to make their purchases of young stock.  If that land is broken up, <Col N="1147" /> how are you going to carry on your national economy and what about your fairs and markets?</P>
    <P>The Minister should go down into Kildare and Meath and view the position for himself.  He should visit the colonies that have been created there.  Some of them are doing fairly well.  Many of these people can well say that if they have been brought out of congested areas that they are now very much in the position of congests. They can say that they are not able to make a living out of the 22 acres of land they have.  They had large families when they came to the Midlands. Now some of their children are married and are living in the house with them.  In the houses on some of these holdings you have three and four families living, with up to 14 people in some of them.  That kind of intensified migration is not a good thing.  It would be far better if men were given a holding of 35 or 40 acres on which they could make a living for themselves and their families.  Many of those people got virgin grass land, but at the moment a lot of it is only third and fourth rate land.  That is not due to any fault on the part of the migrants. Their holdings are so small that they have to graze them day in and day out. I ask the Minister to consider that position because it is a very grave one. I know that he is very anxious to solve this problem, but I think we can never solve congestion because we have not enough land to do so.  We can give a fair amount of relief.</P>
    <P>On the borders of Cavan, in North Meath, we have a vast amount of congestion. You have men living there on five and ten acres of poor land.  Surely they are entitled to some consideration as well as the migrants.  I have no objection to the bringing up of those smaller tenants to County Meath, but I think it would be a much sounder national economy to buy out some of the large landholders in the West, give them a fair portion of land elsewhere and divide their holdings amongst the local people.</P>

      <P>I do not believe that this is going to be the last Land Bill. I think this Bill is 25 years too late. I believe that there are many people with a fair amount of land in my county who would be prepared to hand over a portion of it.  You have people there with 400 acres of land.  If 200 acres of such holdings were acquired at a fair market price and a man was left with 200 acres, he would be able to work it better than the 400 acres. I believe that a good deal of the compulsion there should be cut out.</P>
      <P>There was too much compulsion in the past.  In Meath there was great fear and trembling on the part of the people.  Every landowner for the last 20 years never felt secure.  There was agitation at his hall-door and at his back-door and he heard the cry: &ldquo;We want your land; we must take your land.&rdquo;  The Minister has done a bold thing.  He has offered fair market value for land, and he could not do more to allay the fears of any of these people.  I hope this measure will speedily be put into operation.  So far as my county is concerned, he has a vast amount of acreage under his control. I ask him to give fair and simple justice to the local people first and then, if there is land available, to migrants of the type who are most suitable from the point of view of national economy.  I wish the Minister every success with this new Bill and I hope it will be many years before he will have to bring in another one.  All the same, I am afraid this is not the final measure.  I think he will have to remodel the Land Commission.</P>

      <P>The main features of the Bill have been well and truly discussed and I do not propose to say anything on that aspect.  I rise to mention one point which I think the Minister knows something about.  That is, the necessity for a short clause&mdash;I am disappointed that it is not already in the Bill&mdash;amending the pension provisions of previous Bills so as to provide that an officer of the Land Commission who has retired shall have whatever service he may have given to the Congested Districts Board and the Land Settlement Commission prior to 1923 recognised for the purpose of a <Col N="1149" /> pension.  I would like the Minister seriously to consider that matter before the Committee Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidJohnMadden" hpid="Mr. Madden Mr. Madden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Madden</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is to be congratulated on the introduction of a measure that will give such relief when it is put into operation. It will, for one thing, remove a very serious feature which was a legacy of the foreigner here.  I believe it is principally in my county that it exists. I refer to dual ownership.  I am very glad the Minister has included a rectification of that injustice which, as I have said, was a legacy of an ancient despotism that existed here for 750 years.</P>
      <P>I was rather amazed at Deputy O'Reilly when he said there is no flight from the land.  I do not know from what source he got his statistics, but there is definite and conclusive evidence every day in the week of such a flight.  I am sure every Deputy here has had evidence every day over a number of years of the flight of the rural community.  Why is that so? Whatever the cause, there has been a feeling of instability, of insecurity among the farming community.  The old Irish Parliamentary Party, in a long and enduring struggle, won for the farmers the three Fs. &mdash;fixity of tenure, free sale and fair rent.  How about fixity of tenure?  Is there in the minds of farmers to-day the conviction that they have fixity of tenure? I say &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  I do not want to suggest that the last Government was responsible.  It may be that the Land Commission, with the powers vested in them, overrode the authority of the Minister.  There has been for a number of years an atmosphere of insecurity, instability and, I would say, unhappiness.  Who is responsible, I do not know.  I will not fix the responsibility on any Government or Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Quite recently in my constituency farmers have been visited by Land Commission inspectors who required them to show reasons why some or all of the land in their occupation should not be acquired for sub-division. I have drawn the attention of the Department quite recently to the prevailing conditions.  It may be <Col N="1150" /> necessary to ascertain why some farmers are not properly utilising their land.  No doubt there are lethargic, lazy, indolent persons not utilising their land for the benefit of their families, for the food production of the nation or for the benefit of the general community.  I do not suggest that such people should continue in that indifferent, lackadaisical way, acting as a dead weight on the nation, but I would like the Land Commission or the Minister to tell me how anyone can justify visits to progressive, hard-working farmers, industrious men working their land to a high standard of husbandry, meeting their commitments, not to the minimum degree under the Tillage Orders, but exceeding the minimum requirements, men rearing fine families.</P>
    <P>Numbers of such farmers have recently been visited by Land Commission inspectors who informed them that on a certain day they proposed to make an examination of the conditions under which they worked their land.  Now there must be a definite segregation between (a) the lazy, indolent fellow and (b) the industrious, progressive, hard-working farmer. Where is the fixity of tenure there? That is the atmosphere that has been created in my constituency.</P>
    <P>I have submitted the facts to the Minister and to the Land Commission officials.  I pointed out to them that in farms adjacent to these there were farmers setting hundreds of acres of grass &mdash;even grass for horses&mdash;and that to my own knowledge for the last quarter of a century.  These people are not working the land for the benefit of the State, the good of community, or the advancement of the nation.  It is inexplicable to me how an inspector from the Land Commission can pass by such farms as these and half a mile further on go in to inspect a holding held by a farmer, whose ancestors were in occupation of the land in some cases for as long as 215 years.  Does not that attitude seem almost indefensible on the part of the Land Commission?  It is to me the antithesis of all that our people fought for in order to get fixity of tenure in its real and true sense.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister at last realises the iniquities done by the Land <Col N="1151" /> Commission in the past.  At least they have been examining their conscience. They are going to make good the harm and the injustices done by them in the past.  When I was in the other House I drew a particular case to the attention of the Minister.  A farmer in my constituency offered the Land Commission 153 acres of land.  The land was inspected by the Land Commission and they decided, after a careful examination I suppose, that the land was not suitable for sub-division but that it would be excellent land for afforestation purposes.  The owner was prepared to sell.  There was no house on the land and he found it inconvenient to work it.  I am speaking now subject to correction since I have not got all the data in front of me.  The Land Commission offered him £380 for his 153 acres.  The seller would be required to pay the cost of redemption and other legal expenses.  Out of the £380 offered he would eventually find himself with £134 net.  I pointed out how unjust the offer was to the Land Commission and the hardship it would impose upon this small farmer with a family of seven or eight young children.  The Land Commission move very slowly.  After another 12 months had elapsed they decided to give him £680, from which had to be deducted £160.  That brought the figure down to £520.  From that had to be deducted another £40 for legal expenses. In the end there was about £250 left for this 153 acres of reasonably good land, and the owner had no option but to cross the Irish Sea to find work in a more congenial atmosphere to support himself and his children.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission has a duty to treat the community fairly.  The Minister says&mdash;all credit to him&mdash;that he will in future pay the market value of land.  I agree with Deputy O'Reilly that it will not be an easy matter to determine what the market value is, since supply and demand and other factors enter into it.  Any auctioneer can readily point out the difficulties in determining the market value of land.  I have sold a number of farms in the past.  Farms sold by private treaty never realise the same price as they would if they were sold in the open market.  One may ask why farms <Col N="1152" /> are sold by private treaty when they could be sold to better advantage in the open market.  The reason is that, if the Land Commission knew that the farms were on the market, they would immediately step in and take them. They would pay not the market value price, but what they considered to be a fair price.  This is a Government Department which, if one approaches it to have something done, sends out two or three letters stuck together.  When one opens the envelope one discovers that half of them are torn.  They begin with &ldquo;A Chara&rdquo;, nine or ten lines in Irish, and they end with &ldquo;Mise, le meas&rdquo;.  You get no more than that and you throw them away.</P>
    <P>The price that may be determined for these lands is about £3 6s. 8d. an acre. Is it any wonder that this big and benevolent Minister who has come from the land and who is working on behalf of those on the land realises the injustices of the Irish Land Commission and has introduced a Bill in this House to try to remedy the matter?  Instead of offering him silly, cynical criticism, as some of those on the opposite benches have done &mdash; not all, I will admit &mdash; Deputies ought to co-operate with the Minister.  They should laud him for introducing a section to remedy dual ownership, which is a legacy of past tyranny and injustice by the British, and, secondly, to give to the farmer the market value of his land and withdraw the locusts of inspectors who are creating to-day a feeling of insecurity and instability, as I have already said.  They go around visiting men who are a credit to the country&mdash; farmers who work their land with industry and in a progressive manner and who conform to all the statutes in regard to extra tillage.  They visit these men who work so industriously and who rear good, decent families. How can these farmers have any feeling of peace or security?  By whom is this authority given?  Is it the order of the Government?  Has the Minister given that order?  If not since their advent to power, were these orders issued by the previous Government and, if so, why?  I should like to know why certain men, one after another, were selected&mdash;men against whom no charge of inefficiency or negligence <Col N="1153" /> could be made.  These are just a few points that strike me.</P>
    <P>I went to the Minister before, and he cannot say that I have, as it were, come here behind his back.  I went to the Land Commission and pointed out these happenings.  I hope the Minister will remedy them and that the Bill, when it becomes law, will vest in him and in his successors in office power to keep under control the mercenary methods adopted by some officials in his Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened very attentively to the speeches of the different Deputies.  Some Deputies seem to be very keen on land division. It is a very drastic act to go in on a farmer's land, to take it from him and to divide it out.  A farmer has, say, 300 acres of land.  He is raising food on that land and he is giving employment. That type of man is an asset to the State.  If you take 100 acres of his land from him and give 20 or 30 acres to his workman what will the position then be?  The workman will require money to buy stock and machinery for the farm.  I believe that we have too many small farms in this country&mdash;too many farms of 10, 20 or 30 acres. Usually the farmers on such farms just barely exist.  The Minister should be very careful before he starts land division.  I know farmers who have, say, 50 acres of land.  These men run their farms efficiently and they give employment.  If the Minister for Lands is entitled to take this action I think some other Minister is equally entitled, say, to go down O'Connell Street and take over half the business of a big store or to take over part of some industry.  Very careful consideration should be given to that matter. Probably other Deputies who have spoken to-night are aware of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister is contemplating dividing the land I think he should not give men ten acres or 20 acres.  He should give them 60 acres or 70 acres. Further, along with giving them the land, it would be necessary to give them some money to run the farm. There is no use in giving a man land unless he has the money to stock it and to work it.  Therefore, I say that there are lots of problems in regard to the question of land division and careful <Col N="1154" /> consideration should be given to the matter by the Minister before he takes action.</P>

      <P>I have listened to this debate to-night and to similar debates in years gone by, but I must say that I never thought land was as cheap as a Deputy said it was to-night.  I heard Deputy Madden from Limerick say that it could be had for £3 6s. 8d. an acre. If you look for a bit of ground for the purpose of building a house on it you will pay £1 a foot for it.  If you build a house in the country for the agricultural worker you must pay at least £25 an acre.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>We get it for £25 in Wexford.  We are building houses for the working classes at the moment and we had to pay £135 an acre.  Who wants the land in the country?  Passing through my constituency and through County Wicklow every week, I notice that the unfortunate agricultural labourer has a half acre in some places and one acre under the new scheme.  If he is lucky enough to have a cow he will have to find grazing for it on the banks by the roadside or he may have a goat grazing on the side of a ditch. We hear them talking about taking the land for the farmers.  In my constituency there are plenty of good, genuine agricultural labourers and small farmers who are trying to exist. Some of the best farmers in Ireland are to be found in County Wexford, where we till more than in any other county. Some people there are trying to rear families on 10 or even on eight acres. If they go next door, so to speak, their neighbour has a big ranch.  They have to pay a high price for conacre, while the owner of that land goes around the country, does not bother about tillage, does not stay on the land at all but draws his conacre money from the small farmer, and so forth.  The Minister would do right to divide up the land. The reason some of the small farmers' sons have to fly from the land is because they have not enough to rear families and keep them there.  That is why they have to go away.  They are not able to get a living.  At the same time you have big estates all over the <Col N="1155" /> country lying there and set only for grazing purposes.</P>
      <P>It is only right that the Minister should come along now and take courage.  Many Bills have been brought in and we thought that the land divided for 16 years under the last Government would have almost satisfied the people who want land, but we find no, there are still thousands of people who have not half an acre.  Something should be done to give land to the people of rural Ireland and give them a chance of living.  That is why there is a flight from the land, and many small farmers and labourers, too, would be glad to get a few acres, till them, and make use of them to produce food. You see in the papers that people in the city have to pay 1/1 for a head of cabbage.  They have not a back yard, not to mind a garden, while there are thousands of acres of land around County Dublin, as in other counties, where these people could get some to satisfy them.</P>
      <P>There has been great talk about market value, but no farmer to-day sells his land cheaply.  Go to an auction where you will see farmers bidding for land and you will see what land will go to.  They will not throw it away.  We want the Land Commission to give them a fair price and not do as the last people did, take the people's cattle and send around John Browne to give them whatever price he likes. We do not want the Minister to take land without giving a fair price.  Give the people who have land to sell a fair price and you will get the land.  Divide that land among the working classes and the poor farmers and you need never be afraid that you will leave this side of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaSnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been in this House for 22 years and during that time I have seen and welcomed many efforts to solve this problem of congestion. I am willing and anxious to help the Minister in any way I possibly can to try to solve this problem, but I would like him to put his cards on the table and give us a much broader outline of what his proposals are.  I would like to ask him why, if he is serious <Col N="1156" /> in this matter, he did not give us more particulars of his policy.  I think we should hear, for instance, the area of land he proposes to acquire or resume under this particular Bill.  He should also tell us where this land is situated and where exactly he intends to acquire enough land to form a pool that will help to solve the congestion problem in the West of Ireland.  I think that the Minister to-night realises more than ever the problems that confronted the Fianna Fáil Government in their effort to solve this problem.  Most of the Deputies I have heard speaking from across the House do not seem to have any knowledge or idea of the problem which confronts the Minister.  They seemingly do not understand what exactly congestion means.  When I hear a man advocating that the smallest holding given to any particular individual should be at least 60 or 80 acres, I say that it is a pity that that Deputy would not take a tour through the West of Ireland and try to picture for himself how it is that people living on ten or 12 acres of land all their lives have accomplished the feat of eking out an existence and rearing a family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all admire the work done and the effort made by the late Mr. Hogan. When he introduced the Land Bill of 1923 the position regarding the amount of land available for acquisition was entirely different from what it was when the Land Bill of 1933 was introduced. At that time there were ranches all over the country in the hands of landlords, and the problem facing that Minister was fairly easy.  He could walk in and acquire a farm of 1,000 acres and still leave 5,000 acres to one individual.  The only flaw we found in that Bill was that areas up to 5,000, 6,000 or 7,000 acres were vested in those landlords, and we had to face the problem of getting after them again, and the Land Act of 1933, introduced by Fianna Fáil, had that aim before it.  I can assure the Minister that he will not meet the same type of criticism from this side of the House on this Bill as Fianna Fáil had to contend with when that one was introduced and passed through this House.  He is not going to be told that this Bill means the confiscation of private property, as we were told by the people who now occupy the Government Benches.  He <Col N="1157" /> is going to receive from us every co-operation and assistance to make this Bill workable and to put him in the position, if possible, of solving this problem as soon as possible.  It is because of the knowledge we have of the things that happened in those days and because the Minister has had experience of the working of the different Land Acts from the 1923 Act to the present day, that we believe that he should now be in a position to put his finger on the problem and say: &ldquo;Here is my plan to solve the problem of land division.&rdquo; I am in entire agreement with the purchase of certain types of holdings by the Minister or the Irish Land Commission and I sincerely hope that by this Bill the Minister will solve the problem.</P>
    <P>We have experience of people with a number of holdings, one or two of them non-residential, 20 or 30 miles from the parent holding on which the individual resides.  As soon as there is any local push to have those lands acquired, that man puts a holding up for auction.  The Land Commission says that it does not matter whether it is (a) or (b) holding they purchase.  They say: &ldquo;We will let the man sell his holding and purchase from the new owner at a later stage.&rdquo;  But as soon as that land is sold, a high market value is put on it straightaway and the Land Commission find that they cannot look at it.  I believe that the Land Commission had the power to take over any land they were anxious to take over for the relief of congestion in any area if they only took the necessary steps to go ahead and do it. In so far as fixing of price was concerned, I have yet to see the first case in the Land Commission courts where an appeal was brought against price and that the appellant did not get an increased price.  I think it has always been given in the courts.  I think an increased reasonable price was given always.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">

    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaSnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>But the increased price was thrashed out between people who could do justice between <Col N="1158" /> one man and another.  I do not think the lay commmissioners or the judicial courts are out to rob any individual.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaSnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>They were not.  They could pay £7 or £10 or £30 an acre.  If they were tied by the Act, surely the price they offered would be the same price all the time and one could never get an increase on appeal.  The Minister knows they were not tied.  The Minister cannot quote from any section of any Act to show where the Land Commission were tied down to £10, £20 or £40 an acre.  No matter what he tries to do in this section, he cannot tie himself down to fixing a price, nor can he tell this House that he will pay £40 or £60 an acre.  Coming from a congested district, and from that portion of the country, he knows that, in any two townlands, where the land is equal and the valuation is not one shilling greater in one district than in the other, a 50-acre holding in one place may go £500 or more than in another, although there is no difference in the size of the holding or in the valuation.</P>
      <P>When he is talking about fixing a market price, I do not know where he is going to get that price, or how he is going to fix it.  He cannot put it down in black and white in a Bill, any more than Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or Cumann na nGaedheal could not put it in their Land Acts.  I must say I would like to see power in the hands of the Land Commission, but I am not prepared to give too many powers to any particular Minister.  I have good reasons for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we came into office, I had the unhappy experience of seeing the Land Commission work under an Act whereby the Minister had certain powers. He had the power to give a holding of land, as he actually did, to any particular individual he liked.  That individual would not necessarily be a man hostile to the Minister or his policy.  Unfortunately, to-day we are going to have a Minister putting himself in the very same position.  If we give those powers to this particular Minister confronting us and in charge of this particular <Col N="1159" /> Department, I have no doubt in my mind that the people who are politically opposed to him will not be the people coming out best in his division of land.  For that reason, I am not prepared to give it to him or to give it to a Minister from these benches, either.</P>

      <P>I certainly was.  I should be much more wise now, when I see what is happening everywhere with the Government in power at the moment, in so far as their powers go to giving anything to anybody supporting them.  Because of the things to which I have referred, and because of the danger of any particular Minister getting too many powers and doing too many things from his particular eye, I do not like to give to any Minister very drastic powers in this direction.</P>
      <P>I believe that the Minister should produce a policy, should draft his Bill according to that policy and compel the Land Commission then to carry it out.  I do not think there would be much need to change any commissioner who is working in the Land Commission, unless you pension them off altogether and clear the whole lot out and put in some more revolutionary crowd-but that would not fit in with the terms of this Bill.  If the Minister put his policy into this Bill, he could take power to compel the Land Commission to carry that out.  He should keep out of the division of land, the acquisition and resumption of holdings, and so on.</P>
      <P>There are three dangerous sections in the Bill&mdash;Sections 5, 10 and 23&mdash; sections that I would like changed, and which I hope I will see changed by the Minister, for his own benefit as well as for the benefit of all the Deputies in the House who will be voting for anything he puts into a piece of paper, as well as for the benefit of the people of the country in general whom it is intended to benefit by this legislation.

We made provision for compensating the herds and other people who earned their livelihood on the land. We made provision for compensating Old I.R.A. men who had given service to the country.  Does the Minister say that we should not have made provision for these people?  Experience has shown that there are other ways and means that can be adopted to provide for those people.  We simply made provision for them in the best way we thought fit and left it to the Land Commission to work out the problem and to do the best they could.  We did not dictate to the Land Commission that Tom, Dick or Harry should be given a holding.  That is the implication the Minister is putting on the whole thing. That is where he is entirely wrong.

It is unwise, it is very foolish, for the Minister himself to do it.  I wonder what the reaction will be in Mayo if he ever attempts some of the things envisaged here.  Two heads are wiser than one.  The commissioners are intelligent people who know exactly what they are doing when they are exercising the powers that the Minister is now taking from them.  They have had long experience and, if the Minister tells them exactly what he wants done, in as strong language as he likes, and that he wants a particular job done within a certain length of time, he will get results.  Experience has been gained from the various Acts that were passed.  We brought in the 1933 Act. We found at a later stage that it was not entirely satisfactory.  When that Act was introduced it was met with unscrupulous opposition.  The Opposition did not want us to take over one acre or to divide one acre and definitely and deliberately set out to ensure, if they could, that we would not take over one acre just as they tried to prevent us doing many other things.  It was in spite of them and it was by the loyalty of the Irish people to our policy and to ourselves and by our determination to do this job as speedily as possible that the issue was decided.  The people who were talking about confiscation of private property had that driven home to them pretty forcibly, not by mere talk, but by a general election.  It took a general election to drive that home and it was driven home.  At the same time, that opposition hampered us from going as far as we might have gone with the land division.  The Minister may rest assured that he will not meet that type of criticism or opposition from these benches.</P>

In regard to the question of price, if the question of price is to be left to the Minister and to any individual that he decides should fix the price on market value basis, it will lead to all sorts of corruption.</P>
      <P>I think it was the Minister who made a suggestion about people being robbers.  I do not think this country is completely free of people who would be prepared to go that far and who, if they got an opportunity of robbing the Land Commission, would say: &ldquo;I am only getting some of my own back.&rdquo;  I believe that this question of price is too big a problem to leave to any one individual and the commissioners who were dealing with it before are still quite capable of carrying out that duty.</P>

      <P>I regret that the Minister has not made a decent effort to solve the problem, and, further, has not made any real effort to give the House a clear idea of what his intentions are.  I hope that in his reply he will give us much more information than he gave us in his opening remarks.  Even the White Paper circulated with the Bill does not give a whole lot of information and it is not at all in keeping with the statement made by the Minister, but perhaps he will clarify the position when replying to the criticism put forward. I advise him to be careful in this matter of market value and to try to ensure that &ldquo;puffing&rdquo; will not be allowed to interfere.  I do not think it at all fair that the Minister should come into open competition in the market with any individual who wants to purchase a holding and some other method must be devised for getting over this particular difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>There are only two excuses that can be given for the speech we have just heard from Deputy Killilea.  Either he was deliberately trying to distort what is in the Bill, or, by reason of his rather futile endeavours in another place, he did not read the Bill.  I am being charitable and accepting the second as the reason for his failure to understand what he was discussing.  The Deputy was at great pains to prove that the Bill gives to the Minister powers which it does not give at all.  It is an old Fianna Fáil trick&mdash;to put up ninepins for the sake of knocking them down and take attention from the real issue; but the unfortunate thing, so far as the Deputy was concerned, is that he did not read the Bill sufficiently well to know enough about it to be able to draw the red herring across the trail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill&mdash;let us be quite clear about it&mdash;does not give the Minister any power to fix the price of land.  The Bill in Section 5 changes the legal basis upon which the commissioners and the <Col N="1166" /> Judicial Commissioner must fix the price and it leaves to the Land Commission, and to the Land Commission alone, the power of determination of the price at which any man's holding will be acquired.  I will say at least this for Deputy Killilea, that he was not the first speaker from the Fianna Fáil benches to make that case.  He was not the first who tried to draw the House, and I have a slight suspicion&mdash; I am perhaps a little cynical&mdash;the country, astray on that issue.</P>
    <P>The issue could not be more clear and the Bill could not be more clear. Under the Act of 1923, a different legal basis was established for the price at which resumed land would be paid for by the Land Commission relative to the price at which acquired land would be paid for.  The price at which resumed land would be paid for &mdash;and it is, of course, land which has not been vested&mdash;was set out in the Act of 1923 and restated finally in the Act of 1939.  The then Minister in charge of the Bill made it quite clear when discussing the 1939 measure in the Seanad when he said that all that was being done by that Bill in respect of the price of resumed land was restating the existing law.  The law always has been so in respect of resumed land.  I am sorry the Deputy is not prepared to learn and perhaps I was too charitable in thinking that it was merely that he did not understand the situation; he was perhaps deliberately misrepresenting it.</P>
    <P>In the 1939 Act, the Fianna Fáil Minister in charge of the Bill made it quite clear that the insertion of the particular section dealing with the price of resumed land was only a restatement of the existing law and that the law then was that the Land Commission must, as it did, pay, in respect of any resumed land, the market value of the holding to the person from whom the land was resumed and, in addition, were bound to pay, in certain circumstances, compensation for disturbance.  That has always been the case and any one who has any experience of the work of the Land Commission in regard to resumed holdings knows that it is and always has been the case, and that there has never been <Col N="1167" /> any difficulty about the Land Commission assessing the market value of these holdings.</P>
    <P>That market value was paid in respect of holdings that were not vested and surely there should be a very much stronger case for the payment of the market value in respect of vested holdings&mdash;the payment of a higher price for vested holdings as compared with that paid for unvested holdings.  In spite of the fact that on many occasions it was put up to Fianna Fáil that they should grant that measure of social justice, where it was necessary in the social interests of the community to acquire and distribute land, they always steadfastly refused to do so. This Dáil is not the first Dáil which has had to consider the question.  It was put up on two occasions in my recollection in the Seanad when Fianna Fáil were in power, and on each occasion, although the issue was exactly the issue which is now in Section 5, they deliberately opposed it because they were afraid to face the issue.</P>
    <P>I am glad to have this opportunity of congratulating the Minister on having faced the issue, and having faced it courageously, and on having determined that there should be at least a measure of justice, because it is only justice, for these people from whom land is to be acquired in the interests of the community as a whole and these people who have to give up their land in the interests of a social policy.  I am extremely glad that this section has been introduced.  It has been introduced, not for the reason which Deputy Killilea has given, because the Minister under Section 5 has no more power than has Deputy Killilea to fix the price of any land that may be acquired by the Land Commission in the future, once this Bill has become law, as unquestionably it will become law, with, I hope, Section 5 unchanged.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate&mdash;Wheatenmeal Subsidy.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>To-day, I addressed three questions to the Minister for Agriculture <Col N="1168" /> concerning the proposed withdawal of the subsidy on wheatenmeal.  I would refer to the answers in greater detail but I regret that the time at my disposal will be insufficient to allow of my making the case that I should like to make in regard to this question.  I raise it in this form because I consider it to be a very urgent problem and I hope to be able to convince the Minister, through the Parliamentary Secretary, that it is a question that should be reconsidered and that he should reverse his policy in regard to this proposal to withdraw the wheatenmeal subsidy. First of all, I should like to make a few general references.  Whatever motive prompted the Minister to make this announcement some weeks or some months ago, from the purely financial point of view it seems extraordinary that the Minister, in an effort to save a sum of £80,000 on the subsidies should descend on such an innocent form of industry as the production of wheatenmeal. When one considers that the total amount of flour subsidies in the current year is over £9,000,000, perhaps £10,000,000, one must agree that the amount devoted to wheatenmeal is very small indeed.  Even though the Minister in the course of a reply to Deputy Hickey a fornight ago, said that the figure was by no means insignificant, if we take the relationship of £80,000 to £10,000,000 it represents something less than 1 per cent.  Even if this total is not all devoted to the ordinary 85 per cent. flour extraction, there is at least something over £6,000,000 devoted to the 85 per cent. flour extraction and in that case the percentage would be only slightly over 1 per cent.  Unless there is some very urgent reason for this retrenchment, I think that the Minister on that score should reconsider the matter.</P>
      <P>I regret that the Minister is not here personally because I should like to have heard his reply to the case which I am about to make.  I realise of course that he had no notice of my intention to raise the matter in this way before he left for America.  The second point that I think is worthy of consideration is that the production of wheatenmeal is an almost exclusively rural industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before the general election, the various Parties paid lip service to the <Col N="1169" /> necessity for keeping rural industries alive.  They were quite right, of course, in formulating that as part of their policy.  Fine Gael was particularly strong on that and so were the members of Clann na Poblachta in their published election addresses.  Of the total production of wheatenmeal, by far the greater proportion, as I say, is produced in purely rural areas.  I might mention the names and the locations of a few of the firms engaged in the industry.  You have Howard's of Crookstown, County Cork, Kavanagh's of Maynooth, the Bandon Milling Company, McCarron and Hills, Drogheda, O'Rourke's, Drogheda, the Blanchardstown Mills, County Dublin and Newman's, Athboy, County Meath.  I am told that there are many other smaller mills in the more remote rural areas, some perhaps along the western seaboard. From that point of view alone, I think the withdrawal of the subsidy is entirely unjustified.</P>
    <P>Each successive Government in this country has, at least, declared as its policy that rural industries should be kept alive, this Government much more than any other, and if it persists in this action, it is dealing a death blow to that policy and certainly to the rural production of wheatenmeal.  There are in all 40 or 50 mills throughout the country and even if the production of wheatenmeal is not the only activity, it forms the major portion of the industrial activity of almost every one of these mills.  On the assumption that each of these mills employs on an average about 20 men, there would be something like 800 men engaged, directly or indirectly, in the production of wheatenmeal.  I do not think that any mill would desire the case to be made that every one of these men would be put out of employment if the subsidy were withdrawn, but its withdrawal would certainly have a very bad effect on the numbers employed in the mills, not only on the operatives directly concerned with the handling of wheatenmeal but also those engaged in the transport of it and clerical staffs, because a certain proportion of the work of the members of these staffs is devoted to the handling and transport of wheatenmeal.</P>
    <P>Apart from those directly concerned <Col N="1170" /> in the mills, you have various subsidiary occupations in which people are enabled to get some form of work, due to the production of wheatenmeal. They are enabled to get that work in close proximity to their homes, with the result that it enables them to remain on the land.  That is possibly the most desirable ideal that any Government in this country could place before it.  I might mention some of these subsidiary occupations.  There are carpenters who have to attend to the plant, masons, joiners and lorry drivers.  The people engaged in these occupations and who live close to the wheaten-mills thus get a certain amount of employment which helps them to maintain their homes in these rural districts.</P>
    <P>The third point has reference to the dietetic value of wheatenmeal.  When the proposed withdrawal of the subsidy came to the notice of the Society of Medical Officers of Health, they passed a resolution expressing their concern over the proposed withdrawal. I have not the terms of the resolution before me at the moment but, summarised, the effect of them was that the Society of Medical Officers viewed with consternation the proposed withdrawal of the subsidy because of the bad effect it would have on the nutrition of the people of the country.  Apart from that, the Minister has ample reason, from the dietetic point of view, to maintain the subsidy.  Even the Department of Health in his own régime has published an advertisement which emphasises the nutritive value for children of wheatenmeal.  I shall refer to that in more detail later.</P>
    <P>Apart from these points, there are other factors which should be taken into consideration before what I would describe as this most drastic and undesirable step is taken.  These local mills, which depend for their existence on the production of this meal, provide valuable drying and storage space for our own native wheat particularly in years of a bad harvest.  In 1946 when harvest conditions were particularly adverse, these mills performed a very useful function to the country by enabling us to save several <Col N="1171" /> thousand barrels of wheat which would otherwise have been lost for want of adequate storage space on the farmers' own land.</P>
    <P>There is another point that might be worthy of consideration and that is that, in the event of a future war, a thing which we cannot ignore, the first object of attack would be places of industrial concentration.  At present the mills which produce 85 per cent. extraction flour are mostly situated close to large ports.  In the event of these ports being attacked, it is hardly likey that these big mills would escape.  Therefore, it would be a very valuable asset to the country if we could fall back to some extent on the small mills that produce wheatenmeal.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the effects which the proposed withdrawal of this subsidy would have.  At present the price of wheatenmeal varies from 2/4d. to 2/7d. a stone, according to the locality. I think it is cheaper in the county borough areas.  As against that, 85 per cent. extraction flour ranges between 2/6d. and 2/9d. per stone.  There is generally a difference of 2d. per stone.  If the subsidy is withdrawn, it is estimated that the price of wheatenmeal per stone will increase by almost 100 per cent. Therefore, the consumers of wheatenmeal who are not inconsiderable, people largely from the labouring classes, will either have to pay almost 5/- per stone for this meal or purchase 85 per cent. extraction flour.  In most cases where wheatenmeal is used it is used from preference and, not only that, but the people who use it think it is essential to their health.  If the price increases by that amount, it is almost inevitable that the output of wheatenmeal will drop considerably. It is estimated by people who have examined the matter closely that it would drop to almost 5 per cent.; in other words, wheatenmeal would not only become too dear, but almost unobtainable. It is a staple food with a large section of the community and it is by no means a luxury.  Therefore, the people who use it as a staple food should be protected.  We pay lip-service to the protection of the <Col N="1172" /> interests of minorities and certainly people who eat wholemeal bread are in a minority and therefore their interests should be protected.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of the effect it will have on labour, I think I can do no better than quote from a memorandum from the workers in one of these mills.  The mill in question is the Bellmount Mill, Crookstown, County Cork.  They say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If this step is taken, the sale of wholemeal will drop to such a low level that it will be uneconomic for the mills to continue in business. They will be forced to shut down and lay off their employees.  The result will be that the mill workers will be compelled to leave the district to seek alternative employment.  While seasonal work is occasionally available, no constant employment is available in the district, so that the workers have no alternative.  For the majority this will mean abandoning their homes and looking for accommodation wherever they may find work.  Many of them will be forced to emigrate and will be lost to the country.  Furthermore, they have served their time to wholemeal milling but will find it very difficult to get positions in other mills as most of these are fully staffed.  They would be more likely to finish up as unskilled labourers in building or similar trades.  It does not seem fair that skilled men should be threatened with such a prospect.  Neither does it seem good economics for a Minister for Agriculture to wipe out an industry giving employment in a rural district and to drive the workers and their families from their homes and throw them like so much scrap on the labour market.  This is particularly hard to understand when the Minister for Industry and Commerce is advocating the establishment of new industries in rural districts and promising every support to such industries.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Apart from that, there is the likelihood that it will entail a possible increase in the subsidy on 85 per cent. extraction flour, because the wheat that is now being diverted to these mills will have to be brought to the other mills <Col N="1173" /> and the cost of transport to the big mills at the ports will not be inconsiderable. In his reply to the question I have referred to by Deputy Hickey, the Minister gave as a reason for the proposed withdrawal of the subsidy that it had already been clearly established that for children its dietetic value is materially qualified by its content of phytic acid.  The bogey of phytic acid in relation to wheatenmeal was raised many times and squashed very effectively by medical officers of health, not only here but in England. I can call to mind that a very high authority in this country, in the person of Dr. Saunders, Medical Officer of Health for Cork, laid fairly and squarely the bogey of this phytic acid in wheatenmeal.  I think the most forcible argument I can put forward in this respect is an advertisement published by the Department of Health on July 23rd, 1949, which was headed &ldquo;Diet Does It&rdquo; and in which there is a picture of three young children.  I shall read some of the material in this advertisement, which will be most enlightening to the Parliamentary Secretary. It says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;For growth and repair the body needs every day foods with proteins which are the main body builders: milk, cheese, fish, meat, eggs, peas and beans.  Foods with calcium, which form strong bones and good teeth: milk, fish, cheese, green vegetables, wholemeal bread....  Some foods from each of these body-building groups can always be bought at little cost.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The advertisement also gives the advice: &ldquo;Be sure that the children get these foods.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If this proposed withdrawal is to come into effect, not only will this particular food not be bought at little cost but it will be on the market at a prohibitive cost and, possibly, in such short supply that people will not be able to get it at all.</P>
    <P>Another reason the Minister put forward was that &ldquo;there is good reason to believe that a substantial part of the total production of wheatenmeal is being used for animal feeding.&rdquo;  In that connection, I put a question to the Minister for Industry and Commerce <Col N="1174" /> to-day as regards the number of prosecutions instituted for this alleged offence in the eight years since 21st October, 1941, when the subsidy was first given, and the answer I got was that there was only four prosecutions in the eight years.  I do not think I need refer any further to the weakness of the Minister's argument in that respect.  I also asked the Minister to give me the date of the last prosecution, but he was not able to do so.  I can tell the Parliamentary Secretary that I am fairly confident that there has been no prosecution for this alleged offence in the last 12 months.  The Minister also stated in his reply to Deputy Hickey's question that he would take certain compensatory measures to ensure that there would be no unemployment.  I shall quote again from the memorandum circulated by these employees to which I have referred as to alternative employment. They say as regards wheat assembling:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This is purely a seasonal trade confined to about two months of the year and giving very little employment proportionate to the volume of wheat handled.  Furthermore, there appears to be no future in the trade at present, as is evidenced by the fact that the concerns who previously engaged in it have reduced their activities to about one-tenth of the volume handled in previous seasons. The reasons are, of course, that the amount of wheat sown was considerably reduced last year as a result of the Government's policy and that this season large quantities of imported seed wheat will be available, so that the anticipated demand for native seed wheat is very small.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>With regard to maize and compound food manufactures they say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The firm is already engaged in this trade and, competition being very keen, there is very little room for expansion.  The employment value of the trade is small, as most of the operations are automatic.  It would certainly not be large enough to keep the business going on the present scale.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As to commission milling they say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This also is to a certain extent <Col N="1175" /> seasonal, as it depends on the supplies of grain stored by farmers.  It forms a very insignificant part of the firm's activities, as the local cooperative stores and privately-owned hammer-mills do the bulk of the work.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I regret that I have overstepped the mark.  I had hoped that there would be time for another Deputy to speak on this.  The problem, however, was so wide that I could not possibly deal with it in less time.  I think I have given sufficient reasons to the Parliamentary Secretary to show why this position should not only be reconsidered but why the proposal should be abandoned.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lynch asked what were the motives for the proposal for the withdrawal of the subsidy on wheatenmeal.  The answer to that is simple.  It is one of a number of measures consequential on the recommendations made in the bread and flour inquiry report, the inquiry which has been conducted by a committee under the chairmanship of the Attorney-General. As the Deputy is aware, certain steps on the lines of the recommendations made in that report have already been taken.  This withdrawal of subsidy is another step in that direction. The Deputy went on to refer to the fact that the withdrawal of the subsidy would seriously interfere with employment in a number of mills, particularly rural mills.  There are in all 63 mills milling wheatenmeal throughout the country of which only 31 claim subsidy, and only 13 of these have quotas for 1,000 barrels or more.  In 1947-'48, only eight mills milled over 1,000 sacks for sale.  In fact, one mill alone does approximately 43 per cent. of the entire wheatenmeal business. That particular firm employs about 18 persons on that work, and, of the other mills, the total number employed exclusively on the work, including the 18, would not exceed, I think, 30 persons, even if this particular mill did nothing else.  The number of persons involved is therefore small.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1176" /> As the Minister said in reply to a question, it is not proposed to withdraw the subsidy until adequate provision is made for the continued working of mills on the manufacture of compound feeding stuffs, etc., which, as I said to the Deputy earlier to-day, will be used in far greater quantities in the future than in recent years.  It so happens that the total number of mills involved in the whole of these operations is comparatively limited in so far as most of the work is only a fraction of the work which these mills carry on.</P>
    <P>The particular point which the Deputy made about the withdrawal of wheatenmeal from the point of view of health has not, I think, any great validity as there are differences of opinion as to the dietetic merits of wheatenmeal and the dietetic merits of flour of 85 per cent. extraction.  The Government has taken adequate steps to see that there is available to every person an adequate ration of flour or bread of proper dietetic value.  At the same time it has to have regard to the exceptionally heavy expenditure on food subsidy of which at least three-quarters of the total is in respect of bread and flour.  The total subsidy in recent years has varied between £9,000,000 and £10,000,000.  In so far as any steps are available to the Government to reduce the heavy impost of that subsidy, it is obvious that it must take those steps, in so far as Government action can reduce that heavy burden. These mills which are engaged in the wheatenmeal business as a sideline to their general business will, I imagine, continue&mdash;and it is expected that they will continue&mdash;to mill wheaten flour as part of their general business.  As one or two of the mills are almost exclusively occupied on the wheatenmeal milling end, no proposal to withdraw the subsidy will be taken until adequate steps are taken to ensure that the mills will be occupied fully on alternative work, in particular on the manufacture of compound feeding-stuffs.</P>
    <P>I think the Deputy is aware that there has been in the last 12 months a very substantial increase in the numbers of live stock, particularly cattle, sheep and poultry.  Recent figures indicate that the numbers of stall-fed cattle are tending to rise and that a <Col N="1177" /> consequential increase in the use of feeding stuffs is likely to arise, so that any apprehension which the employees may have as to their future employment can, I think be allayed.  The Deputy read from a memorandum some remarks concerning the fact that the quantity of wheat which the millers have handled in the past year was less than formerly. I think the Deputy is aware that this year more wheat has been handled than in any year, bar one.</P>

      <P>Wheat, and it is likely that the quantity of home-produced wheat will remain consistently high while the present attractive price remains. This year the quantity of wheat supplied to the mills is substantially in excess of the average of the last few years.  I believe that as long as the present price remains&mdash;and, as the Deputy knows, there is a guarantee for at least two years more&mdash;at 62/6 a barrel for wheat, the prospect is that, while the acreage may drop, wheat will be grown on more suitable land, and, with <Col N="1178" /> a more extensive use of fertilisers, this should result in a higher yield.  At any rate, there is no indication at present that the quantity of wheat handled by the mills is likely to be less than it has been in recent years.</P>
      <P>I should also add, in reference to the advertisement which the Deputy read and which issued from the Department of Health, that wheaten meal is not the only food which has a high protein content.  The butter ration was raised this year, and the production of butter is likely to continue at a higher level than in recent years.  Consequently, the ration will remain higher than it has been for the last five or six years.  In addition, there is more milk, and eggs are available in greater quantities. From the point of view of employment there is not any need for apprehension amongst the employees, and, from the dietetic point of view, adequate steps have been taken to provide a sufficient supply of nutritious food.</P>
