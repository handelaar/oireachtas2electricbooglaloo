      <P>Occupiers of land the poor law valuation of which is over £2 but not more than £4 are not debarred from unemployment assistance under the first Employment Period Order of 1949, whereas such persons were debarred from unemployment assistance by the first Order of 1947 unless they were members of the special register of agricultural and turf workers, which has since been discontinued. Further, the employment period is one week shorter in 1949 than in 1947.</P>
      <P>The second Employment Period Order of 1949 leaves eligible for unemployment assistance in the non-scheduled areas men with dependents and women, and in the scheduled areas unmarried men with dependents and women, whereas persons in these classes were debarred from unemployment assistance by the second Employment Period Order of 1947 unless they qualified for exception as residents in houses owned by the local authority of a city or town but situated outside such area, or as factory workers or as members of the special register of agricultural and turf workers. Further, the second employment period of 1949 is three weeks shorter in duration than the second employment period of 1947.</P>

      <P>I understand some 25 persons in the Slieve Bawn district are prepared to sell land for afforestation purposes, but only 16 formal offers have been received. Perhaps the Deputy would induce the other persons to send to the Forestry Division particulars of their respective lands which they are prepared to sell.  All lands offered will be inspected as early as possible and it would facilitate matters if all offers were received before an inspection is undertaken in the area.</P>

Owing to shortage of staff, I do not like to send down an inspector until all these people have made up their minds, when one inspection can cover all the cases.</P>

In the <Col N="1145" /> Castlegregory area, 23 houses were vacated by migrants and the county council requested the Land Commission to let them to labourers.  Four of these houses were unfit for human habitation, 11 were required for Land Commission purposes and seven were let to labourers.  A plot of two roods on which the remaining house stands, was offered to the county council as a building site but they refused to accept it.  It was then allotted to a local doctor as a site for a dwelling-house and dispensary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that considerable quantities of Dutch tomatoes have been recently imported.  It is, however, my policy to ensure that tomatoes shall be available to all sections of the community at reasonable prices.  In the circumstances, it is not my intention to impose any restrictions, other than the duty at the rate of 2d. per lb., on the importation of Dutch tomatoes until <Col N="1148" /> such times as I am fully convinced that, home producers are unable to dispose of their crops economically.  Judging from the prices at which home-grown tomatoes are being retailed this point is as yet far from being reached.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that, while home-grown tomatoes are being retailed at from 1/8 to 2/- a lb., the growers are receiving prices ranging from 6d. to 10d. per lb.?  Does he not agree that this indicates that the people who are doing least of all in the production of what has become an essential food are gaining a great deal more profit from it than the primary producers?  Does he not agree that a price of from 6d. to 10d. per lb. is not an economic price for native growers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy will sympathise with me in my reluctance to enter the jungle of vested interests concerned in the distribution of tomatoes. I understand, however, that the growers did promote a producer-consumer market where they would retail direct to the consumer.  If the tomato growers of North County Dublin are finding themselves unjustly treated by the distributive interests, surely the Deputy will agree with me that their remedy lies in the active prosecution of the consumer-producer market.</P>

      <P>I presume that the Deputy refers to permanent halls.  At the inception of the F.C.A. it was <Col N="1154" /> visualised that 500 halls would be required immediately and that requirements would eventually amount to 1,000 halls.  The question of building permanent halls is in abeyance and for the present over 1,000 rented or rent-free premises are being used in addition to State-owned buildings.</P>
      <P>(a)  The total number of halls required for F.C.A. purposes throughout the country cannot be accurately given owing to fluctuations in the strength of the F.C.A. in the different centres.</P>
      <P>(b)  For the reason stated at (a) it is not possible to state the number of halls it is proposed to build.  Fifty standard Army huts have been allocated to meet F.C.A. requirements in centres where suitable premises are not available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Keyes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the responsible housing authority that the delays are due to the sudden and unprecedented flow of applications for loans under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts.  Delay in disposing of a number of applications has also been caused by the failure of applicants to furnish full information and all necessary legal and other documents with their applications. The position has been under critical examination and every effort will be made to clear the present arrears within a reasonable time and to dispose of future applications promptly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the delay is really due to <Col N="1159" /> the fact that the particular section in the local authority concerned that is dealing with these applications has been under-staffed for a considerable time, and that, despite the fact that the local authority requested the Department on at least 14 occasions within recent months to sanction the employment of additional staff, such sanction has not been forthcoming?  Is it not a fact that for a period of three months the law adviser who deals with this matter under the Dublin County Council had no assistance save that of an inexperienced typist, and that while there was this block about 600 applications had been built up which has created a bottleneck in this very important matter?

They have co-operated in every possible way, with the result that two additional legal appointments may be made to co-operate with the legal adviser of the local authority concerned in order to speed up the work.  I should also point out that the number of claims to be dealt with has had a very considerable bearing on the matter. Over a period of nine years, up to the 31st March, 1940, the sum of £250,000 was loaned out under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act, while during the period of the last nine months applications in respect of loans totalling £720,000 were received, to be administered by the staff of the same authority.  It must be obvious from these figures that the work was bound to get into arrears.  I may say that steps are now being taken to assist the local authority.</P>

      <P>The delay in implementing the rural cottages scheme in Tipperary South Riding area was due to legal difficulties in connection with acquisition of sites under the Tipperary South Riding Compulsory Purchase (Labourers Acts) Order, 1947, which was confirmed by me on the 10th May, 1949, with certain modifications. This Order as confirmed provides for the acquisition of sites for 630 cottages in the county. As house plans have been approved and tenders invited by the council for some of the cottages, there should now be no delay in commencing this scheme.  In regard to giving possession of plots to applicants, I understand from the local authority that no plots will be let until the cottages are erected thereon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon)</NameTxt>
      <P>When the House reported progress on Friday, I was explaining the purpose of the Supplementary Estimate for £1,000,000, which we asked to meet the cost of the project during the remaining part of this financial year.  As the House is aware, under the general powers of the Minister for Agriculture, one part of the project has been embarked upon in eight counties and today 72,000 acres are in hands.  But we anticipate that there will be a very rapid expansion in that acreage so soon as we have power to proceed on the second part of the project, which will permit the Department to undertake work for those who are not in a position to do it for themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I was speaking here on Friday, in explaining the various sub-heads of the Estimate and in referring to the sub-head which makes provision for salaries, wages, etc., I informed the House that, with the exception of the director and deputy director, the bulk of the administrative staff will be in the country and not sequestered in Upper Merrion Street.  In my desire to emphasise that to the House I may have left the House under the impression that that sum relates only to the administrative staff.  Of course, it does not.  It relates in large measure to the anticipated outlay on the employment of men engaged in the work, including those doing manual labour, mechanics, the operators of machinery and others <Col N="1167" /> actually employed.  I think the House will be gratified to know that in the category of mechanics and machine operatives, we are already recruiting men who have been working in Great Britain for the last three or four years and who, in the course of their work in Great Britain, have become familiar with machinery of this character and who have not unnaturally constantly desired to return to work in their own country.  That opportunity is now available.  One has already joined our staff and the applications of others are being considered.</P>
    <P>While that is true, I would like the House to understand this: I have often dwelt on the fact that people who work on the land in this country have hitherto been expected to accept, as in the nature of things generally, that wages earned on the land should be on a lower scale than those normally paid in industrial pursuits.  I have always believed that that arose from the thoroughly bad practice of employing upon the land relatively antediluvian methods and, inasmuch as men were asked on the land to use implements and equipment similar to that in use in their grandfather's day, their output did not permit of a wage commensurate with their skill.  Therefore, although we intend gladly to welcome home skilled workers who had emigrated in the past and who now desire to return home, it is our very clear purpose to train as many as we can of the fellows who come to work at ordinary labour so that, furnished with the competence to use machinery and with the machinery to use, those of them who are working in the rehabilitation of our land will be enabled to earn a wage which bears a fairer relation to the wages normally paid in industrial pursuits than has hitherto been possible for agricultural workers.</P>
    <P>There is provision for the purchase of lime and fertilisers.  Deputies will remember that in both divisions of the scheme provision is made not only for the delivery of these fertilisers upon the land reclaimed but also for the actual spreading of them.  It is intended in every case that the fertilisers will be mechanically spread so that the farmer whose land is being dealt with <Col N="1168" /> need not employ his own labour or the labour of his own men in the very arduous and troublesome work of spreading finely ground fertilisers by hand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>This item only covers the actual spreading of the lime and fertilisers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Lime and fertilisers, £180,000&mdash;that sum makes provision for the treatment in this financial year of 36,000 acres by the spreading of fertilisers. The Deputy will realise that that envisages the rehabilitation of 36,000 acres and the completion of the work on that 36,000 acres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It means that, while you are providing here for purchase and payment, you will deduct from the grants payable to those who are carrying out the operations themselves on their own lands, the cost of the lime and fertilisers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The plan is, as I think I explained when the Bill was before the House, that when the time comes to make the payment of the grant, in the example quoted in the pamphlet, there is a sum of £140 mentioned; where lime and phosphate are required the grant of £140 will be paid to the farmer as to £95 in cash and £45 in the form of lime and phosphate spread upon his land.  Part of it will be paid in cash, part of it in kind.</P>
      <P>In the second part of the scheme, the Estimate for completing the work will include a provision for lime and fertiliser on the same basis.  The calculation of the farmer's liability, which will ultimately be charged upon his land, will be based on the rehabilitation plus such fertilisation as his circumstances may require.  The sum of £260,000 under sub-head F is for the payment of grants to farmers who have done the work themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under sub-head G, advertising and publicity, a sum of £50,000 is provided. The only piece of advertising we have ventured to commit to print to date is the pamphlet which, I think, has been circulated in proof to Deputies and the announcement in the public Press.  I do not doubt that in the initial stages of this project a good <Col N="1169" /> deal of work will be readily forthcoming, but when that first surge of applications has been attended to I do not doubt that there will be a good many people who are still naturally sceptical.  As I cannot subscribe to the view that any part of my function is to compel my employers to do what I think is good for them, I am asking the House to provide me with funds to permit of showing them, through the medium of films, the medium of illustration and the medium of suitable publications, the results of the work which we have done and are doing with a view to encouraging them to do similar work on their own holdings or invite us to do it for them.  I suppose it might be possible to save some of that money if I sought, and the House granted me, powers to burst into any man's holding and do whatever I thought on his land; but I consider that a modest appropriation to finance the persuading of our neighbours procures good value for the community as a whole and preserves what I consider to be a very important characteristic of the public servant: to become a citizen soldier only when the citizen asks him, and we claim no right to come unbidden, no matter how excellent the intention may be.</P>
    <P>Sub-head H provides for accommodation that may be required in a district.  Deputies, I think, will agree with me that one of the most provoking things for country people is not to know where to find a representative of the Department when they go to look for him.  If he is an active and energetic man he will not spend the greater part of every day sitting on his sash in a country town.  However, if there is an office and they cannot find the representative of the Department visiting the town, they can always leave a message for him at the office.  Heretofore, not a few of the officers of local authorities and the Department engaged on advising farmers have found this difficulty, that when they take residential accommodation in a country town they are not there very long before the landlady tells them their room is wanted, because the woman is worn out going <Col N="1170" /> to the door answering calls.  He has been a cause of legitimate embarrassment to the Department and a cause of legitimate complaint.  I suppose, in the busy housewife's life.  So I think there is everything to be said, if people are to have comfortable lodgings in the centre where they work, for providing them with an office which can be accessible without asking the landlady to answer the door every time somebody wants to ask where the Department man is, was or probably will be.</P>
    <P>Sub-head I is that blessed provision that Dáil Éireann sometimes, in its generosity, makes for Departments, a sum for miscellaneous expenses which recognises that no one, however omniscient, can claim the gift of prophecy in matters mundane.  When we are launching a project of this scope, quite frankly, I anticipate that circumstances may arise for which we have not made provision.  We hope, so careful has our preparation been, that such anticipated contingencies will not call for a larger expenditure than £10,000.  If they should, then we must come back, but I hope we shall not have to.  Need I add that if I have overlooked some matter on which Deputies wish to have further information I am unreservedly at their disposal, bearing in mind the pious hope of us all, to do the nation's business with that expedition and promptitude of which we, in the Department of Agriculture, hope to give example in the execution of the land rehabilitation project.</P>

      <P>The first thing that strikes a Deputy and has struck most Deputies on seeing this Supplementary Estimate is that the sum being asked for is a considerable one.  The natural thing to do when presented with a demand such as this is to look down, as the Minister has attempted to do in the course of his remarks, at the items. The striking thing about this Supplementary Estimate is that while it is one for £1,000,000, a little more than a quarter of that sum will go to the farmers.  During our discussions here on the Land Reclamation Bill&mdash;and they were not protracted discussions&mdash; there were two or three questions which I directed to the Minister, not from the point of view of endeavouring to embarrass him or the Government but from points of view that occurred to my mind on which I should like to get an adequate explanation.  The Minister may feel that an explanation has been given.  I must confess that so far I have not got what I would regard as an adequate explanation and I shall cite these points again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told that this is not an employment scheme.  The Minister has assured us that it is not a relief scheme and that while employment will result from the operation of this scheme, that is not what is in his mind and the minds of those who have devised it.  The object, we were told, was the rehabilitation of our land so as to increase its productivity.  Here is the first instalment, £1,000,000 which the Dáil is asked to vote, out of borrowed money, money that will have to be repaid. Surely I am entitled to ask, and the House and the country are entitled to expect, a suitable explanation as to where we are proposing to spend that money that is being borrowed and that must be repaid?  Are we spending it <Col N="1172" /> in the way in which we are likely to secure the only end that the Minister seems to have in mind&mdash;to increase the productivity of our soil?  I have heard, as we all heard only a couple of minutes ago, the Minister describe the farmer down the country who wanted to be assisted in the purchase of lime or fertilisers as a man who wanted to sit on his sash and let somebody else do the job for him.  Surely that is not an adequate explanation of the point made by myself and many other Deputies.  If this is not an employment scheme or a relief scheme, if it is a scheme designed solely to increase the productivity of our soil, then we are entitled to ask ourselves if we are going about that task in the right fashion. If that is the single purpose of the scheme, I am completely unconvinced as to the way in which we are going about it.</P>
    <P>Let us take some of the land that will probably be dealt with under the scheme and let us ask ourselves what that land is like now.  Let us picture for ourselves the work that will have to be undertaken in order to bring it into reasonable condition.  Let us think of the time that must elapse before the owner of the land will be likely to get any reward from the expenditure of money and effort to improve it.  What is the reaction of the farmer, to whom the hope of increased production is held out, to all that?  It may be a wrong reaction, if you like, but there is no use in our telling him that.  He says: &ldquo;Prices are fairly good now; now is the time when it is most important to increase production when the sellers' market is still in existence&rdquo;.  He will further say: &ldquo;You are borrowing money and you are throwing it into the reclamation of land that is marshy, wet, heavy and hard to maintain.  Some years will elapse even after you have spent these considerable sums of money before the owner of the land will get any reward from that expenditure. If you were to give me a quarter of what you are proposing to spend on my marshy, wet, heavy land, in the subsidisation of fertilisers to apply to land that is not just so bad and derelict, within six, eight, nine or <Col N="1173" /> ten months or surely within a year, I would begin to reap the reward&rdquo;. The Minister, of course, will say: &ldquo;The farmer has his land, his stock and his farming operations are paying him.  He has evidence there in abundance that by buying fertilisers and lime and applying it to the land it will give him the necessary reward and that should serve as a sufficient encouragement without any assistance from the State&rdquo;.  But are we aiming at spending this money in order to increase the productivity of our land? If we are aiming at spending this money in order to achieve that end, why should the individual farmer be singled out and be told that he should not require any assistance to achieve that purpose from any Department or the Government?  We all know that fertilisers, basic slag, North African phosphate and all the manures the farmer might desire to purchase have been so far very expensive.  Look at it as farmers will&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not buy much of it myself, but I buy some.  I am in a different position from most farmers in the sense that I am a public man and a former Minister.  I could take chances and risks that the ordinary farmer could not take, and I could get credit that the ordinary farmer could not get, so there is no use in my flapping my wings or talking about what I could do myself or the profits that accrued as a result of my treating my land in any particular fashion. That is no use to the farmer who by his own single solid effort has to make a living for himself and his family out of his land.  He will not be impressed by my giving lectures.  Take 15 or 20 farmers from the part of the country I know best and exclude all questions of politics.  Say to them: &ldquo;There is £1,000,000 that we are going to borrow. We are going to borrow a much larger sum than that, not in your name only but in the name of the community.  How would you have it spent in order to achieve the purpose announced by the Minister, increasing the productivity of the soil and the <Col N="1174" /> income of those who work it as owners or employees?&rdquo;  From whatever section of the community I draft that 15, 20 or 100 farmers.  I have no hesitation in saying that their decision by a very clear majority would be that this sum of money should be spent in a different fashion from that which has been outlined here.  As I think we have made clear already in the course of the discussion here on the Bill which is now before the Seanad, I do not wish to convey that this is not a very desirable kind of work in which to engage.  Far from it.  But I have some personal experience of doing work like this over a period of years and I know as a result of that experience that when you spend money on this type of land it is terribly expensive land to maintain and keep in proper condition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I maintain that when you have spent a great deal of money on the reclamation of land that is subject to water logging and requires a substantial amount of drainage, that land requires almost constant attention if its new condition is to be maintained. As wages are going up and there are labour difficulties of one kind or another it is not the sort of land from which farmers are likely to reap the reward in the future that will enable them to live.  I would encourage the sort of work that is envisaged under this scheme, but at the same time if I had surplus money to spend on my own land I would not spend my money on the four, five, six, seven or ten derelict acres&mdash;or even if they are not derelict, acres that could be improved by drainage&mdash;while I could spend it on another portion of my land from which I could get a much richer reward by treating it in the way to which I have referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>So the Deputy thinks that this scheme had better not be proceeded with at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy thinks nothing of the kind.  We had schemes <Col N="1175" /> not, as the Minister has told me, so comprehensive, but schemes that were not paid for out of borrowed money. The schemes that were in operation down the years were paid for out of taxation.  It is all right for people to talk about comprehensive schemes, but the Minister himself would have a fair idea of the type of individual who if he could borrow money freely&mdash;I am not referring to any particular class in the community&mdash;could put before you the most magnificent ideas.  I often saw that same individual, however, when it came to repaying the loan and he would not be so full of ideas or enthusiasm nor would he have the same respect for punctuality as he would at an earlier stage have given the impression of having.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Minister may meet this criticism by saying, I suppose legitimately, that the organisation is being built up and you want staffs, offices, machinery and equipment, the lurking feeling is undoubtedly in the minds of the people of the country&mdash;and Deputies on all sides of the House know it &mdash;that we are preparing to spend borrowed money lavishly, to a great extent on the purchase of machinery from outside.  They feel that, having borrowed this money and purchased this machinery, we are putting it to work on land which is not likely to give a return for many years while at the same time neglecting land from which we could get a far more immediate return if we were to use some of the funds we are asked for here for another purpose.  I do not want to prolong this discussion in any way, but I have some sympathy with the point of view which has been expressed by Deputies who are not members of this Party.  It is my own point of view. I have no notion that we should use these funds for the purpose of giving farmers artificial fertilisers or ground limestone free upon their land.  I would not be associated with any such proposition, but I will say here&mdash;and I am saying it honestly&mdash;that if the Government has now arranged to commit us to the extent of £40,000,000 and if that £40,000,000 is going to be spent in the manner described so far by the Minister for Agriculture in this House <Col N="1176" /> and outside, then I say that we are proceeding along the wrong lines.  With such a vast sum of money at our disposal we could go ahead with the work envisaged here and at the same time give substantial subsidies&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>A substantial reduction in price.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister asked me on a previous occasion what I had in mind with regard to subsidies.  It all depends on what the prevailing price is.  If the price of basic slag was £12 a ton last year I would make the subsidy much larger than if it were available for £6.  There is no use in quibbling about what a Deputy has in his mind about the extent of a subsidy. I might say that if North African phosphate was available at about £8 a ton last year&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <P>This was long before the war and times were different from what they are now, I admit, but if I were to sit down with a number of people, I would not have any difficulty in agreeing with them on what the extent of the subsidy should be, without unduly taxing the Government.  A subsidy of £1 or £2, in circumstances where that subsidy would be paid out of taxation, would look a very formidable matter, but where we have the Minister and the Government talking in terms of borrowing £40,000,000, it conveys to the man outside the impression that money can be lashed around without any difficulty.  No matter how you may lecture him or preach at him, he says: &ldquo;I have 50 acres of land, none of which needs any drainage, but it does need lime and phosphates.  I am not <Col N="1177" /> to get any assistance at all.  The Minister talks of spending £40,000,000 to increase the productivity of the soil and the national income, so far as agriculture is concerned, and I am not to get a `bob' by way of encouragement or inducement to proceed along a certain line.&rdquo;  That is a line of reasoning, especially in the atmosphere associated with this scheme, that any man can understand.</P>

I do not know if I have made this statement, but if I were here with the responsibility of the Minister for Agriculture and if the Government of which I was a member arranged to borrow £40,000,000 for the purpose of increasing the productivity of the soil and the income of our farmers and of the nation, I would not be associated with or take responsibility for spending that money unless I were given some freedom to spend at least some of it in the fashion I have described.  I would insist upon earmarking some portion of the money for immediate spending in that direction, so that we might not have to wait five, seven or ten years for this increased production about which we hear so much but could see no evidence of in ten or 12 months' time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>If a sum of money of this size is to be flung around loosely and to be spent in the fashion described here, I say that a very substantial portion of it should be used as I suggest. We cannot do more than express our opinions upon these matters, but I say that the opinions I have expressed are opinions which, if political considerations can be excluded, will be found <Col N="1178" /> to be held in the ranks of members of all Parties who have any associations with rural Ireland, and especially when they find on examining this Supplementary Estimate for £1,000,000 of borrowed money that £250,000 of it&mdash; one-quarter of it&mdash;will go to land reclamation and the remaining threequarters on general expenses.</P>

While I was amazed, I am prepared to excuse the Minister for his action, but I cannot excuse him for his attempt to misrepresent and distort the terms of my motion.  There is no question whatever in the motion tabled by Deputy O'Reilly and me of supplying free lime or free fertilisers to anyone, and the Minister knows that.  The motion definitely states that the scheme should be extended to provide for the improvement of land by assisting the owner of such land to apply fertilisers or lime where a soil analysis shows a serious deficiency.</P>

      <P>There is no question in the motion of supplying subsidised fertilisers to all farmers, but there is a very definite question of supplying subsidised fertilisers to farmers whose land, on a soil analysis, shows itself seriously deficient.  The Minister can understand that.  He asks what is meant by assistance.  I mean that the same assistance should be provided for the supplying of lime and fertilisers as is provided already in the scheme for drainage and the clearing of rock and furze off land, that is to say, the State would contribute portion of the cost and, under the legislation going through, would provide credit facilities, if such credit facilities were found necessary or desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Credit facilities, as the Minister knows perfectly well and as I have told him on a thousand different occasions and in a thousand different <Col N="1179" /> places, are not readily available.  I have seen working farmers turned back again and again by merchants when they asked for more than the usual allowance of fertilisers required for their land.  The average farmer, if he has not got the money, goes into the shop and asks for a quantity of fertiliser.  The merchant usually gives him what he thinks the farmer will be able to repay in the course of the year, and how much credit he will give is left to the decision of the merchant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It has, but the terms are repayment at the end of 12 months.  My purpose in speaking is again to urge the Minister to apply this scheme to the land which most urgently needs reclamation.  Remember that reclamation of land includes the improvement of impoverished soils which are deficient in lime and phosphates, and there are millions of acres of such land.  If the Minister travels the country roads he will see land producing meadows only a few inches high, meadows which are hardly worth cutting, and he will see pastures carrying only one or two sheep per acre.  That is not all land in elevated positions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am including it, but if the proposal of the Minister now is to provide assistance in regard to lime and phosphates for what he calls hill-grazing and to provide credit facilities for that type of land, he must bear in mind that there may be poor land on the plains which requires similar assistance.  Surely the test should be not whether the land is of a certain altitude but whether, on a soil analysis&mdash;I think it is a surer test&mdash;it shows a deficiency of lime and phosphates. Until the Minister is prepared to accept the condition that if land is below a certain standard of fertility he will assist the owner to bring that land up to the standard necessary to produce adequate crops, the scheme will not be adequate.  In the meantime, my motion is before the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>If the farmer makes application for assistance under this scheme an inspector or inspectors will duly visit his land.  Soil tests will be taken of the land which requires to be improved.  On those soil tests the Minister's Department estimates that a certain amount of lime and a certain amount of phosphates will be required to bring the land in question up to a reasonably normal state of productivity. Just as in the case of the scheme for the removal of surplus water so, in the case of the scheme for the application of lime and phosphates, the State will contribute portion of the cost of supplying lime and phosphates and, if necessary, the farmer can have his portion of the <Col N="1181" /> cost spread over a number of years as in the case of drainage and other reclamation work.  That is my explanation of the position and I think the Minister must realise that it is reasonable. I do not think it is realised&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a question of bringing derelict land up to a reasonable state of productivity&mdash;just the same as the State assists the farmer to drain his land.  In the past, before the State ever assisted farmers by way of the farm improvements scheme and other schemes, there were farmers who drained their own land and who paid 100 per cent.  of the cost.  But the majority of the farmers were unable to do that.  Hence, the State had to come to their assistance.  In the same way, the State should come to the assistance of the farmer whose land is reasonably deficient in lime and phosphates. That is my proposition.  I hope the Minister will seriously consider it and not brush it aside by distorting or misrepresenting it, as he did to-day and as he did before.</P>

      <P>Let us get this point clear.  Two-thirds of the cost by way of free grant and one-third by way of loan, repayable over 60 years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, if necessary.  The necessity for this scheme will be recognised when we consider the amount of fertiliser that is applied to the land of this country.  It is generally recognised that agricultural land requires about a quarter ton of fertilisers per acre and most land deficient in lime <Col N="1182" /> requires up to one ton of burned lime and two tons of ground limestone.  If we were able to apply one quarter ton of fertiliser to every acre of this country 3,000,000 tons of fertilisers would be required annually in respect of the entire agricultural land of this country.  How much fertiliser was applied to the land of this country over the past 20 years?  I think the answer is somewhere in the region of 250,000 tons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not appalling?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an appalling condition and it is due to no other reason than lack of capital.  The Minister must realise that.  If he cannot see what is plain to the eye of everybody else in this country, somebody must open his eyes in regard to the matter. It is not a question of the farmer not recognising the value of fertilisers.  I live and I have lived amongst farmers and I know that every farmer recognises the value of fertilisers.  The trouble is that the farmer has not the capital to put into his land each year&mdash;capital which, so spent, would give a good return.  Therefore, assistance must be given.  To bear out what I suggest, let me say that I was one of a deputation of farmers who met the American representative in respect of Marshall Aid in this country, Mr. Carrigan.  We found him a perfect gentleman and he was ready to meet us and consider the question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from the failure to extend the scheme to the type of land that most urgently needs it, the first thing that strikes one and rather terrifies one in considering this scheme is the enormous percentage of the money voted that will be spent on administrative expenses.  I do not quite agree with Deputy Smith when he says that only £260,000 will go to the farmer.  As far as I can calculate, only £440,000 will go to the farmer &mdash;the balance will be eaten up by salaries, travelling expenses, machinery, offices and publicity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister has included the wages of men actually working on the scheme &mdash; if he has added those to the salaries of his inspectors&mdash;it is not possible for a Deputy to distinguish between the two.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I told the Deputy what the distinction was&mdash;£120,000 was the estimate for labour.</P>

    <Col N="1184" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Which would leave nearly £90,000 for salaries.  That is a substantial amount.  Then we have £20,000 in respect of travelling expenses. We also have £50,000 for advertising and publicity which appears to be an excessively high percentage.  Then there are offices and so forth.  If the Minister wishes to cut down on expenses in connection with this scheme I think he might give attention to the following case.  A farmer from County Wicklow applied for help under this scheme and within a week three young inspectors arrived at his premises.  They inspected his land and gave a favourable report. They gave an estimate of the cost of draining his land and what the State's contribution would be.  They went away leaving the farmer perfectly satisfied&mdash;these three young, sprightly, optimistic inspectors.  But a week later three older, more sober-spoken, more conservative inspectors arrived on the same farm and they told the farmer that the work of reclamation on his farm could not be undertaken until the bed of the adjoining river was lowered&mdash;a perfectly reasonable thing to suggest&mdash;and they also suggested that this farmer should get in touch with the three T.D.s for his constituency and get representations made to the Office of Public Works to have the bed of the river lowered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The first question one has got to ask is: is it necessary to send the inspectors of the Department round in triplicate?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister can inquire into it to the fullest extent and I shall give him all the particulars at my disposal. I hold that that is not a <Col N="1185" /> proper way to carry out the scheme economically.  The fact of the matter is that the particular river which was referred to is part of the county council's drainage scheme already and work on this river will, I hope, be undertaken in the very near future. There was no need to call in the three T.D.s for the constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have to be very careful in a scheme of this kind not to allow the whole of the £1,000,000 that is voted to be eaten up in a considerable amount of overlapping and fumbling.  It must be carried out efficiently.  There is still a certain amount of confusion in people's minds regarding the scope of the scheme, particularly with regard to the reference the Minister made to-day to the improvement of hill lands.  Farmers generally are not aware of what the Minister proposes to do for hill lands. I think it is not explained in the Minister's circular and it is not explained in the Bill, nor was it explained very fully in any discussion that took place on the Bill here.  I assumed that the improvement of hill grazing meant that, where hill land was overgrown with furze or where it was impossible to cultivate by reason of rocks or stones, the land would be cleared and the cost would be provided for in the scheme just the same as for drainage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It means much more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why I would be very anxious to find out the full terms of the scheme regarding mountain land. With regard to ordinary land which does not come into the rather vague category of hill land and which does not come into the category of water-logged wet land, will the Minister now consider doing something about it?  Surely, there are millions of acres of such land in the Country?  I have travelled over it in County Wicklow&mdash;land which is not giving the grass it should give, the crops it should give, and which could be brought easily into full production.  It would cost some money to do that.  A merchant with whom I discussed this matter&mdash;and merchants really are the only people <Col N="1186" /> who have ample cash to invest in the improvement of land&mdash;and who had purchased some of this land, told me that, after experiment, he found it cost him about £12 an acre to bring it into a reasonable state of production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would I not be well employed bringing that merchant's purchase into reasonable production?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no need to do that.  Arrangements could be made to meet a difficulty of this kind.  The Minister knows that there is very little of the type of land to which I refer in the hands of merchants.  Most of the land is owned by farmers.  The Minister must recognise that.  Most of the farmers are not well-to-do men and have not surplus cash to invest as capital.  Just as in the case of drainage, that land, if we are to get the full benefit from it in the interests of the nation, requires to be improved.  I think no reasonable case can be made or will be made by the Minister against providing assistance for the improvement of such land.</P>
      <P>A small matter which has caused some confusion in farmers' minds is the case of the farmer who hands over the work to the Department to do.  He is directed to pay £12 per acre, regardless of the amount of work that requires to be done per acre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No, no.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter upon which a full explanation would be desirable.  I know certain land where there is a quantity of rock and stone that needs to be removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Two-fifths of the cost, with an overriding maximum of £12.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is satisfactory, but it would be well if it were explained. I hope the Minister now will meet the suggestion in regard to lime and fertilisers in a reasonable way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a few questions to ask.  The item, salaries, wages and allowances, the Minister has explained, covers presumably wages of those employed by the Department on the scheme.  I would like him to give the House some further information as to how the Department expect to proceed <Col N="1187" /> when they are doing the work themselves.  Is it proposed to have contractors employed full-time?</P>
      <P>In connection with the applications under grants for machinery, I presume there will be a limit to the number of persons who will, in the Department's view, be qualified to receive these grants, and I would suggest that those who already have some experience in the business should get preference.</P>
      <P>I cannot see why the Minister resents so much that Deputy Cogan should press for more provision for lime and fertilisers.  As Deputy Smith has said, if such large sums of money are being provided in connection with the E.C.A. plan, we must assume that the primary object of the expenditure of that money upon agricultural production here is to secure the largest output of food in the shortest possible space of time.  If the Minister for Finance is satisfied, having regard to the repayment obligations he must meet, that the money will be well expended and will afford such increased production as to justify him in expecting that repayment of the advances can be met out of such increase, and if it is considered that from the economic and financial point of view the measures the Minister for Agriculture has outlined are satisfactory, I cannot see why other measures which might be equally desirable from the point of view of increasing agricultural production in a large way and in a comparatively short space of time should not be worthy of consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture has repeatedly stated that this is a long-term project.  I notice that in a recent speech he referred to the question of arterial drainage and the outflow of rivers and expressed the view that arterial drainage and ancillary problems are closely connected with the whole project of land rehabilitation. If it is good business to rehabilitate marginal land which, as everyone knows, may furnish a profit only during a limited period when food is scarce in the world, as it is at present, and when prices are comparatively high, I fail to understand why it should be considered heresy to suggest that a <Col N="1188" /> proportion of these funds might be made available in whatever way is considered suitable to enable farmers who cannot take advantage of the reclamation scheme to put capital into their land.</P>
    <P>This is a country of small farmers. We have not been carrying on farming on the Danish system.  An education official from this country visited the folk schools in Denmark and was reminded by the principals at Elsinore that the Danes-had a peasant proprietorship long before we achieved it, and that during the whole period when we were busily occupied with political and agrarian issues of a rather active character and political agitation, the Danes had been concentrating on economic questions.  We know that they got into the milk business on a fairly big scale as far back as the '70's. We know also that it is part of their system to mortgage their farms to a very large extent to raise capital and that the big feature of Danish agriculture before the war was the very heavy capital expenditure on feeding stuffs, farm equipment and the modernisation of buildings.  That has not been the case here.  Our farmers are a rather conservative class and, as Deputy Cogan pointed out, their resources are limited.  There has grown up in Denmark a co-operative organisation which is very like the joint stock organisation in other countries and which is a very efficient distributing and selling organisation, whereas we have been in a large degree carrying on what would be described as subsistence farming, which, perhaps, is inevitable when the great bulk of the farms are as small as they are here.  It seems to me that if we are going to utilise the very large sums of money that the Minister has mentioned for the rehabilitation of land the distinction the Minister makes between land which is suitable for reclamation and land which is of a marginal character, not having been arable up to the present, is rather arbitrary, if the general policy is to increase agricultural production over the entire country and greatly to increase the volume of exports.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy flatters his <Col N="1189" /> colleagues.  Subsistence farming is general after 16 years of his colleagues' exertions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not be put off by these phrases of the Minister.  The important fact is that we are to expend, according to the Minister, £40,000,000.  We are responsible for the repayment of the sums and it is absolutely childish and petty of the Minister to take up the attitude that we are not entitled to discuss this matter.  I think it is absolutely ridiculous for the Minister to take up the attitude that somebody is obstructing.  Are we just to sit silent in out places and ask no questions as to how this money is to be spent?  If the Minister tries to get away with that policy we will meet him anywhere he likes in this country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>That commission, in their majority report, recommended that a subsidy should be granted over a ten-year period of 25 per cent. of the cost of fertilisers and phosphates and 33? per cent. of the cost of ground limestone.  These gentlemen had a good knowledge of Irish agriculture.  Some of them were brought up on the farms of this country and those who were not, if there were any, certainly were in very close touch with Irish agricultural conditions.  That was a recommendation made to the Government before there was any Marshall Plan, that the Government, out of money provided by the taxpayer, should grant a subsidy, seeing that the prices of fertilisers obviously would be out of all proportion to what the small farmers had been accustomed to, so as to encourage them to use the very large quantities of fertilisers that were necessary to bring the land back to its natural condition of fertility.  It was pointed out in the report that even in pre-war years&mdash;and the New Zealand expert has repeated the observation&mdash; the consumption of fertilisers was very low compared with the consumption in countries like Denmark and other competitors in the British market.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of the method in which the scheme will operate, perhaps the Minister would say how exactly farmers who wish to have land cleaned of rocks are to proceed. What procedure does he envisage when a farmer wants that to be done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy mean how he would proceed to make his application?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, what would be the procedure.  I can see that in the beginning, while the scheme is getting into operation, there will be a good deal of overlapping perhaps.  But I think that our experience of the farm improvements staff in the past is that they have shown that they understand intimately the farmers' conditions.  As I stated in this House before, if they have not already established themselves <Col N="1191" /> in the confidence of all the farming community, they have done it in many cases.  It is only a matter of time, I think, if they proceed on the same lines and the same understanding, until they receive the general support, confidence and co-operation of the farmers, which are necessary.</P>
      <P>I believe that the Minister is doing good work in getting the young farmers' clubs interested in this matter. Both the majority and minority reports of the agricultural commission stated that education was the foundation for progress in agriculture as well as in every other respect.  I have pointed out what the British laid before themselves as their aim, that increased technical efficiency is a very important consideration.  When the Minister has got that land reclaimed and brought up to a pitch that it can be used to produce food with profit to the nation and to the owners, there will be the problem of getting the young farming population to keep up that position and improve it in the years to come.  I would not go so far as to agree with Deputy Cogan, but I think he may have been right when he recommended that there should have been a number of demonstration farms.  I certainly would go so far as to say that nothing could be more valuable than that farmers could be brought to a number of places, shown this machinery in operation, shown what can be done in the way of removal of scrub and rocks and whatever other cleaning operations are in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy consider the use of film shows for that purpose?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe more in practical work.  As the young farmers themselves have stated, farmers are rather shy of going to technical schools. We know that they are not too accustomed to dealing with machinery in this country, although the younger men may have some knowledge of it.  One of the things mentioned in the report on economic co-operation issued by the Government is that the number of tractors in use is relatively low in this country compared with Great Britain, <Col N="1192" /> for example.  However that may be, I simply want to say that, in spite of the admirable work which is being done in many respects, young farmers, any more than old farmers, have not that knowledge of these mechanical operations that they have in other countries. Not alone would we be giving them that knowledge, but we would also be showing them how these reclamation schemes work in practice and the value of them.</P>
      <P>Farmers are very often shy in coming forward and explaining their difficulties. They are rather daunted if they feel that the officials they have to deal with are altogether more expert in these matters than they are.  I believe strongly that the more demonstrations on their own lands that you can have to encourage farmers to take advantage of the scheme the better.  I believe that the Minister should re-examine the question, if it is not possible to make any adjustment in the scheme which he has put before the House, whether it would not be worth while to reconsider the plea which has been made so that farmers who are not in a position to take advantage of reclamation and who wistfully say to one down the country: &ldquo;I am afraid it is going to be no use to me because I have not land of that character; it does not happen that the scheme will suit me&rdquo;, could be brought into it and have the feeling that it was benefiting them.</P>

      <P>So far as the scheme is concerned, I think the idea behind it is a good one.  I take it that it is much on the lines of the field drainage scheme carried out in Galway and Mayo last year.  Judging by the outline which the Minister has furnished to each of us, it is, apparently, on the lines of the field drainage scheme to a very large extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That was all done by manual labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that it was done by manual labour.  At the same time, the outline so far as the outfall, the main drain, the box drain and the minor drains are concerned is much on the same lines.  There are a great many places in the country where perhaps <Col N="1193" /> a great deal of it will have to be done by manual labour.  I understood the Minister to say once or twice that farmers are to get up to a maximum of £20 per statute acre if they carry out the scheme.  In this it is stated that for nine acres the free grant will amount to £140.  That would be something short of the £20 per statute acre which the Minister mentioned at first.  I imagine it would be almost £5 per statute acre short of what he mentioned in his opening statement in the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>That was elicited in the course of the debate on the Second Reading and I think on the Committee Stage by Deputies on this side of the House and also by Deputy Lehane.  I think he brought out that point fairly clearly.  Nevertheless, there is a difference, but I am not making any point of that.  There is one item in this Supplementary Estimate which I question&mdash;I do not question the amount being included in the Estimate, but the purpose for which it is to be used&mdash;and which was mentioned by Deputy Derrig at the end of his speech&mdash;that is the £50,000 for advertising.  That is at the rate of almost £2,000 per county.  I think the proper way to advertise a scheme of this kind is by not confining it at the outset to eight counties.  Perhaps the Minister can give good reasons for that.  At the same time, I think that every county should be taken into consideration and that the best way to advertise it is to have the scheme carried out in every one of the Twenty-Six Counties.  That would be a better form of advertising than any publicity <Col N="1194" /> given in newspapers or by way of films or anything of that kind, because that is a real demonstration of the type of work that is being carried out. I would ask the Minister to consider that, because I believe he would get, at least, five schemes carried out in every county to demonstrate the work for even less than the £50,000 that is set out here for advertising.</P>
      <P>I think everyone, no matter on what side of the House he sits, will be in agreement with the point that was raised by Deputy Smith&mdash;I fail to understand why the Minister should not agree with it&mdash;namely, that it is unfair that people whose land is of fairly high quality at the moment cannot avail of, or derive any advantage from the scheme.  I think that if even one-eighth of the £40,000,000 which it is proposed to spend, were set aside for those people it would be a great incentive, a great help to them if given by way of a subsidy for the purchase of fertilisers and lime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, this scheme and this legislation follow much the same lines as every other type of legislation that I have known to be passed through this House since this State was founded.  I suppose the position is much the same in every other country, namely, that thrifty people in many instances are to be penalised, and that thriftless people are to be compensated.  To a large extent, it logically boils down to that.  I do not want the Minister to hand over all the money to the people I speak of, but I believe that those who care their land and who put their labour and sweat into it in the past, and in many instances brought it to a high standard of fertility, should not be excluded from a scheme of this kind.  If you take land at the present time, and go by Griffith's valuation of 100 years ago, you will find that a great deal of the land to which this scheme will apply was the most highly valued land in the country at that time, while on the other hand you will find that the land, which is now in a high state of fertility, was at that time land with a very low valuation. That shows that there was a <Col N="1195" /> lot of labour put into that land to bring it to its present high state of fertility. That is the reason why the Minister can afford, although I do not think he should do so, to by-pass those people who have land of that kind and who, by their labour, brought it to a good state of fertility.  I think they are entitled to come within the provisions of this scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>It may require lime and fertilisers.  If the owners have that land analysed it may appear to be very fine grass land, or it may be very good land for growing certain crops, but not so good for the growing of other crops. If an analysis is made of the soil it may be found that certain elements are deficient in it.  I hold that the owners of such land are entitled to equal consideration with the people who are being provided for under this scheme.  I think the Minister should take that into account.  If land of the kind I speak of is included under the scheme it will give a quicker and a speedier return for the money that is expended on it.</P>
      <P>I want to impress on the Minister that the field drainage scheme carried out in the Counties of Galway and Mayo was an excellent one in 80 per cent. of the cases as far as the beneficiaries are concerned.  I want to make this point, however, that there were a number of cases where drainage was carried out to such an extent that the land on which the work was undertaken is not much better now, because as a result it is now too dry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I made that point last year, and I can tell the Minister that a number of his officials were not pleased that I did so.  There is land that requires drains nine yards apart or, perhaps, seven yards apart, but <Col N="1196" /> you also have land that would do with drains 20 yards apart, land which in three years would be dried out sufficiently. As regards some of the land on which drainage work was carried out last year, it is already too dry.</P>

      <P>I know very well that it will not be arable land and that it will not produce crops.  In fact, the grass and the crops on it are even worse than if drainage work had never been carried out on it.  A good deal of care has to be taken in the carrying out of these schemes.  I want to say again that I disagree with the spending of £50,000 on advertising, whether it be by means of films or through the newspapers.  I believe that the proper type of advertising for a scheme of this kind is by having practical demonstrations carried out in all the counties as nearly as possible at the same time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say a few words on this Supplementary Estimate. After all, this matter was very fully discussed when the Minister introduced his Bill.  The Deputies opposite have devoted a great deal of time and attention to the question as to why the Minister was not applying this scheme to farmers who are in the happy position of having their land in a good state of fertility.  The reason, of course, is that here the Minister is dealing with a land reclamation measure.  If at any time the Minister finds it necessary to introduce a Bill to supply lime and fertilisers to all farmers he will do so, but the two things are not to be mixed up.  One would imagine, listening to the Deputies opposite, that lime and fertilisers had never been given to the farmers, and that the latter were so poor that they could not afford to get fertilisers for their land, or, again, that farmers are so jealous-minded that, because they happen to be in the happy position of having been blessed by nature with good land, they resent the fact that the Minister is doing something to improve the land of less fortunate neighbours whose land is not of good quality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That reminds me of the man who has enjoyed such good health during his <Col N="1197" /> lifetime that he has always been able to draw his full week's wages, and feels that he has a grievance when he reaches the age of 70 because he never drew national health insurance benefit, instead of being thankful that during his working life he enjoyed such good health he was able to draw a full week's wages.  He was so jealous-minded that he would seem to prefer taking a few pounds out of the insurance fund during the years he was working.  That is a very small way to approach the very worthy object which the Minister has in view.  His object is to restore to good condition land which at the moment is in a low state of fertility and is not producing all that it could produce.  The Minister is going to reclaim land to the extent of 3,000,000 or 4,000,000 acres.  The estimated cost is £40,000,000 which is to be spread over a period of ten years. The Minister cannot spend £40,000,000 overnight.  It will take time and patience to do that.  I suggest to Deputies opposite that they would be doing much better work for their constituents and the farming community in general if they allow this measure to get on its way.  After a few months, when officials and farmers get accustomed to its operation, things will work smoothly and there will not be the terrible difficulties visualised by Deputies on the opposite benches.</P>
    <P>Let me remind Deputies that this is a Land Reclamation Bill and there is no purpose served by trying to confuse the issue so far as the supply of lime and fertilisers is concerned.  I know that Fianna Fáil Deputies would be the first to resent it if it were suggested, by innuendo or implication, during the 16 years when their Party formed the Government, that the farmers were not able to buy lime or fertilisers.  I have heard Fianna Fáil Deputies often saying that the farmers were rolling in wealth.  It is there in black and white.  I do not think Deputy Cogan is complimenting Irish farmers when he suggests that there is no farmer able to buy lime or to fertilise his own land.  With all respect to Deputy Cogan, I do not believe that, and I know as many farmers as the next.  When I speak of farmers I mean good, honest hardworking <Col N="1198" /> farmers.  I never knew a good industrious farmer who was at any time refused credit when he asked for it. That is my answer to Deputy Cogan and to any other Deputies who have tried to hold up farmers as a set of paupers, as men who have no initiative and who cannot get a &ldquo;bob&rdquo; on their word.  So far as I am aware, any industrious farmer will get all he wants.  Since this is really a Land Reclamation Bill, Deputies should not confuse it by references to supplies of lime and fertilisers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to add my voice to what has been suggested by my colleagues here and by Deputies on other sides of the House&mdash;that the Minister should reconsider his attitude as regards the provision of some of the money at his disposal.  I think he should consider providing some of it for the purpose of cheapening the price of ground limestone and artificial manure.  This is a matter of considerable importance.  The Minister has given no explanation to satisfy any member of the House why he could not do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What does the Deputy suggest?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that the Minister should bring down, by way of subsidy&mdash;there is no other way of doing it&mdash;the price of artificial manure and lime, and bring it down considerably. I stand over that.  The Minister, if he is a wise man, will use a good portion of this money in doing that, and he will serve the interests of the farmers better than in the way he is proposing in this Estimate.  I make that suggestion in all seriousness.  It has been said frequently by the Minister that all land does not need to be drained or improved.  I would like to point out that there are millions of acres of poor, light land that have given crops from year to year and have done so for the last century, and I suggest that that land needs both lime and superphosphate, and a considerable amount of both.  The owners of that land are not wealthy people; they are poor, struggling farmers, as Deputy Cogan said, who, with their families, barely exist.  The Minister will not be called <Col N="1199" /> upon, under this scheme, to do anything on these farms, on these millions of acres of poor land.</P>
      <P>This scheme will apply to fewer farmers than the farm improvements scheme that has been in operation for a good number of years.  If a farmer does not need to have any land drained, to have hilly land cleaned or fences taken down, this scheme will not apply to him on the outline the Minister has given.  The Minister may jeer or smile at what I am saying.  He can tell the farmer that he is sitting on his sash, or say that 95 per cent. of the farmers do not understand or cannot pronounce the word rehabilitation.</P>
      <P>The fact remains, however, that this scheme will apply only to a small number of farmers.  That number will not be very great out of the total number of landholders.  There will still be millions of acres than can do with much more lime and much more phosphate than the landowners will be able to provide.  That is something the Minister should keep seriously in mind.  If he has at his disposal a pool of £40,000,000, and if he will spend £10,000,000 or £15,000,000 in giving cheaper lime and artificial manure to all farmers, the return to the nation will be ten times greater than if he spent the whole £40,000,000 on the bogs and the hills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Beegan mentioned the £50,000 for advertising.  There is no need for the Minister to spend any money on advertising.  If it is a good scheme, this scheme will advertise itself and the Minister can save the £50,000 for use in some other way. Demonstrations by the Minister's machinery through his officers in the country will advertise this scheme.  It does not require one &ldquo;bob&rdquo; on advertising. Some weeks ago the Minister met representatives of the provincial Press.  I wonder if this is as a result of that meeting?  I am sorry the Minister thinks it is necessary to spend £50,000 on advertising.  There will be little use in having a film showing a man how to use a spade and shovel. That will not make a man use a spade or shovel.  All the films the Minister could show will not make a lazy man <Col N="1200" /> work&mdash;if there is such in the country. When the work is proceeding and when the farmers observe that it is going ahead, they will take advantage of the scheme if they think it will be for their benefit.  In these circumstances it is absolutely unnecessary to spend money on advertising.</P>
    <P>There is another item here providing £15,000 for district offices and stores. Recently I heard a story about these offices where the Minister's satellites down the country wanted offices in a particular provincial town and they thought well of going to a landlord in that town, who had offices already let, and offering him 120 per cent. of an increase in the rent if that landlord would evict the existing tenants and give them the offices.  That is not good enough.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Minister to tell us what his estimate of the wages is under sub-head A.  There is £210,000 provided for salaries, wages and allowances.  Is provision made under this for wages paid for the actual doing of the work?  What is the estimate as to the number of manhours or days, or the number of men who may be engaged on the work and paid out of this £210,000 during the period over which it will be spent? There will probably be salaries for inspectors and so on.  What proportion will be paid in wages to the ordinary workmen?  The House would like to have that figure.</P>
      <P>There is provision for travelling expenses at the rate of £10,000.  I suppose the people will not be able to get around without travelling. Machinery and implements are estimated to cost £200,000.  I had not the advantage of being here when the Minister made his opening statement on that.  Has any of that machinery been purchased?  Will it be purchased in the dollar area or the sterling area? The House should have that information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one thing certain in relation to this Estimate and that is that the farmers will get the smallest amount of that £1,000,000.  Is there any possibility that this machinery will have to be replaced?  The Minister must bear in mind that depreciation of such machinery can be as high as 30 per cent.  The life of such machinery is very short and that £200,000, I suppose, will have to be respent in a very <Col N="1203" /> short time.  This machinery will not last very long.  Both sides of the House hope that this scheme will be a success.</P>

      <P>Both sides hope that it will reach the success the Minister hopes and serve the country's needs to the extent the Minister has in mind. Everyone hopes that.  This £40,000,000 must be provided out of Marshall Aid by the Minister for Finance or in some other way.  In order to get a better and quicker return for the expenditure of a portion of that money the Minister should seriously reconsider providing subsidies for ground limestone.  He may tell us that this is spread on the farmers' land at 35/- a ton.  A farmer who has 50 acres of land will need 100 tons and that will cost him almost £200.  The farmer may not have that £200.  In addition, he will need a substantial amount of superphosphate. That will be another £150.  That is more capital than any farmer would have to spend.</P>

      <P>I said he might have 50 acres.  Take any acreage you like.  He may have 50 acres of poor, light, tillage land that needs no rehabilitation of any kind.  It may need ground lime and superphosphate and there are many farmers who would not have the capital to so rehabilitate their land in the shortest possible time.  These farmers are not lazy farmers.  They are hardworking farmers.  They produce a large part of the wealth of the country in tillage, milk, cattle and everything else.  They will not benefit in any way under this scheme.  If they had ground limestone at £1 a ton, instead of 35/- a ton spread, it would be better.  I hope the Minister will give consideration to the views of those people who understand the difficulties. There is no use in the Minister telling me that the manure ring is putting up the price of artificial manures.  There will be no objection <Col N="1204" /> if the Minister seeks to take over the whole lot.</P>

      <P>It is disgusting and degrading.  The only thing I must refer to I do with distaste.  What is more contemptible than the man who is willing to wound but afraid to strike? What is more contemptible than the man who gets up in public and says: &ldquo;So-and-so has done wrong and you are responsible for him, but I will not tell you who he is; I will not tell you where the wrong was done; I will not tell you who was injured, because I do not want to give you the chance of repairing what was wrong.  I want to have it to talk about in fairs and markets.  I want to have it to say that it could not be contradicted, but I will not add that I was too cowardly to give it form, so that it could effectively be challenged&rdquo;. Shame on the creature who strikes from behind and runs.  He should be proud of his valiant assassination of some public servant's character.  He can boast of it when he gets back to County Wexford.  None can daunt him.  He is prepared to face the doughtiest challenge, always provided that he does it in the dark.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cogan spoke of three officers calling on a farmer who made an application.  I thought he was going to say that it took at least a year, but to my gratification they called promptly; they gave an estimate.  I was beginning to glow with satisfaction until the second trio entered.  Up to that point all might be well but when the second trio began to tell the farmer he ought to approach the county T.D.s I confess my optimistic <Col N="1206" /> hopes began to flag.  It is not impossible at this early stage, when we are training staff and trying to establish procedure, that you might have three junior men going just to learn their job and three responsible officers following in their footsteps to ensure that they are giving full satisfaction. We are only a fortnight at it and we are trying to bind ourselves to see that the least experienced member of our staff will not be a reproach to anybody.  There is no other way we can do it, except by sending chaps out with an experienced man and, for superior precaution, going round in a selected number of places and asking farmers, &ldquo;Did the fellows who called on you give you every satisfaction and look after everything?&rdquo;  I do not think I have any apology to make.  On the contrary, that is what I wish them to do because I wish all officers in this project to train in their obligation to have as their primary objective the satisfying of the farmers' requirements.</P>
    <P>That explanation I think is possible, but the Deputy may rest assured that the matter will be closely examined. If that is the explanation, I want to make it clear that far from censuring any officers in connection with this incident I shall commend them, as they have done admirably what I would have them do.  The Deputy is no doubt aware that the matter is one of such a highly specialised character that the Otto Cahn Endowment made large sums available to carry out extensive experiments in the Welsh mountains, which are similar to our Wicklow mountains.  The objection to raising the level of fertility in certain circumstances is that it becomes uneconomic. A variety of factors enter into the matter which render the problem a complicated one, and it must be dealt with in that spirit.  Any attempt to do it absolutely may result in a waste of money and a failure to achieve one's purpose.  The danger is that if you attempt to raise the level of fertility higher than the elevation will permit and attempt to raise stock on it which require a higher degree of fertility to keep them in health, a farmer may incur heavy losses in trying to raise <Col N="1207" /> valuable stock under these circumstances.</P>
    <P>Let us get this clear.  The object of this project is not confined, as Deputy Derrig seems to think, to marginal land in the accepted sense of the term.  We are not seeking to bring back into marginal production, land the operation of which would become uneconomic the moment normal trading returns. What we want to do is to go in on land which we can make arable by carrying out certain mechanical operations, the effective performance of which requires capital equipment that we can never reasonably hope the average individual farmer will be in a position to command.  Unless we do that, we must reconcile ourselves to an unending future in which that land may be regarded as forever derelict. A strong economic argument can be put for the proposition that large areas of the land of this country are not economic, that we can evacuate the population and leave it to the seagulls. There are men who accept the Manchester School of Economics who would argue that very strongly.  I reject that school of economics quite categorically and I say that we are not going to leave the land to the seagulls, economics or no economics.  The Land War was not fought for economics and this project is not being prosecuted for economics.  The Land War was fought to make the lives of our people on their own holdings happy.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this project is to make the lives of our people on their own holdings happy.  What we feel is that if you put land in a state of arability which will result in the man who works on his own holding getting a fair living, he may never expect to get rich or to accumulate great wealth on the land of Ireland, but he will be able to raise a decent family decently.  That is a modest objective.  I think it is worth £40,000,000 to enable my neighbours in my own country, if they work hard on their own holdings, to raise a decent family decently.  If this House does not think it is worth £40,000,000, then the House should not pass this Estimate. That is the plain fact.  I think we are purchasing something infinitely <Col N="1208" /> more precious than the Manchester School of Economists ever conceived. If anyone differs with me in that, he should challenge a division on this Estimate and put up a proposal that we evacuate large parts of this country and install seagulls.  We can vote on one side for the people and on the other side for the seagulls.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Cogan himself perceived, Deputy Allen is rushing in and Deputy Derrig is passionately stirred about giving everybody fertilisers for nothing. That is a great hobby-horse.  When I asked Deputy Cogan what he had in mind, Deputy Cogan replied that the rate of the subsidy must depend on the price of the fertiliser.  I want to assure Deputy Cogan that, in practice, what happens is that the price of the fertiliser depends on the rate of the subsidy.  If I announced that there is going to be £1 per ton subsidy on &ldquo;super&rdquo;, up will go the price of &ldquo;super&rdquo;.  If I make it £2, up again will go the price of &ldquo;super&rdquo;.  You would imagine that Fianna Fáil, for whom Deputy Allen and Deputy Derrig speak, subsidised fertilisers regularly. If Deputies will turn to column 1710 of Volume 115, No. 12, they will see that I showed the House that, year after year, Fianna Fáil went through all the motions of appropriating large sums to subsidise fertilisers and when the year was done they had not spent the money&mdash;not a penny.  In one year they had to take back from the fertiliser manufacturers a large sum of money which they said they charged in excess.  Did they give that money to the farmers who paid the excess prices? They did not&mdash;not a penny of it.  It went into the Exchequer.  Now, I welcome Deputy Allen's declaration on behalf of his Party and I endorse it. But I do not believe in paying the fertiliser manufacturers to bring down the price of fertilisers, not a bit of it. I welcome the assurance of Deputy Allen that I have the support of the Fianna Fáil Party in saying to the fertiliser manufacturers that they are going to bring prices down or we shall bring them down for them, and not by changing or chopping costings, etc., but by putting a factory down beside them.  That is the way to bring down the price of fertilisers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1209" /> I am told that I should provide a subsidy for ground limestone.  Seventyfive thousand pounds a year we have been shovelling out to subsidise burnt lime, but we have not spent one penny piece in subsidising ground limestone. Yet the smallest farmer can buy ground limestone in Ireland cheaper than he can buy it anywhere in Great Britain, and in Great Britain it carries a subsidy of a varying amount according to the transport associated with the delivery.  Why should our people pay subsidies to any ring or monopoly in order to get the fertilisers which the land requires at the lowest possible price?  So long as I am Minister for Agriculture we are not going to do it, but we are going to insist on getting such supplies of phosphates, potash, nitrogen and lime as our people may from time to time require at the lowest possible price.  If the cartel will not supply it we will find another means, and I welcome the knowledge that Deputy Allen and his colleagues accept that so that we may be unanimous about it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Smith says: &ldquo;No matter how low the price of fertilisers is, still I would subsidise it because money is being lashed around.&rdquo;  Why is it if a Minister for Agriculture in this country persuades the Government to make some money available for the farmers of the land it is being &ldquo;lashed around,&rdquo; but if you buy a Constellation aircraft, that is not lashing money around, or if you plan to build a hotel in Glengarriff to cost £1,000,000 that is not lashing money around?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Smith says that fertilisers were frightfully expensive.  They certainly were.  Who made them so? Was it not the ring?  Who will get the subsidy if the subsidy is to be provided on the scale suggested by Deputy Smith?  Is it not the ring?  I hope that Deputy Smith endorses Deputy Allen's assurance that, if it becomes necessary to manufacture fertilisers ourselves in order to frustrate the attempt of the manure ring to exploit our people, the Fianna Fáil Party is 100 per cent. behind us in that enterprise.  Or has he reservations?  I am disappointed. I thought it was bad enough that Fianna Fáil should be split on foreign <Col N="1211" /> policy, but on economics it would be disastrous.  I am sorry if it irritates Deputy Smith, but really the ruddy glow of bucolic conservatism that is gradually shrouding his person edifies me.

      <P>Then I am not as edified as I was.  But the shade of Mr. Goschen seemed to sit behind him.  I felt he lacked an appropriate Lord Randolph to encourage him.  Deputy Smith knows perfectly well that it is not true to say that only a quarter of this money goes to the farmers.  He caused poor Deputy Allen to go into hysterics. Deputy Allen knew that it was not true, too, but he wove a cranky, cantankerous whinge around that for about a quarter of an hour.  I think it is a discreditable proposition to say that if a man's land, by the exertions of his father and grandfather before him, is now in a state of high fertility, it is unjust that we should not give him a hand-out on the occasion of rehabilitating land which is in the hands of a poorer <Col N="1212" /> neighbour who never succeeded in bringing it up to the level of fertility which the well-off man enjoys.  I do not know what experience Deputies have, but I do not think that our neighbours in the country are that kind of people.  I do not think that is the kind of jealousy that characterises them.  We have many faults, but I would not say the average person in the country is grudging.  If he is opposed to you in politics he would go without his supper if he thought that you would have to go without your breakfast.  If he thinks you were down on your luck, if a person does get run down and loses all his cattle in a year, who goes around with the hat to buy a couple of cows to put him on his feet again? Is it not the neighbours?  I think it is a mistake to assume that the people in the country have that grudging, mean and jealous outlook.  I am not a bit afraid of it in any case. It was Deputy Beegan who advanced that doctrine that it is a shame to be rehabilitating one man's land if we do not give a hand-out to his neighbour to console him because his land does not require rehabilitation.  That is an ugly, pauperish approach to life and it is not the way of our people.</P>
      <P>Deputy Derrig asked what should a farmer do who wants to get his land cleared of rocks.  He should ask for a form, fill in his name and address, and say approximately how many acres of land require attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Will that be done by the Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>An officer will then call on him and show him what, in our judgment, is necessary to be done to clear his land effectively.  It may be that the farmer will elect to do it himself and take the grant, in which event probably he will do part with his own family and will possibly hire one of the local contractor chaps whom we speak of equipping with machinery on a loan and grant basis.  Alternatively, if the problem appears to us to be quite beyond anything except what could be achieved by very heavy machinery, we might advise him to let us do it for him.  But it would be a matter of discussion between us and <Col N="1213" /> the farmer when our man called on the farmer, and, in whatever he wished to do, we would try to meet him unless his proposal was obviously impossible of performance.  It would be a very rare case in which we would say: &ldquo;We cannot accept that because we know that, unless we do it, there is no equipment within your reach which could achieve your purpose.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I quite agree with Deputy Derrig that, when land has been rehabilitated, it is very important that it should not sink back again, but I do not take the gloomy view which many people take in that respect.  I think that if our people have a chance, they will not let it slip back again.  It was suggested to me that we should have set up demonstration farms.  I do think that our farmers are inclined to look at a demonstration farm run by an officer of my Department and say: &ldquo;Sure, he has money&rdquo; and so forth. What I am hoping is that, under the scheme whereby we will have one agent for every three parishes, the agent will locate quickly four or five energetic and enterprising farmers, and that, with his help and guidance, these farmers' farms will become demonstration farms, and, as they improve under his guidance, his advice and counsel, he will be able to say to farmers whom he wants to bring with him: &ldquo;Come down and look at So-and-so's place, which is run on exactly the same lines as those on which you are running yours.  If you can do the same as he is doing, your land will pay&rdquo; I think that is a much more effective way of having a demonstration farm than to set up one under an officer of my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy spoke rather in deprecation of the films.  I want advice on that matter.  It did occur to me that, just for the very reason stated by Deputy Derrig, our people are unfamiliar with much of the modern types of machinery and their method of user.  It is not always easy to get half a parish to come a distance, but I think that nothing impresses a man so much as seeing something in action.  There is a recent development in film technique whereby you can erect a medium-sized screen in daylight in a public place&mdash;a market <Col N="1214" /> square or fair green&mdash;and, by projecting the film from behind, get a perfectly clearly visible moving picture in broad daylight.  This could be displayed adjacent to the weekly market or fair green, or at any place where people habitually gather, and made the occasion of telling them: &ldquo;If you wish to see what is portrayed here, it is to be seen at such-and-such a place on such-and-such a date&rdquo;.  We are already doing that, within limits, at Johnstown, which, as the Deputy knows, is the experimental farm in Wexford.  There are, in my opinion, very dramatic experiments proceeding there.  I can only hope that the Deputy and some of his colleagues will honour the institution with a visit of inspection between now and the harvest, when I think he will have reason to be, as I am, proud of the extent and character of the work there proceeding.</P>
    <P>Deputy Derrig was quite wrong in presuming that the object of the project was to get the largest possible return in the shortest possible time. I do not give a hoot for scarcity markets, and I think it is a terrible mistake to try to persuade our people that, to adopt some device that will snatch a profit on a scarcity market, they are justified in spending any amount of money to equip themselves to do that very thing.  My aim is to equip them and to advise them so that they may become masters of a long-term market, yielding not a fortuitous profit now, with a prospect of collapse hereafter, but a steady profit for a protracted period.</P>
    <P>It is pure eyewash to say that the failure to put out fertilisers is solely due to lack of capital.  It is due to the fact that, in 1934 and 1935, our people threw their hats at it.  The economic war knocked the heart out of them and they stopped buying basic slag and super and putting out fertilisers on grass lands.  That meant that they stopped putting out fertilisers on 80 per cent. of the land of this country.</P>

      <P>I assure the Deputy that a careful check made it quite clear that aphosphorosis was their complaint, but it is a very extraordinary thing to find anywhere a soil test in which the phosphate content is nil; so I want to tell Deputies, because we had better all face this, who believed that that condition was confined substantially to the part of the country across Ireland from Gort, through Portarlington, to the east coast, that any such belief is a foolish illusion.  It is now quite manifest that all over the country there is a condition of phosphate deficiency which no one could have believed until our resources permitted the extensive soil testing which has been going on for the past 12 months.  I have prepared a proper record of the incidence of aphosphorosis and soil deficiency in phosphate which falls below 4 per cent., which, I think, will astonish Deputies.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This Fisheries (Amendment) Bill is one of three designed to achieve a common purpose in consolidating fishery law.  The procedure is first with this Fishery (Amendment) Bill to make certain minor changes in the law and also to eliminate some inconsistencies in the series of statutes which constitute the fishery code from 1842 to 1944.</P>
      <P>This Bill is to be followed by a second Bill which will remove overlappings, redundancies and uncertainties such as where the expression &ldquo;fishing engine&rdquo; is used in one statute and, for precisely the same thing, &ldquo;fishing instrument&rdquo; is used somewhere else, and perhaps a third expression is employed to describe precisely the same thing in yet another statute.  The purpose of the second Bill in this series will be to establish common procedure, common terms for identical objects; and the third Bill will be the immense volume at present resting in the Library for the convenience of Deputies which will be submitted to the special procedure laid down by the Oireachtas for consolidating legislation, and which will be presented to the Special Committee provided for under that procedure, together with a certificate from the Attorney-General that any such Consolidation Bill in fact reproduces the fishery law as it will be when these two preliminary Bills have been passed.  If Deputies want me to go into details about fines and forfeitures I will.</P>

      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1950, for Pensions, Superannuation, Compensation (including Workmen's Compensation), and Additional and other Allowances and Gratuities under the Superannuation Acts, 1834 to 1947, and sundry other Statutes; Extra-Statutory Pensions, Allowances, and Gratuities awarded by the Minister for Finance; increases in certain Pensions and Allowances; fees to Medical Referees and occasional fees to Doctors, etc.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  They are all in the nature of token Votes for the sum of £10.  Vote 16 deals with Superannnuation and Retired Allowances, Vote 46 deals with Primary Education, being a Supplementary Estimate for a total of £10; Vote 61 deals with certain Civil Servants in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and in relation to it also there is a supplementary total vote of £10; and, lastly, there is the Army Pensions Vote, also for a sum of £10.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this Supplementary Estimate is to enable payment to be made in advance of the necessary legislation, in respect of increases in pensions to certain retired civil <Col N="1219" /> servants, members of the Garda Síochána and the Dublin Metropolitan Police, and resigned and dismissed members of the Royal Irish Constabulary. Similar Supplementary Estimates are being taken to provide for the payment of pension increases to teachers and to civil servants who were formerly employed in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  Some of these matters I am mentioning generally will not have complete application to Vote 64, Army Pensions.  There will be some details in which they may be changed. I have already introduced the First Reading of the Pensions (Increase) Bill to provide for the grant of increases of pension to the classes affected, and the Bill will be circulated during the coming recess.  It would not be possible to have the necessary Bill enacted in the present session, but it is intended to commence the revision of pension payments fortwith.</P>
    <P>The increases will be granted on the following basis:&mdash;Where the annual pension does not exceed £100, it will be increased by 50 per cent; where the annual pension exceeds £100 but does not exceed £150, it will be increased by 40 per cent., but the increase will in no case be less than £50; where the annual pension exceeds £150 and is less than £450 it will be increased by 30 per cent., but the increase will in no case be less than £60.  There will be no increase that will bring the pension to more than £450 a year.  No pension of £450 a year or over will be increased.  The last item is to cover increases in certain pensions and allowances under the Army Pensions Acts and the Defence Forces pensions schemes.</P>
    <P>In the case of civil servants, whose pensions include a bonus element determined by reference to the cost-of-living figure at the date of retirement, the increased pension will be subject to a maximum of the amount produced if the pension were revised by reference to a cost-of-living of 270 (i.e. the figure by reference to which Civil Service remuneration was revised in 1946). Similar appropriate maxima will also be applied to the increased pensions of other classes.  These maxima are designed <Col N="1220" /> to ensure that no increased pension shall be greater than the amount which would be payable to a pensioner of equivalent status and service who retired after the general increase of remuneration granted in 1946.</P>
    <P>Where emergency bonus has been included in the calculation of a pension, the part of pension related to the emergency bonus will first be deducted, and the remainder, being the pension on normal salary, will then be increased by the appropriate amount.</P>
    <P>The increases will apply to the pensions of civil servants and Garda Siochána who retired in the normal course before the 1st July, 1940, the pensions of teachers who retired before the increase in teachers' salaries in September and October, 1946, and the pensions of the resigned and dismissed members of the Royal Irish Constabulary. The increases will be payable as from the 1st April, 1949.</P>
    <P>Civil servants and Garda pensioners who retired during the stabilisation period, 1st July, 1940, to 31st October, 1946, have already received increases in their pensions under the Superannuation Act, 1947, and the Garda Síochána (Pensions) Act, 1947.  Their pensions were increased by reference to the cost-of-living figure at the date of the pensioner's retirement up to a maximum cost-of-living figure of 270. In some cases, the increases proposed under the Bill promised in the autumn would be more favourable to the pensioner than the increased pension payable under the Superannuation Act, 1947, or the Garda Síochána (Pensions) Act, 1947.  It is accordingly proposed to apply the provisions of the Bill, where more favourable, to such pensioners with effect from April, 1949, instead of the increases granted to them under the previous Acts.  The conditions that no pension will be increased beyond the amount determined by reference to a cost-of-living figure of 270, and that emeregncy bonus will be deducted in calculating the pension to be increased will, of course, apply.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to make provision in the Bill enabling the Minister for Local Government to authorise increases to pensioners of local authorities on similar terms and conditions. <Col N="1221" /> The total cost to the Exchequer of the pension increases now being provided is estimated at £205,000 a year, exclusive of the cost of increases in pensions paid by local authorities.</P>
    <P>The Gardaí and Royal Irish Constabulary widows' pensions will be provided by Orders.  Those Orders can be made during the recess and the payments issued.  The Department of Education will start on the payments to national school teachers, and as there are considerable numbers of these, it is expected that they will be fully occupied in making these payments until the House has reassembled. If, however, it is possible for them to attend to the secondary school teachers, an amending scheme can be made to cover this.  Otherwise, the secondary teachers will await the passage of legislation.</P>
    <P>The Department of Defence will be able to make payments by Order or by schemes under the Vote that I will introduce in a moment.  The only extra people likely to be covered by the legislation in the autumn are widows and children of Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries, but I do not propose to make any payment to any of these until after the legislation has been passed.</P>

      <P>From what the Minister has said, it is clear that the scheme will not be in full operation until the legislation has been passed.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the reason why I said that, with regard to the pensioners over £100, where there is a 40 per cent. increase, no payment will be less than £50.  It is to make provision against what the Deputy is arguing about that that has been put in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The procedure was followed elsewhere, I understand, of having a minimum pension based on present needs.  I do not know whether the Minister has examined that point, that is to say, to bring all pensioners up to a certain level.  It is quite true that there is a substantial improvement now&mdash;for example, the pensioner who is receiving £100 will now receive £150&mdash;but there must be a certain number who are even below the £100 figure, and £50 in their case would scarcely bring them to the point where the pension would be regarded as reasonable in present circumstances. The claim of the pensioned teachers was that, as far as possible, they should be put on the basis of those who have come on to the new salary scale.  There was also the question of women teachers who have been retired.</P>
      <P>I am glad that the Minister has been able to meet the case of these pensioned teachers and I think that it is a very good thing indeed that they are getting these increases.  I would like to know whether that point has been examined, about bringing those who were on very low rates, even substantially below the £100 figure, up to a certain minimum.  I do not think that the amount involved could be very much.  According to my recollection, there are about 200 of these teachers retired and although some of them live to a ripe old age, this problem is, as everyone knows, a disappearing one, since it refers only to teachers who were actually on pension before 1946.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As some other Deputies are interested in the Army and the Garda, I might make the point that those who have the advantage of being on the cost-of-living bonus will get more <Col N="1223" /> favourable terms than those who are on inclusive salaries because they are being taken at the figure of £270, which generally approximates somewhat to present circumstances.  I suppose that is inherent in the situation.</P>
    <P>In the case of teachers on pension, they were on the old inclusive scales and to that extent I am quite sure the case can and will be made that they are not doing as well as either civil servants, the Garda or even employees of local authorities.  I think the arrangement probably will be that allowance will be made not only for the basic salary of the latter classes but that the cost-of-living bonus will also enter into the superannuation and that the increase therefore will be based on consideration of the amount of the bonus as well as the basic salary. They have that advantage over the teachers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>May I put in a word of explanation for the benefit of Deputies who are interested particularly in the Army Pensions Supplementary Estimate?  The scale of increases outlined by the Minister for Finance will be adhered to in the main with regard to Army pensions but, as Deputies are aware, it would be unwise to apply the scales in exactly the same manner because in the increment scheme designed for others, those with the smallest pension get the highest percentage lift, and so on.  The next highest pension gets less lift.  With wound and disability pensions, obviously the person with the smallest pension would be the person with the slightest disability and the person with the highest pension would be the person with the greatest degree of disability, so that if we were to follow exactly the same lines it would mean that the greatest percentage increase would be given to those with the least disability and with the greatest potential for earning a livelihood over and above the pension and the smallest percentage increase would be given to the totally disabled exsoldier. So, in the case of the Army we are following the standard set down as closely as possible but the heavy end of the money will be given <Col N="1224" /> to the people with the greatest degree of disablement.  I think that is generally accepted.</P>
      <P>The overriding maximum of 50 per cent. will be adhered to with the exception of one or two very exceptional grades in whose case it would be an injustice to limit them to the 50 per cent. but the total money which will be expended on Army pensions will, of course, be within the sum allocated, which is strictly in relation to the total sum for Army pensions.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister if people who suffered disablement and who come under the 1932 and the 1937 Acts will be covered by this particular Vote.  It is not suggested, as far as I can see in the Supplementary Estimate which was issued, that these people are covered but perhaps the Minister will inform us as to that when he is replying.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I would say that almost all the categories of pensioners in whom Deputies are interested are covered and I am wondering why the Old I.R.A. are not included.  Perhaps they are in it.  I cannot say.  As far as I could gather from listening to the Minister for Finance and to the Minister for Defence, the Old I.R.A. do not appear to be included and it seems to me an extraordinary state of affairs that the only section of the community of pensioners who are not being covered are the men who gave national service which brought about the establishment of this institution.  I would ask the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Defence whether that is an oversight or whether it is intended to bring them in under some other scheme.</P>

      <P>I gathered that.  I want to ask whether this will include widows, that is, if those widows who <Col N="1225" /> are in receipt of pensions at the moment will come within the increases that have been mentioned.  I am not altogether clear on that aspect of it. I do think that all military service pensions should be increased also.  I think that is the point which Deputy Traynor is making and I should like to support it&mdash;that all persons in receipt of military pensions, whether under the 1924 or the 1934 Act, should be included.  The principal thing anyway is that there is going to be a general all-round increase and that is very welcome coming at this time just prior to the conclusion of this session of the Dáil.  It may be that quite a number of special cases will not be caught under this Supplementary Estimate. If that is so, that is something which we shall have to take up with the Minister subsequently.  However, I am glad that this opportunity has been availed of to make this all-round increase.</P>

      <P>What I am anxious to see is this: in that 200 group referred to by Deputy Derrig, there are some who had got very small pensions indeed, so small that they were almost negligible.  They have had to try to live on these pensions up to this.  It is quite obvious that if they were getting £20 they would be only getting £30 by an increase of 50 per cent.  That seems miserably small.  Their number also is very small.  I was wondering whether the Minister could make an absolute minimum under which nobody would be receiving less than £50. Personally, I think it ought to go up to £100.</P>

      <P>I ask the Minister to consider carefully those persons with such a miserably small pension that with the increase of 50 per cent. they do not reach £50.  If they cover only a relatively small group, an effort ought to be made to provide for them.  I met some representatives of these pensioners, and I was wondering whether it would be possible to provide in their case that there would be a minimum of £100.  However, I can see <Col N="1227" /> at once that if you fix a standard in the case of one particular class, you will naturally be asked to extend it to any others who may fall into the same category as regards amounts of pension. The main thing to ensure is that where there are very small pensions you will not work simply to 50 per cent., which would still leave the pensions very small.</P>

      <P>Those who are under £34 will receive a 50 per cent. increase, so that they will be in receipt now of less than £50 with the pension, plus the increase.  I take it that the plea of Deputy de Valera is that this small group in the lowest category might have reserved to them a minimum of £50 as their pension, plus the increase. There is such a small number the Minister might very well consider acceding to that.</P>

      <P>The difficulty with having any minimum is that there is such a large class involved.  Some Deputies introduced the question of military service pensions.  They are not included in this for the reason that they were not, when given, supposed to be a gratuity intended for the maintenance or support of the beneficiary, but rather an acknowledgment of service rendered.  They were never put on the basis of pensions, although the phrase was used in regard to them.  Of course, our military service pensions are very costly.  They cost nearly £400,000 yearly.  The average pension would be about £30.  If there is any minimum struck and if there is any question of bringing in military service pensions hereafter&mdash;I am certainly against it at the moment&mdash;then, of course, such an increase as would ensure that no one would have less than £50 could be very costly.  Even with the class I am dealing with at the moment&mdash;civil servants, Gardaí, R.I.C. and teachers&mdash;there are over 900 people who are on the £50 and under scale. However, before the legislation goes through, I will have that considered, but the cost is something which has to be borne in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I have cleared up the point with reference to Deputy Derrig.  I do not know whether I put the thing wrongly or he took me up wrongly.  So far as that lowly-paid group with pensions not exceeding £100 are concerned, the increase that is proposed is 50 per cent.  The minimum of £50 and the minimum of £60 arise in connection with the second and third category. There are, Deputies will observe, two ceilings, so to speak, in this matter. One is the £450 limit.  It is not merely that a person with £450 will not get any increase, but no increase will be given which will bring the pension higher than £450.  A person just on the verge of £450 and who may seem to qualify for 30 per cent. increase, will <Col N="1229" /> not get that 30 per cent increase, but only such percentage as will bring the amount up to £450.  In relation to that, there are the maxima I spoke of.  I do not want to create any more anomalies; there are plenty of them at present. Therefore I want to establish the other maximum of which I spoke.  I will not go beyond the amount to be produced if the pension is related to a cost-of-living figure of 270.  That was the figure that operated in the 1946 revision and I want to keep to that.</P>

      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £2,700 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1950, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Houses of the Oireachtas, including certain Grants-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>This sum of £2,700 is required for the purpose of making grants to enable members of the Oireachtas to take a more active and effective part in inter-Parliamentary Assemblies.  From 1923, grants have been made towards the expenses of members of the Oireachtas who participated in certain Parliamentary activities.  In 1939 the provision was reduced to a maximum sum of £200.  That was to cover the Irish groups' expenses in participating in inter-Parliamentary Assemblies including the subscription and the costs of any delegation that might travel. That sum was kept on until 1948-1949. Actually, since 1940-41, the expenditure was confined to the amount of the annual subscription because the conferences were suspended by reason of war conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A proposal has recently been made that the Ceann Comhairle should be invited to arrange a meeting of members of the Dáil and Seanad to consider certain suggestions that have been made to enable members of the Oireachtas to take a more active and effective part in inter-Parliamentary <Col N="1231" /> activities.  Provision is being made for that.  The activities that will take place is a matter to be decided later. The provision is for the cost of membership&mdash;that is subscriptions to an association of an inter-Parliamentary character.  It will also cover representation at conferences.  That will allow for the payment of the expenses of the people who may be selected to travel to conferences.  It is hoped there would be enough in the Vote to enable foreign Parliamentarians who came to Ireland to be received and entertained.</P>
    <P>There have been, in the main, two associations to which this State was attached.  One was the Inter-Parliamentary Association which meets in Geneva.  That is a group of members of Parliaments of different countries. The other association with which this country had some attachment was the group that used to be called &ldquo;the Empire Parliamentary Group.&rdquo;  It has now adopted a new title.  It is known as the &ldquo;Commonwealth Parliamentary Association.&rdquo;  That association has made such arrangements as will enable people who are not exactly members of the group represented still to attend.  It is hoped for this year that a conference will be held at Toronto, and that a delegation from the Parliament of the United States will attend.  The arrangement has been made in such a way as to enable representatives of that Parliament to attend and clearly to accommodate members of this Oireachtas if it were decided to let such a delegation go. That is a matter which the conference to be convened by the Ceann Comhairle could discuss generally&mdash;activities of this inter-Parliamentary type.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>As it has been conveyed to me, I understand the intention is to ask the members of the Oireachtas to form a Parliamentary association which would decide to what Parliamentary bodies we would affiliate.  We have discussed that and we are prepared to enter into such an association.  The grants which it is now suggested the Dáil should provide are, I take it, intended to meet the expenses of the association including <Col N="1232" /> those of the delegations which they may decide to send to the conferences of the body with which they affiliate. All that is a matter for the association itself.  To what extent will the Government say: &ldquo;We will not give you the grant in the case of a particular proposed delegation&rdquo;?  In other words, the sum in this Vote is not to be paid over to the association as such.  It is to be retained, I take it, in the Treasury, to be at the disposal of the Minister for Finance and of the Government who in any specific case may say: &ldquo;We do not agree to that and we are not going to give you any grant for that purpose.&rdquo;  I should like to be clear as to whether some of it is going to be handed over to the association and be at its disposal as a grant-in-aid, or whether it is to be given <i>ad hoc</i> in each particular case at the discretion of the Minister for Finance and of the Government.</P>
      <P>There is another point that I would like to be clear on.  It is this.  The Minister referred to what used to be called the &ldquo;Empire Parliamentary Association,&rdquo; and he has indicated that that body has changed its title. I think he said it changed its constitution so as to admit of the membership or presence at its sessions and conferences of the representatives of Parliamentary Associations of States that are not members of the British Commonwealth.  Has the name actually been changed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an answer to one question.  The next is, has its Constitution definitely been changed, and would it be possible to get a copy of its Constitution?  I think I was told at one time that it was about to be changed, but I would like to know if, in fact, it has been changed.  The fact that the United States is to be represented at the conference in Toronto would seem to indicate that it has, but I would like to be certain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, of course, another remark that I would like to make.  The two associations that have been referred to may be said to be two of the older associations, but the number of international <Col N="1233" /> bodies, of various kinds, has become so great that it is almost impossible to keep track of them. Naturally, our desire would be to limit the number so that it would be possible to attend properly to the activities of the bodies with which we would be associated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised that the name has been changed.  I would assume that to be so from an extract from a letter which was sent to the Deputy who has spoken where the phrase occurs that &ldquo;the rules have been amended to provide for the admission of countries that are not in the British Commonwealth of Nations.&rdquo;  I am relying on that document.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the documentary evidence before me goes, I am advised that the rule has been amended in order to provide for the admission of countries not in the British Commonwealth of Nations, and provision has been made for the purpose of enabling America and this country to attend.  There is no ambiguity about the matter; indeed, we cannot allow any such ambiguity about a matter of that sort, and if there is any it will have to be cleared up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that that document is sufficient evidence.  On the Deputy's other point, these are Grants-in-Aid.  As to when a grant will be given, that will arise on consideration of an application in respect of a particular Parliamentary body.  These moneys will not be handed over <i>en bloc</i> to an association.  There will be the usual supervision carried out by my own Department.  If assent is given to the payment of a subscription to some delegation, giving the Grant-in-Aid means, as the phrase has it, that the moneys will not be strictly subject to repayment; once the grant is issued, there will be no repayment. <Col N="1234" /> I think the Deputy's point is that, when we are asking for £2,700, we will put it into the hands of an association for disbursement as they please.  That is not so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £2,522 1s. 6d. be granted to make good an Excess on the Grand for Forestry for the year ended 31st March, 1948.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This excess arose mainly on sub-head C (2) of the Forestry Vote, on which is borne the cost for cultural operations and maintenance work.  The original Estimate for the year 1947-48 provided a sum of £246,215.  An additional sum of £66,000 was subsequently provided by Supplementary Estimate, making the total provision for the year 1947-48 for cultural operations and maintenance work, £312,215.  Expenditure <Col N="1235" /> from the sub-head, however, totalled £318,242 1s. Od.  Savings on other sub-heads enabled the deficit in the gross Vote to be reduced to £2,089 19s. 6d.  There was a deficiency of £432 2s. Od. in the estimated Appropriations-in-Aid and that left the excess on the net Vote at £2,522 1s. 6d.</P>
    <P>Deputies will understand that an estimation of expenditure on sub-head C (2), which covers all expenditure directly relating to the conduct of operations in State forests, is difficult at any time, but it was exceptionally difficult in 1947-48 and other recent years owing to the great uncertainty as regards supplies and the consequent difficulty in planning the annual programme of work.  There was an unexpected heavy drain on the sub-head to meet the cost of fuel production, which was resumed on a large scale during the fuel crisis in the winter of 1947.  There was a Supplementary Estimate taken to meet expenditure on this additional work.  It was thought that that supplementary would make adequate provision for the payment for the service for the year.</P>
    <P>There were certain materials that were oustanding, mainly fencing materials, that were not expected to arrive until 1948-49.  They were received unexpectedly in the last few weeks of the financial year 1947-48 and, in accordance with the terms of the contract, they had to be paid for on delivery.  The system is that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs makes the purchase through their agents.  They pay for the materials on the understanding that they will be recouped.  The expenditure of £2,522 was incurred, but it did not become apparent until after the close of the financial year 1947-48.  I am asking that this money should now be made good.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1236" /> That the Defence Forces (Pensions) (Amendment) Scheme, 1949, prepared by the Minister for Defence, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, under the terms of the Defence Forces (Pensions) Acts, 1932 to 1949, and laid before the House on the 15th July, 1949, be confirmed.</P>
    <P>I think Deputies will agree that the White Paper circulated with this amendment scheme makes the position very clear.  This amendment arises, in the main, out of the Bill passed by the House some time ago authorising the Minister to amend and extend the scheme so as to include chaplains. Generally, it follows on the same lines as the scheme made for nurses and the broad provisions in the scheme are as follows:</P>
    <P>No. 1&mdash;Pensions.  Normally, to qualify for a pension, a chaplain must have 20 years' continuous and full-time service. If he is forced to retire on the ground of ill-health he will be entitled to a pension after ten years' service.  The rates will be 1/60th of his annual emoluments for each year of service, but after 20 years' service, each year thereafter will be reckoned as 1/30th for pension purposes.  Taking the emoluments, pay, ration and accommodation allowance of the ordinary chaplain, the pension, at present rates, after 20 years' service, would be approximately £187 a year, and the maximum pension payable after 30 years' service will be about £375 a year. It also deals with gratuities.  Normally, to qualify for a gratuity, a chaplain must have at least five years' continuous and full-time service; but if he is forced to retire on grounds of ill health he will be entitled thereon to a gratuity, even after only one year's service.  The gratuity will be calculated at 30 days' pay for each year of service.  The pay of an ordinary chaplain at the present moment is 24/- per day.</P>
    <P>The formulation of this scheme for chaplains' pensions and gratuities is being used to extend the principal scheme in a number of minor respects. None of these amendments is of a restrictive character, but all of them tend to relieve individual cases of hardship <Col N="1237" /> which have arisen from time to time in administering the scheme.</P>
    <P>Article 7 ensures that the widow or children of an officer will not be deprived of a pension because the officer died before fulfilling the present condition of being in receipt of retired pay.  Article 9 removes the qualification for a soldier's married pension of having to be in receipt of marriage allowance on the date of his discharge. He will now receive a pension even though his wife has died provided that he was drawing an allowance in respect of his children.  Article 16 permits the Minister to increase the married officers' gratuity paid to area administrative officers by adding notional to actual service, just as the 1947 scheme did in the case of pay.  We are now doing the same with regard to marriage allowances.</P>
    <P>If there are any other points upon which Deputies require information, not contained in the statement or in the White Paper, I will endeavour to give it to them; but I think the White Paper already circulated covers the whole scheme, Article by Article.</P>

I know that that was covered recently by a Bill, but it is only right that I should congratulate the Minister on being the instrument which brings in this provision and which makes it possible to give to the particular gentlemen concerned something in the nature of a reward to which they are entitled but which has been withheld from them over a long period of years.  I notice that it is retrospective to the first day of December, 1944.  I wonder if that covers all the chaplains down through the years.  It would be nice if it were possible to reward all these chaplains in one way or another.  Those who come within the terms of the Act and also within the terms of this scheme are assured of getting that to which they are entitled.  There are some who <Col N="1238" /> may not come within the first day of December, 1944, though I imagine the Minister has been advised on that particular aspect of the matter.  I am sure he has gone back as far as is necessary.</P>
      <P>I am also glad that he has made provision for the specific portion of the Act to apply to officers who were not in a position to receive gratuities because they did not retire from the service.  On a number of occasions in the past it was necessary to induce officers, who were so ill that there was no chance of their recovery, to retire. That will not be necessary in future. It was always a rather painful step to take and I am glad the Minister has brought in legislation which will make that process unnecessary in the future.</P>

      <P>I want to congratulate the Minister on making this amendment to the pension scheme. These amendments cover a number of special cases of hardship.  The only objection is that some of the provisions in this scheme have been inserted to deal with particular cases only.  I have always held out against that.  Article 5 provides for an officer who has held an appointment for not less than two years and three months; I take it that period is put in to cover some particular case.  The important thing is, however, that these amendments do improve the scheme as a whole.  For that alone, the Minister is to be congratulated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one section here which may cause a little trouble to the Minister and his Department in regard to interpretation. Article 9 provides that if a marriage allowance was payable on the date of discharge, or if a man's wife was maintained in an institution and, but for that, marriage allowance would have been payable to her, or, if being a widower, he was in receipt of a child or children's allowances, marriage allowances will be paid.  There is a case that is not covered here.  To my personal knowledge there are quite a few of them.  I refer to the case where a wife is separated from her husband for reasons other than the exigencies of the service.  Take for instance, the case of a married soldier <Col N="1239" /> stationed in the Curragh; he could not obtain married quarters during the emergency in the Curragh, or elsewhere; his wife went across to live with friends in Britain; he was refused a marriage allowance and that refusal will now follow in so far as his pension is concerned.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other cases where husbands and wives are separated because they disagree with one another and not because of the exigencies of the service.  In those cases, marriage allowances were not payable. Because marriage allowances were not payable, the soldiers are not now entitled to what I will call the &ldquo;married soldiers' pension&rdquo;.  I think that is a hardship; it is unfair.  There may have been during the time of service that disagreement that did not entitle the wife to the marriage allowance and they may have made it up since.  I think it is unfair to limit this provision to the particular cases mentioned in the section.</P>
    <P>That is the only thing I want to mention in regard to this scheme.  It is very easy to pick holes in a scheme. It is very easy to criticise it and I do not want to do that where an amendment to a scheme does provide a substantial improvement.  Where that has been brought in by the Minister, I think the Minister deserves congratulations and our support.  This scheme is brought before us by virtue of the Act which says that such a scheme must be put before the Dáil for approval and although I or other Deputies may draw attention to some matter such as I have mentioned, we cannot improve the scheme in any way.  My only reason for mentioning it now is so that the Minister may have a note of this and that when further amendments of the scheme are contemplated by him this particular point may be dealt with.</P>
    <P>I welcome the scheme.  I welcome the expedition in which the part dealing with chaplains has been brought in.  I only regret that the language to which I referred when the Bill was brought into the Dáil&mdash;the term, &ldquo;chaplaincy service&rdquo;&mdash;could not have been altered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to answer a few of the suggestions made by Deputies <Col N="1240" /> on this amendment.  Deputy Traynor asked in particular if every chaplain who had the entitlement laid down in this scheme, whether he earned that entitlement in the past or in the future, is covered by the scheme.  I am informed that that is so.  Anybody who has previously gone out and who has had 20 years' service is covered by that. Anybody who went out on less than 20 years' service, but whose going was as a result of ill-health, is covered by the scheme.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cowan referred to these words, &ldquo;two years and three months&rdquo;. He inquired whether that was designed to meet any particular case.  It is not designed to meet any particular case; there has not been such a case.  Heretofore, an officer member of the Defence Council only got a higher rate of pension if he were forced to retire.  In this amendment we are giving the higher rate of pension to an officer who voluntarily retired as a member of the Defence Council, if he had completed two years and three months' service.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cowan also referred to the problem of soldiers who are separated from their wives and families either because of the exigencies of Army service or because of lack of domestic harmony.  That is a very big problem. It is a difficult problem and one which must be considered on the merits of the individual cases.  The fairest course, taking all the factors into account, is to be guided by the wishes of the parties concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Dr. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be read a Second Time.  The purpose of this Bill is to provide new rates of pensions for officers and soldiers disabled by wound or injury after the passing of this Bill.  The position at the moment is that, for example, in the case of 100 per cent. disablement the rate of pension payable to a soldier under the 1927 Act is 26/- a week.  This rate was increased to 42/- a week by the Act of 1943 for soldiers wounded during the emergency.  Since the end of <Col N="1241" /> the emergency, that is, the 3rd September, 1946, the only rate applicable was the 26/- a week payable under the Act of 1927, so that it became necessary to review the whole position.  This Bill now increases the rate to 50/- a week for soldiers wounded after the passing of this Bill and leaves the soldiers the same rates of increased marriage pension payable under the Act of 1946.  It will be seen, therefore, that there is a period from the 3rd of September, 1946, to the date of the passing of this Bill when the soldier wounded during that period will not be entitled either to the 42/- a week of the 1943 Act or the 50/- a week of this Bill, but to the 26/- a week of the 1927 Act. That gap, however, will be covered in a later Bill which will deal with an increase in pensions payable under the Act of 1927, that is, under the pensions scheme for which we introduced a Supplementary Estimate half an hour ago.</P>
      <P>The second important object of this Bill&mdash;Section 9&mdash;is to extend the date of application for medals for the purpose of special allowances.  That date under the Act of 1946 was the 31st of December, 1946.  Now it is extended to six months after the passing of this Bill.  There are at present about 3,613 late applications and as soon as this Bill becomes law the necessary forms will be sent without undue delay to all the persons concerned.</P>
      <P>Another purpose of this Bill&mdash;Sections 8 and 10&mdash;is to extend the provisions of the Army Pension Acts to nurses and to officers and men of the First Line Reserve.  Hitherto, neither nurses nor reservists, except during the emergency, came within the ordinary peace-time Acts.  They will now be entitled to the same rights as the ordinary regular officer or soldier. Further, the Bill&mdash;Section 11&mdash;empowers the Minister to formulate a pension or compensation scheme for the Second Line Reserve and this will be put in train immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Provision is also made in this Bill&mdash; Section 7&mdash;for the dependents of unmarried officers or soldiers who are killed or who die from wounds attributable to service.  If the relative was totally or mainly dependent on the deceased an allowance will be payable, <Col N="1242" /> but if the dependence was only partial a gratuity will be payable.  In the case of a soldier the test of the dependency will be the contribution of a voluntary allotment from his pay.</P>
    <P>The sections just outlined may be described as general in character in that they relate to groups or classes rather than to individuals.  Experience in the administration of the Acts has revealed, however, that some sections are so tightly drawn, or some words so rigidly defined, that they inflict undue hardship in particular cases, and, therefore, the Bill in several sections attempts to remedy this defect, and to remove the hardship.  Thus the Seventh Schedule of the 1927 Act limits to four the number of children in respect of whom allowances could be paid, but this limitation is abolished by Section 6, sub-section (4) of this Bill.  Again the term &ldquo;marriage allowance&rdquo; used in the Acts is so rigidly defined in Defence Force Regulations that a widower soldier with, perhaps, many orphans was deprived of a marriage pension under the Acts because although he was in receipt of children's allowance, that allowance was not technically marriage allowance.  Moreover, if a soldier thus circumstanced was killed or died from wounds while serving, his children would not have been entitled to an allowance.  This defect is now removed by sub-sections (1), (2) and (3) of Section 6 of the Bill, which in effect extends the term marriage allowance so as to include children's allowance payable under Defence Force Regulations.</P>
    <P>During the past 25 years six persons have forfeited their pensions under Section 11 of the 1923 Act in that while on pension they were convicted of a crime or offence for which they were sentenced to imprisonment for any term exceeding three months, and two pensions were made forfeit by the Minister on grounds of disgraceful conduct. Hitherto no power existed to restore the forefeiture but the occasion of this Bill has been taken, by Section 1, to vest in the Minister, with the assent of the Minister for Finance, power to restore such pension or allowance.</P>
    <P>Finally, Section 12 is designed to meet some cases of great hardship <Col N="1243" /> which have arisen in connection with the administration of special allowances. As the Acts stand at present a person's claim is finally determined if the applicant dies after the grant of an allowance by the Minister for Defence but before the Minister for Finance has assented to the grant.  Seven successful applicants died in such circumstances, with the result that their relatives were deprived of sums ranging from £18 in one case to £150 in another.  That position is remedied in this Bill, and by giving the provision retrospective effect to the 1st January, 1947, the relatives of the seven dead applicants will receive the moneys due on foot of the awards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill aims at improving, to some extent, the conditions mentioned in the Acts referred to in Section 1.  From time to time we have heard, or received complaints in respect of one aspect or another of some of these Acts.  This Bill is now going a long way towards removing some, at least, of the causes of complaint.  Section 2, which deals with the forfeiture of pension, covers a matter in which I was very interested and which I brought to the attention of the Minister in this House on a couple of occasions. It appears to me, however, that, so far as forfeiture of pensions is concerned, the Bill is confined mainly to Army personnel and that it will not, in fact, affect persons who forfeited their pensions under the 1934 Act unless that matter is also covered by a Supplementary Estimate or by some provision that the Minister may have in mind for a future Bill.  To my mind, the forfeiture of a pension in these cases was, to some extent, unjust, because, as I mentioned on a former occasion, if a man committed a criminal offence for which he was sentenced to a period of imprisonment, the judge dealing with the case dealt with it wholly on the assumption that the imprisonment was the full punishment of the crime with which the man was charged.  In many cases he was unaware of the fact that the man was a pensioner or was entitled to a certain sum of money and that that sum of money would be forfeited in certain circumstances, such <Col N="1244" /> as his being sentenced to three months' imprisonment or for any term in excess of that period.</P>
      <P>To my mind that was very unfair, inasmuch as not only a term of imprisonment was inflicted on the individual but a fine was also imposed. That was a matter that was never given very serious consideration by those responsible for the drafting of that particular section.  I welcome the fact that Section 2 now covers at least that particular phase of pensioners' rights.  I should like to know if it is being made retrospective.  I think the Minister probably, together with the Minister for Finance, can go back over a period and restore pensions.  I hope that is so because it would to some extent remove an injustice that has existed.</P>
      <P>I am also pleased to see that the question of false statements is being dealt with because I am pretty certain a number of pensions have been secured by individuals as a result of false statements.  I think the penalty for making such statements was formerly £5 and that is now being increased to £25.  A £25 penalty is probably severe.  There is also, I see, at the discretion of the court the possibility of imprisonment.  It rests with the court, of course, to decide whether the fine of £25 plus imprisonment will be inflicted.  Personally, I rather feel that when people are coming before the various boards to which they have to make their case the greatest deterrent would be for the chairman of the board to warn them of the existence of this particular section because outside of that I do not think it will ever be enforced but the warning might have a salutary effect.</P>
      <P>The provision regarding marriage pensions and allowances is also to my mind a step forward.  It makes it possible not alone for the individual to secure a pension but it also ensures that the limitation which formerly existed of, I think, four children will not exist in the future.  That is very useful.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, as far as I can see, the Bill is one that I am prepared to welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to special allowances <Col N="1245" /> and the extension of the date to six months after the passing of the Bill for applying for medals, that is all to the good.  I wonder, however, if the Minister has given any consideration to the appeal which I made to him on a former occasion in respect of the enforcement of the means test.  He will remember that I quoted a case for him which to my mind was one of considerable hardship where a sister supported her brother.  She could only do that as a result of going out and working but yet the officer computing the means test valued that support at 23/-.  As a result, instead of receiving 30/- which the Act of 1943 provided, that individual received 7/-. I would like if the Minister could do something about easing, with regard to this particular allowance, the means test which is enforced in respect of old age pensions and widows' and orphans' pensions.  After all, these are individuals whose service in the national cause brought about the disability, disablement or incapacity from which they now suffer and for that reason I imagine that they should be given special consideration. I should mention that I brought this matter before the late Government and I had almost secured agreement to some form of action to alleviate the position of individuals in such a situation.</P>
    <P>I take it that Section 11, which deals with the Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil and the Sluagh Muire, is merely making permanent what was formerly contained only in emergency legislation.  The Reserve and the 2nd Line which is the Fórsa Cosanta and the Sluagh Muire will have this legislation protecting them.</P>
    <P>I am wondering if there is retrospection with regard to Section 12 dealing with gratuities to the relatives of certain deceased persons and with the question of allotment in respect of the parents of a soldier.  The parents of a soldier can only secure an allowance or pension if the soldier has been providing in some form or other an allotment to the dependents.  I would suggest to the Minister that in a number of cases young men serving in the Army whose parents are alive endeavour to further their own interests <Col N="1246" /> by educating themselves.  Instead of receiving an allotment from them, their parents are in fact helping them to secure grinds or tuition of one kind or another in the hope that at some time they may be able to get a commission in the Army or sit for a Civil Service examination.  Only in a case where a soldier has made an allotment in respect of his parents will those parents receive a dependents' allowance in the event of that boy's death.  I would like if the Minister would examine that aspect of the case and make it possible for parents who lose such a boy to receive some form of compensation.  I am pretty certain that the Workmen's Compensation Act would cover such a case when the boy loses his life in the course of his employment.</P>
    <P>Again I would congratulate the Minister on bringing in the various improvements in this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I follow Deputy Traynor in congratulating the Minister on the introduction of this Bill which follows the pattern to some extent. Taken with the scheme we have already improved, the same principle seems to run through this Bill.  I am very pleased that the Minister has taken the power with the consent of the Minister for Finance to restore pensions and allowances that have been forfeited for one reason or another.  There have been cases of forfeiture that have been exceedingly harsh and it is right that there should be this form of appeal, this reconsideration which may be given to the matter, so as to enable the Minister to restore the pension.  It is a very good provision and I am glad to see it in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the limitation in Section 7 in regard to dependents, the dependents will be treated, in the case of a soldier, in relation to the making of an allotment. There are cases of allotment to parents, of course, but, generally speaking, the allotment is to a wife, and, unless things have changed in the past few years, the number of allocations of pay to parents, or any person other than a wife, must be very small and to that extent the section limits unduly. Perhaps on the next Stage the Minister <Col N="1247" /> might be agreeable to widen the section somewhat by removing that restriction.</P>
    <P>I did not have an opportunity of looking closely into the effect of Section 10 which brings in the First Line Reserve.  Sub-section (2) says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(a)  The expression `the forces' shall be construed as including the Reserve of Officers&mdash;First Line and the Reserve of Men&mdash;First Line and</P>
    <P>(b)  the word `soldier' shall be construed as including a man of the Reserve of men&mdash;First Line.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As I say, I did not have an opportunity of relating that section to the Acts as a whole, but my present fear is that the limitation of this measure to the First Line Reserve of Officers and First Line Reserve of Men may impose a hardship on members of the other classes of Reserve, classes A and B, the Volunteer Reserve.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>At the moment, yes, but it may be that members of this force would have a claim under this Act, if the limitation were not there.  The Minister will be able to put me right on that when concluding, because I have not had an opportunity of considering that aspect at all.</P>
      <P>Section 10 says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The expression &lsquo;the forces&rsquo; shall be construed as excluding the Reserve...&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>save as provided otherwise in the Act, and then there is the provision bringing in the First Line of Reserve of Officers and First Line Reserve of Men.  It was always endeavoured to interpret the word &ldquo;forces&rdquo; as referring only to the regular Army.  Under the 1923 Act, &ldquo;Defence Forces&rdquo; included the Reserve and &ldquo;forces&rdquo; was limited to the regular Army.  That has been followed over the past 26 years in the Acts and Regulations, but this section gives a different meaning to the word &ldquo;forces&rdquo;.  I think probably that might be altered, so that we could adhere to the interpretation of forces and Defence Forces which <Col N="1248" /> has been followed for the past quarter of a century.</P>
    <P>I notice that Section 13 provides for deductions in respect of public claims from pensions, allowances, gratuities and compensations.  Some such provision is quite normal in these Acts, but sub-section (2) states that payment of the pension allowance, gratuity or compensation, may be withheld until the amount of the deduction is ascertained. I can see some danger there.  The Department may make a claim on an individual and the individual may dispute the claim.  In that event, there is only one proper way of having the matter decided, that is, by means of an action in the courts, and I should say that it might be very unfair to withhold payment of a pension until this whole procedure has been gone through.  I have come across cases, in practice, where threats to withhold pensions were made.  In actual fact, part or the whole of the pension was stopped for a period and it was then discovered that the deduction was entirely illegal and the pension had to be refunded.  I am aware of circumstances that would necessitate the introduction of a clause such as this, but I think the authority contained in that section ought not be used in practice for the purposes of forcing a person to admit a liability which he has not got.  However, reading the section, I can see ways by which the difficulty can be got round, and once there is that loophole in it, it is probably safe enough.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has been able to introduce the scheme we have just passed and to introduce this Bill.  If, as Deputies, we were entitled to put down amendments which would increase the charge on public funds, there are quite a number of amendments I might suggest to him, but we are limited in that regard by the rules of the House and probably also by the provisions of the Constitution.  In these circumstances, we have to depend on the Minister to bring in the Bills which will provide for these increased pensions.  However, I welcome the Bill as improving the position and as falling into line with the pattern of increases that are being made generally. <Col N="1249" /> I am sure it will be welcomed also by those persons who will be affected by it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on honouring the promise of his predecessor by extending the time for applying for medals which are an essential qualification for a special allowance.  I was also glad to see the provision in regard to 100 per cent. disability.  However, I must say that I was really disappointed that there was no increase in the special allowance.  A sum of 30/- is a very small amount these days for a man who has to prove himself incapable of self-support and who has to be practically destitute before he gets that amount.  When any increase is going, those who helped in some way to build up the State should not be forgotten. I should like to put that point of view strongly before the Minister. If there is any way in which he can amend this measure by giving the people who are drawing the special allowance an increase he should do so. At the present time it is practically impossible for them to live and to keep their dependents on this amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then there is, in addition, a very severe means test in connection with that allowance.  The Minister will remember that I had a Parliamentary question down to him quite recently in regard to the case of an old age pensioner who had an allowance of £10 7s. 6d. a year which was granted because a son had been killed by the Black and Tans.  Because of an increase of 2/6 under the Old Age Pensions Act last year this old age pensioner suffers a loss in the total income of over £5. Instead of being of benefit to this old age pensioner, the increase in the old age pension has meant a loss, I think, of £5 10s. per year.  Having put a question of that nature down to the Minister one would have thought that there would have been some provision in an Act such as this to increase the means test.  For the life of me I cannot see why there should be a means test in this measure of £40 a year and, in the case of the old age pension, a means test of £52 a year.  That is not all. Under this Bill, in the case of anybody claiming a special allowance who has a <Col N="1250" /> boy or girl under 18 years of age working, the full earnings of that boy or girl are counted as means.  Now, in the case of the old age pension, only the profit of the earnings of people under 18 years of age will be taken into account as means.  I suggest that in a case like this the procedure is entirely wrong.  I would, therefore, ask the Minister to look into those points. After all, it is very unfair that the whole of the earnings of a boy or girl under 18 years of age should be taken into account under this measure whereas under the other system, only the profit earnings are taken into account.</P>
    <P>A case has recently been brought to my notice of a man who has lost both his legs through gangrene.  He got the special allowance.  He is in the district hospital.  His wife went to work and is earning a little over £2 a week. As a result, his special allowance was cut off completely.  That is very hard on these people.  I put it to that woman that she was only working for the State and not for herself and her husband because she was forfeiting everything she was earning.  The fact of the matter is that she is an industrious woman who likes to work.</P>
    <P>Another difficulty is that of the man whose application is turned down.  He cannot re-apply until 12 months have elapsed.  Now a lot of things will happen in regard to a man's means in 12 months.  That period should be shortened by at least half.  A man may have some little income now and be deprived of it in a couple of months' time.  Yet such a man would have to wait 12 months before he could re-apply. Similarly in the case of a disability.</P>
    <P>As the Minister is aware, the extension of the period of application for medals has been delayed for a very long time and I wonder if he would go a small way towards meeting this case and making it retrospective to at least the beginning of this year.  Some people have been waiting for this for a couple of years.  They are very badly off.  I should be glad if the Minister would find it possible to make it retrospective.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on Section 12.  I have in mind <Col N="1251" /> a very sad case which could come under this section.  It is that of a man who was dead two days before the award came, and his wife could not get the money which was coming to him.</P>
    <P>Let me conclude by again appealing to the Minister to try and increase the special allowance from the present rate of 30/-.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. A. Byrne Mr. A. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I, with other Members of the House, join in the congratulations extended to the Minister for his efforts to improve the lot of the Army men and to improve the lot of the ex-Army men who served in the days gone by.  Deputy McGrath drew the Minister's attention to certain cases where the means test is causing hardship.  I would make an earnest appeal that where there are payments to ex-Army men or ex-I.R.A. men the means test should be withdrawn entirely.  I have known instances where, when members of a family got a very small job with small wages, the pensioner instantly lost a few shillings off the pension which he had earned through his service.</P>
      <P>The Minister is also aware&mdash;and I would ask him to stop me immediately if this point has been dealt with&mdash;that several times I and other Deputies raised questions in this House in regard to the men who went out from 1945 up to 31st August, 1946.  They went out at the lower rate of pension &mdash;at the same time expecting that they would receive the increase.  They were given to understand that the increase was for N.C.O.s and men who had completed 21 years' pensionable service. I have here a letter from a leader of one of the organisations which looks after ex-servicemen.  It explains clearly what the men had hoped for.  It reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Thanks for text of Army Pensions Bill.  It is to be regretted, however, that the Minister has made no move in regard to the N.C.O.s and men who were encouraged to leave after the publication of the White Paper in 1945.  As you are aware, N.C.O.s and men were advised to go out on pension, as the age limit for the new Army was 32 years of age for N.C.O.s and men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1252" /> As an encouragement for these men to go out it was understood that their pension was being increased. The men who went out from 1945, up to 31st August, 1946, went on the lower rate of pension, at the same time expecting that they would receive the increase as they were given to understand that the increase was for N.C.O.s and men who completed 21 years' pensionable service.</P>
    <P>The Government at the time dated the increase as from 2nd September, 1946, which meant that about 300 N.C.O.s and men who had gone did not benefit.  At the same time the officers who went with them received the increase, being covered by six months' leave of absence.  Since this Government has been in office, we have got no decision on the matter, only that our case is being considered. Every other case has been dealt with&mdash;teachers, civil servants, ex-R.I.C., and the present Army Bill dealing with disability pensions.</P>
    <P>Apart from seeking this increase, there is the moral injustice, as we consider that we were led up the garden path.  You, sir, have asked the Ministers in both Governments to settle this question and the ex-servicemen appreciate your efforts on our behalf.  We would feel grateful if you could manage to fit in a question, before the Recess, requesting the Minister to give a decisive answer one way or the other.</P>
    <P>Again thanking you for all you have done for the ex-servicemen,</P>
    <P Just="Right">Faithfully yours,</P>
    <P Just="Right">J&mdash;&mdash;P&mdash;&mdash;T.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister whether he has done anything in accordance with his promise.  Other members asked this question several times within the last year or two.  These few hundred men still feel aggrieved because they went out&mdash;and were encouraged to go out&mdash; a month or two before the new increases came into being.  I would again appeal on their behalf to the Minister, who has done so much and done it so well.  I believe he will do better. Having done so much for the Army men, he ought not to leave 300 men, who served the Army well, feeling aggrieved in the way they feel at present.</P>

      <P>This matter of the dead-line of the 2nd September, 1946, is one of some importance.  I think I was the first person to raise this matter in the House in the time of the previous Government.  I do not intend to repeat the general case to be made for it, which will be found already in the Official Reports, somewhere around the Estimates for 1947 or some similar occasion in that year.  The important point is that, from about the fall of Germany onwards, from the end of the war in the West, when it was apparent that the war was ending soldiers were encouraged to leave the Forces.  I think that applied to some officers also.  Efforts were being made by the Government at the time, and the staff had been directed to make what preparations could be made, to find employment for soldiers going out &mdash;and particularly for regular soldiers who were going out on age limit or service completed at that time.  Certain vacancies were occurring and men &mdash;both N.C.O.s, officers and men&mdash; were encouraged to go into them and they went.  Many of those men, both to my personal knowledge and the knowledge of other Deputies in the House who know something about the Army, were some of the very best that were in the Army.  In fact, it was because of their personal qualifications, their characters, that it was relatively easier for those men to get a job at that time.  Many of those men went before the 2nd September, 1946.  However, they found themselves later in the position that, having gone out&mdash; to some extent as the result of indirect pressure, shall I call it, or suggestions, prompted by considerations of gradual demobilisation, so as to avoid a rush&mdash; these men found that they would not have the benefits that accrued to those who hung on until later.  Anyone who was there at that time will remember that, during that period in 1945 and the early part of 1946, anyone who had anywhere to go was encouraged to go. Consequently, I think there is a case to be made for this and it has been made already by a number of Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very hard to see on what basis other than an administrative one there can be justification for hitting that <Col N="1254" /> line.  I have in mind, as I speak, some N.C.O.s who were literally the very best that the Army had and who had given very faithful service over a number of years.  They went out to jobs, such as that of dock policemen, before that date and, consequently, there is a differentiation from people who went out after that date.</P>

      <P>This Bill undoubtedly removes a number of grievances which we all have met with in the course of the last few years, grievances which arose under the interpretation of the existing legislation.  It is certainly to be welcomed in that respect.  I would like to congratulate the Minister particularly on Section 9, which extends <Col N="1255" /> the date for the application for medals, to bring some of the now rather old people who fought for the establishment of our freedom into line for the special allowances.  There is one phrase in that section which I think may be stereotyping the thing rather than settling it.</P>
      <P>I had a case last year of a man who had a special allowance and who was an old age pensioner and whose wife also was an old age pensioner.  His wife died; and he was immediately stopped the old age pension for her. Under the Act, he was entitled to an increase in his special allowance, but he found he could not get that until 12 months had elapsed from the last revision.  As far as I am aware, that was only a Departmental regulation up to this.  The Minister is now putting it into Section 9, line 29, setting out distinctly that the special allowance shall be subject to periodic review not more frequently than once a year. This particular man had to suffer that loss for six weeks, but it is quite possible that a man might have to suffer it for 11 or 11½ months.  In the case of people like this who have given service to the nation and who are now on a very small pittance it is not fair that the regulations should make them suffer a financial loss.  We are now putting it actually into legislation, as I see it, and I want to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that some means should be found by which recipients of these very small allowances should not be at a financial loss owing to the administration of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very sorry that there does not seem to be any provision in this Bill to ease the means test which is in force in regard to these special allowances. In some cases it seems to be working very grievously against the recipients. The Minister should give further consideration to that aspect of the matter and, if he does, I am sure he will find himself in sympathy with that view and find some way of dealing with it. The allowances are very meagre, and so far I have not seen anything about increasing them in these cases and in the case of Army service pensions as <Col N="1256" /> they are being increased in other cases. I hope that when the Minister does bring in the Bill dealing with Army service pensions he will consider the question of the special allowances.  I know that some of these people are in a very bad way and surely it is not too much to ask that these people who gave service to the nation should be placed above the starvation level in their declining years.</P>

      <P>The Army Pensions Bill, 1949, having received commendation, approval and a general welcome from the ex-Minister for Defence, Deputy Traynor, nothing remains for us to do except to join in the chorus of praise accorded to the Minister. There is one aspect of the matter, however, on which I should like to touch very briefly.  It has reference to the means test.  I am sure each Deputy could elaborate the points made by some of the Opposition speakers in reference to the hardship suffered by pensioners under the means test regulations. It struck me that a very good case was argued against the means test, inadvertently perhaps, by the Minister for Finance to-day.  I think I should draw the fact to his attention and it may cause a re-examination of this question of the means test.  When we were dealing with the Superannuation and Retired Allowances Supplementary Estimates, the House will recall that the Minister for Finance was urged to establish a minimum pension of £50.  He expressed, I take it, sympathy with this idea were it confined to a rather small class of teachers and those who came under the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  But, in regard to Army pensions, he stated, if I recollect correctly, that no such sympathy could be shown as the Army pensions were not granted for the purpose of support, for the purpose of enabling a person to improve his livelihood. They were, he said, granted in recognition of service rendered to the nation.</P>

      <P>Yes.  It appears to me anyway that that would be a basis for re-examination of the case.  I can see the point that the Minister for Finance could not agree with that.  But, undoubtedly, the time should come when, in consonance with the larger view of things on a basis of social welfare, the idea of a means test should be a thing of the past and I would urge that the Minister for Finance should take a progressive view and be a pioneer and have the glory of being the first, in regard to the regulations administered by his Department, to have this means test either minimised or abolished for ever.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>This code is known as the Army Pensions Acts.  The Army Pensions Acts originated in 1923 and they deal mainly with wound and disability pensions.  In the public mind, Army pensions mean military service pensions.  It is very hard to get the public to distinguish between this code and military service pensions.  It would be well if this code was known as the disability pension code.  I welcome the provisions of Section 2 of the Bill.  The Minister should see that the same provisions apply to military service pensions.  Section 9 extends the date for applications for medals by members of the I.R.A. and I welcome that provision also.  Persons permanently disabled and incapable of self-support by reason of permanent infirmity of body or mind, as the code lays down, can apply now for the allowances provided for under the Act.  I do not think Section 12 is anything new in the Army pensions legislation. <Col N="1258" /> That has already been provided for under other Acts.</P>
      <P>I wonder will the provision in Section 12 apply to a person who is granted an allowance under this Bill and by reason of the fact that he was permanently detained in hospital and that there was an assessment of £40 placed on his means.  He was deprived of £40, but that provision was withdrawn by the present Minister and so that assessment of £40 is not to apply in future cases.  In the particular case I have in mind, the investigation officer assessed the means of the person concerned at £5 a year, with £40 because he was permanently detained in hospital. He was a married man.  The balance up to £85 was paid for one year.  The man died and his wife is still living.  I wonder does Section 12 enable the Minister to pay the amount that was withheld by the State in those circumstances?</P>
      <P>As regards Section 13, it operates in this way.  If an applicant for a special allowance or a disability pension owes the State a sum of money, the State is taking power to hold up the payment of the pension until there is an inquiry. If the amount due is more than the current amount of the pension, it can withhold the full pension until the debt is paid.  Why should the State take authority to do that when the person concerned must, of necessity, be incapable of self-support by reason of permanent infirmity of body or mind? I think the Minister should drop that provision in the section.  If such a person owes a debt to the State, well the State can well afford to let it go.</P>
      <P>I do not see anything in the Bill which enables the Minister to have the ceiling figure in the means test raised where allowances are paid in respect of members of the forces who were killed or died on service, and whose parents were in receipt of an allowance. It may be that some such provision will be included in some future Bill.  I am drawing attention to it so that it will get consideration. I think that, with the exception of the point that I have mentioned in regard to Section 13, the Bill will meet with the approval of members of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with Deputies who were confused about the very many Army Pensions Acts which have been passed under different names &mdash;Army Pensions Acts, Military Services Pensions Acts, Defence Forces Pensions Acts and others.  I do not mind confessing that, at the moment, I could not speak with any certainty of the total number of different Acts dealing with the Forces as a whole.  This debate strayed in and out through several Acts that are not before the House.</P>
      <P>With regard to points that do strictly relate to this Bill, I think it was Deputy Traynor who referred to the section which gives power to restore forfeited pensions, and asked, I suppose in view of the small numbers concerned, if we were taking power to restore pensions forfeited under the Military Service Pensions Act.  This Bill refers only to Army pensions, and so I can only take power under it to restore forfeited Army pensions.  Under the pensions amending legislation foreshadowed for the Autumn, power will be taken to restore forfeited military service pensions.</P>
      <P>With regard to the section referred to by Deputy Hilliard and other Deputies which gives power to withhold pensions until claims by the State against a potential pensioner have been satisfied, I can say that such a power has been given in every Act passed since 1927.  This is an amending Bill, and is merely carrying the same power in it.  It is, I think, a normal provision, provided that it is not abused by undue delay in dealing with claims.  There is nothing unjust in it.  I certainly never had any evidence or any complaint to the effect that this power has ever been used in the past so as to induce a person waiting for a pension to accept liability for a debt that was not, in fact, a debt.  That certainly never has come under my notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with gratuities to dependents other than the wife and children of a deceased soldier, there was always, in all Acts, a very clear obligation on the claimant to establish dependency.  Dependency, total or partial, had to be proved, and the onus of doing so was on the dependent who <Col N="1260" /> was claiming.  It was always, of course, customary for a soldier to make an allotment out of his pay to his wife. The machinery of the paying and the accounting department was placed at the service of the soldier for such a purpose.  Within the last two years, that machinery has been placed at the service of the soldier for the purpose of making an allotment out of his pay to any other dependent, or partially dependent relative, other than his wife.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowan raised a point with regard to the first line A and B Reserves. The A and B Reserves have been amalgamated into the first line and the particular section the Deputy is referring to is merely extending the benefits.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that, but the point I am not clear on is this. If this section is passed in its present form, it may operate to cause a hardship to people who belong to the A and B Reserve, who are now discharged and who are not in the first line at the moment.</P>

      <P>Deputy McGrath and other Deputies spoke with special reference to the means test as applied to the people in receipt of special allowances. In that connection all I can say is that it is never good policy to spur a willing horse.  The regulations under which the special allowance is granted were there as part of the Act of 1946.  My predecessor and myself, in our time, have been particularly alert and awake to any complaints made with regard to any injustice arising out of the application of the means test. The only change made in the application of the means test since 1946, step by step, has been in the direction of relaxing its application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But you cannot relax the means test to the point of boring a hole through the parent Act.  The parent Act was regarded by Deputies in all sections of the House as a particularly worthy and generous measure.  It was not an Act to grant so much money to a person <Col N="1261" /> unable to work who had a medal.  It was not in the form of a pension, where you gave so much money to a person because he was in a certain condition of health and had rendered service.  It was an Act which enabled the Minister for Defence to bring the income of people to a certain named figure in the event of their being single, and a higher figure if they were married.  In other words, the means test in some shape or form is implicit and is contained in the Act and cannot be withdrawn by any regulations.</P>
    <P>How exactly the means test is operated is a matter of machinery and triangular regulations.  Any change taken with regard to that has been to reduce the incidence of the means test in so far as it is pressing unduly on any particular person.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In all other cases that is the standard year.  The general attitude of both Departments with regard to the investigation and with regard to the application of the means <Col N="1262" /> test is to be as lenient as possible to the applicant.  Cases were raised in the past, and it was mentioned by Deputy Hilliard, that if people were in hospital, people in receipt of the special allowance, or in a sanatorium, the appropriate value of their maintenance in the hospital or the sanatorium was counted as means and, consequently, they forfeited the whole of the special allowance, or a considerable portion of it.  In that respect&mdash; and it is a fairly big item&mdash;the condition governing the means test was removed, so that there is no reduction because of hospital, sanatorium or other institutional treatment.</P>
      <P>As regards the case Deputy Traynor referred to, that type of case, too, has been removed from being penalised by the means test and that particular case is now, I am informed, in receipt of an allowance.  The general inclination of the Departments concerned in dealing with these people in receipt of special allowances is to be as sympathetic as possible and, as far as I am a cog in that particular piece of machinery, my outlook is to be as easy as possible with them and reduce their pension by the minimum.</P>

Sub-section (2) gives power to withhold until the amount of the deduction is ascertained.

      <P>Thirteen is what they call the unlucky number.  Sub-section (1) of that section is all right. It is similar to what has appeared in <Col N="1264" /> all Army Pension Acts up to the present. The Department have found a certain difficulty in administration where a claim may be pending against a man and there may be some doubt about it.  The man insists on being paid his pension and the Department have no option but to pay him.  The Department had no authority to withhold payment.  Now, in case of doubt, this section will give them authority to withhold.  That being so, the pension may be withheld for quite a long period while the question as to whether or not there is a claim is under consideration, probably between the Department of Defence and the Department of Finance.  That may operate harshly against particular individuals and, for that reason, I do not like to see this sub-section incorporated in the present Bill.  If the Minister would agree to consider it in view of what I have said and to delete it in the Seanad, that would meet my point. I do not want to bind him to saying that he will delete it in the Seanad.  I ask him to consider it.</P>

      <P>It is a matter of practice.  The Deputy is correct in saying that that particular sub-section does not appear in the parent Act.  I am correct in saying that, whether or not it does appear in the parent Act, the practice has always been to hold up the pension, or the payment of any moneys, until the &ldquo;all clear&rdquo; signal is given.  We are merely putting into the Act now in an open and above board way, the practice that has always been there.  As the Deputy indicated, it does not say that the pension &ldquo;shall&rdquo; or &ldquo;will&rdquo; be withheld until all these claims are ascertained.  It merely gives power to do so.  It is purely permissive.  A great number of Deputies have show themselves very interested in Army pensions.  I am glad that they are interested.  If that power is exercised and a case is made that there is undue hardship involved on the individual through the exercise of such powers, I shall certainly not&mdash; and I believe no other Minister would &mdash;continue to withhold the payment of pension, because there is always another instalment coming on which can be utilised to meet any debt in cases of hardship.</P>

      <P>I have come up against it in a certain way.  There may be, for instance, that form of claim.  Now, under sub-section (1) the Minister is entitled to deduct any moneys that are due to the State. Nobody could object to that.  But where it is not established that there is money due to the State and there is a doubt, if the pensioner consults a solicitor and the solicitor writes a pretty stiff letter to the Minister, the pension is released straightaway at the present time, because the Minister has no authority to withhold it.  Now, the pensioner may consult a solicitor; the solicitor may write as strong and as abusive a letter as he likes to the Minister, but the Minister has power to withhold it.  I do not want to delay the Bill by fighting that particular issue.  I have pointed out the defect to the Minister and I would like him to consider it between this and the time when the Bill comes before the Seanad. If he likes to introduce an amendment then, well and good.  I have done my duty.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The purpose of this Bill is to enable widows' pensions and children's allowances to be granted to the widow and children of any Minister, Ceann Comhairle or Parliamentary Secretary who dies in office irrespective of whether or not he has qualified by having been in office for a certain period.  The amendment is directed to Section 20 of the Act of 1938.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under that Act, payment to a widow or to children is restricted to cases in <Col N="1266" /> which the holder of the office at the date of his death would himself have been entitled to a pension if he had ceased to hold such office.  The existing statutory minimum period required for qualifying is three years.  A widow's pension is fixed at half the rate which her deceased husband would have got had he remained alive.  Where the husband's pension is based on a minimum of three years, the widow's pension would be £150 in the case of the widow of a Minister or Ceann Comhairle and £100 in the case of the widow of a Parliamentary Secretary.  If the amendment is passed, the widow's pension will be payable at a minimum rate; in the case which has a definite relationship on this matter, it will be a sum of £150. If it applies to the widow of a Parliamentary Secretary it will be at the rate of £100.  The normal rate of children's allowances, which are £30 if the widow is still alive and £50 if she is dead, will be payable in the new circumstances. The provisions are made retrospective to take effect as from the passing of the main Act; that is, 22nd December, 1938.  These pensions payable to such widows and to a certain number of children&mdash;I think it is likely to be two children, and I have not got the ages at the moment&mdash;will be increased if in the autumn the Dáil agrees to what I forecasted to-day, namely, specific provision to increase them.  They will be the only Central Fund payments that will be increased&mdash; that is, the pensions and allowances to the widows and children of Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries.  No increased payment will be made until such legislation is brought before the House.  Prior to the passing of the Act, payment at the old rate will be made in respect of such widows and children.</P>

      <P>Some days ago the Government Whips approached us and informed us of the Government's desire to introduce and enact this Bill before the Summer Recess.  We were supplied with a copy of the Bill.  The Government Whips requested that we should consider it.  We were given to understand that the Government's action might depend upon our decision and we were requested to inform the Government whether or not we would <Col N="1267" /> oppose the Bill.  The Bill was considered at a meeting of our Party.  I think it is right I should say that at the beginning of our consideration of the Bill there was considerable divergence of viewpoints amongst us.  As our discussion and consideration of the Bill proceeded, however, towards agreement, it was decided to seek information from the Government Whips as to the attitude of the various Parties comprising the Government Coalition. We were informed by the Government Whips that all of the Parties in the Government Coalition were supporting the Bill and on that assurance we decided that we would not oppose it or seek to divide the Dáil on it.</P>
      <P>This legislation, which provides for the payment of pensions to former Ministers of State and other retired Parliamentary officers and their widows after their deaths, has been the subject of considerable and often unfair comment at political meetings. I think that it is not out of order for me, on the occasion of the introduction of this amending Bill, to give a very brief synopsis of the history of the principal Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The idea of providing pensions for Ministers, Parliamentary Secretaries and other Parliamentary officers was under consideration here for many years.  I think I am correct in saying that it was considered by a Committee of the Dáil during the period of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government, on the initiative of that Government.  The Committee, however, did not produce an agreed report and no action followed from its deliberations.  Later, when the Fianna Fáil Government was in office, the matter was again taken up by the Fine Gael Party.  Representatives of the Fine Gael Party discussed the idea with representatives of the Fianna Fáil Government and urged on the Fianna Fáil Government that legislation to provide for such pensions should be enacted.  The Fianna Fáil Government was impressed by the case that was made and, although it fully realised that responsibility for the introduction of such legislation would carry political penalties, nevertheless it decided to proceed towards the establishment of an all-Party Committee <Col N="1268" /> to consider the form that the legislation should take.  That Committee met and reached agreement.  It was composed of the representatives of all the Parties then in the House, the Fianna Fáil Party, the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party.  The conclusions of the Committee were reached with evidence of complete agreement amongst all three Parties but, as is now well known, when the report of the Committee was drafted not all the members of the Committee signed it, certain members from the Labour Party not being available for that purpose. When the legislation based upon the Committee's report was submitted to the Dáil, I must say, in tribute to the Fine Gael Party, that they loyally supported here the recommendations which their representatives on the Committee had helped to frame.  I think the present Minister for Defence acted as spokesman for the Party and proclaimed himself as proud to sponsor the measure in the House.</P>
    <P>To our astonishment, however, a similar line was not taken by the Labour Party.  The leader of that Party announced that it had been decided to leave the action of individual members to their individual discretion and he himself, despite the encouragement he had given to the preparation and the introduction of the Bill, voted against it.  Later, the action of the Fianna Fáil Government in introducing and securing the enactment of that Bill was subjected to considerable misrepresentation. It was, as I have indicated, accepted by us as a political burden that we had to carry.  Other Parties which have since emerged joined in the campaign against our Party, which was initiated by a section of the Labour Party, on the grounds of having introduced that Bill.  It is, I think, reasonable for me now to express the hope that the decision of all these Parties to support this amending Bill indicates the termination of that campaign; indicates their acceptance of the desirability of having legislation of the character of the Ministerial and Parliamentary Officers Act on the Statute Book and that there will not be, either in relation to Fianna Fáil or any other Party, any misrepresentation of their motives in supporting that legislation. <Col N="1269" /> If the introduction of this Bill, with the support of all the Parties comprising the Government Coalition, serves that purpose then it will effect not merely what is, in my view, a desirable amendment of the law but another purpose perhaps equally useful.</P>

      <P>It is regrettable that that note should have been introduced. There are matters in connection with Ministerial pensions to which a very big section of the electorate take exception. The form of speech which we have just heard, which was delivered in an effort to stifle individual opinion in this House, will serve no useful purpose. I do accept that when the Fianna Fáil Government introduced this pensions legislation, they did so on a general request from the House. I accept that the all-Party Committee which was formed had before it strong evidence to justify the proposal but, in spite of that, I feel, and I have always felt, that this House is not the place in which matters of Ministerial pensions should have been decided. This House is vested with certain powers which are operated on behalf of the people.  We are trustees of the people and we should carry out our duties in accordance with the wishes of the electorate, but when it comes to a matter of awarding ourselves pensions, in my view that is a matter which should be submitted to a referendum of the people.  If we had the people's decision on that matter there would be no scope for criticism, good, bad or indifferent in regard to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill introduced by the Minister has apparently the support of all Parties in this House.  It affects one particular case.  It affects the case of a man who was Minister for a short period but we must remember that, <Col N="1270" /> although he was Minister for only a short period, he served in this House for a long number of years and that he had devoted himself, in the interests of his constituents and of the country, to the work and the business of this House.  Shortly after the general election, when he became Minister, I discussed with him this problem of a Dáil Deputy who after many years of service might find himself in the position of being defeated or who might die and leave a widow. The late Minister was of opinion that, we as a Parliament, should have a fund to which each and every one of us should subscribe, whereby we would make provision for a case of hardship such as that.  I think this Bill gives the opportunity to refer to that matter.  In the normal way, I would take exception to the Bill but because of certain matters that arose over the last year or for more than a year, any objection by me might be misinterpreted.  Once we have, as apparently we have, the unanimous wish of the House that this Bill should be passed, I take it that as far as this particular measure is concerned there will be no scope for criticism at least within the House.</P>
    <P>As I said in the beginning, I deeply regret that Deputy Lemass, speaking to the Bill, did not confine himself to the question before the House. So far as I am concerned, opportunities may offer when I may have to discuss this matter of Ministerial pensions in public.  I shall be quite prepared to do that and the attempt that was made by Deputy Lemass tonight to close the lips of Deputies or others in regard to that matter will not succeed.  The Bill proposes a very small pension for the widow of a person who has given to the State very long and very satisfactory service and, because of that I am quite sure that every Deputy irrespective of Party, whether he belongs to a Party at all or not, will give the Bill his full support.</P>

      <P>I have only three points to make in relation to the Second Reading of this piece of legislation. I am not accepting the accuracy of the historical review which <Col N="1271" /> Deputy Lemass gave nor any of the implications which he has tried to put forward in regard to the approval of this measure.  The second is that this piece of legislation puts the widow and children of a person holding qualifying office exactly in the same position as that which is given in another regard under the Presidential Establishment Act, 1938.  The third is in regard to the matter raised by Deputy Cowan of the fund, which goes outside Ministers or Parliamentary Secretaries.  I understand that that matter is under consideration by the Committee of Procedure and Privileges.</P>

      <P>The object of this Bill is to amend the provisions of Sections 11 and 17 of the Rent Restrictions Act, 1946, in relation to the special lawful additions to the basic rent in respect of what I may describe as exceptional repairs executed by the landlord.  The provisions in question have given rise to unforeseen difficulties in practice which have made amending legislation imperative and a matter of urgency. It is only right that I should, at the outset of my remarks, express my gratitude to Senator Miss Pearse for drawing my attention to the matter in the first instance and so enabling the situation that had arisen to be brought under review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Paragraph (g) of Section 11 (2) and paragraph (e) of Section 17 (2) of the Act of 1946, which the Bill proposes to amend, are identical.  They provide that if a landlord, in any of the five pairs of years in the period 1945 to 1950 inclusive, expends an amount in excess of two-thirds of the basic rent on putting the premises into a reasonable state of repair, he shall be entitled to increase the lawful rent by a sum equal to 15 per cent. per annum of the amount by which his expenditure exceeds two-thirds of the basic rent.  I think it is clear that the Legislature, when enacting these provisions in 1946, had in mind the difficult situation in which the landlords of controlled property were placed.  On the one hand they were compelled by the law to accept restricted rents&mdash; severely restricted, one might say, particularly in the case of premises that were still controlled on the 1914 basis&mdash;while, on the other hand, the Rent Restrictions Code had, from the <Col N="1273" /> beginning, made the position of landlords more difficult, so far as liability for repairs was concerned, by placing special remedies at the disposal of tenants and, moreover, there were the powers of local authorities under the Public Health and Housing Acts to compel the carrying out of repairs by landlords.  Landlords were able to complain with some force that controlled rents were inadequate to permit of the discharge even in a limited degree of their liabilites in respect of repairs, especially in view of the greatly increased cost of repairs.  One solution would have been to have allowed rents to be increased to such an extent as might have been considered necessary to compensate landlords for the increased cost of repairs. But, this would have resulted in automatic and, perhaps, substantial increases of rents for all tenants&mdash;a situation which, I am bound to say, could scarcely have been viewed with equanimity.</P>
    <P>Confronted with the dilemma which I have endeavoured briefly to outline, the Legislature in 1946 decided that an increase of rent should be allowed in respect of repairs, only when the repairs had actually been executed by the landlord to an extent which involved outlay in a particular period in excess of a specified proportion of the basic rent.  Such a provision seemed to have the advantages that tenants could not be asked to pay increased rents until the repairs had been done and that landlords would be encouraged, or could be compelled, to carry out necessary repairs and be assured of an increase in rent to recoup them their expenditure.  It is true, perhaps, that the provision was, in principle, open to the objection that it placed a premium upon neglect of repairs but to labour this objection too much would be to ignore the realities of the situation in which landlords had been placed for many years during which rents had continued to be severely restricted while repair costs had continued to mount.  At all events, it seemed to accord with the requirements of a sound public policy, apart from any question of endeavouring to do justice to landlords, to have the state of the law such that there would <Col N="1274" /> be an incentive to landlords to carry out necessary repairs even though this might involve some increase of rents for tenants.</P>
    <P>The provisions in this respect that were incorporated in the 1946 Act were not novel.  Provisions on identical lines had been included in the Rent Acts of 1923 and 1926 covering repair work carried out in any pair of years in the period 1923 to 1928.  One can only speculate at this stage as to the reasons why, in respect of this particular kind of repair expenditure, the percentage was fixed at the seemingly high figure of 15, while the allowance in respect of other kinds of expenditure by the landlord, for example, expenditure on improvements or structural alterations, was restricted to 8 per cent. in both the 1923 and 1946 Acts. One reason that suggests itself is that the 15 per cent. allowance was reckonable only on the excess of the landlord's expenditure over two-thirds of the basic rent so that the net return on his gross expenditure would, in fact, be less than 15 per cent.  This, in turn, suggests that what was contemplated was expenditure on repairs which, while not trifling, was not, on the other hand, of such an amount that two-thirds of the basic rent would be so insignificant a proportion of it that, in practice, the landlord would receive a return of virtually 15 per cent. on his total expenditure.  Such a result could scarcely have been envisaged as there appears to be no good reason why a net return of nearly 15 per cent. should have been allowed in respect of expenditure on repairs while the allowance in respect of expenditure on improvements or structural alterations was limited to 8 per cent.</P>
    <P>Whatever may have been the reasons underlying the provisions in question. Deputies will, I think, now be satisfied that they have produced results in practice which were certainly not foreseen. Two factors appear to have been overlooked, namely, (a) the possibility that repairs amounting almost to total reconstruction might be necessary involving correspondingly heavy expenditure, and (b) the greatly increased cost of repairs.  The second of these is, of course, in a sense, merely an aggravation of the first.  As Deputies will <Col N="1275" /> readily realise, when a sum running into several hundreds of pounds or, perhaps, a thousand pounds or more is spent by the landlord on repairs and the landlord is allowed to increase the rent by 15 per cent. per annum of the amount by which that expenditure exceeds two-thirds of the basic rent (which would be a relatively insignificant figure), the result is a wholly disproportionate increase in the rent of the premises.  Cases have actually occurred in which the result of the operation of the provisions which the Bill proposes to amend has been to double, treble and even quadruple the existing rents.  Clearly, if this situation were allowed to continue, it could only result for many tenants in the complete deprivation of the protection which the Rent Restrictions Code was intended to provide for them as there might be such a disproportionate increase of rents as to leave the tenants with no alternative but to give up possession. In these circumstances, I felt that the matter was one which called for the immediate attention of the Legislature and the Government's proposals for dealing with the situation are embodied in the Bill now before the House.</P>
    <P>In considering the proposals in the Bill I want Deputies to bear in mind two things.  Firstly, the proposals are of an <i>ad hoc</i> character framed to deal with the <i>de facto</i> situation that now confronts us in a number of actual cases and, secondly, these proposals fall to be considered in the light of the fact that the Act of 1946 is itself due to expire at the end of next year so that there will be a further opportunity of reviewing the whole position in the near future.  The Bill proposes that, as on and from its enactment, the allowance to the landlord in respect of expenditure on repairs should be modified to a sum calculated in accordance with the scale set out in the Schedule, that is, at the rate of 15 per cent. per annum on the first £100 of the excess of the landlord's expenditure over two-thirds of the basic rent, 8 per cent on the second £100 and 6 per cent. on any amount over £200.  It is true that, even on this modified scale, comparatively substantial increases of rent <Col N="1276" /> will still be possible.  But we have to face the fact that landlords, apart from their liability in the matter of repairs under contract or at common law or under the Rent Restrictions Act, are often compelled by the local authority to carry out substantial repairs and that it would be wholly unreasonable, having regard to the severely restricted rents permitted under the Act, to expect landlords to carry out such repairs without giving them some increase of rent.</P>
    <P>As regards those cases in which rents have already been increased under Sections 11 (2) (g) or 17 (2) (e) of the 1946 Act, the rents will be automatically adjusted as from the passing of this Bill on the basis of the new scale and Section 3 of the Bill contains provision which will enable any tenant who, through being unaware of the passage of this amending legislation, goes on paying the increased rent to recover the difference between that rent and the adjusted rent in respect of any period after the enactment of the Bill.  In addition to any other method of recovery, the tenant will be able to recover any such sum by withholding the rent until he has recouped himself the amount.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to pretend that the proposals in the Bill provide the ideal solution but I feel that I can recommend them to the House as providing the best practicable solution in the circumstances confronting us.  Deputies will appreciate that, as I have already mentioned, we are legislating to deal with a <i>de facto</i> situation in which a number of landlords have exercised their legitimate rights under the Act of 1946 and this is something which we cannot entirely ignore.  It may well be that, when the whole question comes to be dealt with again, a more radical solution may have to be attempted for the problem presented by the conflicting needs of a reasonable standard of repair on the one hand and of a rent within the means of the tenant on the other hand.  I am bound to say that at this stage it is not easy to see what the solution for this problem may be and we can only hope that it will not prove wholly intractable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess that, when I was informed that the <Col N="1277" /> Minister contemplated bringing in a special Bill to deal with this problem, I did not quite see the manner in which he would tackle it.  I think that, everything considered, seeing that he is confining himself merely to closing this particular loophole, the method which he adopted is probably the best that could be conveniently evolved.  However, in that connection, I should like to say some things about these sub-sections and I take paragraph (g) of sub-section (2) of Section 11 as an example.  If one parses that sub-section, one finds certain difficulty, which, I think, the courts have already experienced, in dealing with the section.  The precise meaning of the phrase &ldquo;comprising the two years&rdquo;&mdash;it goes on to specify the years&mdash;has, in itself, given rise to difficulty, and, in particular, the phrase &ldquo;in excess of two-thirds of the basic rent of the premises&rdquo; has given rise to difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulty in regard to &ldquo;comprising&rdquo; is a matter of the precise definition of the period of years, but the difficulty in regard to two-thirds of the basic rent is that basic rent in the Act, as the Minister will appreciate, is defined in the definition section with reference to Section 9, in the case of 1923 Act controlled premises and Sections 14, 15 and 16 of non-1923 Act controlled premises.  If one then goes to these sections with references to which basic rent is defined, one will see that the period to which basic rent relates is not defined in the Act.  The reason is obvious, that, in practical cases, one might have to deal with a weekly, monthly or yearly tenancy.  The Act does not explicitly within these sections relate the basic rent to a particular period of time.  That fact causes certain difficulty in interpreting these paragraphs which are in question in this Bill, and I understand, though I have no personal knowledge of the matter, nor do I know of any reported case on the subject at the moment&mdash;on the other hand, I have heard it mentioned in professional circles that the question has arisen&mdash;that &ldquo;two-thirds of the basic rent&rdquo; has been related to the basic rent over a period of two years rather than one year.  Obviously <Col N="1278" /> this was an attempt by the courts on their own to ameliorate the situation which the Minister designs to amend here to-day, since such an interpretation would, in effect, substitute fourthirds of the basic rent when the basic rent is related to one year and to that extent would operate in some degree in the direction in which the Minister is moving.</P>
    <P>I merely mention the matter now for the purpose of ensuring that we advert to the fact that, if the decision to which I have referred&mdash;a decision which, I think, is a Circuit Court decision and which has not been universally adopted, even in the Circuit Court&mdash;should rule, we must regard this amendment as applying to that particular interpretation of that paragraph of Section 11 (2) and, correspondingly, I presume, to a similar interpretation of Section 17.  I do not think that, in the cases the Minister is contemplating, it is going to make very much difference when we regard this Bill merely as an interim measure for a year.  The only point I make therefore is that it might operate completely, or virtually completely, to deprive a landlord, in the case of very small repairs, but, as against that, it is to be noted that the Minister has preserved the 15 per cent. for the first £100, so that the question is not serious with relation to this Bill.  The serious matter, however, is that when the Minister is considering the Rent Restrictions Act as a whole, and, in particular, reconsidering these provisions, a radical redrafting of this sub-section or paragraph in the light of experience is indicated.  The Minister will be in a better position than anybody else to get information from rent tribunals in regard to this matter and I would suggest to him that he should secure that information.</P>
    <P>I have heard it mentioned no later than to-day, by a person who knew what he was talking about in regard to this matter, that there were 17 possible amendments in this paragraph.  I must confess that, on a cursory examination here, I have not been able to find the 17 possible amendments which he was talking about but, as I say, he pointed out that here were 17 possible questions <Col N="1279" /> arising out of this paragraph. That figure may be an exaggeration but certainly there are some&mdash;as I, on looking at it casually now, can see.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, the intention is to give the Minister this Bill and it is understood that amendments now would hardly be in order nor would they, perhaps, be desirable.  I mention them now for future reference.  In regard to the Bill, I think that we must pass it as a matter of urgency in view of the circumstances that have arisen.</P>

      <P>I am glad that the Minister introduced this Bill.  It will help to do a considerable lot of good for a small number of people&mdash;at least, a small number of people as far as I am aware of.  This particular part of the 1946 Act that the Minister is amending now has caused substantial hardship. I, personally, was aware of one case where the matter was referred to the court and, under the section, the rent was increased 300 per cent.  That was a shocking increase.  It certainly comes as a very welcome surprise to me that the Minister has introduced this Bill to put this matter in order. It may operate against a few landlords but that cannot be helped.  The provisions that are now being amended operated very severely against the tenants.  Some of these landlords insisted on their pound of flesh and, while they had the provisions of the Act there to support them, no reason, no common sense&mdash;nothing&mdash;prevailed with them.  However, the wheel is turning now and the effect of that turn will be undoubtedly welcomed by quite a number of tenants.  I would suggest to the Minister, although it is somewhat outside the scope of the present discussion, that when he comes to the consideration of the Act as a whole he ought to endeavour to simplify the whole procedure, which has become so complicated and involved that nobody understands it.  The courts have difficulty in interpreting it.  Lawyers, even those who are very familiar with Rent Act cases, have tremendous difficulty in finding their way through the Acts.  I would ask the Minister to endeavour to find some simple way by which rents can be fixed, probably by the District <Col N="1280" /> Court, without any of this reference back&mdash;certainly not to 1914.  The Minister's prompt action in regard to this matter will be welcomed and I am quite sure that if he is able to simplify the very involved condition in which the Rent Acts are now in he will earn the gratitude of all the people who have to do with the interpretation of those Acts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only a matter of weeks since I put down a question in this House asking the Minister if his attention had been drawn to certain proceedings in our courts bringing about a very serious position for a great number of our tenants of houses and also the danger of a position being reached whereby we might have a very serious situation.  I want publicly to pay tribute to the Minister in complimenting him on his very prompt action in coming to the aid of those who have been affected and of a great many more who have been threatened.  I welcome this amending Bill.  The Minister in his statement in reference to this matter has put out of my mind the discussion of certain matters here now because he has indicated quite clearly that within a very short period of time, when the Act we have expires, a comprehensive study will be made with a view to trying to adjust not only this position but others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A lot has been said on behalf of the decent landlord who is entitled to certain rights and to a certain profit on his property, and a certain very limited reference has been made to the type of landlord who seeks always to abuse&mdash;if he can get things to which he is not entitled by resorting to abusive methods&mdash;and to affect tenants very harshly.  What I have to thank the Minister for in this particular instance is that the cases which came to my knowledge were cases where landlords, in order to get possession of premises, thought out a scheme whereby they did not in any particular year or couple of years carry out what would be called necessary or essential repairs. They allowed buildings to get into such a state that the authorities had to be called in in order to force the landlords to comply with their responsibilities. Then, much more than <Col N="1281" /> necessary repairs were indulged in, with the result that if this position had been allowed to continue very many of our people would not have been able to afford to pay the rents which would be clapped on their backs.  Deputy Cowan referred to one particular and notorious case where the rent was increased to something like four times the size of the previous payment.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that the position in this State is that we cannot make this amending legislation retrospective because those who have been affected will now have to pay very substantial increases, even with the limitations which are now imposed upon the collecting of the charges by these new reduced percentages on the charges of £100 and £200.  I am sorry that cannot be cured but I agree that the principle of avoiding retrospective legislation is, in fact, a good one.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister is quite satisfied that the public are sufficiently aware of the rights they have under Section 20 (5) of the 1946 Act.  Under that sub-section the tenant has a right to be consulted in the first place with regard to repairs and if he is not consulted and if repairs are done which he may think are in fact above what the court would decide as necessary or what I would call &ldquo;essential repairs&rdquo; he has a right to go to court and appeal to have the matter investigated with a view to the actual charge being fixed by the court.  I want to be frank. I have to thank the Minister for having drawn my attention to this particular sub-section of the Act because I myself was unaware of it until the Minister drew my attention to it and I am grateful to him for having done so.  I should like him to refer to it because otherwise it may not get the publicity it deserves.</P>
    <P>There is one thing which I should like the Minister to refer to, if he cares to say what he thinks is the meaning of it, and that is the question whether he is satisfied that under Section 20 (5), where what might be regarded as a necessary expenditure on the part of the landlord takes place, there is a sufficient safeguard for the tenant&mdash;that a bad landlord will not, in fact, if he does the repairs himself or has some small contractor doing <Col N="1282" /> them for him, be able to charge more than what should be the normal value of the repairs done.</P>
    <P>I am glad that it has been decided to give the Minister all the Stages of this Bill to-night, as the matter is a very serious one.  I am glad that those who have had imposed upon them very extravagant increases in rent will now have an opportunity of having them reconsidered with a view to the reductions which this Bill will bring about.</P>
    <P>There is a type of small house where the rent is very low as compared with modern rents, and in many cases these are very old, almost cottage type, houses.  It appears to me that it would be very easy, in some of these cases, to spend £100 or £200 on these houses and thereby bring about a very substantial increase in the rent.  I am wondering whether the local authority could not be brought in in some way, in the Minister's comprehensive Bill which he is to introduce, as a safeguard for these people.  Numbers of tenants may be paying 7/-, 8/-, or even up to 12/6, a week for a particular type of small old-time house.  A quick calculation will show that, even under this Bill, if there is something slightly over £200 spent, it would mean an extra £23 a year chargeable to these houses, which would mean a net increase of something like 9/- a week.</P>
    <P>I am not approaching this in any carping manner.  I want to say, without any reservation at all, that the Minister deserves to be particularly congratulated, first of all on the manner in which he has attempted to give some serious protection to the tenants generally, and secondly for the quick manner in which he has had this matter examined and the speed with which it is before us here.  I also want to thank him publicly for the advice and information he and his Department have given me throughout the short period in which this matter was being discussed and considered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join in the tributes paid to the Minister for the expeditious manner in which he has met us in a very grave situation.  In view of the fact that the 1946 Act in itself contains a provision that it was to be reviewed not later than next <Col N="1283" /> year, any Minister might have let the matter ride until then.  Nevertheless, the Minister foresaw what was a very serious situation for certain tenants and it has been met to a certain degree by this particular amendment.</P>
      <P>I would like to reiterate, however, what my colleague, Deputy Briscoe, has said in regard to houses with low rents.  Under the terms of this amending Bill, even as it stands, these rents can still mount to completely disproportionate figures, compared with the original rent.  It occurred to me that the Minister might have gone a little further and put an over-all maximum on the amount of the permitted increases in relation to the amount expended on repairs, so that it would bear some relation to the market value of the house.  Many of the houses to which Deputy Briscoe referred have rents ranging from 2/6 to 10/- a week and they can be bought at present without vacant possession at as low as £100 and with vacant possession up to £300.  Even under the terms of the amending Bill, the rent chargeable on these houses can be doubled and quadrupled.</P>
      <P>Even if the Minister could not see his way to touch that particular aspect of the question now, I would ask him to have it very much present to his mind when he is considering the whole situation next year and try to introduce some prohibition, some overriding maximum of permitted increases, so as to bear a fairer relation to the market value of these small houses.  That would give those who are tenants at present and their successors in such houses reasonable security.  If the rent is disproportionately increased now, it will mean almost an eviction order on these particular tenants, who could not afford to pay much more&mdash;certainly not three times more&mdash;than they are asked to pay at present.</P>

      <P>I am glad that the Bill has been received in this particular way and the best thing I can do is to take the last argument first.  The 1946 Act does arrange for an overriding maximum&mdash;Section 20 (5) governs that &mdash;but the tenants up to the present where this has arisen have not made <Col N="1284" /> use of it.  I want to stress that point. Where these excessive improvements are carried out, if the tenants had availed of that section, this could not have occurred.  Even availing of it, as the law stood, there could be a very substantial increase of 15 per cent. on the capital expenditure.  The operative words in sub-section (5) are:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the court may, on the application of the tenant, if satisfied that the expenditure (in so far as it is applicable to any of the said matters) in respect of which the notice was served, was not incurred or was unnecessary in whole or in part, disallow or reduce the increase accordingly, as from such date (whether before the date of the application or otherwise) as the Court thinks fit.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That gives very wide power to the court.</P>

It is these particular cases I was directing attention to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Where a landlord by default lets the house go out of repair, the repairs are necessary by that time.  The court, on application under this sub-section (5), finds itself confronted with the position that the repairs are necessary.  Whatever about the method by which they become necessary, the court cannot find that they are unnecessary and so ground jurisdiction for the variation that this paragraph gives.  I think that is the essential difficulty.</P>

This new amendment to this particular section is protecting the tenant in a temporary way, at any rate, until we have examined the whole code.</P>
      <P>As has been pointed out, the Act expires in 1950 and it will not be a matter for the Minister and his Department alone to consider.  I invite Deputies on all sides of the House to assist us in that particular matter and try to get some measure which will be fair to all concerned.  It is not going to be easy.  I can see very great difficulties and I am sure everyone else can.  If, however, the matter is approached in the proper manner, I think we can and will get an equitable method of dealing with the problem.  I do not think there is anything further I can usefully say except that the matter must be reviewed next year.

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the motion standing in my name and that of Deputy Beegan:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Dáil is of opinion that the price of farmers' butter should be guaranteed by the Government at a price which will give the producer the same return for his milk as that received by the creamery suppliers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt that this will be a very popular motion and that it will get support and agreement from all sides of the House.  I am sure it is one which will appeal to all Deputies. There is nothing of a political nature in it and it is one which every individual Deputy and every group can support without doing any violence to themselves.  This matter was discussed on many occasions during the present year.  Every Deputy is aware that there is general dissatisfaction amongst a big section of our farmers because of the return they are receiving and have received since the season opened this year for the sale of home-made butter. There is no doubt about that.  The return received for home-made butter by farmers who have no other means of disposing of the produce of their cows is such that they cannot remain in production. Roughly, 50 per cent. of the milk of cows in this country is supplied to creameries.  Of the balance, I suppose a proportion is used as raw milk, a certain proportion is used for butter in the farmers' own homes and the balance is made into farmers' butter <Col N="1287" /> to be sold on the open market, the fresh butter market or otherwise.</P>
    <P>The Minister's predecessor provided for 1947 a scheme whereby farmers' butter received a subsidy and the farmers received 2/11d. per lb. for their butter.  That scheme gave general satisfaction and enabled the people who are compelled, owing to the circumstances, to market home-made butter to get a fair return in comparison with what creamery suppliers were getting for their produce that year.  But for the past two years they have not got a fair return.  Last year things were bad, but this year things are much worse.  The farmer who has to sell home-made butter is getting roughly half of what the creamery suppliers are getting for their produce. Nobody will say that the creamery suppliers are getting too much.  As a matter of fact, I believe creamery suppliers are entitled to more than they are getting for their milk.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon) James M. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon)</NameTxt>
      <P>How much more?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter for determination. Nobody will say they are getting too much.  The average cow in this country, I suppose, could be said to be a 500-gallon cow.  I think that is a fair estimate.  Many people would say that the yield is much less.  Probably an estimate of the milk production of the country would show that the average yield is only 400 or 450 gallons per cow.  The creamery supplier, because of the help given to him out of taxation, is guaranteed 1/2 per gallon for his milk in the summer and 1/4 in the winter.  The home butter maker is getting about half that.  The home butter maker is being taxed by the authority of this Dáil in order to provide a subsidy for the creamery supplier.  I think it is a great injustice that the farmer who is not getting an economic price for his home-made butter should be taxed in order to provide a subsidy for those who are supplying milk to creameries. I hope the House will view it in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture has given no good reason to the House as <Col N="1288" /> to why he did not continue the scheme that was operated by his predecessor in the matter of giving a subsidy on farmers' butter.  He told us on a previous occasion that he found a certain amount of farmers' butter that was not the best, and that it was difficult to market it.  Now, that is a very small problem.  It is purely a matter of organisation. I do not want to hear anything to-night, and I am sure the House or the country do not want to hear anything, about all the bad butter that is produced by farmers, because that is not the case at all.  There may be a very small percentage, but generally speaking that is not so.  If there is a certain amount of home-made butter being produced that is not up to the highest standard, then it is the Minister's job, or the job of his Department, to see that the quality of it is stepped up.  The Minister has the means at his disposal for doing that. The argument put forward by the Minister is no reason at all why he will not provide a subsidy for farmers' butter.  His argument is unjust.</P>
    <P>As regards farmers' butter, 99 per cent. of it is good edible butter, fit for human consumption.  If there were weaknesses in the scheme that was in operation, and if there was a need for tightening up the system and of seeing that the butter factors graded the butter properly, that was a simple matter that could be put right by organisation.  In the year 1947 a subsidy amounting to £90,000 was provided. Perhaps a greater amount would have been required this year, or perhaps a lesser sum would have been sufficient, but something needs to be done on this matter.</P>
    <P>The number of creameries that we have in many counties is very small. Creameries scarcely exist at all in the Leinster counties.</P>

On a previous occasion here he expounded at length on the closing down of creameries.  No creameries were closed down where <Col N="1289" /> there was a supply of milk available for them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of creameries were closed down in Laoighis, Offaly, Carlow, Wexford and other counties, because there were no milk supplies for them.  The committees of management of those creameries were composed of farmers, shrewd, hard-headed business men who depend for their livelihood on what they can wring out of the land and on the return they can get from their cows.  They, in their judgment, let it be right or wrong, decided to close down those creameries because, being good business men, they found that it was not a paying proposition to keep them going.  The Minister, or any other member of the House, who might be engaged in business, would drop a special line of business if he found that it was not paying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>Farmers are entitled to exercise their judgment in the management of their business just as people in other businesses are.  They are entitled to do what in their judgment is in their best interest, whether as members of a co-operative society or in any other way.  I think the Minister will concede that right to them as business men.  We had half a dozen creameries closed down because there was no milk supply in their areas.  That is no reason why a subsidy should not be provided for farmers' butter, or why some steps should not be taken by the Government to bring the price of home-made butter up to the price which the creamery suppliers receive at the expense of the tax-payer.  The tax-payer last year, in many areas, provided a subsidy for those who sent their milk to the creameries.</P>

      <P>The point must be kept in mind that creamery suppliers and others who produced butter during the years of the emergency were restricted in the price they got for their product. That product may have been worth more, but in the interests of the community they were restricted in the price they received.  I am sure it will be admitted that the price they got for their dairy produce during those years was fairly low.  That was done in the interests of the community&mdash;so that the community might get butter at a reasonable price.  I hold that those who produce home-made butter are entitled to get a fair livelihood from their product in the same way as the man who produces wheat or beet or any other crop is entitled to get a fair livelihood from what he produces.  I am sure that, in present circumstances, neither the Minister nor anybody else will say that a return of from £15 to £16 for the butter that the average cow produces is sufficient to pay a farmer.  Unless farmers can get more, they must go out of cows, and half those cows are in the possession of farmers who make home-made butter.</P>

      <P>It all depends on whether there is a sufficient number of cows in an area to make the opening <Col N="1291" /> of a creamery an economic proposition or not.  Will the Minister, or his Department, undertake to start creameries and keep them going in any area where you have a sufficient number of cows, and, if necessary, provide a subsidy to keep those creameries in existence?  You may, for instance, have 100, 200, or 500 cows in an area, but that number may not be sufficient to make a creamery economic.  It is a well-known fact that most farmers go out of cows in districts where there is not a creamery, or where it is not economic to have one started.</P>
      <P>I do not want to continue this argument any longer.  The Minister knows the number of creameries in the country.  It is not long since he answered a question on that.  In many counties you have no creamery at all. There are only seven or eight areas in the country where you have a fair number of creameries, such as Cork, Kerry, Clare, Cavan, Kilkenny, Limerick, Tipperary and Waterford. The number of creameries outside of those counties is infinitesimal.  You have counties with as many as 30,000 or 40,000 cows in which there is no creamery at all.</P>

      <P>I did not close it down. It was closed down because, as the manager wrote to the Press when the Minister made his wild statement in the House some time ago, the creamery was kept open for a year without any milk going to it.  That was the reason why Shelbourne was closed down.  It served a very small part of Wexford anyway; it does not serve the area where they have the largest number of cows and where the largest amount of farmers' butter is produced. <Col N="1292" /> It is more a tillage than a cattleraising area; it always has been.  It is more of a corn-growing area and always will remain so.  Even if Shelbourne opened in the morning, it could not be made a butter-producing area, and the Minister must know that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of cow centres.  There are several cow centres and several areas where farmers are selling butter at 1/6 to 1/8 per lb.  I know farmers with 20 or 25 cows and they are trying to exist and to pay labour and they can hardly do it.  It would need the produce of ten cows to pay one agricultural worker, and even then it would scarcely pay. him.  I do not know how any farmer can hope to exist; he has to pay rent, rates and taxes, and all the outgoings and then maintain a family and produce farmers' butter.  He cannot do it.  The Minister has a responsibility to that type of farmer just as he has to any other type of farmer.  Large numbers of these farmers are in a serious plight.</P>
      <P>I ask the Dáil to support this motion. The Minister should treat all farmers alike, whether they are producing farmers' butter or any other type of produce, and so enable them to get a livelihood out of their farms, whatever their produce may be.  This is a simple motion.  It is one that every Deputy has sympathy with and I have no doubt every Deputy will support it.  I trust the Minister will indicate that he is accepting the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not agree with that either.  This motion has only one disadvantage, and that is that it was incubated by the Fianna Fáil Party, who, over a very long period, did not show any intense interest in the farming community.  If, however, we are prepared to ignore the manner and the place of this motion's incubation, and the circumstances under which it comes before the House, and if we are prepared to consider it on its merits, I think the Minister should have no hesitation in accepting it.  There is nothing wrong with it.  We have to be logical in matters of this kind.</P>
      <P>All citizens pay taxes.  The man who produces farmers' butter pays taxes just as well as the man who supplies the creamery, and if there is a subsidy on butter it should apply to all butter that is of good quality.  There is no point in subsidising butter of bad quality and I do not think anybody will advocate the subsidising of poor quality butter.  Nobody will question the contention that farmers' butter of good quality is equal to&mdash;and, I contend, superior to&mdash;the best that the creameries can produce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main issue raised in this matter is whether we are as a State going to suppress or discourage the production of butter on the farm and, by administrative measures, force the farmer to build creameries and supply his milk to those creameries.  On that issue I am prepared to consider <Col N="1294" /> this motion.  I believe that over a considerable area creameries have proved a very substantial success. Over a very considerable area also, particularly in Leinster and in some counties in other provinces, creameries, in spite of all the efforts made to boost them, have failed rather miserably.</P>
    <P>I speak with experience of this matter. When I started to farm I was one of those who initiated the establishment of a creamery in my area.  I was one of those who canvassed the necessary supply of good milk to sustain that creamery.  That was in 1929. Organisers came down from the Department and from the Agricultural Organisation Society to urge on the praiseworthy work of establishing a creamery.  We established that creamery on the assumption that the price of milk would range about 6d. per gallon.  Hardly had we the building completed when the price of butter on the world market collapsed and we who pioneered that creamery found ourselves supplying milk to it at 2d. and 2½d. per gallon.</P>
    <P>That was not an economic proposition. The creameries struggled on for a number of years and eventually they failed.  There is no Party issue of any kind raised in this matter.  The failure of that creamery and a number of other creameries was due to the collapse in the price of butter in the world markets.  It may be asked why did those particular creameries collapse while others in Munster and Kilkenny continued to survive.  The fact is that the supplies of milk to the Leinster creameries were not as large as the supplies to the Munster creameries.  The creameries themselves were not so long established. They were unable to weather the storm.</P>
    <P>But several other remarkable factors intervened in regard to the Leinster creameries.  Farmers were encouraged to keep a good herd of cows in order to provide milk to the creameries. These farmers found it more remunerative to supply milk to the city and the creameries lost their support.  A certain amount of competition was offered by good quality farmers' butter.  The establishment of the creamery in these <Col N="1295" /> areas resulted in a reduction in the quantity of farmers' butter offered for local consumption.  That, in turn, enhanced the price of farmers' butter. These farmers stood out.  They found that the establishment of the creameries improved their position to the detriment of those who actually supported the creameries.  All these factors are remembered by the farmers in the Leinster counties.  In 1929-1930 a number of creameries were established all over Leinster.  Almost all of them failed.  The Minister was rather severe on a particular creamery in Wexford, but he could be equally severe on the other creameries that collapsed.  In doing so, I think he would be very unjust.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true, but the position in regard to Shelbourne creamery was that when they found they could not produce butter at a profit owing to the collapse, they turned over to more profitable enterprises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not quite agree with that.  The farmers found there was nothing in the creamery for them as far as butter was concerned and the creamery society, so far from leaving anyone in the lurch, helped them by supplying them with cheap seeds and manures and products other than milk. I think Shelbourne Society was rather lucky inasmuch as the manager there had the initiative and enterprise to go into other enterprises.  In the other bankrupt creameries the unfortunate shareholders had to make good the deficit. The memory of those failures is fairly green as far as the shareholders in those enterprises are concerned. The farmers will not be very enthusiastic about re-establishing these creameries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This issue can be decided on its merits.  Is it better to establish creameries in Wexford, Carlow, Kildare and elsewhere rather than encourage the farmers to manufacture butter <Col N="1296" /> on their own farms?  There is a certain amount of merit on both sides.  The creamery is a big organisation with up-to-date machinery; it can handle a large quantity of milk efficiently and it can produce a uniform type of butter. On the other hand, supplying milk to the creamery involves the farmer in a good deal of lost time.  It also helps to spread disease amongst young stock because of the mixing and blending of large quantities of separated milk.  It does not give the uniform type of milk the farmer would have if he separated it on his own farm because milk delivered to the creameries will vary in degrees of sourness according to the distance it has travelled and the particular type of weather.  It also has the disadvantage of making the farmer dependent on factors such as trade unions and transport.  These are things of which he would like to be independent.</P>
    <P>If the farmer makes his own butter in his own dairy, he will separate the milk each morning and he will have a uniform commodity to feed to his stock.  There is no danger of contamination owing to blending.  It may be said that dairying on the farm involves a good deal of manual labour. With the progress being made in regard to rural electrification, that labour will be a thing of the past in a very few years.  Added to that, there is the fact that well-made farmers' butter has a distinctive flavour which no creamery can ever hope to equal.  It excels creamery butter.  That is agreed by all those who have tried both and who have been fortunate enough to procure the best quality farmers' butter. Taking all those facts into consideration, I think the balance of merit lies in favour of letting the people who are at present making country butter, particularly in areas not near an established creamery, continue to make that butter.  If the Minister decides to promote the ultimate establishment of creameries in every area.  I think it is very unfair, pending the establishment of such creameries, to compel the people who live in areas where creameries are not in existence to suffer the loss of that State subsidy which is paid to people engaged in producing a similar type of commodity.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1297" /> In matters of this kind we have got to be absolutely just as between one citizen and another.  You cannot collect taxation from people generally and show favour in the distribution of the benefits of that taxation.  The person who is thoroughly efficient in the production of home-made butter is as much entitled to a subsidy as the person who supplies milk to the creamery.  I think the Minister should consider the enactment of this motion. The motion, as the Minister will see, is not very specifically worded.  It gives a certain amount of latitude to the Minister.  It says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;that the price of farmers' butter should be guaranteed by the Government at a price which will give the producer the same return for his milk as that received by the creamery suppliers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That does not mean, of course, that the farmer will get the same price as the creamery, that is, 1/2 a lb.  It would be almost equal to something over 3/- a lb.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that not what the motion says?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Consideration should be given to the cost to the farmer of the carriage of this milk to the creamery and so on.  All those things should be taken into consideration and I think the Minister could meet this motion very easily and very fairly without any very severe loss to the Exchequer.  Certainly, he would be doing an act of justice to a very industrious and honest section of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On several occasions the Minister has said in this House that a person who makes good quality farmers' butter would have no worry about finding a market for it.  That is true to a certain extent of the person who makes high-class farmers' butter and has a supply all the year round.  That person can, and very usually does, find a good customer for the butter.  However, we are dealing with a very large section of the community which makes excellent butter but only for three or four months in the year&mdash;the summer months&mdash;just the same as people who supply creameries only supply on a <Col N="1298" /> large scale during the summer months. Those people have not the regular allthe-year customers and cannot expect to have.  Those are the people about whom I am particularly worried and I think they are the people who should be considered.  The people who make really bad butter do not deserve any consideration from anybody.  They are the people who ruin the market to a great extent.  I do not think the farming community should be blamed for it. One pound of bad butter amongst a hundred pounds of good butter will contaminate the entire amount.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows as well as I do that during the last ten years the whole system of collecting farmers' butter has deteriorated to an alarming extent. Twenty or 30 years ago there were butter markets in every town where butter buyers, mostly from Cork, came on one day of the week and bought up the butter and paid according to the grade.  However, in recent years, particularly during the emergency, the buying and collecting of farmers' butter has been left mainly to the small shopkeeper.  Everyone knows that the small shopkeeper, and even the large shopkeeper, cannot grade butter properly.  He has no proper way of storing it.  It is altogether wrong.  It would be well if we were able to go back to ten years ago when we had those buyers going round from one town to another on one day of the week.  They were not afraid to grade the butter because they were not dependent on the customers.  They graded the butter and paid for it accordingly.</P>
    <P>There is another factor which must enter into this matter.  It must interest the Minister very much and it is this. Twenty years ago, in areas where country butter was made, the butter-making instructresses were exceptionally zealous in all counties in carrying out the instructions in the production of country butter.  Classes were held regularly in almost every district.  During the past ten years classes have lapsed and those instructresses have turned over to concentrate more on poultry production, and there is very little interest taken at the moment in the Department in improving the quality of country butter <Col N="1299" /> Therefore, if we are going to start casting blame at the farming community because butter is of bad quality, I think the Department must take a certain amount of that blame.  The whole case of this motion rests simply upon justice.  You cannot discriminate between one section of the community and another.  You cannot give one person who makes good quality creamery butter preference over the person who makes good quality country butter.  They are both tax-payers in the same State and you have got to treat them equally.</P>
    <P>A great deal of argument against helping the production of country butter was based on the fact that a considerable quantity of butter purchased under the purchasing scheme of 1947 went bad.  The fact of the matter is that that butter could not fail to go bad because&mdash;I am not going to cast blame one way or the other, the scheme was only in its first year&mdash;the system under which butter was purchased was altogether wrong.  It was left, in the main, to the small shopkeepers to buy the one sort of butter and keep it lying out in a store along with other kinds of commodities for perhaps two or three weeks and that did not improve it.  In the same way, if the small shopkeeper buys good quality butter and mixes it with one or two pounds of an inferior type it is going to deteriorate.  If that scheme is to be put into operation again, it must be put into operation on somewhat more efficient lines.  There must be somewhat stricter supervision of the purchasing and the grading of butter. There must be an immediate rejection of any butter that is of very inferior quality.  That is essential if the scheme is to work at all.</P>
    <P>I do not consider that this motion creates any difficulties for the Minister and I think it should be accepted by him.  One of the factors in connection with the matter is that, although I have complained that the motion was not very long on the Order Paper, it has been long enough to allow the peak point of production of butter for the present year to have passed.  If the Minister accepts this motion he will <Col N="1300" /> not be presented with any very severe problem for the present year and he will be able to make necessary arrangements and adjustments so far as the coming year is concerned.  I therefore ask him to accept the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon)</NameTxt>
      <P>When we were discussing this matter in the House on a previous occasion, not two months ago, I said to Deputy Allen that he must have a countenance of molybdenum, because brass would not endure the indecency he had displayed. Deputy Allen, and Deputy Dr. Ryan sitting beside him, represent Wexford and they come to the House and report that their neighbours in Wexford are hard pressed, inasmuch as they have an abundance of milk and no means of disposing of it except to convert it into farmers' butter for which there is no market. Now, Deputy Allen and Deputy Ryan have on the committee of the Shelbourne creamery a number of close friends and political associates, men who have made no disguise of their intentions to exercise the democratic freedom of this country to proclaim themselves devoted adherents of these two public men.  The Shelbourne creamery society is one of the richest corporations in this country.  It pays no income-tax.  It is a co-operative society which justifies its existence on the plea that its sole purpose is to serve the farmers and the community resident in the area where it functions. The Shelbourne Co-operative Society operated three creameries in the southern half of the County Wexford and, side by side with that creamery business, they operated a large retail and wholesale business which yielded them much profit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, they could do either of two things.  They could distribute the profits amongst their customer members or they could charge that profit, on which they are not asked to pay any income-tax, with the duty of providing a necessary amenity for their neighbours in the form, not of the creation of a new creamery but of maintaining the existing creamery.  But Deputy Allen's hard-headed friends, according to himself, sat down, cast up their <Col N="1301" /> accounts and said: &ldquo;Boys, we can make more than this if we shut down the creamery and let the neighbours take a running jump at themselves.&rdquo; So Deputy Allen's hard-headed friends sat down and closed not one creamery but three creameries, and the House hears the position that Deputy Allen paints&mdash;hundreds of farmers, some of them with 20 cows and 25 cows, at their wits' end to know what they will do with the milk of their cows since Shelburne closed the creamery.  And Deputy Allen has the cast-iron, nickel-plated countenance to come in here and hold himself out as the champion of these afflicted farmers, he and his friends having created the very situation which embarrasses and harasses these hard-working men.  How far is it possible to masquerade before our people and to put your finger in their eye&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy wants to divert the House from the fact that the case for the motion was founded by Deputy Allen on the distressful condition of his neighbours in Wexford and he has always been able to make a profit out of butter under the previous Administration.  It is necessary that the House should know the source of the circumstances of which he complained and I am surprised that Deputies who denied the people of Wexford the creamery facilities which would have relieved them of their present straits would be so sensitive.</P>
      <P>There is not the least use in wailing about the decline of the market for farmers' butter.  I have pointed out in this House before that farmers' butter well made is in every respect a product equal in excellence to creamery butter, but I pointed out again that many other of the traditional products of the rural community are in intrinsic worth equal to the quasi-industrial product but that does not by any means ensure that they will command a comparable market.  Homespun yarn is in many ways much superior to factory made knitting wool.  Twenty-five years ago in a large part of rural Ireland it was preferred and those with the wisdom to prefer it bought the more enduring article with superior qualities. Try to sell it now.  It is still superior to the factory produced product.  Public taste has changed.  You could get the material to make a Foxford heavy tweed coat and it was superior to other materials.  It is still superior to other materials, but whereas our grandfathers bought the Foxford product for its excellence, their grandchildren will not buy it.  Exactly the same is true of farmers' butter.  Farmers' butter well made is in many regards a better product than creamery butter. Farmers' butter to-day well made is in many respects, in my personal judgment, a superior article to creamery butter.</P>

      <P>There you are.  Deputy Hickey points out that the public taste has changed, but 30 years ago you would have had a great many <Col N="1306" /> people who took that view.  There is no change in the relative value of the two products, but the public taste has changed and I cannot change it back again.  I was recently speaking at the Cork Committee of Agriculture and one farmers' representative suggested in public that there should be made available for him during the hay-making and harvesting operations supplementary quotas of butter for the men he might have working on his land.  I said to that member of the county committee: &ldquo;But you can have as much farmers' butter as you care to buy&rdquo; and he replied to me: &ldquo;Ah, sure they would not eat it.&rdquo; I do not think I was unreasonable in saying to him: &ldquo;If you cannot get the people in Bantry to eat farmers' butter, how do you expect me to sell it in Battersea and Birmingham?  They have as much right to exercise a personal choice as have the residents of Bantry, and I cannot command them to change their taste, any more than you can command the agricultural workers in Bantry to change their taste&rdquo;.  Sometimes I feel the futility of arguments of this kind for I know perfectly well that not a single Deputy on the Fianna Fáil Benches believes for one moment in the tedious tripe we have had to listen to from Deputy Allen.  But it is thought to be good politics.  Deputy Allen should have learned a lesson from West Cork.</P>

      <P>It was thought a great triumph to have farmers' butter as an issue in West Cork.  There were a lot of decent people in West Cork who did feel, and feel severely, the impact of the decline in the farmers' butter market, but acting on a very sound principle of politics in this country, I was afforded, by the courtesy of Cork County Committee of Agriculture, an opportunity of speaking for the record in Cork on the first Saturday that the campaign was in progress, and the topic on which I chose to address the Cork County Committee of Agriculture was farmers' butter.  I told them the truth about it and an awful lot of farmers and their wives came out and voted in West Cork.</P>

But my instinct was perfectly right.  When I laid the facts of the case before them I do not believe that ten votes were turned away from the inter-Party Government candidate by the tripe talked about farmers' butter, one of the many boomerangs the boys let fly &mdash;farmers' butter, 2/6 eggs, and the Minister does not like fish.</P>

      <P>I saw a picture of a black man throwing a boomerang in the papers a couple of days ago and I thought of the boys.  Deputy Cogan makes the case that farmers' butter is in many cases superior to creamery butter.  I think a great many people will agree with him.  I do.  It is my misfortune to like farmers' butter.  I suppose a Minister for Agriculture ought to like creamery butter.  I prefer farmers' butter, but I tried to explain to the House before that the difficulty that arises in connection with the kind of scheme my predecessor, Deputy Smith, sought to administer was that when he subsidised the price of farmers' butter on the market to ensure that farmers' butter, sold on the open market, would fetch 2/11 per lb., what happened was that all the inferior butter came out on the public market to get the 2/11.  The woman who had good butter had not to go hawking it around at all.  She had her customer at hand who was always glad to take it from her and pay her her demand.  How can Deputy Cogan suggest that these people who have farmers' butter superior in quality to creamery butter are unable to sell it at 2/8 or 2/9?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, but, even so, while creamery butter is rationed, must there not be somebody who is prepared to pay at least the same price for extra butter of superior quality? Suppose creamery butter is rationed and farmers' butter is a better product, surely any rational citizen will leave the creamery ration after him and take his ration in the superior farmers' butter at 2/8.  I am taking it that Deputy Cogan is arguing on the merits.  Is it not manifest that if you have a good article and a better article, both available, it is only a very eccentric person who will take the inferior article and pay the same price for it? If the farmers' butter is better than the creamery butter, surely there are enough rational people in the country who in time of plenty will buy it rather than pay the same price for something not so good.  That is substantially what is happening.</P>
      <P>The woman who makes the good butter has her customers.  A lot of people want to suggest that to say that some of the farmers' butter made in rural Ireland is of second quality constitutes a reflection on the women who make it.  That is all cod.  It is no crime not to be an expert butter maker. Some women, taking every precaution they know how to take, have not got the knack of making butter, and when they bring butter into the town they do their business in, nobody wants to buy it from them for their own consumption, but they go into the shop they deal in and the shopkeeper, out of courtesy to his customer, must oblige her by taking the butter and trying to sell it thereafter to the best advantage he can.  Faced with this problem, there are two courses of conduct&mdash;in fact, there is really only one &mdash;open to a well-intentioned person, that is, to do all he can to help the people who have hitherto been dependent on farmers' butter for disposing of their milk.  The alternative is to act the rôle of the mischievous trouble-maker braying for everything he knows will render a solution of the problem most difficult.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1309" /> Deputy Allen knows perfectly well that a repetition of what happened in 1947 is something that no same Government would stand for.  We spent in 1947 between £70,000 and £80,000 in subsidy and found ultimately that we had left on our hands 2,100 cwts. of butter that was playing the <i>Marseillaise</i> down in the cold store. We succeeded in arranging to have that butter consigned to Great Britain for reconstitution, which is a process of treatment rendering it suitable for incorporation in certain types of confectionery, and were glad to sell it on that basis at a loss, taking the subsidy paid upon it into consideration, of £18,000.  Is there any rational soul in this House or outside it who will suggest that this year again we should proceed to spend practically £100,000 of the public's money on persuading people to buy that which we all know is an article for which the market is disappearing and will shortly disappear altogether?</P>

Accordingly, I proceeded to cast around for alternative markets for milk&mdash;to expand them and to make them available for those who hitherto have made farmers' butter.  Somebody said here to-day that the Government in the past years provided a subsidy of £2,000,000 odd for the farmers of this country producing butter.  That is not true.  Up to last year, the £2,000,000 odd that was paid out in subsidy was not a subsidy to the farmers but a subsidy to the consumers in this country.</P>

      <P>This year my problem was to meet the immediate difficulties of the men who produce dairy butter, farmers' butter.  Accordingly, I opened negotiations with the British Ministry of Food and secured for them from them a price of 233/4 per cwt. f.o.b. Cork.  That figure is 38/- a cwt. less than the new price for creamery butter&mdash;4d. a lb.  Mark you, 4d. a lb. less than the world price for top quality creamery butter is not such a bad price to get for farmers' butter.  As usual, my responsible and far-seeing colleagues elect to open this debate when I am in the middle of negotiations with the British Ministry of Food&mdash;trying to get them to continue paying 233/4 up to the 30th September.  I am not without hope that I may prevail upon them to do so.  We have already sent out 10,000 cwts. of farmers' butter.  We may have a good deal more&mdash;and we are getting for it 4d. per lb. less than the new price for top quality Danish creamery butter.  Does that represent more constructive help for the producer of farmers' butter than bawling here in Dáil Éireann about closing creameries in County Wexford?</P>

Now that I have been 12 months Minister for Agriculture, I know the reason why.  It is because it would be terribly difficult to provide for the farmers who keep cows if we had not the Dairy Disposals Board and their incomparable staff to employ in their service.  During the recent difficulties of this year, it would be very hard to form a correct estimate of the extent to which the board and its officers of infinite resource succeeded in relieving the severe difficulties of farmers who were really in a state of urgent embarrassment.  I ask the House to note especially that it was not in West Cork they functioned exclusively, though function they do and have done there.  One of the areas in which a problem of difficulty arose was South Galway and North Clare.  Others to whom I turned and asked for help to organise co-operative means of processing and selling milk declared themselves quite unequal to such an undertaking; but the Dairy Disposals Board made the following provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the district between Ennistymon and Gort they made creamery facilities available within four to six miles of every farmer's home, by the use of a <Col N="1313" /> travelling creamery.  In Inagh and Shragh Cross similar provision was made to collect milk which would otherwise have had to be converted into farmers' butter.  At Clarecastle, in West Clare, creamery facilities were made available.  Another travelling creamery is in the process of construction to add to the service already provided in the Ennistymon-Gort area. We are erecting a new creamery at Doon, Ballybunion.  The Dicksgrove creamery group is providing additional travelling creamery facilities.  Provision has been made for the milk supply available in Ballydehob.  Drinagh group creamery has been asked by officers of my Department to make provision for the milk produced at Kilcrohane and Kealkil.  The Dairy Disposals Board has provided travelling creamery facilities in Glengarriff, Comhola and Borlin.</P>
    <P>There are two new stops in the Cahirciveen area, one at Derrynane Cross and the other at Staigue Cross &mdash;but that is only a beginning.  The Lansdowne condensery is condensing 82,000 gallons of milk per day.  We are in process of preparing for the erection of a new dried milk factory in the town of Tipperary.  We have made an Order releasing from the control of the Transport Act creamery milk for the creamery and skim on the return journey.</P>
    <P>I do not deny that my best effort to help farmers who desire to dispose of milk can, in some measure, be frustrated by people like Deputy Allen. Given time, of course, we will sweep him out of our path, when we get round to him.  But his like could at least, if they are incapable of co-operation, abstain from mischief.  If he would just be quiescent and no more than that, it would greatly simplify the task of providing the requirements of people who are entitled to look to us for help.  I am bound to say that certain Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party, in the areas where it was necessary to take emergency measures to relieve this difficulty, helped; and I am glad gratefully to acknowledge their help and freely to acknowledge that their co-operation made it possible to supply the needed service much sooner <Col N="1314" /> than we otherwise might have, for they had the local knowledge to suggest how a travelling creamery circuit might most advantageously be constructed so as to ensure that, on its circuit, it would collect the economic minimum of 2,000 gallons which is necessary if it is to be permanently maintained in operation.</P>
    <P>Surely it is not unreasonable to ask Deputies to facilitate me in helping their neighbour.  There is no virtue in my doing that&mdash;that is what I am paid for&mdash;£1,525 a year, the mangy, inadequate salary, but if I do not want it.  I need not take it and, so long as I take it, it is no compliment for me to do my work.  When, in the course of doing the work I am paid to do, I come to resolve the problems that their neighbours are entitled to invite me to resolve, instead of moving heaven and earth to prevent me from solving them in the hope that some lousy political advantage will result therefrom, Fianna Fáil Deputies should forget their politics for an hour and, if they forget their duty as public men, remember at least that they have a duty to their neighbours.</P>

They should recall the fact that, apart from their duty as public men, they have the duty of the ordinary human being to their neighbours.  That is all I ask of them. If they do that minimum, I will do the rest.  If they do not do that minimum, they will be swept aside like chaff, but the necessary measures will be delayed while they are being swept into the ash-can, and in many cases it is a matter of consequence that there should not be a protracted delay.  I ask Deputies between now and the <Col N="1315" /> opening of the next milk season to help me by explaining to their neighbours that I cannot get a profitable market for farmers' butter and that it is a shame to be making good butter which has to be sold at a price far below its value in a foreign market simply because popular taste has changed.</P>

      <P>However, really constructive work can be done, between now and next February if Deputies, whatever side they sit on, will explain the problem to their neighbours and, in so far as they can see their way, communicate to me or to my Department the circumstances of their particular areas where they feel that, by any process of organisation or encouragement, we can build up what may now be an inadequate supply of milk into a supply that would justify the building of a creamery or the provision of travelling creamery facilities from some adjacent central creamery.  If everyone would put his hand to that task between now and next spring, this problem, which Deputy Allen is trailing about the House to see if he can squeeze any political advantage out of it&mdash;and he cannot&mdash;could be resolved and decent people who work hard could be ensured a fair return for their labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not without hope that, given an effort by our people to raise this industry to the maximum efficiency of which they are capable, adequately to fertilise their land so that their cattle may be fed in the most economically possible way, in summer on growing grass and in winter on silage made out of the grass they grow themselves, we may be able to get a long-term steady market for this product which would <Col N="1316" /> guarantee to those who engage in it a certain profit.  The hope of that is contingent on the farmers really under taking a sufficient production and effecting the maximum economy possible in the feeding and maintenance of their stock.  It depends in some degree on the mischievous, irresponsible people who, in the hope of some political kudos, would like to discredit me.  They think that if they cripple that industry, the repercussions upon myself would be severe.</P>
    <P>It is carrying political spleen and vengeance to fantastic lengths deliberately to injure our own people in order to hurt one single politician in the public life of this country.  I am not going to make any gestures about getting out of the way, if that would placate them.  Every time I see a mischief maker's head, I will hit it and expose him for what he is Every time I can get from any Deputy on the other side of the House a semblance of co-operation, I will thank him for it and publicly acknowledge it. But, if Deputies on the far side of the House want fight, they will get it.  If they want to help, I want to tell them that we want that, that it will make for the success of the efforts we are making.</P>
