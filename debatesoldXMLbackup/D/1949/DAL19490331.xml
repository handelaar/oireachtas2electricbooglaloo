    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare whether he is aware that the Workmen's Compensation (Amendment) Act, 1948, has caused much disappointment in its operation in so far as many recipients of workmen's compensation have failed to derive any benefit by way of increased compensation, under the Act; and, if so, what action he proposes in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Norton) William Norton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the negative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A few cases have come to notice where injured workers have received from their employers or their employers' insurers either no increase in their weekly payments of compensation or a smaller increase than they considered they were entitled to under the Workmen's Compensation (Amendment) Act, 1948.  As I have no power to intervene in such cases, I have had the suggestion made to inquirers that they should seek legal advice if they are dissatisfied with the amount of their weekly compensation payments.  The power of determining claims under the Workmen's Compensation Acts and questions relating to such claims is vested in the Circuit Court.  I may mention, for the Deputy's information, that the power of the court to review weekly rates of compensation because of fluctuations in wages was extended <Col N="2050" /> under the 1948 Act to cover cases which had not been the subject of a court order or registered agreement.  It would appear from some inquiries received in the Department that the importance of this amendment, from the injured workman's point of view, is not generally appreciated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not appreciate that people whose pre-accident earnings were 50/- and less have received no benefit whatever under the new Act; that people whose pre-accident earnings did not exceed £3 6s. 8d. receive benefit only to a limited extent; and, further, that people whose compensation is based on partial incapacity have received no benefit under the new Act?  Does he not agree that in these cases hardship still exists and that their compensation should be increased on a <i>pro rata</i> basis with the compensation given in the 1948 Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Under Section 7 of the Workmen's Compensation (Amendment) Act, 1948, I put into the hands of injured workmen a potent instrument for securing a higher rate of compensation if their wages increased since the time they met with an accident.  If the Deputy will consult some of his legal friends he will find that, in Section 7, they have a means of securing increased compensation if their wages increased since the accident. The Deputy apparently does not realise the potentialities of Section 7 of the 1948 Act, and, if he gets some legal advice, he will find that these people can recover a greater rate of compensation than he or some of those for whom he speaks appear to realise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that persons whose pre-accident earnings were 50/- or less, and whose rate of wages did not increase in the meantime, would not benefit to any extent under the new Act?  I quite realise that there is in existence machinery under which an applicant may claim an increase in compensation in respect of a fluctuation in wages, but does the Minister not realise that, in the three cases I instance, there is no machinery <Col N="2051" /> for providing increased compensation under existing legislation?  I can prove that if the Minister wishes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot interpret, because that is the function of the Circuit Court, claims of injured workmen to particular scales of compensation. What I am saying to the Deputy is that the recent Workmen's Compensation Act raised the ceiling for workmen's compensation purposes from 37/6 to 50/- per week, and it provided also that, where an injured workman's wages increased, or would have increased if he had not been injured, and where he was previously conditioned by a maximum of 37/6, he can now go to the courts and secure either three-quarters of his current rate of wages, or 50/-, whichever is the lesser sum.  That is a right he had not previously got, a right which was given to him by the 1948 Act.  I do not think there are such infirmities in the 1948 Act as the Deputy appears to suggest, and I think injured workmen have a way out in the overwhelming majority of cases under Section 7.</P>

Again, on the fifth day that he spoke about the last day, there is a report handed to him by the superintendent of the Civic Guards and on the 3rd October there is a minute from his secretary in which it is sent to the Civic Guards and on the face he has written &ldquo;Minister approves.&rdquo;  I asked that officer did he write that without the Minister's approval and he said no, that the Minister did approve of it and saw that letter.

I have inquired from the chief superintendent and he informs me that he furnished a report to the then Minister on the 2nd October, 1947, and that he saw the Minister on that date, and that he cannot agree that he told the then Minister that there was not a tittle of evidence against the persons complained of.  In fact, the actual Garda investigations had not then commenced and were not in fact started till the 6th October, 1947.

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that loss is being caused to motor traders by the refusal of customers to accept delivery of vehicles ordered by them for the haulage of timber; that the refusal was consequent on his closing down the wood fuel industry; and that the re-export of these vehicles is not permitted although there is no market for them at home; and, if so, whether he will annul the regulation which prohibits the re-export of the vehicles, and thereby, in effect, renders them unsaleable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Only one case has been brought to my notice in which it has been suggested that loss to a motor trader was likely to arise because of the refusal of a customer to accept delivery of a vehicle ordered by him <Col N="2067" /> for use in the haulage of timber.  In the particular case referred to, the vehicle was assembled here and I am not aware that there is no market for vehicles of this type at home.  The Deputy must be aware that the discontinuance of purchases of timber applied only to fuel for delivery to the dumps of Fuel Importers Limited, and because of the quantities already assembled there.  While I have been mindful of the interests of motor traders, there are other considerations affecting exports to which I must have regard in the present abnormal conditions. Having regard to these considerations, I had to decide not to give export licences for new lorries and I regret that I cannot modify that decision.</P>

This firm wrote a letter to the then Taoiseach which, <i>inter alia</i>, contained the following paragraphs&mdash;I do not propose to mention any names in relation to the whole matter.  After reciting certain allegations the letter went on:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;On examination of the facts disclosed, we are of the opinion that in order to have the matter properly investigated it will be necessary to deal with it expeditiously, and in particular to arrange for an immediate and simultaneous examination of books and records of several business firms in the country, and of certain Government Departments and concerns.

      <P>&ldquo;He would like to ask the head of the Government, he said, if he had received as far back as last September information relating to alleged frauds in connection with Government contracts and breaches of rationing and price control Orders, and concerning, among others, some persons closely connected with the Government, and if so what steps had been taken to have the matter fully investigated in public.  Information, continued Mr. MacBride, had been conveyed to Mr. de Valera concerning some extensive malpractices in which some persons, not unconnected with Government circles, were closely associated.  This was some months ago.  He did not know whether that information was capable of proof beyond doubt, but he did know that the information was made available to the authorities. He was not aware that any public investigation had been carried out.  There had been ample time to get these matters investigated and brought before the courts, and he now wished to ask why that had not been done.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>With your permission, Sir, may I just make this observation? <Col N="2075" /> Deputy de Valera is now talking about a public inquiry.  I have sent for the file in my Department.  I am speaking from recollection, but I can verify it if necessary.  In regard to the speech made by the present Minister for External Affairs the Deputy stated that he would not have a public inquiry into this matter, that the place to inquire into these matters was the courts.  You refused an inquiry after four months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the question. It is a court matter to inquire as to whether certain things were done. The question that I want to be examined is whether steps were taken by the proper authorities for the investigation of this, whether there was any fault or any attempt on the part of any member of the Government to shield anyone.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I can state my view on that.  That is why, when this letter was received by me, I immediately sent for the Minister for Justice.  That is my recollection.  I immediately rang him on the 'phone.  He came down and I gave him this letter.  It was quite obvious that it had not merely an ordinary complexion, but also a political complexion.  I said: &ldquo;You had better see about this at once.&rdquo; He reported to me&mdash;I do not know how soon&mdash;within a day or so, that he had, in fact, given this matter over to the police, and that they had gone to the firm in question, that the police went down to investigate it and that investigations were being conducted. I think they reported at some stage that there was not evidence enough to support a prosecution.  That is my recollection.</P>

It would have been very easy for us, if we did not have regard to the public interest and to the necessity for the protection of police investigations, to publish certain things on these files which would be very useful to us and to the public.

The Bill, in its appearance, is a simple Bill, but it contains the most far-reaching proposals. This Bill proposes to permit certain local authorities to abolish arbitrarily all the rights which a man may have on his land and opens, in some sections, a wide field for graft and corruption. When this Bill was put down for Second Reading we, in order to meet the wishes of the Government in a reasonable way, said that we would allow them tentatively and provisionally to fix it for yesterday, but that if we objected to taking it this week that then we were entitled to get the usual notice.

As far as we have been able to judge, it is a Bill of very wide implications, the full extent of which we will require time to probe. The general view of our Party is that we are not in a position to see the full implications of this Bill at the moment, and that it will require a certain amount of time to study it.  The suggestion is that in a week's time we can take the Second Reading.  The suggestion has come from the Government side that if that be so that we should take all stages of it next week.  That would be impossible if it is found necessary to have important amendments moved to it.  It is important that public business be done properly and not be rushed.  We are very anxious to see that Government work is done and we want to do our work properly.  On behalf of nearly half the members of the House, I want to say that we are not satisfied that we can see the implications of this Bill, or that it can be properly debated this evening.  The suggestion is that it be taken next week, but if there are amendments a fortnight at least would be required to consider them and see that they are properly drafted.  We are quite prepared to meet the Government and sit on after next week, but we cannot agree to the scamping of public business or to half-doing it.</P>

      <P>That the Dáil approves of the Convention of the World Meteorological Organisation signed at Washington on the 11th October, 1947, a copy of which was laid on the Table of the Dáil on the 22nd February, 1949.</P>
      <P>International agreement upon methods of observing and reporting weather and upon procedures for the exchange and promulgation of meteorological information is essential to all national meteorological services, since each makes use as a daily routine of the information promulgated by the others.</P>
      <P>International co-operation in these matters has hitherto been organised through the International Meteorological Organisation, which was founded in 1878.  This consists of the Conference of Directors of Meteorological Services (of which each director of a national service is a member, <i>ex officio</i>); various technical committees or commissions establish the conference and an international secretariat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2083" /> The Irish Meteorological Service has actively participated since its establishment in 1937 in the work of the International Meteorological Organisation, and at present holds a seat on the governing body (the International Meteorological Committee) and the presidency of one of the main commissions (that of aeronautical meteorology).</P>
    <P>At the conference of directors held at Washington, D.C., in October, 1947, a World Meteorological Convention was prepared, establishing a World Meteorological Organisation to replace the existing International Meteorological Organisation.  By this convention international co-operation in meteorology, like that in the fields of telecommunication, health, aviation, etc., will be based upon agreement between States instead of agreement between national meteorological services as at present.  In general the convention provides for an organisation working on the same lines as the existing organisation, with only those changes necessitated by the adoption of an inter-governmental form of agreement.</P>
    <P>The World Meteorological Convention has so far been signed, subject to ratification, by 42 States, including ourselves.  Up to date it has been ratified or acceded to by a number of States.  It comes into force, and the present International Meteorological Organisation ceases to exist, when 30 States have ratified it.</P>

    <P>The City of Waterford Gas Company <Col N="2084" /> has made an application under Section 10 of the Gas Regulation Act, 1920, and the Gas Regulation (Special Orders) Rules, 1940, for a special Order to effect certain modifications of the City of Waterford Gas Act, 1898, for the purpose of making better provision for the proper and efficient conduct of the company's undertaking.  The principal objects of the Order are to provide for borrowing powers by mortgage or debenture to the extent of £64,795 12s. 6d., which is the aggregate amount of the paid-up share capital of the company; and to authorise the creation, issue and redemption of debenture stock, the interest being limited to 4 per cent., save with the consent of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.

    <P>It is proposed also to create a redemption fund from the profits of the company for the purpose of redeeming the loan, mortgage, debenture or debenture stock raised or created by the company.  Power is also sought to improve the internal management of the company, empowering the directors to declare an interim half-yearly dividend without the sanction or direction of a general meeting; to determine the remuneration of the secretary and auditors; and to enable the company to make a minimum charge, not to exceed 25/- a quarter, where gas is used as a stand-by only on any premises used for trade or business purposes.  It is necessary to apply Sections 23, 24, 25 and 26 of the City of Waterford Gas Act, 1898, with the necessary modifications to the powers of borrowing sought in the draft.</P>
    <P>The draft repeals Section 15 of the City of Waterford Gas Act, 1858, which provides that the quorum of a meeting of directors was three if there were more than three directors, and two <Col N="2085" /> when the number of directors did not exceed three; it provides also by Article 5 that the quorum for a meeting of directors shall be two.  It is proposed to amend Section 17 of the 1858 Act by changing the date of the ordinary meetings of the company from &ldquo;the month of August&rdquo; to any date &ldquo;not later than the month of November.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Gas Regulation Act, 1920, altered the old and cumbersome procedure whereby statutory gas undertakings were obliged to secure their powers by way of Private Act or Provisional Order confirmed by a Special Act of Parliament, and provided instead that powers or additional powers could be secured by a Special Order approved by a resolution of both Houses.</P>
    <P>The procedure, as laid down in the Gas Regulation (Special Orders) Rules, 1940, requires that the draft Order be prepared by the gas undertaking, and that full publicity of the intention to apply for the Order and of the contents of the draft be given by notices in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and local newspapers. Notification must also be given to the State and to private interests involved. One month is given for the lodging of objections, the subsequent stages being dealt with in accordance with the Gas Regulation Act, 1920.</P>
    <P>If there are objections, an inquiry may be held and, after considering the report of the person who held the inquiry, the Minister may modify the draft before submission to the Oireachtas, or he may decline to submit the draft.  No objections were lodged and no inquiry was necessary.</P>

      <P>The Vote for Lands for the year 1949-50 shows a net increase of £107,070 as compared with last year.  The increase is accounted for mainly in sub-head I, which provides for the expenditure necessary on improvement of estates and the division of untenanted land into new holdings.  The increase follows as a consequence of the speeding up of the work of land division.</P>
      <P>Sub-head A, which provides for salaries, wages and allowances is increased by £34,497 by reason of the general increases in remuneration granted to civil servants.  In other sub-heads there are no changes calling for particular comment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the general work of the Land Commission during the past year there has been a speeding up of activities in general.  Up to the end of the financial year 1947-48 the activities of the Land Commission, particularly in this sphere of land settlement, were still affected by restrictions imposed during the period of the emergency. These had been relaxed in the case of the scheduled congested districts counties, but the position remained that outside the scheduled congested districts counties the Land Commission, except for land in certain very limited categories, were not free to undertake <Col N="2087" /> inquiries or to institute proceedings with a view to the acquisition of land for division.  The carrying out of a land settlement programme on any sort of large scale demands that there should be a considerable reserve of useful lands in hands and also a sufficient supply of additional lands &ldquo;in the machine&rdquo; in process of acquisition.  At the beginning of the past financial year, however, in consequence of the restrictions in force for some years previously, the position had been reached that practically no useful land remained on hands.  By a Government decision last spring the Government authorised the Land Commission to resume their activities outside the scheduled congested districts for the acquisition and resumption of land intended to be used for the relief of congestion.  It will be understood that this decision could not secure the immediate acquisition of fresh lands. It did, however, open the way for the carrying out of the inquiries and inspections which are a necessary preliminary of all land acquisition work. Since the restrictions were removed our inspectors have been engaged throughout the country on this preliminary work.  Many old reports furnished prior to the imposition of restrictions have had to be reviewed and new reports furnished in other cases with detailed information as to suitability and price following valuation of lands proposed for acquisition. The result of all this work is now beginning to show in the returns of land acquired.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, too soon yet to expect final returns of work during the year, but provisional figures can be given which will indicate some idea of the scope of inspectorate activity during the year.  Preliminary inspections carried out embrace an area of somewhat in the region of 40,000 acres. More detailed inspections and valuations were carried out in respect of an area of some 25,000 acres, while lands made the subject of acquisition proceedings during the year comprised something about 45,000 acres.  As regards the actual division of land, I have referred to the fact that we <Col N="2088" /> opened the year with practically no reserve of useful land on hands. Notwithstanding that disadvantage, a most satisfactory output has been achieved and when the final figures are available I shall be disappointed if the division figure for the year is less than 20,000 acres.</P>
    <P>The work of revesting tenanted holdings and untenanted land allotments has also been pushed ahead as fast as possible.  The importance of clearing off the arrears on this side of our work has repeatedly been stressed and the past year's contribution to the solution of this task must be regarded as satisfactory, as a total of some 15,000 holdings and allotments were during the year vested in the tenants and allottees.</P>
    <P>With regard to the user of allotments, work on the examination of divided estates has continued during the year.  At present the Land Commission have under observation approximately some 1,500 unsatisfactory allottees.  Over 2,000 inspections were carried out during the year and warnings were issued in some 700 cases. There are over 600 further cases under attention for termination of agreements for unsatisfactory user.</P>
    <P>As regards the collection of annuities the position continues to be satisfactory. Out of a total amount of £35,036,779, collectable since revision took place in the year 1933, arrears amounted at the 31st January last to £108,810, or approximately 3 per cent.</P>

      <P>I was saying that hitherto it has been the practice, whenever an Estimate was under review, and particularly the Estimate for the Department of Lands, for the Opposition to sling all the mud they possibly could at whoever happened to be in charge of that Department, whether he was a Minister or a Parliamentary Secretary, and at the officials of that Department.  I myself was the victim of such a campaign of slander on one occasion.  Strange as it may appear, I never, at any period, had any responsibility for the Department of Lands; but that did not save me from the mud-slinging campaign indulged in on these benches by the then Deputy Dillon, now Minister for Agriculture, when he accused me of dividing the land of this country amongst my political friends.  The then Deputy Dillon knew as well as I did that I had nothing to do with the division of land, but that did not prevent him from carrying on his campaign of calumny.  So much for that.  I merely mention it in the hope that henceforth we shall finish with that type of attack upon whoever is in charge of the Irish Land Commission. If there are to be criticisms of the Minister, or of his Department, they should be constructive criticisms.

      <P>I have only to take up the debates for the last 16 or 17 years to see it.  I merely want to refer to it and to say that I hope there will be an end to it from all sides of the House. I do not think it adds anything to our reputation as members of this House to carry on such a campaign.  I did not come into the House to quote from the past records of the House, as the Minister would seem to want me to do now. All I wish to say is that I hope the Minister has changed his views, now that he has got a little bit of experience, towards the Land Commission and towards the officials of the Land Commission.  I sincerely hope he has and that his colleague, particularly his colleague and fellow-Deputy from his own constituency, will also change his views.  If we are to have criticisms at all, let them be based on facts.  If we have charges to make against the Minister or against his officials, we will put them down in black and white and show where either the Minister or his officials are wanting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am afraid the Minister is not altogether as optimistic this evening as he was before he became Minister. If he were he would not have brought in this slight increase of £107,000 to cover the additional expenses of the additional activities which we had been led to believe from previous announcements of the Minister were going to take place henceforth.  An increase of £107,000 on this Estimate is a very small one to provide for the acquisition of estates and the carrying out of improvements&mdash;all the very essential improvements that are necessary if lands are to be divided on the scale we would all wish to see.  One would imagine that now the emergency <Col N="2091" /> has passed and supplies of essential materials which were unobtainable for a good many years are in hands, we would see a more hopeful sign coming from the Minister than the small sum which he is now providing by way of increase as compared with last year's figures.  If we are to make a success of land division we will have to speed up the activities and we will have to provide the necessary oil to keep the machine working by way of the necessary funds.  I am afraid the amount which the Minister is bringing in here to-day will not lend itself to a very large increase in the area of land to be divided during the coming year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>The total increase is £107,070 and most of that, £100,000, is for the improvement of estates.  That is £100,000 increase on the previous year.  I know that that is relatively a very small sum by way of an increase, but it is far from what one would expect as materials are no longer in scarce supply.  It could easily be argued during the war years, but it compares very unfavourably with the Estimates that were brought in prior to the war when supplies were available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>One would naturally expect that there would be a good increase during the coming year in the activities of the inspectors who were seconded to other Departments for other essential work during the war and who are now back again in the Land Commission, and that their activities would show results.  There would not be much point in chasing around the country unless their operations lead to the division of land and the creation of new holdings.  The primary purpose of the Land Commission is the relief of congestion.  I hope the Minister and his Department will concentrate on that very laudable work.  I am not one of those who want to create the impression that this is a very soft or a very easy job.  I know it is not.  I know <Col N="2092" /> some of the difficulties that have to be gone through before an estate can be acquired and divided, and I think it would be a great mistake to pretend that this work can be done overnight. Statements of that kind deceive the people and nothing could be worse than that the people should be led up the garden path in the belief that one has only to wave a magic wand, as some of the Deputies now sitting behind the Government led the people to believe some 14 or 15 months ago.</P>

      <P>I hope the Minister will allow me to proceed.  It is not my habit to interrupt and I hope I shall get the same courtesy from the people opposite.  The Minister will have the opportunity of replying later.  Side by side with congestion is the rundale system, which obtains particularly in the counties of the western seaboard. Even in my native county there is a considerable area held under the rundale system, where oftentimes a farmer in order to thatch his house has to trespass on his neighbour's land.  That is not confined to any one particular area. It is pretty widespread, and particularly along the western seaboard.  The sooner that state of affairs is ended the better it will be for everybody.  There are difficulties in the way.  When you come to deal with a matter of that kind you find that the particular haggard or field that you want to acquire has become enhanced in value in the eyes of its holder, and oftentimes people will prove unreasonable.  The staff of the Land Commission have to try to negotiate with those people.  The time will come when the Land Commission will have to deal more drastically with cases of that kind if we are to <Col N="2093" /> have a solution of that rundale system in our time.  It may be necessary to obtain compulsory powers in order to get over these difficulties.  Nothing could be worse than continuing this system of rundale with which we are all familiar&mdash;those who represent western constituencies, at all events.</P>
      <P>Another matter to which I wish to refer is the question of housing.  I would suggest to the Minister that he should look into the plans already in existence of certain types of houses. According to these plans which are more or less stereotyped, fire-places, particularly those built in the rooms of these small dwellings, are built even in bog areas which are suitable only for the burning of coal.  I have seen them myself even when the houses were built on a raft to prevent them sinking in the bog.  Despite the fact that the turf is actually under the house these little fire-places, ten to 12 inches in width, were built.  They should be enlarged to enable the people resident in the bogs to burn their own turf.  If the authorities want to save on it let them cut out the grates altogether and give them the ordinary hearth which everybody in the country is used to, so that if a member of the family is sick or a neighbour calls they can put the fire down without having to buy coal which is the only fuel that will fit into these little grates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it would be well if the Land Commission got its engineers or architects to look into the question of the avoidance of draughts.  The doors and windows are so placed, particularly in the kitchens of these houses, that in many cases they are very draughty.  It ought not to be beyond the powers of an architect to draft something more suitable for the occupants than we have had hitherto.  We should all like to see the dwelling house somewhat larger, if possible.  I suppose it is too much to hope for at the present time under existing costs.  The next point I should like to make is that every farmer who gets a division of land or for whom the Land Commission are catering by providing offices ought to be provided with a cart house.  Out buildings are provided but, unfortunately, <Col N="2094" /> the doorways in these houses are incapable, as represented in the plans, of allowing the ordinary farmer's cart to be placed inside.  Oftentimes the farmer has at his own expense to widen the doorway to enable him to put in his cart.  He should also have a stable for his horse, a piggery, and a poultry house.  In addition I would suggest that he should have a small hay shed, without which it is well nigh impossible for the ordinary farmer to carry on.  In the construction of these out-offices, I know of no reason why the rainfall from the roof or the effluent from the cowhouse, should be turned towards the backdoor of the dwellinghouse. I think it is contrary to public health and yet it is done.  I do hope the Minister and his officials will take note of these remarks and prevent a recurrence of these faults in future.</P>
    <P>The next note I have concerns fencing. It has been the practice, particularly in areas where building materials are scarce, where stone is scarce for instance, to erect what we call &ldquo;moots&rdquo;&mdash; that is a bank of earth separating two fields.  That is all very well for the time being but unless that bank or mound of earth is protected either by a wire fence or in some other manner it will be damaged.  Better still if thorn quicks could be planted at the foot of the &ldquo;moot&rdquo;, in the course of years, provided stocks are kept away, that will provide an efficient hedge and make a good fence which will prevent the stock trespassing on neighbours.  In the past, we have all seen, particularly in districts where fencing materials are scarce, these embankments being built and after a while, when cattle are allowed in, they seem to take a particular delight in exercising their horns on the &ldquo;moots&rdquo; until the stage is reached where there is no longer any means of preventing trespass.  I do not think it would take a lot of ingenuity to bring about a marked improvement in that line of activity.  Furthermore if hedges were planted in the way I have suggested, they would not merely provide shelter but they would beautify the country. If in each of these &ldquo;moots&rdquo; a thorn quick hedge were planted, in eight or nine years there would be a nice hedge <Col N="2095" /> which would provide shelter for animals and would add very much to the amenities of the farm.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister&mdash; and this is to my mind very important &mdash;what is the present policy of the Government towards ex-I.R.A. applicants for land.  I mention this matter because it has been brought to my notice that, in the case of a couple of small estates that have been divided in my own constituency, some I.R.A. men have been passed over.  To my mind at all events these men were in every way suitable for divisions of land.  They were small holders, they had large families and they had obtained certificates and pensions in respect of their fight for Irish freedom. Yet these men were passed over and others who, according to my information were further from the land divided, were given preference.  I am not accusing the Minister of any deliberate intention to act in this way. I am merely directing his attention to the fact that these things have happened and I hope there will not be a recurrence of them, and that these men will get the preference to which, according to law, they are entitled, all other things being equal.  I hope that these men who are equally qualified with other applicants will get preference. I should like the Minister to give some information on that matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall let the Minister have particulars of a few cases that have been brought to my notice.  On the question of migration, I think it would be a better policy, and incidentally it would be cheaper for the Land Commission, where they could possibly do so, to move the larger farmers.  There are fairly large holders in some of the congested areas and they should be migrated rather than moving several small holders. <Col N="2096" /> The cost of transferring a large farmer would be very little more than that of transferring one of his smaller neighbours, whereas to obtain the same area of land by the transference of several small holders is going to cost the State a good deal more in the way of transfer costs.  It would be much better, I think, to transfer the larger holders.  Possibly they may be more suitable migrants and the land which they would vacate would help to relieve congestion amongst their smaller neighbours in that locality.  It would be far more satisfactory than transferring the small holders in large numbers.</P>
      <P>I have also a note here regarding market value.  That also has become a very thorny question lately.  I merely wish to say in passing that I think most people will agree that if land is to be acquired, the owner ought to get reasonable compensation.  After all, if the State is acquiring a business or interfering in any other way with other property, reasonable compensation is paid and I think the same rule should obtain when it comes to taking over land, particularly if it is taken compulsorily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also like to direct the Minister's attention to a very big problem with which either he or some other Minister will in future have to grapple. That is the question of embankments in tidal waters.  We have in Clare in particular a very large mileage of embankments along the estuaries of the Shannon and the Fergus.  In passing, I should like to say that quite recently, when a breach was made in the vicinity of Sixmilebridge and the matter was reported, the Land Commission&mdash;despite all the mud that has been flung at it recently, it is only fair to place this on record&mdash;acted with commendable speed and sent their men there to have the breach repaired.  They have been vilified so often that I think it is only fair when they do a good day's work it should be placed on record.  The fact that they came to the rescue of a number of farmers there gave these farmers some hope that they were not altogether forgotten.  The whole question of embankments, I know, constitutes a big problem and each Department of State would like to hand the baby over <Col N="2097" /> to some other Department but the question, as I say, will have to be tackled either by the Minister, by some of his colleagues or by some other Government at a later date.  Where these embankments are subject to a breakdown from time to time during pressure by high tides, it is only the State that can come to the rescue of the farmers concerned.  Most of these lands carry very high valuation.  In one instance brought to my notice, some lands liable to floods were carry-a valuation of £2 a statute acre.  It sounds incredible, but it is a fact. These lands are sometimes inundated and it is the duty of the State to protect them for the farmers concerned.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission has in hands for the past couple of years some estates where, for some reason, there has been a hold-up in the completion of the work.  I refer first to the Crowe estate at Dromore, Ruan.  They have been operating there for three or four years and yet have not completed the work.  I hope this hold-up will not continue indefinitely.  The Studdert estate at Ballyhannon, and Creagh estate at Daingean are two in point. Some of them were only recently acquired.  In one case, the former owner opposed the Land Commission and got away with the plea that it was a stud farm, when everyone locally knew that there was scarcely a stud game cock in the whole place.</P>
    <P>There is another estate in East Clare on hands for a long number of years. The circumstances there are extremely difficult.  There is the famous Arthur estate at The Glen, Killaloe.  The Land Commission have been dealing with it for a long number of years and at long last have seen the completion of their work.  The Minister is smiling.  I think that, slow and tedious though the work was, the operations were almost completed before he saw the inside of the Land Commission.  There are still some jobs to be done there and I hope that in a very short time we will see the end of our troubles as regards the Arthur estate.</P>
    <P>In Ballinruan district, there are some vacant houses&mdash;as there are in other places in my constituency&mdash;which have been vacated by migrants transferred <Col N="2098" /> to other counties.  These houses, which I know very well, were reasonably good farmhouses, two-storey, slated dwellings, with suitable out-offices. Owing to their having been left derelict for the past two or three years, they are not improving and I hope the Land Commission will see that these lands are allocated amongst the congests immediately joining these vacated farms, so that the houses will not be allowed to continue to deteriorate.</P>
    <P>Before the outbreak of the last war, the Land Commission had a very big housing programme in West Clare, around the Shragh, Moanmore and Doonbeg areas.  It was contemplated at that time to erect no fewer than 120 houses and they had gone a long way towards the completion of the job by the year 1939, when the advent of war and consequent scarcity of materials put an end to the operations.  It was a pity that work was not completed, as there were some of the worst rural slums in the whole country in that area.  At least 40 of those people were provided with houses when the war put a stop to the work.  Could the Minister indicate the prospects of continuing that work now, since materials have become available, so as to complete the job begun in 1937 or 1938? I hope he will see that it is continued, as there are many people there who cannot afford to erect their own houses &mdash;particularly when houses have been provided by the Land Commission for the neighbours.  Many of these people are small holders with a couple of acres of bog on which to make a living, and these houses were erected on their own little plots.</P>
    <P>Some of them had not the necessary labour to do the work themselves, but others were more enterprising and took the contracts from the Land Commission, under whose supervision they constructed their own houses.  That, of course, is the better practice, as a man building a house for his own family will be more careful to put the best workmanship and materials into it.  I hope the Minister will look into this question and continue the good work which was interrupted in 1939.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to avail of this Estimate to refer to a few matters affecting my constituency, County Dublin.  So far as I can judge, County Dublin seems to be one of the most neglected areas where land division is concerned.  It is a well-known fact that the area of Fingal in North County Dublin, and a great part of the south county, has inside its borders some of what is reckoned to be the most productive agricultural land we have in the country.  We have the anomaly that in several areas there are large estates of what is said by people who should know to be the best land in the country lying unused and giving little or no employment.  Both during the reign of the present Government and of the previous Government, representations have been made by many organisations concerning the large estates, but very little progress has been secured by the people of County Dublin in the matter of land division. Such land division as has been carried out in the past was not, it seems to me, of great benefit to the people.  The fundamental failing in the policy as it applied to County Dublin was that the parcels allotted to many of the tenants were so small as to make the earning of a livelihood thereon a difficulty.  Yet we have a great expanse of land including a number of estates, particularly in the north of the county, which would be admirable for division.  I might mention one which is known as Newbarn.  I understand it is presently under consideration by the Department. There are many others in the north-western portion of the county that have been brought to the notice of the Department.  So far as I can judge, little or no progress has been made in our county in the direction of getting these estates divided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In County Dublin there is, and has been, as much land hunger as exists in any county.  It has been stated that the primary policy of the Land Commission is the relief of congestion, a policy which must be acceptable to everybody on all sides of the House, but when that policy is put into effect so as to mean that migrants are brought from distant parts and settled in <Col N="2100" /> County Dublin, where there is at the moment, as I say, a considerable desire for land division, it seems to me that the policy is being ill-applied.  I have in mind the case of a small holding on the borders of County Dublin and Meath which was recently allotted to a migrant from one of the western counties.  I have no doubt that the migrant was a very well qualified applicant and I am not criticising the giving of the holding to him; but I say that it is most undesirable, with so strong a desire in this area for land division, that migrants should be imported there.  Other counties adjoining County Dublin and in other parts of the country may be well fitted for peopling with migrants, but I urge the Minister to review this policy, so far as County Dublin is concerned.</P>
    <P>We have a situation there which may not be paralleled in any other county. During the years of the war, a number of these estates and larger farms to which I refer were let in conacre to many men who before the war might have been in the position of agricultural labourers.  The conacre was available because compulsory tillage was in existence.  A certain proportion of the estates had to be tilled, which meant that many of these ex-agricultural labourers and small farmers living on uneconomic holdings could add to their incomes by taking conacre and tilling the land.  With the passing of compulsory tillage, a policy to which I made no secret of my opposition, this problem is accentuated, inasmuch as the conacre farmers who formerly could get conacre relatively easily are now finding difficulty in obtaining land in that fashion, and I suggest to the Minister that that creates a situation of great urgency, so far as land division is concerned.</P>
    <P>Conacre farming of itself is no satisfactory solution of the economic difficulties of men living on a small portion of land or men who have no land.  It is simply a makeshift, a temporary and transitory solution.  The true solution, as we all know, is the settling of the man and his family upon a unit of land sufficient to support him in decent Christian comfort; but the existence in my constituency of these large <Col N="2101" /> estates and the apparent inactivity of the Land Commission in regard to them is at present a matter of comment, as it was a matter of comment during the reign of Fianna Fáil and even, I should say, since the first time the idea of land division was mooted.</P>
    <P>I urge that special thought and consideration should be given to this area. The land in that district is reckoned to be the most valuable land, from the point of view of agricultural produce, that we have in the country.  The agricultural operatives, both working farmers and farm labourers, are deserving of the highest praise possible for the manner in which they have maintained the tradition of tillage and the production of goods over a very long number of years, a tradition which comes down to them not from the last generation but from generations before that.  For that reason alone, this area is in need of special consideration.</P>
    <P>It will create very great local difficulties if a policy of the importation of migrants is pursued in North County Dublin.  First attention should be given to the people who were born and bred there, who are well qualified to work the land, who know it particularly well and who are in need of land in order to get a better living for themselves and for their families. That this problem is not one which can be delayed is very evident to those of us who are familiar with County Dublin.  The Land Commission has become notorious and a by-word throughout the country for its slowness of motion.  Like other speakers on this Estimate, I have not the slightest doubt that the job of any Minister for Lands is a tremendous task.  There is no question whatever about that, but I feel that, in so far as we in County Dublin are concerned, we have legitimate cause for complaint.  The whole accent in the matter of urgency in land division has been centred on other areas, whereas in County Dublin neglect has been the apparent policy for a very considerable time.</P>
    <P>I have had many representations in connection with the need for water where the land is divided.  In the past, the Land Commission has divided land into parcels and has neglected to <Col N="2102" /> make arrangements whereby the people to whom the land is given can obtain water.  We have cases of men having to travel two and three miles for water, and, while that may be the accepted thing in other parts of the country, it is regarded in my county as something which can easily be remedied and should be remedied and which should not be a feature of agriculture in the most progressive agricultural county, the premier county. Provision should be made upon all holdings which are allocated by the Land Commission for making available a pump for the supply of water, which is so essential in agriculture.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that he would be disappointed if, when the final total of the acreage divided last year becomes known, it was not 20,000 acres.  That, undoubtedly, is an encouraging thing&mdash; that 20,000 acres have been divided, that the policy of returning the land to the people of this nation is being pursued; but, again, not one rood of these 20,000 acres has been divided in my county, so far as my knowledge goes.</P>
    <P>Another matter which is the subject of much complaint by Land Commission tenants is the delay in the vesting of land.  I should like the Minister to indicate to us how soon those of us who are interested in County Dublin can anticipate that progress will be made in this important matter.  It appears that many men who are residing on Land Commission land were told years ago that it was a matter of a relatively short time when their land would be vested.  They are still awaiting vesting. It is an unsatisfactory state of affairs that, for a long time, men are not sure of their position.  No man is sure until the land is vested and he is made owner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Are these small farmers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, small holders.  There is another peculiar aspect of the land question in County Dublin which may not apply elsewhere.  There is a number of men who ordinarily work as agricultural labourers and who hold small <Col N="2103" /> parcels of land&mdash;five to ten acres or even less.  Representations have been made to me recently by some of these men in connection with housing.  It appears that it is impossible for them to secure a house from the Land Commission. It is quite conceivable that, under the present policy of Dublin County Council, the county council would build houses for such men who are legitimate agricultural labourers and who qualify for re-housing in the ordinary course of events.  The difficulty that the county council finds is that of obtaining sites.  Where men hold small pieces of land, I would strongly suggest that no objection should be raised to their making available to the county council a site sufficient for the county council to build a house for them and that that site should be made available at a reasonable figure.  That would apply particularly where land is not vested.  Difficulty and delay arise there and we cannot afford to have any delay in the matter of housing, particularly in rural areas.  It is high time that such men, who represent the real wealth of this nation, men who toil on the land, should have no barrier placed in their way.  Rather, every point should be strained to provide them with decent housing conditions with the greatest possible speed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last speaker referred to many things he thought desirable things which should be done by the present Minister.  It is very difficult for Deputies on this side of the House to resist the temptation to say: &ldquo;Why did you not do it when you had the opportunity?&rdquo;  The present Minister is doing a tough job as efficiently as any human being could do it.  The criticisms which I offer are on questions of policy, and I offer them in the strongest possible manner so far as County Dublin is concerned.  The principal criticism which I make is that in County Dublin there has not been adequate land division.  There is sufficient land there to ease the present situation, idle land, land which is not worked, and which is of no use to anybody. I would again urge the Minister to give special attention to that matter <Col N="2104" /> because I feel that County Dublin has not had the attention it deserves in relation to this matter in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I was hoping that the Minister, as a Minister who is approaching his work anew, would have taken this occasion to give the House a general picture of the task before us in land division as he conceives it and of his general administrative policy in regard to it.  In the Constitution, as one of the directives to social policy, it is stated that there shall be established on the land in economic security as many families as in the circumstances shall be practicable. That is in the Constitution because it seemed to be the general aim of all Parties and everybody in the country who was thinking from the social point of view.  There are three important words in it, of course&mdash;&ldquo;economic security&rdquo; and &ldquo;practicability&rdquo;. &ldquo;Economic security&rdquo; meant that the person who was put on the land and owned the land should be able to maintain himself and his family and to make reasonable provision for himself and his family so that he would be really dependent on his farm and not on anything else.  That raised a very big question as to what was the economic size of a holding, because when we are giving land we are giving to an individual, with the aid of the community, a very important gift, and, naturally, that gift ought not to be larger than would enable us to achieve the aim that is set out in the Constitution, namely, that it should enable him to live on the land in economic security.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know how many in the House would agree with me on this, that it is desirable to have as many families as possible in that economic security.  I do not think there is any individual in the community who has such liberty, who is really as free as a man who is placed in that position. He is very different from those who are mere wage earners, and so on.  He is monarch, to a certain extent, of all he surveys within his own holding.  It is an ideal existence, it seems to me, from a human point of view.  Consequently, from a social point of view, <Col N="2105" /> I think very many will agree with me that it is desirable in the national interest to have as many families as possible placed in that position.</P>
    <P>It is from that point of view that I would approach the whole question of land division.  I know that that runs counter in a certain direction to other views.  One view would be to have very large holdings and some would even go to the point of having communal holdings and imagine that by machinery and so on they would get higher production.  I think it has been proved that more comes from the individual acre of land in a small farm than in a larger farm and I think therefore &mdash;actually and from a narrow economic point of view rather than from a social one&mdash;that we will get more from land divided into holdings such as is envisaged here.  That does not mean that the farms would be all of the same size. Everybody knows that farms of different sizes fit in and that there is a gradual passage from the smaller farm to the larger one and that the larger farms help the small ones.  We should consider what size of farm would be essential.  The large farms should be able to justify their existence by the amount of labour they give and by their part in the general economy. It is generally admitted that large farms&mdash;and when I say large farms I mean farms of 200, 300 or 400 acres&mdash; play a part in our general economy and it might be very undesirable to touch them if they are doing their work by giving added employment and helping small farms to carry on.</P>
    <P>We are very anxious, naturally, that those in possession of land should have security.  Everybody here is agreed that security of tenure is one of the purposes we should have in our legislation and we should see that it is not disturbed except in the cases where that has been clearly admitted to be right.  As many families as possible and economic security should be our aim.  I thought that the Minister in introducing the Estimate should have tried to give us a general picture so that we could see how we are progressing towards that aim.  I should like to <Col N="2106" /> know, first of all, if he holds that it is the proper aim.</P>
    <P>I remember asking for a report at one stage as to the amount of land available in this part of Ireland for division according to the view of the Land Commission.  I got estimates ranging from 500,000 acres to 1,000,000 acres at the time, and it is not very long ago.  The Minister might tell us if he thinks that that is about the amount available for division in accordance with the present policy and without in any way changing our policy.  I have always been urging very hard on the Department to speed up this division of land because I was looking to this ultimate social aim we had in mind.  It was pointed out to me in a convincing way that one might wish to move rapidly, but if one did, one was not going to do in anything like the proper way the work we had in mind, that is, to divide up the land into proper farms and to see that the right type of people got them.  You would require experienced inspectors. At one time we considerably increased the inspectorial staff.  When you increase staff you often slow up work while the staff is being trained.  You slow up the work of the people who are partially engaged in the training of it. During the period shortly after the increase we got a very large amount of land, something up to 100,000 acres. The Minister will set me right if I am wrong, but my recollection is that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I heard complaints afterwards that on account of the speed at which it was done the work was not done as satisfactorily as would be desirable.  We have to choose then between doing what you might call perfect work, which every Civil Service Department wants to do, and going ahead more rapidly and putting up with the mistakes which are necessarily made if work is done rapidly.  One of the mistakes was said to have been that a number of people got portions of land who did not turn out to be suitable tenants or good farmers or the type who should have been given land. <Col N="2107" /> They did not work them.  From the Minister's opening statement, I take it that he has a number of such people in mind and I am sure he will see that the intention of the State in giving land to people will be fulfilled, namely, that they should farm it and make a living out of it.</P>
      <P>The war came and it was necessary for compulsory tillage to get a number of experienced people, and the only Department from which they could be got was the Department of Lands.  That, apart from anything else, crippled the Department during the period of the war.  After the war the intention was to go ahead as rapidly as possible.  I was not Minister, but my own idea was that it was necessary to do something such as was done before when we increased the number of inspectors. Nobody wants to see more inspectors or more State officials in the country than are required to do the work, but if we want the work to be done, we must make up our minds to provide the people necessary to do it.  My view then was that if we wanted to get ahead more rapidly we would have to increase the inspectorial staff.  The Minister for Finance and, possibly, even the Minister for Lands might not agree, but one of the means of doing work is to get the experienced staff.  I said &ldquo;experienced&rdquo; staff.  It is work that cannot be done by novices.  I was amused to hear Deputy Dunne talk of farms which were divided in which there was no water.  In some cases it may be almost impossible to provide the farms with water, but I cannot see a farm getting on without it.  Experience is needed to divide big estates to see that water will be available and to understand the needs of each farm.  Experience is needed, owing to the nature of the task which a land inspector has to accomplish, and you do not get that by competitive examination or from engineers with degrees.  These men have to be trained.  If you want them you have to look ahead and realise that during the year or two in which you are getting these officers trained you will not have the amount of division you might expect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us look at the task.  My recollection <Col N="2108" /> is&mdash;the Minister can correct me if I am wrong&mdash;although there may be differences of opinion about it, that in the report which I received it was stated that we could count on between 500,000 and 1,000,000 acres as being available for division.  I asked myself what was the size of an economic farm, how many farms that land should be divided into, taking the quality of the land into consideration.  That 500,000 to 1,000,000 acres of land would be of different qualities and to estimate the number of families among which it should be divided let us take 50 acres as an average.  I do not think that even taking the land as average land that it would be too far out.  On an average, taking land of various qualities, suppose we make an estimate of 50 acres apiece.  I am not suggesting that an economic farm should run up to that acreage but that, to be economic, it should be of a size that would enable a family to be maintained on it according to requirements in different parts of the country.  If you are near a city or a town where there is a market available for various produce you may not require as large a farm as you might require in a remote area.  Suppose we take it at 50 acres.  Half a million acres would be necessary for 10,000 families.  It would be a great advantage to this country to see an additional 10,000 families in economic security throughout the country.  We hear a lot of talk about emigration and about the diminishing number of children attending rural schools and it would be a great advantage to us if these 500,000 acres were available to settle 10,000 families on them.  If 1,000,000 acres were available, and we take the same average of 50 acres, then it would be possible to settle 20,000 families.  The task before us, therefore, is the placing of 10,000 to 20,000 families on the land.  It is a tremendous national work and of very great importance. If we are satisfied with that aim, we ought to set about the work as quickly as we possibly can.  That was the general aim we had.</P>
    <P>Then we come to the question of the machinery for doing the work.  I pointed out to others a target of 100,000 acres at which we should aim <Col N="2109" /> and, having got 100,000 acres and it was proved practicable, I said: &ldquo;Very well.  There are 100,000 acres.  Why not do that every year?&rdquo;  It was pointed out to me that there was a certain amount of land in hand.  You can get all this land that is available. You can do it, perhaps, more quickly in the case of large estates and parcels of land which require to be divided up. It was suggested that in that particular case there were particularly favourable circumstances&mdash;apart from criticism afterwards to the effect that a number of people got land who, probably, did not turn out to be good tenants.</P>
    <P>I was told then that there was another matter which necessarily caused delay.  Deputy Dunne quickly shied at the difficulties that were in the way but he agrees that the relief of congestion ought to be one of the primary aims in land division.  In other words, he agrees that when we are dividing this land we ought to have in mind the necessity of improving the circumstances of those who have holdings of a very small size and which could not, in any sense, be regarded as economic or of the type to give economic security to the families living on them.  It was suggested that if we really want to have this programme of relief of congestion we should look after, to a large extent, the West.  We have greater congestion in western areas than anywhere else.  I think it was generally agreed that that policy should be pursued.  I think it was the general aim to try and concentrate on dealing with that problem as quickly as possible.  It is an extremely difficult one&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that was a year or two before we went out of office.  I think the Minister will find that the general aim was, seeing that we could not do everything at once, to try and concentrate and deal with this. In the first place it was an urgent and crying need.  In the second place, if it was ever going to be solved it would have to be solved while a considerable amount of land was in hands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Once you had distributed the large parcels of land then you were finished as far as the means <Col N="2110" /> of dealing with congestion in the West was concerned.  In regard to that, there are difficulties.  You have to try to see if it is possible, in the case of three, four or five local farms together, to leave one behind and to try and induce those who leave their old holdings to take up economic holdings elsewhere. It was pointed out that that meant a great deal of negotiation.  Very often one or two individuals hold up a whole scheme.  It was pointed out to me that no matter how rapidly, as a Government, we might desire to go ahead with this, we should be up against the problem of how to get the necessary agreements.</P>
    <P>I propose to deal now with another point raised by Deputy Dunne.  If you want to distribute land and if you want to bring migrants to, say, County Dublin, the people in County Dublin will say that they have prior claim. That, apparently, was what Deputy Dunne said in regard to Dublin, but he can be quite sure that in every other county the people would make that plea too, and in that respect Dublin is not peculiar.  I think it happened in County Meath and in a number of other places too.  We cannot have it both ways.  If we are going to solve the problem of the congested areas, if we really want to solve it and to help those who are there and give them economic holdings, we can only do so in the areas in which there is land available.  If the local people are so numerous that they want to have that land, well, it is quite obvious that you cannot satisfy both.  What was done, I think, in the past, was to try to meet, to a certain extent, the local demand as far as it could quite reasonably be done and, where at all possible, in regard to the land that was left&mdash;after satisfying the most urgent and reason able demands of the local people&mdash;to try to have it made available for migrants.</P>
    <P>What I am coming to is this.  If we are to pursue the policy of dealing with the congested areas and this policy of migrants, it is going to be much slower than anything we have had up to the present.  Consider the distribution of 500,000 acres of land.  I suppose it would be difficult, perhaps, to get an exact calculation, but consider <Col N="2111" /> the position if we distributed 50,000 acres a year.  The Minister suggested that possibly the figure would be 25,000 acres this coming year.  I do not know exactly what was done last year, so I cannot tell him what hopes I would have of his reaching that target of 25,000.  Would the Minister mind telling me how many acres of land were distributed last year?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>By reason of the fact that we are now at the end of the financial year I am unable to give the exact figures.  They are not yet available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not matter. I only wanted a rough figure to enable me to make a calculation.  Suppose the figure were 50,000 acres per annum. It would take ten years to accomplish the work.  If the Minister's figure were to work out as an average yearly distribution it would take 20 years, at the minimum, for the land to be divided. If the division of the land is an important matter&mdash;and I believe that it is important from a social, economic and general point of view&mdash;we in this House ought to be prepared to vote the necessary money to provide the Minister with the staff that would be required to deal with the matter and we ought to make up our minds that it is a job that we will try to accomplish within a period of ten years.  It there are 500,000 acres to be distributed let us set as a target the doing of that job in ten years.  If it were not for the particular difficulties I have indicated as having been pointed out to me, I would certainly press very hard that we should do that.  I do not want, however, to be in any way unreasonable about this.  The Minister by now, however, ought to have considered the whole problem and I think he ought to tell us in broad terms what his plans are and what he would propose to do so that we can check up from time to <Col N="2112" /> time and see the rate of progress.  It seems to me that at the present rate of progress there is no chance of achieving this aim of dividing the land which should be divided in 20 years. I say &ldquo;should be divided,&rdquo; because a lot of people want land divided which probably should not be divided.  I am talking about land which in the social and economic interests of the country ought to be divided.  I do not think we ought to be content to leave it like that.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister ought to consult with his Department and not surrender to any views that may be there unless he is absolutely convinced they are right.  All the difficulties are bound to be put up to him.  He ought, however, to use his own mind on it and see whether there is any possibility of trying to envisage the ending of this problem within a period of ten years. That was the aim I set before myself. I do not know to what extent I would have been able to succeed had we been given the opportunity.  I ask the Minister to examine it in that way and to come to the House and give us a picture of the situation as he sees it, and approach it from the fundamental point of view I have indicated as being in the Constitution&mdash;the dividing of land and establishing on it as many families in economic security as is practicable.  He can always be assured of a sympathetic understanding from those of us who know anything of the matter, or who have any interest in this matter.  He can be assured of a sympathetic understanding of any difficulties that confront him and that we will be all trying to help in order to get this good work ahead as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>I am glad that the Leader of the Opposition intervened in the debate at an early stage because, from the speech he made, we can be assured of calm waters.  It was a reasonable speech and one with which I thoroughly agree.  But, in the course of his speech, he said that a reasonably sized farm would be about 50 acres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I would not like the matter to proceed on a wrong basis. It would be a great pity if there was <Col N="2113" /> any misunderstanding.  I tried to make it as clear as possible that that was only taken for the purpose of a rough calculation.  I spoke about 500,000 acres.  I do not know what the quality of the land is.  I tried to find out the average that I should take so as to make it a basis of calculation.  Do not regard it as anything more than a basis of calculation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the average was a good one.  It is roughly about the size of an economic farm. You could argue for years about the size of an economic farm in different counties and in different areas in counties.  In South Meath a man would want 40 acres on which to rear a family.  In East Meath, where there is fruit growing carried on, you could get a good living out of five acres of land.  Therefore, I think we should give up talking about what is an economic farm.</P>
      <P>The Land Commission Estimate has been very severely criticised for a long number of years and I suppose rightly so, because there is always land hunger amongst the Irish people.  Why should there not be, because in the past many of their ancestors were driven from the land?  I am satisfied that the Land Commission is a very slow-moving machine.  It may be that it should be a slow-moving machine, but I think it was always too slow. This problem of land division should have been completely solved after 25 years of native Government.  I hope that in the next ten years we shall have seen the end of land division. During the last 25 years the Land Commission made a vast amount of blunders.  I am sure the present Minister has a huge task in front of him, an ugly task, namely, to dispossess many men who occupy farms and who will not make an effort to work them. It is not a nice job, but he must face up to it.  I think he told us the number was 1,500 of what I may call undesirables who will not work their holdings. That is a terrible state of affairs, in fact it is a disastrous state of affairs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a question of capital.  I know men who got land and who had not a &ldquo;bob&rdquo; and they are comfortable to-day because they took off their coats and worked.  Too many of the wrong type of men were selected.  I am not going to say they were selected for political reasons, because I do not want to go into that. But too many men who were not of the right type were selected.  I would put a lot of the blame for that on some of the junior inspectors down the country. Where they got the information from I do not know, but there was a good deal slipped across them.  I do not think they should be let off lightly for allowing it to happen.  I know that in my own county inspectors were able to go around giving out Old I.R.A. forms for men to fill up saying that they were Old I.R.A. men and were entitled to land.  Many men who got land as Old I.R.A. men were no such thing, in fact they were the reverse.  I would not mind if they made a good job of the land, but a good many of them are complete failures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree that the first task of the Minister should be to step up economic holdings.  That is one of the main things which have to be done.  There are far too many cases in this country where a man is neither a farmer nor a labourer and is always in a miserable condition.  With regard to migration from the West to the Midlands, I am one of those who will fight for my own county.  At the same time, I will be reasonable and say that we should not act like a dog in the manger.  There is congestion in the West which must be solved in some way.  We do not want to have it solved by the emigrant ship.  I think there is room in all the counties for a fair amount of migration. At the same time, I ask the Minister to be careful and not bring the migrants up by hundreds and thousands to those counties where they are going without giving fair satisfaction to the people of those counties, such as Meath, Dublin, Kildare and Westmeath.  The Minister should give decent and reasonable consideration to the local people and, if he does, he will be met in a good <Col N="2115" /> spirit, and I and other Deputies will help him out.</P>
    <P>A good many farms in my county are a bone of contention at present in connection with division.  In the County Meath, which is one of the most important counties from the point of view of the export of live stock, we cannot have men coming in wholesale and given a division of land.  There are many landholders there who are giving good employment and working their lands to the fullest extent and giving a good return.  These men are a national asset.  They are as much of an asset to Connemara and the South as they are to Meath.  They are big buyers of store cattle and sheep throughout the country and big exporters. Many of these have fairsized farms, but they are giving a full return to the nation in employment and in connection with the export trade.  I think the fears of these men should be allayed, because at present there is land hunger in the Midlands. There are farms there of from 50 to 700 or 800 acres which are earmarked for division in the minds of many local people.  We do not want to get back to the old system of gate-breaking and firing shots into the houses.  There is no need for that.  In my county there are many farms on which there is no farmer living. Some of those men have their homes in the West of Ireland, some are publicans in Dublin and others live in London.  Most of those farms provide no employment except for a herd with his dog.  There may be a man living on an odd farm.  I am satisfied that those holdings are not giving the full return they should to the nation.  If the Land Commission divided them into economic holdings, and I think that could be done in a reasonable way, everyone would be satisfied.</P>
    <P>I hope that in the new Land Bill a reasonable price will be paid by the Land Commission for the land it acquires.  An owner is entitled to the market value of his land.  I am not favouring a small price or too big a price but a fair place.  In the case of some properties that were taken over <Col N="2116" /> in the past the low price paid for the land amounted to semi-confiscation. During the economic war, land was brought to the position that it became almost valueless, and people were glad to get out of it.  I know of one case where the owner, instead of getting any money for his land, had to hand over money when his holding was taken from him.  That is a terrible state of affairs.  I know of another case where a woman, who has since died, had 150 acres of land taken from her, and when everything was cleared up all she was offered was a £5 note.  She refused to take it and she was right.  That sort of thing should not happen in a Christian country.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that, in those areas where you have a good number of small cottiers, a cow plot should be provided.  I think that if proper trustees were appointed, a scheme of that kind could be well worked and would give satisfaction.  I know, of course, that where unsuitable trustees are appointed, endless trouble results.  What I suggest would be of immense benefit in many areas.  In the County Meath, where five-acre plots were given out to men who were called cottiers, experience has shown that, while one man might work the plot well, there were eight or nine who did not, one reason being that they were not able to stock the plot.  A cow plot in the vicinity of these congested areas would solve that problem.</P>
    <P>There is not enough land to give a holding to everyone.  In my county if all who are looking for land got it, there would not be a rood for each one. The Minister is new to his office and we do not want to be too critical at the present time, but if things are not done in the way we expect we will be fairly critical next year.</P>
    <P>The position with regard to water supplies is rather bad in my county. The last Government gave strips of land to people, but did not provide them with a water supply, and they could not afford to sink a pump themselves. They are without water for three months of the year.  During the summer months, when they should be working their holdings, their time is <Col N="2117" /> taken up drawing water from a neighbour's farm.  In future the Land Commission should give such people a water supply.  It is as necessary as the house, the out-offices and the live stock that they get.</P>
    <P>With regard to the colonies which we have in the County Meath, I am satisfied that if the people living in them were consulted they would say that the Land Commission had made a hash of the division of some of the big estates on which we have these colonies.  The people would say that the holdings they were given are too small, and that they could not live on them at all if it were not for the income they have from members of their families who are working on the roads or who have gone to England to work in the pits.  When vesting is completed in Meath, Dublin and Westmeath, I am satisfied that we will be horrified at the number of farms that will be put up for sale.  I am sorry to have to say that.  I have men coming to me day and night asking when their land is likely to be vested so that they may be able to dispose of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>That is as true of those who have come from the West of Ireland as it is of the Meath men.  We have these 22 acre farms, but when you take off the area under roads, ditches and haggards the occupier is left with about 12 Irish acres.  No man is able to rear a family on that area of land. In the West of Ireland, a man might be able to make a living for himself and his family on five acres of land, but in that case he would not be depending entirely on the land.  He would have other sources of income&mdash;from fishing, from State grants and from friends in America.  The position in Meath is different.  There is no fishing industry there, and there are no State grants and very few relatives in America.  I suggest that the size of these County Meath holdings should be stepped up to 30 or 40 acres to enable a man to make a living and rear his family in decency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to change the type of migrant that comes from the <Col N="2118" /> West of Ireland to the Midlands.  Far too many of the smaller type of men are brought to Meath.  I am not saying that they are bad men.  They are good men and work well.  They are as good as any of the Meath men we have. My suggestion is that the bigger type of men should be brought from the West and given reasonably sized farms on which they could provide employment for people.  If a man in the County Galway, with 300 acres of land, was transferred to Meath and given, say, 75 or 100 acres, with a nice house, he would certainly be doing well, and should be able to provide employment for people in the area. What happened under the Cumann na nGaedheal Government was that they took land off the big landholders in the West of Ireland and gave them farms in County Meath, leaving them their old homes in the West.  The result has been that these farms have become an eyesore in the County Meath.  The weeds and thistles on them are never cut unless there is a prosecution brought.  The fences are all broken and the whole place is an eyesore.  The only employment that is given is to a herd with his dog.  Is it to be wondered at that the Meath people should be crying out for land when they see that sort of thing going on?  That was not done by Fianna Fáil, but happened mostly under the Cumann na nGaedheal Government. I think it was a bad policy.  These big idle hulks of migrants from the West only come to Meath to see how their bullocks are doing.  That is a bad system.  I think that, when a man is transferred from a holding to Meath or Westmeath, he should be given an economic unit which would enable him to provide some employment for the local people.</P>
    <P>There is a special problem in East Meath, where there is a growing hunger for land.  We have there a fair number of men who could make good use of an allotment of land.  They would be quite content if we gave them seven, eight or ten acres of land to enable them to engage in fruit and market gardening, whereas, in the other end of Meath, a man could not make a living on less than 30 acres <Col N="2119" /> of land.  You will be doing very good work in East Meath if you give small acreages to good men.  There are scores of good men there crying out for land and entitled to get it.</P>
    <P>We are told that in the future no landless men will get land.  That is very unfortunate.  I know the Minister's idea is that sufficient land is not there.  But we have many landless men in County Meath and some of them have £400 or £500 in capital, a couple of horses and a few cattle.  They are prepared to take land for tillage on the 11 months' system.  They are very good farmers, still they do not own an acre.  If these men were considered I am satisfied the Minister will agree that some of them would be well entitled to a farm.  They are really good farmers, but they have no land.  If they got a holding they would make good.  They should not be kept out of any scheme.  Landless men of that type should get fair consideration. They are good men and a national asset.</P>
    <P>I will not go into this Estimate to the same extent as I did last year.  I was always rightly critical, because in other years a complete hash was made of land division in the Midlands.  The biggest problem is the congest and the new migration in County Meath. There are homesteads in parts of Meath giving accommodation to two or three generations.  These people do not know what to do.  There is a scarcity of fertilisers&mdash;no manures, or manures in insufficient quantity.  The little homes they got were nice and trim eight or nine years ago, but the land is fairly poor to-day, the heart has been eaten out of it.  When a man goes into the milk business, unless he is putting manures and fertilisers back into his land it will run into dirt after a short while.  These little problems are increasing in number.  I ask the Minister to see to it that whoever is planted on the land will be given an economic holding.</P>
    <P>The Minister should also take into consideration starting a migration scheme in the congested areas of Meath.  There are congested areas in <Col N="2120" /> County Meath and some of the people there should be removed to some other part of the county.  It would be desirable to have as many economic holdings as possible.  The small holders should be given at least 25 or 30 acres.  In the congested sections some people could be moved further afield and the holdings of the remainder could, in this way, be made economic.  That would be doing something proper for the nation.  It is not desirable to continue having rural slums.  The Land Commission could do much useful work within the next 15 years if they carried out a scheme of internal migration in Meath as distinct from the scheme of migrating people from the West or the North.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to observe the changed frame of mind in this House in the discussion on this Estimate. We have, this evening, a very mild atmosphere altogether.  Everybody now seems to realise the great difficulties in the way of the Land Commission in proceeding with this work of acquisition and division.  The Minister, when he was in opposition, was not by any means the mildest of the critics of the Fianna Fáil Government. One of his greatest criticisms at that time was that the Minister for Lands was not sufficiently strong-willed in the Cabinet to wrest from the Minister for Finance sufficient money to speed up land division.  He used to say there were other Ministers so strong-willed that they could get almost all they required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the 1949-50 Estimate, and last year we had the 1948-49 Estimate, a Fianna Fáil Estimate.  This year we have a net increase of £107,000 over last year's Estimate and £100,000 of it is put down for the improvement of estates.  That means the erection of out-houses, out-offices and fences.  All that kind of work requires material and labour.  I am not going to compare this Estimate with last year's Estimate; I am going to compare it with the 1947-48 Estimate, which was a year further away from the general election, and that could be considered to be even a more difficult time.  You will find that the increase in this year's Estimate as compared with the 1947-48 <Col N="2121" /> Estimate is only a bare £109,000; it is only just the same increase, so far as the improvement of estates is concerned, of £100,000, as was in the Book of Estimates in 1947-48.</P>
    <P>I want to know was that money expended in 1947-48 on the improvement of estates, or was it expended last year.  I believe it must have been expended last year by reason of the fact that a number of the gangers who were almost whole-time men have been out of employment for a considerable time, and that a considerable amount of Land Commission work that could be done and should be done in the ordinary way was not carried out.  It is a well-known fact that nearly every ganger in my county had his activities with the Land Commission temporarily dispensed with and that a number of them were sent over to the Board of Works to supervise the rural improvement and the minor relief schemes.  I wonder is this extra £100,000 going to provide for a full working year?  Is it going to make such a great difference that it will give even an additional six months' work?</P>
    <P>In addition to that, in the 1947-48 Estimate there was a big increase in salaries and wages.  The amount was £48,315.  This year there is £34,487, so that from 1947-48 to 1949-50 salaries and wages have been increased by £82,802, whereas the money advanced for the improvement of estates has gone up by only £100,000.  Remember that the 1947-48 Estimate was for approximately £52,000,000 and the Estimate this year provides for £65,000,000, a difference of £13,000,000. Out of that £13,000,000, for this thing that we were told was so important for the welfare of the people and thousands of families within the country, they are getting only £100,000, in addition to what was provided in the 1947-48 Estimate.  But the other very small section have got an increase in salaries and wages within £18,000 of that sum.  I think there is something wrong there.  I wonder where the £6,000,000 is that was talked about so glibly as being essential for a Land Commission estimate in order to carry <Col N="2122" /> on and speed up the work of the Land Commission.  On the total Estimate we have this year we are still £3,500,000 short of the £6,000,000 estimate.</P>
    <P>In his opening statement, the Minister mentioned that the Land Commission activities last year would have been greater were it not for the fact that there was no reservoir of land when the Minister took over last year. I thought that we should have had a much more detailed statement from the Minister giving us some indication of policy&mdash;whether there will be any change in the policy to be pursued, whether there will be any slowing up of the work of the Land Commission, or anything else.  But we did not get anything like that.  We were told very little beyond the statement that activities would have been greater had there been any reservoir of land available. There is an implication in that, of course, that the Fianna Fáil Government did nothing about the acquisition of land.  Everybody knows that the acquisition of land had to be slowed up during the war.</P>

I will give the Minister the names of them; I will even give him the record numbers. Therefore, it was not absolutely and completely stopped.  I will mention one estate in particular&mdash;the estate of James J. Smith at Loughrea.  The Minister talks about the hold-up.  There was a hold-up apart altogether from the war.  The Minister and everybody else in this House who takes any interest in the Land Commission at all knows that.  Progress in land acquisition was held up in 1946-47 because an action was taken in the courts challenging the right of the Land Commission on constitutional grounds to take over land. That was the Fisher case in County Louth.  It was only in October, 1947, <Col N="2123" /> that judgment was given by the Supreme Court in that matter.  If that is not so, then I shall ask the Minister how it was&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>How was it that though resumption proceedings were taken in the case of the holding of Eric S.

There are many similar cases which I could enumerate here where the same set of circumstances obtained.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact remains that they were held up until that particular date.  There were other cases where resumption proceedings were taken in 1941 and 1942 and where the petition was disallowed.  I can give the Minister all the record numbers.  If the Minister wants the names I can give him those too.  The Minister, before he took office, held that there should be no difficulty at all in acquiring or resuming land while Fianna Fáil were in office.  The Minister has been 12 months in office now.  What has he done in that period?  The Minister, when he sat on these benches, held that there were no legal difficulties in the way.  He said there were no financial difficulties; in fact, there was nothing whatsoever to prevent the Land Commission taking over these lands.  But I can give him a list of the estates where proceedings were taken away back in 1940 and where the petitions were disallowed in 1941; work on these estates was held up as a result of the war conditions and subsequently as a result of the Fisher case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to see land acquisition proceeding much more rapidly.  We hear a good deal about the congested districts problem.  There is no doubt that the problem is an acute one.  In what term shall we refer to it in the future?  Is it the solution of the congested problem or the relief of the congested problem? Land division will never solve the problem. I have stated that time and time again.  I challenge contradiction on it.  Land division can only give a certain amount of relief.  The Leader of the Opposition, speaking here a short while ago, stated that he asked on some occasion for particulars as to the amount of land available for division; he said that he was not given a firm estimate.  He was told it was anywhere from 500,000 to 1,000,000 acres. Both figures could be right.  There could be 500,000 acres of untenanted land available and there could be about 600,000 acres of land available for rearrangement.  The Minister knows that in his own county there are about 23,000 congests.  In County Galway&mdash;and this figure is a conservative one&mdash;the number is between 12,000 and 14,000.  In County Donegal the figure would range from 10,000 to 11,000.  But we have congested areas in County Leitrim.  We have congested areas in County Clare.  We have congested areas in County Kerry and in West Cork and parts of Waterford. We have a number of congests, according to Deputy Giles, even in County Meath, and according to Deputy Dunne, in County Dublin.  I do not think I should be far wrong in assuming that at the moment there are 60,000 <Col N="2125" /> congests in the entire country.  If we have 60,000 uneconomic holders in the whole State how could we provide for them out of the 500,000 acres of untenanted land plus the 600,000 acres of tenanted land which these congests occupy?  Take, for instance, 20,000 congests.  How many could you put on the 600,000 acres?  I am not going to give as high a figure for the size of an average holding as the Leader of our Party.  He only mentioned that by way of illustration.  However, if you gave 30 acres of land&mdash;and it would be of a very inferior type to what is peopled by the congests&mdash;when you had relieved 20,000 families the whole 600,000 acres would be gone.  What about the remaining 40,000 congests? You have 500,000 acres for them with 12½ statute acres for a holding.  Consequently, all this talk about solving congestion by land division is something that should be finished with for all time.  Playing up to the congests and holding out hope to them should no longer be the highway for the journeyman politician to tread.  If the congestion problem is to be relieved in any satisfactory manner as much of the land available as possible will have to be placed at their disposal, and they must be given decent sized holdings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was some question about the size of holdings.  My personal view is that where there is a fairly large estate it would not be a bad policy to give a holding of land of from 75 to 100 acres to an exceptionally good man if you could get him there, a man who would have a good practical knowledge of working land and of using all kinds of farm machinery.  That man should be of great benefit to the number of others that you would place on the 30-acre holdings, and they, in turn, could be of very great advantage to him.  In my opinion, that is something that should be attempted anywhere it is possible.  However, some Departments other than the Department of Lands have got to tackle the congestion problem.  I advocated what I am stating now when our own Party were the Government.  There are at least two other Departments which must come into it&mdash;the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Department of Agriculture.  The three Departments <Col N="2126" /> combined have got to come in and see what they can do to prepare suitable schemes and establish suitable industries to provide for the people who, no matter what Government is in office, no matter what Minister is Minister for Lands, will still have to reside in the congested areas.  In my opinion, that is something that has to be tackled and it cannot be tackled in any easy way.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of talk about the price of land.  Deputy Giles said that land was taken from people during the economic war who, in fact, had to give money to have it taken from them. Perhaps there were certain cases like that but, if so, I think they did not know their business or they did not understand the law or they did not go to the trouble of going to some legal man for advice.  I hold that it could not be taken from them so easily.  The minute the Land Commission came along and said: &ldquo;We propose acquiring your holding,&rdquo; some of them said: &ldquo;If you do, I cannot stop you.&rdquo;  Is there any criterion on which we can base this market value?  Under the 1903 Land Act, I understand the basis on which the value of land was fixed was so many years' purchase.  Whether that was all right or not then, I do not believe it would be all right now.  I believe there should be some proportionate increase on the number of years' purchase and that we should get some common denominator of that kind to settle this thing once and for all.  It was stated by Deputy Giles that a good deal depends on the location and on the quantity of the land also. I think it is true that, perhaps, a 50-acre farm in certain places is not such a big farm at all.  It is, perhaps, even more difficult to make a living on it than on a five-acre farm in close proximity to the City of Dublin.</P>
    <P>Another point I wish to bring to the notice of the Minister is one which I am sure he has heard all about because in his own county, as in mine, it is something that is brought to our notice very often.  It is this question of the improvement of bogs taken over by the Land Commission.  That is one place I hold the Minister has failed in not having a much higher Estimate for the improvement of estates this year. <Col N="2127" /> A number of bogs, I am sure, in Mayo, Galway, Roscommon and elsewhere have been taken over by the Land Commission.  The offer of a holding of land is very attractive and alluring when a Land Commission official says to a man: &ldquo;Here is your holding if you are prepared to take it.  If not, somebody else will.&rdquo;  An allotment of turbary is given.  There is a verbal promise given that the bog will be drained and put into proper condition. It was given in the past, not merely under the Land Commission under the native Government since it was established, but it was given also under the Estates Commissioners during the time of the Estates Commissioners and the Congested Districts Board. That promise was never redeemed and there are thousands of acres of bogs which were given in that way to tenants 35 and 40 years ago which are there to-day, useless, as no improvements were carried out.  Unless the State steps in those people will never be able to get their supply of turf out of them.  That work could have been done in the first instance by the Land Commission.  What happened at that time is happening to-day, too.  The Land Commission comes along and they point out a holding and point out the bog.  They lockspit the allotments of turbary, the drains and the road. Perhaps the road is half done and the bog is left there.  I am afraid then there is no redress if, by any chance in the world, that holding becomes vested.  The Land Commission snap their fingers at the unfortunate person or persons involved and say: &ldquo;It is your own now; if you wish you can carry on with the improvements.&rdquo;  I think it is time practices of that sort should be stopped.  They were allowed to go on too long and the prevention of them is long overdue.  The Land Commission inspectors come along, making promises to simple countrymen and go away without the slightest intention of fulfilling these promises.</P>
    <P>I mentioned about gangers on halftime. There is another matter I wish to bring to the Minister's attention. There were gangers in the Land Commission when this State was established. <Col N="2128" /> Some of them are there still. There were gangers there when we took over and there are gangers there now.  The Minister for Local Government, in the Fianna Fáil Administration, brought in a Bill which has since become law and is known as the Local Officers' Superannuation Act, but these men did not benefit by it.  These gangers are the very best of men with practical experience, to whom I would be prepared to entrust even the division of an estate rather than entrusting it to some of the degree inspectors who come out from a university, until they have experience of the work.  I believe these gangers should be given some form of establishment and that a pension fund should be created for them. I think, after all the time they have given to the service of the State, there is no reason why they should be the one class exempt from benefits of that kind.</P>
    <P>The Minister intervened here the other evening when Deputy Moran made some remarks about inspectors going out.  I was glad that it was admitted openly here for the first time that the Minister has no right to dictate to the Land Commission in matters concerning the acquisition or division of land, by virtue of Section 6 of the 1933 Act.  That Act was passed here when, mind you, we were up against pretty tough opposition, and pretty tough methods.  Why was it brought in?  It was brought in to take the acquisition and division of land away from Government control.  The Minister may smile&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister may smile, all right, but if the Minister thinks it would be safe for him to dictate to one of his officials, well, let him just try it on but I would not be the person to do so if I were in his position.  I am sure that those who were here before as Ministers for Lands were very careful not to put themselves in pawn to any official or to any set of people who have been given judicial powers.  I hope that has been brought home to the people. I hope that if there is a new Land Act to be introduced, as was hinted by Deputy Giles, that that section is one <Col N="2129" /> that will not be repealed.  All this question of the division of land is not the simple matter it appears to be.  I am glad the time has come that all Parties in this House, so far as I have heard them speak on this Estimate, are agreed that it is not a simple job.  I hope that they will have at least sufficient honesty to admit in their own hearts now, if they do not admit it to the public, that their criticism of Fianna Fáil in this respect was anything but honest criticism.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope to preserve the calm of this debate despite what I might describe as the semi-provocative innocence of Deputy Beegan.  I am going to try to approach the problem in an abstract way.  I hope, whether my membership of this House be long or short, that within that period we shall come here to hold a post-mortem on the Land Commission.  I am convinced&mdash;and I said it when speaking on this Estimate last year&mdash;that the time has come for us to devise some new machinery in connection with the acquisition and division of land.  I think that the Land Commission is an archaic institution and that there are far too many technical difficulties, far too many artifices permitted in connection with it, to allow any Minister really to tackle the question of finishing land division in a reasonable way or in a reasonable time.  I have no hesitation at all in laying a good deal of blame at the door of both native Governments we have had for the chaotic condition of land division at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I go unhesitatingly so far as to say that I think the Land Commission, owing to an inept and stupid approach to the question of what is an economic holding, have created throughout the length and breadth of this country a number of small farm slums in which there is no living for anybody.  The Minister or some other Minister will ultimately have to take the trouble of assessing once and for all what is the amount of land available for division in this country, coming to a reasonable decision in the light of the location of each particular estate or piece of land as to what is an economic unit in the division of that land, and, having decided <Col N="2130" /> that, he will have to get down to the job once and for all of distributing all these holdings and of then saying: &ldquo;The question of land division is now finished.  Any land that will change hands in future will change hands under the normal incidence of sale and purchase or under the normal incidence of succession by right of testacy.&rdquo;  This problem should be tackled on the broadest national basis and tackled in a realistic way, in which no considerations, no efforts of any Minister and no demands on the Exchequer should be allowed outweigh the consideration that this has become a festering sore with which we must deal once and for all.</P>
    <P>Deputy Beegan most probably went very near the truth when he said that there is a good deal, if not of direct dishonesty, then of latent dishonesty in holding out promises to all congests that they will get land ultimately. They will not.  We know that in our heart of hearts and the sooner we face it the better.  We must solve this problem on a broad national basis and then turn in a more realistic way to finding alternative types of employment and livelihood for those people who will have to survive in the congested districts.  I am convinced that no matter what kind of a microbe may infect the Land Commission, one of the most absent ones is the germ of common-sense.  A large number of the officials in that Department seem to approach the problem of rural Ireland congestion and land division from fine, comfortable chairs in comfortable offices, without the least conception of the real situation in the area or the real local feeling.  I am convinced that, whether the Minister can interfere or not with whatever rule the commissioners employ for the distribution of land, there are many instances where, irrespective of what political reasons might be aired by various Parties, people who are absolutely unsuitable have been given holdings and other people in the very same area, who would be absolutely suitable by virtue of their earnestness at their work and their own endeavours, have been overlooked.</P>
    <P>This is a problem about which one may quite honestly say that time is <Col N="2131" /> against its solution.  If it is allowed to continue in the willy-nilly way it has been continued, the magnitude of the problem increases, because you have more and more demands on whatever reservoir of land might ultimately be there and the normal death-rate or wastage of applicants by demise is not sufficient to take up the increase that comes in the demand.  Unless some Government&mdash;and I am urging it upon this Government that they might do it &mdash;takes this as a huge national problem, there will be no final solution. They will have to get some kind of a Department which will have the right to make a survey of all land that they consider suitable for acquisition and redistribution amongst tenants; and the new Department must do that expeditiously, within a period of 12 months, no matter where they get the staff.  They must get the survey done and come into this House and get autocratic powers of acquisition and confirmation of title.  Then, in some way or other, by loan or by some other device, they must get the money to deal with the problem, all within a three-year period.  Then they must take the pool of land acquired by them and they must start on its distribution. Otherwise, there will never be any headway made in this matter.</P>
    <P>I am sure that Deputy Moran sitting opposite me will agree with me that there are too many frills and difficulties and too many artifices that we lawyers can use to defeat the Land Commission as it is operating at present.  There are too many ready means at our disposal by way of objections, legal technicalities and even by non-consent of the tenant here or the tenant there, where the whole activity of acquisition and subsequent division can be held up.  We have a problem and we must face it and take it in one comprehensive sweep, taking over the ownership and control by the State of all the land that is there, and getting some ready and simple statutory means from this Parliament to make good all title to that land, without having all the various devolutions of title and other title difficulties that arise in many of the estates throughout this country.  Unless we can do that <Col N="2132" /> and, then by way of loan or otherwise &mdash;outside normal taxation, I suggest&mdash; buy out all that land there and then and have it ready for distribution, we will never get rid of the problem. There is a tendency towards a growing permanency about the Land Commission, a Department that was designed at one time as a temporary thing; and if it is allowed to continue in its peculiar octopus way, it will be not as one time designed, a method of dealing with a certain land problem in Ireland, but will become a permanent entity within our State.</P>
    <P>We must deal with the problem once and for all and reach its solution and then put it by, saying: &ldquo;There can be no more agitation about land; what has been done is done, we believe, in the best interests of the country; and it is finished.&rdquo;  Otherwise, there will be continued unrest, with a certain amount of dissatisfaction in various quarters, a feeling of uneasiness in the people who may own large tracts of land, that they may be subjected to a semi-confiscatory process.  Then you will have people all over the place acting as political agitators, as each Party stirs up the flames that can be stirred so readily on questions of land and the ownership of land.  You will get waves of uneasiness sweeping through the country, with people demanding and becoming more and more impatient about the land that should be divided. It must be faced in a realistic, national way, as as bad a problem as some of the national scourges we are suffering from, such as lack of houses or tuberculosis. We must tackle it in a fearless way and find a final solution, or some of us who may be fortunate, or unfortunate, enough to be members of this House for a long period will be here arguing, year after year, as to how we are to solve questions of land division.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated his intention of bringing in a new Land Bill. I hope he will have the courage to get back some of his effervescent enthusiasm, as displayed when he was Deputy Blowick on the other benches.  I hope he will get back to the broad outlook that he had then, that this problem must be tackled in a bigger way.  If <Col N="2133" /> he does that and if he has that courage, there will not be a voice on any side of the House raised in protest.  It is the earnest desire of all of us that these problems should be solved as rapidly as possible, so that the people dispossessed by generations of grabbing, generations of settlements, by all the various types of ills and shocks that land ownership has suffered in this country, may be re-established on the land that was once owned by their forefathers and that we now feel should rightly be revested in them.  Unless, in his new Land Bill, he has the courage to get away from the clutches of an archaic monster which is rapidly disintegrating&mdash;so I describe the Land Commission&mdash;unless he gets a new concept with regard to and a new drive into land division, I feel that there will be no future for it, except that possibly, as the years go on, we will have another £100,000 increase.  What is a sum of £100,000 in the solution of the problem of land division?  It will have to be faced on the basis of its real cost which will run to a figure comparable with that envisaged by the Minister for Agriculture in respect of one of his schemes which is to be spread over ten years.</P>
    <P>I agree wholeheartedly with Deputy de Valera for the first time in my life that the time has come for some Minister to lay down a period&mdash;he suggests a ten year period; I suggest a five year period&mdash;within which this problem is to be realistically tackled and a solution arrived at.  I agree that we have reached a stage at which this must be faced, and, if his colleague the Minister for Agriculture can get his £40,000,000 or £50,000,000 for the reclamation of land over ten years, I hope the Minister for Lands will be able to get the £40,000,000 or £60,000,000 which he may need to buy all the land in and divide it out.  The Minister for Lands can always press this point of view, that, no matter what he may spend in the solution of this huge problem, it will ultimately be reaped to the Exchequer in a way which will meet all capital expenditure which the solution of the problem may have involved.</P>
    <P>I said at the beginning what I really <Col N="2134" /> believe, that the Minister will have to get some sensible approach to what is an economic holding.  There are some holdings in the country which are alleged to be economic and I should dearly love to see one of the officials who so describe them trying to make an economic living on them.  We have reached the stage at which the Land Commission in some of its activities has created virtual rural slums.  It is no fault of the people who have got the land.  Some of this land is worked in a very earnest and skilful way, with all the energy of a father and his sons, and yet they cannot get a living out of it.  How the broad definition of an economic holding is arrived at, I do not know.  I have made several efforts to find out from officials the basis on which it is arrived at, but I have failed, and I hope the Minister will be able to tell me what he considers to be an economic holding.</P>
    <P>The Leader of the Opposition took a very sensible line when he spoke of an economic holding as being roughly in the region of 50 acres.  I am quite prepared to admit, and would be the first person to do so, that, in certain areas, particularly where there is the supplement of glass or a particular climatic situation or the proximity of a large market, on a very small holding such as those in Rush and Lusk, it is possible to make a successful living&mdash;it depends on one's enterprise and energy &mdash;but taking it by and large I, representing as I do a congested constituency, feel that the very minimum you should fix in places such as West Cork, parts of Kerry and, I am sure, in Mayo and in Galway, is a 50-acre farm, because, even on that basis, every 50-acre farm will contain at least onethird scrubland.  The time has come, to my mind, when this problem of land division must be faced on the basis of a quick and finite solution, so that we can get down to the problem of building our whole rural economy on the foundation that our land problem is solved.  The situation at present in rural Ireland is that with everybody in expectation of getting a farm, nobody can put his mind down to working out his own salvation in the knowledge that he is not going to get it.</P>
    <P>I want to go further into Land Commission <Col N="2135" /> activities and to suggest that the Minister in future should, in co-operation with the Minister for Agriculture, direct that the various land reclamation schemes, and, in consultation with the Minister for Local Government, the various drainage schemes, should be concentrated on getting as soon as possible the land which may be waste on certain of the big estates now awaiting division cleared up, so that, in the very near future, these big estates which are lying dormant, which are lying as blue prints and archaic files in the Land Commission, will be made capable of providing the biggest possible holdings.  I have no criticism to offer of the administration of the Minister's Department or of his own administration, but I want to express the hope that he will not fall into what I consider to be the error of all the Ministers for Lands, without exception, which this country has had of trying to make an obsolete, pulse-less and decaying system the means by which the problem of land division is to be solved.</P>
    <P>It may be well said that people of my and Deputy Moran's profession might have found things much more difficult in the years gone by, if there had not been all the various legal intricacies and various steps from lay commissioners' courts to judicial commissioners and ultimate appeal to the Supreme Court, by which we were able to delay Land Commission acquisition, and, in many cases, to defeat it.  If all that had not been there, things might not have been so easy for us; but I say that the time has come when, with the 25 years' experience which the Land Commission has had, he should be able to sit down and devise a simple, ready way himself.</P>
    <P>There are only three problems to be solved.  I am speaking now in the spirit of giving advice which may never be accepted, but which is given in the best possible way.  The first problem is easy of solution&mdash;that of getting enough money.  The second is getting an immediate knowledge of all the land which is available.  He has his engineers and I do not think he should have any difficulty in coming back to this House after 12 months and saying: &ldquo;We have <Col N="2136" /> carried out a complete survey of Ireland and there are 1,000,000 acres of land available for sub-division.&rdquo;  Then bring in a very simple little Bill to put the question of dealing with titles right, and I and Deputy Moran may then start to whine a little about what we will lose but it will get my support. Having done that, ostracise all politicians and get down to the problem of distributing land once and for all. When that is done, turn around and tell the people that they have to find another solution for their difficulties because the land is distributed and congestion, in so far as land division will solve it, has been dealt with, that in so far as there is any land in the various counties, it is now distributed and that in future land will be obtainable only in the open market by buying it unless one is lucky enough to inherit it from an uncle or a first cousin.</P>

      <P>If he had the courage to deal with the problem in the manner I envisage he would find that he had another ten years of life by dealing with forestry in the realistic way that my colleague, Deputy Fitzpatrick, would like.  We would have to keep him for that.  There are activities in the Land Commission that I want to deal with rather scantily.  I did not intend to delay the House as long as I did on my solution to land division. Whether it is a little bit too grandiose and ambitious, or not, I do hope the seeming energy and one-time known enthusiasm of the Minister will be sufficient to tackle the problem in a realistic way when he comes to introduce, as he has indicated he will, a new Land Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are activities of the Land Commission that I want to deal with.  I <Col N="2137" /> have a good deal of sympathy with Deputy Beegan.  When they come to deal with the question of turbary, they make certain types of roads, as Deputy Beegan says, before holdings are vested and it might well be said that a lot of their activities in that respect, owing to the fact that they leave them in a state of incompleteness are a national waste.  I do not care whether a job is big or small, if you tackle it at all, do the thing properly.  In parts of Ireland where you have various turbaries being opened up by Land Commission activity, in many cases one might describe the work as that of a botch engineer.  There are things, I suppose, that can be said in defence of it.  There may be a shortage of money. They may be trying to stretch a small grant or a small amount of money that is available from certain funds too far, but I do think that the Minister should try in the coming year to ensure that whatever money the Land Commission may spend on small works of this nature, in so far as the work is done at all, that it will be done in a complete and permanent manner and not left in such a way that the normal progress of a year would allow the work that was done to be dissipated for lack of maintenance.</P>
    <P>There are many sins for which the Minister for Lands is not guilty.  I often feel when talking on the Department of Lands that the Shakespearean quotation is very apt, that &ldquo;the fault is not in our stars but in ourselves,&rdquo; and as long as any Minister allows the medium of his effort to solve this problem to be that amorphous Department, as I describe it, he is striving in vain.  When we were first established as a native Government nobody envisaged that it would take 25 years to solve the question of land division, and anyone sitting back and looking at it reasonably now must realise that, if it is to be continued on its present basis, it will take a fair bit more than another 25 years to solve it.  If in 25 years of effort the figure is the figure that the Minister has quoted, namely, that we have put into holdings 1,500 people that have been proved unsuitable, it is a fair judgment of the real ability of this Land Commission.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2138" /> I am convinced that there are people in the Land Commission who have no conception of what any part of rural Ireland looks like.  I am convinced that there are people in that Department that the Minister might find it very hard to unearth in the cobwebs and files that are stored away in it.  I am convinced&mdash;and I have some wee knowledge of the Land Commission&mdash;that the Land Commission itself feels fettered in its efforts, that the people of responsibility and of any real outlook in it feel that it is not the best and most workmanlike machinery for dealing with its immediate problem.  If the Minister does not attack this problem on the basis of finding a better, more pliable and more intelligent instrument for carrying out the desire of all of us, namely, the consummation and ultimate clearing up and finishing of the land problem, we will be talking about it <i>ad infinitum</i>, because we will never get any nearer a solution.</P>
    <P>Before I move to report progress, may I say that if there is going to be any kind of narrow approach to the question of land division, there will never be a solution?  Unless we have courage to grapple with the problem on the three broad principles I have suggested of finding out first how much land we have; secondly, what it will cost to acquire it all and, thirdly, by some legislative proposal, making a simple and ready way of completing title, we will be up against time's delay, the law's delay and then, <i>ad nauseam</i> we will be asking here when So-and-so in such a parish is going to get a bit of land belonging to So-and-so, and we will be still getting the answer: &ldquo;The Land Commission have no proceedings at the moment to acquire the said holding.&rdquo; I move to report progress.</P>

      <P>May I ask, before the Minister begins, if he is really determined to enforce that this be taken now?  We thought that the Bill was going to be a simple one, but those who have examined it with knowledge tell <Col N="2139" /> me&mdash;and it seems clear enough on the surface of it&mdash;that it has very wide implications, and these implications need time in which to be examined.  I suggest that we would do the nation's work better if those who are here to criticise a measure were able to criticise it properly.  I know that it has been ordered, but I suppose the Order could be set aside by agreement, and I would ask the Minister&mdash;in no sense at all to cause obstruction, but in order to do our work well&mdash;if he could leave this over till next week so that sufficient time would be given for its examination.</P>

      <P>I understood that this matter was already decided to-day.  This Bill does nothing in the direction that Deputies opposite fear.  It has no power to do anything of the kind and all these fears as they are generally felt are wholly unfounded.  It is very necessary that this Bill be put into law at the very earliest date from the point of view of bringing certain lands in this country into production and from the point of view of the promotion of employment. If the Bill is to be delayed for a certain period the purposes it is intended to serve will also be delayed and I must ask the House, therefore, to take this Bill as already arranged.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Local Authorities (Works) Bill, 1949, be now read a Second Time.  As Deputies will have observed, this Bill is a short one. There are, in fact, only six clauses in the Bill but the whole idea of it is contained in Clause 2.  The Bill, as Deputies will also have observed, is framed in very simple language which is very easily understood and that relieves me of the responsibility of making any lengthy explanation of its contents.  The Bill is intended to serve two purposes.  It is designed to remove a disability which precluded local authorities from protecting public property in the past, a disability the presence of which was very keenly felt in <Col N="2140" /> many counties in this country.  One purpose of the Bill, therefore, is to enable local authorities to execute such works as they consider reasonable for the protection or relief from flooding, landslide, subsidence or other similar occurrence of any land owned by them, or any permanent construction, that is, a road, bridge, building, wall or embankment which was constructed by them or which they are required by law to maintain.  But it goes somewhat further and it proposes to provide against or remove the cause of flooding in any lands within the functional area of a local authority which are not owned by them but which it considers necessary to improve in the interests of the landowner concerned or in the public interest generally.</P>
      <P>Section 2 of the Bill describes the type of work that is visualised under the Bill.  The types of work which it will be possible to execute are the clearing of obstructions in watercourses, the making of drains, the widening or deepening of watercourses, the making or repairing of walls or embankments and the diversion of water into watercourses.</P>
      <P>There is a provision in the Bill enabling the Minister to nominate a person to carry out works which a local authority is unable or unwilling to carry out.  I want to assure the House that that is a perfectly innocent provision. The position is, of course, that work of this kind may arise in quite a number of urban areas and urban authorities will have neither the means, the organisation nor the facilities to carry it out.  It will then be necessary to nominate, say, the county engineer of the authority of the county in which the urban area is situated.  It might be necessary in certain areas, or because certain difficulties have arisen, to nominate some engineering officer, say, of the Department, to see that the work is carried out in accordance with the terms of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two ancillary sections, one of which deals with the right of entry on land and the other which provides for the payment of compensation to persons whose lands are damaged by reason of the carrying out of works. Deputies will have observed&mdash;and I think this is a complete answer to the <Col N="2141" /> suggestions that there was something sinister, far-reaching and dangerous in this Bill&mdash;that the Bill does not in fact propose to arm local authorities with any compulsory powers for the acquisition of land.  The Bill follows closely, almost exactly, the pattern of the Sanitary Services Act and the Arterial Drainage Act and other legislative measures which have been enacted in rapid succession in this House over a number of years and which provide for the right of entry on land.  It is no more revolutionary, radical or far-reaching than the provisions of the Emergency Powers Order which enabled lands to be entered on for the purpose of getting turf, opening bogs or drains, or making roads to facilitate the people who used these bogs and it is quite in accord with the general lines of legislation of a similar kind which has already been passed into law.  I want to emphasise, therefore, that it is not proposed to arm local authorities under this measure with compulsory powers for the acquisition of the land necessary for the carrying out of schemes.</P>
    <P>My firm conviction is that the many schemes which I believe will be formulated under this Bill and successfully operated will be put forward as a result of the full measure of co-operation in rural Ireland which I expect for this Bill.  I am quite satisfied that the Bill will be generally welcomed by land owners who have been interested, not for a short time but for many years, in the passage into law or the provision in some other way of powers such as this Bill will provide and I therefore confidently believe that the bulk of the work to be carried out under this Bill when it becomes an Act&mdash;and I believe there will be a very considerable amount&mdash;will be carried out on the basis of co-operation, harmony and understanding between the local authority and the land owners concerned. I do not think it will be necessary, therefore, to engage in any long justification of this measure.  However, it may be necessary to make a few general observations so that the position may be very fully understood in this House.</P>
    <P>As I have already said, the first power conferred on the local authorities <Col N="2142" /> by the Bill is one to enable them to undertake works for the protection of land or the relief of flooding on land owned by them.  I am quite sure that there are still a considerable number of people in the country who are of the opinion that there is no legal impediment to local authorities going in and doing work of this kind.  Take, for instance, the case of a public road that is flooded by an adjoining river. The obvious and the proper and the legitimate thing for the local authority to do would be to enter on the stream or river in question and to clear it of whatever causes the flooding.  In fact, they have no right whatever to do this work.  A number of local authorities know already to their cost&mdash;because that cost is represented in the subsequent deterioration of a good deal of their property&mdash;that they have no right to do this work.  There are members in this House who were colleagues of mine on a local authority for a number of years.  We know how often we experienced the feeling of frustration that a difficulty of this kind caused in regard to the carrying out of very necessary public works.  We did, in fact, over a number of years make representations that these impediments should be removed.  No steps that I am aware of were ever taken to do so. Therefore, apart altogether from the other provisions of the Bill, it would be necessary at some stage, and at a very early stage, to undertake the enactment of legislation that would remove that disability so that existing public property would be maintained in a reasonable condition of repair and would not be subject to the deterioration that the existing position entailed.</P>
    <P>This difficulty is exemplified by instances where rivers or streams which run alongside or under roads become swollen as a result of continuous rainfall. The remedy is very often quite simple and it is very often largely an inexpensive one.  The removal of obstructions such as tree trunks or silt or rocks, the widening and deepening of the bed of the river or stream and the building of embankments or retaining-walls is necessary to remove difficulties of that kind.  It is a common occurrence to notice bridges endangered, very frequently because of <Col N="2143" /> an accumulation of silt under the eyes of the bridges.  Notwithstanding that position, there is no legal authority whatever to undertake that work.  The local authorities who undertake work of that kind, through their officers, are liable to surcharge for its execution although the canons of commonsense seem to be outraged by such an extraordinary procedure.  The local authorities are in the position that, while they can spend public money on repairing, say, the fabric of a bridge, they cannot enter under the eye of it to remove an obstruction that endangers the structure and damages public property on an adjoining roadway for a very considerable distance on either side of the bridge.  During the last two or three years there have been, in many districts where there was never in the public knowledge very much flooding, frequent experiences of very severe flooding.  In my judgment a measure of this kind will help very considerably to obviate that flooding in the future.  I am not imprudent enough to suggest that it will completely remove it but I believe it will lessen it very considerably and remove entirely the frequency&mdash;the degree if not the frequency&mdash;of flooding in a number of areas.</P>
    <P>I feel quite sure, therefore, that this Bill will be welcome.  I am quite satisfied that it will receive from the owners of land a very substantial measure of co-operation.  I would emphasise again that the spirit in which we hope to see this Bill operated is one of co-operation and understanding.  There is no intention whatever, and I think this fact should be recognised by anybody who wants to face the facts, to do anything that will in any way injure the property or the interests of any person. Rather is it intended under a measure of this kind to help people; to remove the disabilities under which they have laboured for a long time; to protect public property and&mdash;a very important point in my judgment&mdash;to provide a very large scheme of employment in the rural areas.  That employment will be provided by way of productive work &mdash;work that will result in making the lands that will be dealt with under this Bill more productive; work that will, <Col N="2144" /> therefore, be of benefit to the community as a whole in the districts in which schemes of this kind will be operated.  I believe that the Bill will be very generally operated in rural Ireland where it seems to me and it has seemed to me for a number of years there is very wide scope for the execution on a large scale of works of this kind.</P>
    <P>I have given the House an idea in a general way of what this Bill proposes to do.  But it proposes to do something else also.  It proposes to do endeavour to grapple with that problem in a number of towns where public property, represented by local authority houses, is subject to periodic flooding and where most difficult conditions have arisen in many instances in past years.  Again, I do not pretend that this Bill will provide the complete remedy for that but I confidently assert that it will ease the position that was created in a number of areas in past years.</P>
    <P>It proposes also to enable the local authority to do work for the removal of the danger of flooding to houses not owned by them.  The local authority is more and more, as time goes on, concerned in this matter of housing. Damage to house property of any kind is now becoming a serious matter for the local authorities, because more and more the local authorities are being compelled by the force of circumstances to undertake the provision of houses for widening sections of the people.  One of the reasons for this Bill is that the work which it proposes to do is beyond the financial capacity of any individual landholder or any group of landholders.  Because of that fact, the local authority is asked to act as agent of the people in having works of this kind executed.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will observe, this is an enabling Bill.  The finance necessary to operate this Bill is being made available by the Government.  The grants to local authorities will be 100 per cent. and local authorities need have no reservations whatever on that point.  I am confident that the local authorities will see a wide scope for the execution of schemes of this kind in their administrative areas.  I am quite sure <Col N="2145" /> that their engineers, who are already engaged on preliminary examinations and the possibilities of schemes of this kind, have had a tremendous lot of useful information and proposals put before them, and I expect to get the result of these examinations in a short time.</P>
    <P>As I explained, the urgency of proposals of this kind is the necessity for getting on with useful public work. The necessity for doing useful public work has been felt on all sides of the House, not alone for the past 12 months, but for many years.  This seems to me to afford a good opportunity for putting that policy into practice.  I believe, therefore, that the proposals, instead of being regarded with suspicion or doubt down the country, will be welcomed because they indicate an opportunity of undertaking in a national way work of this kind which members of local authorities for very many years have felt would be useful and valuable.  I have mentioned the proposal by which small local authorities, who may not have a technical staff to undertake schemes of this kind, will be facilitated by the nomination of some other agent for that purpose, and that is the main reason for the section in the Bill dealing with that matter.</P>

      <P>No.  I think not.  I understand the Minister for Industry and Commerce has proposals which will be made public later on and which will deal with the problem the Deputy has inquired about.  I recommend this Bill to the House.  I assert that the operation of the schemes to be promoted under this Bill, when it becomes an Act, will prove conclusively that there is no danger whatever of any indue or unfair interference with people's rights or property.  I am quite satisfied that the people in rural Ireland need have no fears whatever on that score and that they will embrace the opportunity which this Bill will afford them of restoring to fertility lands that periodically and for several months of the year have been water-logged over <Col N="2146" /> a number of years.  I am satisfied that these people in rural Ireland who have not regular employment now nor for very many years past will also be glad to participate in the good and useful work which this Bill will make possible for them at good wages.  I, therefore, recommend the Bill to the House as a useful measure which I am very glad to have an opportunity of putting forward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I should have thought, in view of the furore here to-day, that the first task to which the Minister would have addressed himself in presenting this Bill to the House would be by way of self-exculpation, to have demonstrated beyond yea or nay the need for urgency to the Opposition, one of whose functions in Parliament is primarily to protect the rights of the private individual.  Just as it can be said that the Government are charged in an especial measure with safeguarding the public interest, so those of us who are private Deputies must do our utmost in Parliament to protect the rights of ordinary private citizens like ourselves whose rights are likely to be affected by legislative proposals. Because we do speak for the common people of the country, we are entitled, in justice, in order that we may be enabled to discharge our duties properly, to get fair facilities for studying the measures put before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister to-day, led by the Taoiseach, and supported by the majority which is behind him, showed a wanton and brutal disregard, not merely for the responsibilities of the Opposition, not merely for the rights of the Opposition but for the rights of private individuals when, in relation to a measure of such far-reaching implications as this Bill, he allowed us no more than two days to study it, to examine and analyse its provisions, and to satisfy ourselves whether, on the whole, they are or are not likely to conduce, not merely to the public interest but to the general happiness and prosperity of the private people of this country.  Let me make it clear again that, though this Bill may have been delivered to the post office on Friday evening or Saturday morning, it did not <Col N="2147" /> in fact reach the homes of the majority of members of this House until Monday morning, or perhaps even in some cases Monday afternoon.</P>

      <P>I think, too, that we ought to have respect for the collective right of this Assembly as a whole.  As Deputy Allen said, we are in this position, that in many cases the text of this Bill did not reach Deputies until Tuesday afternoon.  Since Tuesday we have been heavily engaged in this House.  We were engaged in the discussion of a most important proposal&mdash; the Vote on Account&mdash;to provide a considerable sum of the taxpayers' money to carry on the services here, to approve of a policy which many of us think is disastrous to the people of the country, a policy which requires close and detailed examination.  How, in the light of his other responsibilities in this House, could any Deputy adequately examine this Bill and come in here and discuss it intelligently, and discuss it, as we are bound to do, critically?  That is the position in which we now find ourselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is being rushed, and it is being rushed without any justification. Where are the vast public interests that are at the present moment being endangered by reason of the fact that this Bill is not law?  What public edifice is being undermined by floods or water?  I should have thought that one of the difficulties that we are experiencing at the present moment in this <Col N="2148" /> country is, perhaps, a shortage of water; but, in any event, where are these vast tracts of land that are at present endangered; where are the valuable public properties that have been jeopardised or damaged by reason of the fact that this Bill has not become law?  I should have thought that, when the Minister put this Bill before the House as an urgent measure, he would, at least, have told us all that, or at least have given us some examples of major damage that was being occasioned by reason of the fact that the local authorities had not the powers which he is now asking.  But the Minister has not addressed himself to that question; he has not even addressed himself to the Bill, and the remarkable thing about the Minister's introductory speech is the fact that he has failed completely to follow the normal precedents in this Legislature to expound this measure for the benefit of those Deputies who have not yet had time to peruse it.</P>
    <P>The Minister says this is a simple Bill.  I suggest to the House that it may be simple, but I am going to contend that, even if the Minister does contend that it is simple, it may be a very dangerous measure, and that those who look at this simple enactment cannot allow themselves to forget that it is a simple enactment affecting the property of a great many individuals in this country, and they cannot allow themselves to forget that an important element in the Coalition which is sponsoring this Bill is a group which believes that, in order to open the way towards the establishment of an Elysian Paradise in this land, all rights in property should be expropriated.  I will justify this warning later.</P>
    <P>If the Fianna Fáil Government had proposed to bring in a measure which is so conspicuously lacking as this in any safeguard for the rights of an individual who may be affected by the operations of these local authorities, we should have been told that we were rushing headlong towards Communism. Now, we have had an attempt to establish totalitarianism here in Blue Shirts, and in this Bill we have totalitarianism in jack-boots, because, as I will show, under this Bill the Minister has power, and he himself <Col N="2149" /> has admitted it, to choose his instrument and to choose his agents to go in anywhere on any person's land and carry out any works that he, the Minister, may think should be carried out if by any chance the local authority is unwilling to obey his <i>fiat.</i></P>
    <P>The Minister says that this is a simple Bill.  A Bill to make it a capital offence to possess private property would be just as simple a Bill as this, perhaps even simpler.  It might be written in three lines instead of in five sections, but because it would be written in three lines that would be no excuse for accepting the Bill just on the <i>ipse dixit</i> of the Minister that it was a very simple Bill.  The Minister for Local Government has said that all our fears are unfounded.  He says that the Bill is necessary to bring lands into productivity.  Well, we shall examine it in the light of that argument.  Just examine sub-section (2) of Section 2 and see what it says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where a local authority to whom this section applies are of opinion that&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  any land owned by them, or</P>
    <P>(b)  any permanent construction which was constructed by them or which they are required by law to maintain,</P>
    <P>has sustained or is likely to sustain damage from flooding, landslide, subsidence or other similar occurrence, the local authority may execute such works as they consider reasonable for the purpose of affording relief or protection from the damage.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Will the Minister tell us the extent of the agriculturally productive land that is owned by local authorities?  There are local authorities which do not own even a cow park, and yet look at the wide powers which are to be conferred upon them in this Bill, powers which, we are told, are to be conferred upon them in order to enable them to increase the productivity of their land.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy will just wait I shall come to the next sub-section. I am going to try to do the <Col N="2150" /> thing which the Minister neglected to do, though he was in duty bound to the House to do it.  I am going to try to explain to the House the purport and content of the various provisions in this Bill, and if the Deputy will be just patient enough he will hear something about sub-section (3) in due time. I am again putting it to the Minister to tell the House the area of land in the ownership of local authorities, the productivity of which is at the present moment being endangered by reason of the fact that they have not got these powers.  Do Deputies not think that at least the Minister ought to have told us that?  He has been harping on the fact that this Bill is necessary to enable local authorities to do certain things; he has told us that if they are given these powers it will increase the productivity of land, theirs amongst others.  I think that if this Bill were the fruit of any investigation or any study, if it were anything else than a panic measure introduced in order to try to appease the widespread disaffection and discontent in the country which the Minister's policy in relation to the roads has created, the Minister would be fortified by statistics showing the area of land in the ownership of local authorities whose productivity would be increased by the provisions of this measure.</P>
      <P>Before I pass from sub-section (2) of Section 2 I would ask him also to enumerate to the House the number of permanent constructions in the ownership of local authorities which have sustained, or are likely to sustain, damage from the causes specified in the Bill.  I think that he ought at least to have told us that, if indeed he can find any justification for the plea of urgency which he has made for this measure.</P>

    <P>The Minister says, of course, that this Bill is simple in language.  I have already told the House that it would be quite easy to draft measures containing the most outrageous provisions in very simple language and very terse language, but the unfortunate thing about bad legislation that is drafted in simple language, in language which appears to be clear to the ordinary layman, is that it has the unhappy <Col N="2151" /> knack of proving to be very difficult to interpret, and very difficult to make operative.  There is one thing the history of the legal profession has taught us, and that is that lawyers always reap a very rich harvest from legislation which is expressed in oversimplified terms.  I can assure the House, though I am only a layman with, however, some experience of what the lawyers in the courts can do with simple phraseology, that in the interpretation of this Act there will be a good many pickings for the lawyers.</P>

      <P>Sub-section (3) reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where a local authority to whom this section applies are of opinion&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is very easy to become of a certain opinion when you want to serve your friends.  That is a point which will arise for consideration later.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;that&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  any land in their functional area, not being land owned by them, or</P>
      <P>(b)  any permanent construction in their functional area, not being a permanent construction which was constructed by them or which they are required by law to maintain, has sustained or is likely to sustain damage ... may execute such works as they consider reasonable for the purpose of affording such relief or protection.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2152" /> If this matter is urgent, do you not think the Minister should have been in a position to place before the Dáil some estimate of the amount of land in private ownership that is being damaged or is likely to be damaged, as the sub-section sets out, from flooding, landslide, subsidence or other similar occurrence?  That is not a problem with which the local authorities are unfamiliar. There is not, I am certain, a county surveyor or an assistant county surveyor or even a road ganger in any part of this State who could not at once enumerate those particular pieces of property in private ownership in his district which are likely to be damaged in these ways.</P>
    <P>If the provisions of this Bill have received the consideration which their importance merits, surely the Minister for Local Government would have received from the local authorities already, would have collected during the past 12 months, the statistical data which would have enabled him to give to the House figures for the amount of damage taking one year with another which has been occasioned by the causes mentioned in this Bill?  One would have thought that that would be a simple thing to do, but the Minister, instead of doing his ordinary normal duty as a responsible Minister and treating the House as a responsible legislative Assembly, as a congregation of reasonably intelligent beings who should be persuaded by argument, substantiated by some evidence, chooses to ignore every one of us.  He feels confident that he has behind him the support of a majority and, therefore, he disdains to give, not merely to the members of the Opposition and not merely to those who support him, but he disdains to give to the people of the country, the facts and figures upon which he bases the outrageous proposals in this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>One would have thought that where any public bodies are given wholesale and arbitrary rights to interfere with private property in the way proposed in this Bill that at least the Minister would have <Col N="2153" /> been able to adduce to the House irrefutable figures which would have justified his proposals.  He has refused to do that and, instead, he has come here saying, &ldquo;I am a meek, harmless and simple individual; all I am anxious to do is to increase the productivity of the land and provide employment and therefore you must pass this Bill without any hesitation or criticism, without any attempt to point out to the people the dangers which are involved.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is too much of a confidence trick.  There is no use in trying to sell the farmers a gold brick, to tell them this will benefit their land when, in fact, it will enable local authorities to deal with those farmers' lands in any way they like.</P>
      <P>It is rather extraordinary that the Minister did not refer to some of the other provisions in this Section 2.  Let me read again sub-section (3), which Deputy O'Higgins was so very anxious to hear about a little while ago:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where a local authority to whom this section applies are of opinion that&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  any land in their functional area, not being land owned by them, or</P>
      <P>(b)  any permanent construction in their functional area, not being a permanent construction which was constructed by them or which they are required by law to maintain,</P>
      <P>has sustained or is likely to sustain damage from flooding, landslide, subsidence or other similar occurrence and that it is in the public interest to afford relief or protection from the damage, the local authority may execute such works as they consider reasonable for the purpose of affording such relief or protection.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Do Deputies not think that the House in this section is being asked to abrogate one of its major functions? We here are, in general, supposed to be the ultimate judges of the public interest.  That is why we have the lawmaking prerogative.  When we pass legislation to limit the rights of property in certain ways, or to do other similar things, we do it as judges of the <Col N="2154" /> public interest.  We are under the Constitution the judges of the public interest; and one of the points that may arise later in the courts&mdash;if people can ever get to the courts under this Bill&mdash;for the consideration of the judges is as to whether we have any right to constitute the local authorities as the unrestricted and unqualified judges of the public interest.</P>

      <P>They are not limited by what the section covers in relation to any one of these works.  Under the Bill the local authorities are virtually free of all responsibility for any illjudged action of theirs which they are of opinion is in the public interest.  We shall deal with that when we come to the relevant section.  At the moment I am dealing with one particular point: for the first time in its history Dáil Eireann is being asked, I believe, to allow small bodies of local men&mdash;however estimable they may be in other respects&mdash;to become the judges of the general public interest.  However estimable they may be in other respects, they cannot have the necessary vision or the necessary experience to constitute themselves reliable judges in such a cause.</P>

Perhaps he will be patient with me now and allow me to continue <Col N="2155" /> for I was patient in listening to him talking about the Land Commission, and perhaps we shall get on a little better then.</P>
      <P>Now, what else does this Section 2 do?  It empowers the local authorities to carry out works without restriction as to their nature or as to their cost.</P>

      <P>It does not limit, because these things are not exclusive. They are mentioned here as enumerating the types of works in particular that may be done.  It does not say &ldquo;shall include only.&rdquo;  Therefore, we are in the situation, so far as Section 2 is concerned, that the local authorities may undertake at the public expense&mdash; we shall deal with the question of who is going to pay for it afterwards, whether it is to be the ratepayers or the taxpayers&mdash;and carry out work on a certain person's land, with no limitation in regard to cost and with no concern for the damage they may do to some other man's property.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>And I repeat with no concern for the damage which they may <Col N="2156" /> do to some other man's property.  We are in the position that a friend of a Minister&mdash;if there is such a Minister of that character in office, as there may be&mdash;could be benefited at the expense of an opponent of the Minister, because there is nothing in this Bill which provides an adequate safeguard for the damage which may be done by a local authority in carrying out such works as it elects to execute under Section 2 of the Bill.  That is the plain and simple fact.  Any person who has read the Bill cannot deny it.</P>
      <P>Before we depart from that Section 2, let us see some of the things which may be done.  The making of drains seems to be simple.  In many instances I have no doubt it is a useful and necessary work but, in certain circumstances, it is work which is likely to occasion great damage.  It will depend upon where the work is done; it will depend upon the nature and extent of the work.  We all know the very serious drainage problems which have been created by ineffective, inefficient or inexpert attacks upon a particular drainage problem.  We have some experience of that, even if Deputy Collins has not.  That was one of the problems that the Turf Development Board had to face and overcome in its early stages. Because of the unsatisfactory condition in which we took over the drainage systems of this country from the Cumann na Gaedheal Government, as soon as ever the Turf Development Board began to attack the problem of bog drainage they found they were immediately flooding out large stretches of the country.  While it is quite true that in a great number of cases&mdash;and I do not want to appear to unduly minimise the number of cases&mdash;it may be a useful and necessary work; nevertheless if such work is carried out without due thought and consideration for all the factors involved it may do more harm than good.</P>
      <P>Take the next particular item&mdash;the removal of substances or things causing obstructions in watercourses.  I wonder would a weir he held by the courts or by the local authority to be a &ldquo;thing causing obstruction in watercourses&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>

      <P>Precisely.  I am grateful to Deputy Sir John Esmonde&mdash;I am sorry if I ascribed the assistance for which I am indebted to Deputy Collins to Deputy Sir John Esmonde.  I apologise to Deputy Sir John Esmonde, and I am very grateful to Deputy Collins. Because of Deputy Sir John Esmonde's well-known interests in fisheries I thought perhaps the prompt would have come more readily and properly from him.  I understand, however, that it is to Deputy Collins I am indebted for the fact that the expression, &ldquo;things causing obstruction in watercourses&rdquo;, might be held to cover and include weirs&mdash;fishing weirs, perhaps mill dams&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We are now at the stage, therefore, at which it will be possible for a local authority to benefit a friend of a friend of an officer of that authority, or the friend of a friend of a member of the local authority, with sufficient influence to persuade whoever is going to be the responsible executive officer under this Bill, by making it possible for that authority under this Bill to remove, say, a weir in order to improve the drainage of a certain stretch of land along a river and, at the same time, do a great deal of damage to the private property of some other man.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to say very much about the widening or <Col N="2158" /> deepening of watercourses.  You cannot widen or deepen a watercourse without having a great deal of what is sometimes very undesirable material from the point of view of the farmer, to get rid of.  Where is the material which is removed when the watercourse is widened or deepened to be deposited? Wherever, so far as the Bill goes, in God's good earth the local authority likes.  It may even be on the land of the farmer whose holding happens to adjoin the watercourse which is widened or deepened.</P>
      <P>I have not much to say about the making or repairing of walls or embankments.  The diversion of water, under paragraph (e), into watercourses may be productive of very undesirable consequences; but it is to be done, mind you, if the local authority considers it reasonable to do so and in the public interest in order to protect, say, the property of one individual without any regard to the rights of another. That is written all through this Bill and that is why I said at the start that we ought to consider it very carefully. There is no single safeguard in this Bill which will protect the right of any person whose property is likely to be affected by the operations of the local authority.  It is very remarkable that in the course of his speech introducing this measure the responsible Minister did not once advert to that very undesirable position.  Here he is giving the local authorities wide powers without restriction.</P>
      <P>Let me, however, make my position quite clear.  This Bill is not entirely the creation of the Minister.  There was prepared for inclusion in a measure for which I was responsible provisions which would confer upon the local authorities power to carry out certain necessary works to protect their own property; the power to clear obstructions from the eyes of bridges; the power to construct embankments to protect roads.  But they were not introduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister will be good enough to refer to the former Secretary of the Department, Mr. James Hurson, he will tell him.  I think, perhaps, the former Secretary, Mr. Collins, will also tell him.  However, at least Mr. Hurson will tell him because this matter received very careful consideration from me in relation to a stretch of road in Cork County with which the Minister is very familiar.  It would have been introduced, I think, in the Local Government Act of 1946 except for the fact that when this apparently simple provision was being drafted we at once found ourselves up against some of the very important considerations which I am now endeavouring to put before the House.  If the Minister looks in the draftsman's office he will find a draft of the section to which I refer, in which we decided that we would not bring it in in the 1946 Bill because the matter required further consideration.  We were proposing ultimately to bring it in in the amended and expanded Sanitary Services Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to get back to the point I was going to make.  I am not for a moment going to deny that it would be useful to give power to the local authorities to do some of the things that are embodied in this Bill.  It would be very desirable that they should be able to make drains in certain circumstances. It would be very desirable that they should be able to remove substances causing obstructions in watercourses. For instance, as the Minister has said, the accretion of loose stones which often chokes the eyes of bridges and causes flooding is not a very desirable thing.  However, this measure goes far beyond that.  It gives the arbitrary power to a local authority, an urban district council, a county council or the corporation of a county borough or a borough, to go in on any <Col N="2160" /> man's land and do any of the things which they think are reasonable and necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>In certain circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It gives them the power to execute works designed ostensibly to prevent flooding of any lands owned by them or any land, in fact, owned by any private individual and to do that without being compelled even to give notice that they are going to do so to the persons whose lands are likely to be detrimentally affected. We have had many examples before this House where important public works were being undertaken; works of great magnitude which were undeniably in the public interest, works which were generally approved by the people almost unanimously.  Yet, in the case of every one of these works carried out by responsible people who were subject to public criticism and attack here in the Dáil and over whom we had this control: If they abused the powers we gave them we could remove them from office and appoint more considerate and more prudent men to take their place.  Notwithstanding that these boards were carrying out important public works on a vast scope, works which would undeniably improve the productive capacity of the people, the Dáil thought it wise to write into all the legislation empowering them to do these things certain provisions for the protection and the safeguarding of the public.  We had, for instance, in relation to the Shannon Electricity Act of 1925 provisions in Section 10 providing that before work was commenced steps would be taken to ensure that all parties likely to be affected thereby would know what it was proposed to do.  Where is there any provision in this Bill to ensure that this will be done?  Section 45 of the Electricity Supply Act of 1927, the Act under which the Electricity Supply Board was set up, may be summarised in these terms because it is a lengthy provision: When the board thinks proper to use compulsorily any easement or other right over land, or any right of impounding, diverting or abstracting water for the performance <Col N="2161" /> of any of its duties or functions, it must by Special Order, declare its intention and before making the Special Order, it must deposit in a suitable place documents which will fully and clearly indicate what it is proposed to do.  It goes on to say that before doing any of these things&mdash; the availment of any easement or right or the diversion or abstracting of any water&mdash;it shall give notice in such manner as it may consider best adapted, for informing persons likely to be affected by the Order of its intention and of the manner in which representations and objections in respect of the Order may be made. Where is there any such provision in this so very simple Bill, which gives to a local authority power completely to expropriate certain private rights which individuals have in their property?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, in Section 53 of the Electricity Supply Act of 1927, we have it laid down that certain provisions must be complied with prior to the placing of an electric line across land.  There is no question here of entering land and depositing on it the rubbish which may be taken from the bed of a river&mdash;the carcases of dead dogs, old pieces of tin cans, old bicycle wheels and the general débris you get along a river.  It is not a case of doing any permanent damage to the land; it is a case merely of running an electric line across it and yet see what the board must do.  The board has to serve notice of its intention on the owner and the occupier of such land.  Then, take the Electricity Supply (Amendment) Act (No. 2) of 1934.  Section 8 of that Act makes certain provisions and I feel the wording of the section is very significant because it shows you that the approach of the previous Government to the rights of the private individual was very different from the approach of the present Government.  We did believe in individual and human rights when we were in power.  At any rate, Section 8 of the Electricity Supply Act of 1934 provided that one month before interfering with any property, the board had to take steps to ensure that all proper parties likely to be affected would know what was proposed to be done.  It provided, in order to ensure <Col N="2162" /> that, that the board should give notice by advertisement, published twice in each of two or more newspapers, and that the plans and records of what it was proposed to do and all the necessary forms should be made available for inspection in a specified place. There is no proposal of that sort in this simple Bill.  In this simple Bill of the Minister's the local authority may do what it likes without advertising the fact, without publishing the fact, without giving any notice whatever to any person who may be detrimentally affected by their operations.</P>

      <P>Is it the Deputy's point that so long as the local authorities do not endanger the lives of citizens, they can do what they like with the citizen's property?</P>

      <P>That is, I know, a fundamental of the Deputy's political philosophy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take another instance.  The Deputy says that the reason that the Electricity Supply Board must give notice, when it intends to run an electric line across a man's land, is that it may endanger life.  If the Deputy when he leaves the House will go down to the Library and take down a copy of the Electricity Supply Act of 1927 and turn to Section 98, he will see a provision which has nothing to do with electric lines, which has nothing to do with dangerous equipment which the Electricity Supply Board may have under <Col N="2163" /> its control or may wish to erect.  He will find a provision dealing with the simple procedure of cutting any tree, shrub or hedge.  It provides that before lopping or cutting any such tree, the board shall give seven days' notice to the occupier of the land on which it grows.  That was an onerous obligation, some people might think, to place on the Electricity Supply Board, who have their headquarters here in Dublin and who may have to carry out these activities in remote parts of the country, but the local authorities&mdash;the urban councils, the county councils and the corporations of the county boroughs&mdash;are not so remote from the people who are going to be affected by their operations and if the House considered it reasonable in 1927 to impose on the Electricity Supply Board the obligation of giving notice to the occupiers of land and to persons whose shrubs or trees they proposed to lop or cut, do you not think that, if this Minister had any regard for the rights of individuals, he would have put some such provision also into this Bill?  The notice could be given by advertisement in the local Press or it could be sent, as we are compelling the Electricity Supply Board to send it, by registered post.  It would be a simple matter and it would protect the rights of private individuals.  Yet it has not been done by the Minister in this allegedly simple Bill.</P>
    <P>Then, again, in the Turf Development Act of 1946 we see in Section 31 that not later than one month before the board interferes with any property or right, the board must deposit documents sufficient to show every interference proposed to be made and must give public notice by advertisement published twice in each of two or more daily newspapers and in such other newspapers as shall be prescribed as to where these forms may be inspected by any person who considers that he is likely to be affected.  Why should we impose these obligations upon bodies like the Electricity Supply Board, the Turf Development Board, Mianraí Teo. and other bodies of this sort, which are under the ultimate jurisdiction and supervision of this House?  They can, if we think it necessary, <Col N="2164" /> be brought to account here by putting down a motion asking the Minister, for stated reasons, to justify their actions in certain regards.  Why should we impose that obligation on them in relation to works which are admittedly and undeniably of great public importance and public interest, which will increase the productive capacity of the State; while we allow the local authorities to do anything they like and carry out any sort of works they like, which may not be ultimately in the public interest at all, without compelling them, in the interests of the private citizen, to accept and fulfil the same kind of obligation as we impose on the bodies I have mentioned?  Is there any justification for the failure of the Minister to write those very proper and very necessary safeguards into this Bill?</P>
    <P>We are told that these works are of minor importance, we are told that the Bill is urgent, because those works are going to increase the productive capacity of the land and give employment. It is asserted that they are going to increase the productive capacity of the land and will give productive employment and because of that we are inserting here in this Bill the thin end of a very big totalitarian wedge.  If this thing can be done in relation to these matters by the local authorities, without their being compelled to give the notice which we insist on from these larger corporations in relation to schemes admittedly of public importance, some other person will come along and say: &ldquo;Why do you insist on the Electricity Supply Board giving this notice, why do you insist on the Turf Board giving this notice, when you allow local authorities to do other things, much more questionable and much more doubtful, without giving notice?&rdquo;  Then we will be faced with the situation that the almighty State and the corporate bodies established under it will be able to do what they like with any man's property, without let or hindrance and without any appeal to any impartial authority whatsoever.</P>
    <P>That is why this measure is dangerous&mdash;and it is not without its significance that it should be introduced by a Coalition Government <Col N="2165" /> which depends for its majority upon the support of a number of totalitarians sitting here in this House.</P>

      <P>Yes, Sir.  I am afraid, Sir, that I have to refer you to Section 1 of the Bill:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The expression &lsquo;permanent construction&rsquo; includes roads, bridges, <Col N="2166" /> houses, buildings, walls and embankments.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The local authority may carry out any work on these &ldquo;permanent constructions&rdquo;, including roads.  There are works which could be carried out on roads, works which are urgently needed to restore those roads to proper condition and maintain them in proper condition.  That could be done without giving the local authorities the wide, unrestricted powers which this Bill proposes to confer on them.  It could have been done, it ought to be done, and because it is not done we have created throughout the length and breadth of this country an employment problem which the Minister for Local Government states this Bill is intended to solve.</P>
    <P>Let me address myself to the question of the employment which will be given under this Bill.  How much employment will it give?  Have we had any exposition to the House by the Minister in that regard?  Has he told us about the important works that are held up because the local authorities have not got the powers which this Bill proposes to confer on them&mdash;and confer on them so dangerously in the form in which the Bill is drafted?  We have not had a single example.  He has not given us even one instance of flooding which could be cured and he has not told us the amount of employment which would be given by remedying that defect.  He has not told us the number of men which would be employed on any one particular work. You would think he would at least have examined a few samples and be in a position to justify his attitude here.  He has not produced a single instance; he has not cited a road work in such and such a place which would give employment to ten men.  Mind you, clearing the eye of a bridge is certainly not going to provide long term employment for any significant number of men.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the extent of the employment that is to be given under this measure?  The making of drains&mdash;no doubt, there is a great deal of land that could be improved by the making of drains, but it is not land which is going to be touched mainly by the provisions of this Bill.  Sub-section (3) of Section 2 says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where a local authority to whom this section applies are of opinion that&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  any land in their functional area, not being land owned by them, or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2168" /> has sustained or is likely to sustain damage from flooding, landslide, subsidence or other similar occurrence and that it is in the public interest to afford relief or protection from the damage, the local authority may execute such works as they consider reasonable for the purpose of affording such relief or protection.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have said that there is a great deal of land which could be improved by the making of drains but it is not land which can be touched by this Bill, unless this term &ldquo;public interest&rdquo; is to be so interpreted that the local rates or the Central Exchequer is to be made one vast pork barrel into which every man may dip his hands.  Most people reading this Bill would assume that what is meant here by the &ldquo;making of drains&rdquo; is the making of drains on land which adjoins a river where it may be easily drained.  I do not know whether that is the correct interpretation of the provisions of the section or not, because the Minister whose duty it was to inform the House failed to do his duty in that regard. He contented himself with repeating <i>ad nauseam</i> how very simple this measure was, but he did not tell us what type of land was going to be affected by the making of drains and he did not tell us, either, who was going to be employed by the local authority in the making of these drains, or whether these drains were to be made irrespective of what the wishes of the landowner were or whether the local authority, in virtue of its own opinion, was going to be empowered to send in all its disemployed road workers to any farmer's land to make drains in order to provide employment to get the Government out of a mess of its own creation.  He did not say one word about that, but I assume that the local authorities, as they are at present constituted, will act reasonably. I am not so certain how the local authorities might act if the Minister's Party had a majority on these bodies, because it is rather remarkable that, in relation to a great number of these affairs, the members of the Minister's Party who are on local authorities seem to wage a perpetual vendetta against the most substantial ratepayers and against landowners.  However, <Col N="2169" /> there is a problem to which the Minister might have addressed himself in presenting this Bill.</P>
    <P>Let me see what else there is&mdash;&ldquo;the removal of substances or things causing obstructions in watercourses&rdquo;.  So far as the amount of employment that it is likely to give, it can quite readily be equated with the work which will be done in clearing the eyes of bridges.  I think it will prove to be virtually negligible.  Go down the whole of this list and I am prepared to bet that, even at the end of next year, when the local authorities have made the fullest possible survey of all the work falling within one or other of these categories which they could and should reasonably do, and if they drew these up as a constructional programme and embarked on it, they would not give work to 15,000 men for one month, and that is supposed to compensate the road workers for being thrown out of employment, to compensate for the sum of over £2,000,000 in grants of which the local authorities were deprived this year.</P>
    <P>The Minister in fact has disclosed one of the reasons why this Bill is considered to be urgently necessary.  He is trying to pass on to the ratepayers responsibility for dealing with an unemployment problem which is of his own creation.  Normally, therefore, in justice, the Government should accept financial responsibility for carrying it out.  He has said that this is merely an enabling Bill, so far as the local authorities are concerned.  I have shown that it is a Bill which enables them to do anything they like, without giving notice or warning to any person likely to be detrimentally or prejudicially affected by what they do.  He says that it is an enabling Bill, and that, in order to enable the local authorities to make effective use of it, he proposes to give them grants amounting to 100 per cent. of the cost of the work.  The Minister can make that promise and still leave the Minister for Finance with a very easy mind, because we are told that local authorities must have schemes in by April 15th.  That is not a justification for describing this Bill as an urgent measure, because there is nothing to prevent the local authorities from drawing up their schedule of work <Col N="2170" /> long before the Bill becomes law, if necessary, and no justification for the House swallowing this Bill holus-bolus in the form in which it has been presented to it.  It is no justification for this House scamping the serious consideration which certain of the proposals in this Bill demand.</P>
    <P>As I have said, there is nothing to prevent the local authorities from preparing their schedule between now and April 15th, but what sort of schedule is it going to be if they have only got until April 15th to prepare it?  How many schemes will emanate from each local authority between now and April 15th?  I forget how many local authorities there are in the country.  I think there are about 900 odd.  Perhaps it is a much smaller figure.  Supposing two or three schemes come from everyone of them, from all the urban districts, from all the county councils.  Perhaps more will come from the county councils. Perhaps three schemes will come from each of about 400 urban districts, what is going to be the extent of work that will be provided by any one of those schemes?  Will there be £100 worth of work in any one of them?  If you have three schemes each from 400 urban districts, that is 1,200 schemes at £100 a scheme.  That is, £120,000 worth of employment will be provided by 400 bodies.  Assume that ten schemes come from each county council.  These schemes are not likely to be anything like as extensive or as expensive as the local authority scheme.  But, assume again that each of them costs £100, that is £26,000 to be added to the £120,000, that is £146,000.</P>
    <P>All of us who have any experience of trying to get public works in the City of Dublin know how limited the field is for that sort of enterprise.  Suppose we get 50 schemes in the City of Dublin and another, say 30 in Cork and ten in Limerick and ten in Galway, that is 100 and supposing these schemes cost £500 each, that is £50,000.  So we have got to this stage that, on schemes submitted between now and 15th April, the amount of work which will be carried out will cost something like £200,000.</P>
    <P>It is a fair calculation that in order to give one man employment for one <Col N="2171" /> year you would have to spend, even on the type of work which we are now considering, giving the Minister every benefit in the estimate, about £600.  Six hundred pounds per man per year.  I see Deputy Lehane shake his head. He is right.  Long experience in relation to these matters and the experience of the Board of Works has always been that you are not safe in calculating the cost of giving an unskilled worker employment for one year at less than between £1,000 and £1,200.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am giving the Minister the benefit of every doubt and the amount of employment, under the most favourable circumstances, that could be given under this Bill would be about 5,000 men.  For the sake of giving 5,000 men employment&mdash;I am not going to decry the desirability of doing that if it can be done&mdash;we are going to destroy the right of every private individual to have some court of appeal if he is injured or aggrieved by the action, not merely of another citizen of the State, but of a public authority. Where is that right of appeal given in this Bill?  I have shown the House quite conclusively that, apparently, the local authority may act in secret, clandestinely anyhow, and, without due notice, carry out works which, as I have said, may damage seriously the property of a private citizen and yet they are not even called upon to notify the persons likely to be affected that they propose to do that and, if they do carry out this work and people's property is damaged&mdash;and it may be very severely damaged&mdash;there is no right of appeal.</P>
      <P>The Minister did not refer in his opening speech to Section 4 of this Bill.  Would the House look at Section 4:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;A local authority or person <Col N="2172" /> executing works pursuant to this Act or an order made thereunder, or any officer, servant or agent of such authority or person, may enter on any land for the purposes of the execution of the works.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These local authorities are given quite arbitrary rights of entrance.  If we were dealing here now with a very serious public health problem, as we were dealing with it in the year 1946 and 1947, if we were dealing with the case, say, of a person who was suffering from an infectious and deadly disease and who was breaking the law by concealing that, by failing to notify the local authority of the fact that he was so suffering, and if we wished to give to the responsible officer of the local health authority the right to enter the property upon which that person was being maintained or in which he was residing, we would have to provide that the officer must be armed with a warrant before he could do it, even though the health of the whole community was being jeopardised by the action of a law-breaker. Here in this Bill, however, we have a quite arbitrary authority given to any officer, servant or agent of a public body to enter upon the lands of any man in this State.  He is not even asked to produce his credentials and, if his right to enter is challenged, we are told that the person who obstructs or interferes with the exercise of the power conferred by sub-section (1) shall be guilty of an offence under the section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding £10.</P>
    <P>Do Deputies think that the House is justified in passing a Bill containing a clause giving unqualified and unrestricted right of entry to any officer, servant or agent of a public body?  Is there any farmer in this House who thinks that it would be right and fair in the interests of his fellows that the officers of the local authority should be armed with that right of entry on his land.  It does not matter who the person may be.  He comes there in the guise of a private individual and yet, if you challenge him it may be held by some court to be obstruction.  He is not called upon to carry any credentials and you do not even receive <Col N="2173" /> notice that he is coming from the local authority&mdash;they do not publish any&mdash; and yet you are to open your gates and let this man in to do whatever he damn well likes on the land.</P>
    <P>That is what is proposed in this &ldquo;simple Bill&rdquo;.  Do you not think there should be at least some provision that the person should be duly authorised and carry some kind of authority and that the person on whose land he proposes to enter should be notified in advance as to what he proposes to do so that the farmer may expect him and be ready for him?  I think, if the Bill goes through, that the farmers will be ready for him, ready for him in another way.  Is it not astounding that this Bill should emanate from a Government which contains a Minister for Agriculture who said that a farmer would be quite justified in shooting any inspector who set foot upon his land without due authority.</P>

Apparently shopkeepers and town dwellers may show the pip-squeaks the door with impunity, but if a farmer even closes his gates against one he is fined £10 under this &ldquo;simple measure&rdquo; which the Minister for Local Government failed to expound to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us come to Section 5.  I said I would deal with this Bill and discharge the duty in which the Minister failed. Let me remind the House again that, under Section 2, a local authority may enter upon the land of any individual in this country and carry out any work &mdash;&ldquo;such&rdquo; work is the word&mdash;as they consider reasonable in the public interest to execute in order to accomplish certain things, and, among other things, it may dispose of any substance or thing that is removed from a watercourse&mdash;the section is very specific about this&mdash;no matter how noxious it may be, on land adjacent to the watercourse. The local authority may remove it or dispose of it otherwise as the local authority thinks fit.  The section <Col N="2174" /> gives local authorities rights to dispose of any substance or thing it likes on land adjacent to a watercourse from which it has been removed.  That may do very serious damage to land which is adjacent to the watercourse. Some of these other things, which it is particularly enjoined on local authorities to do under this Bill, may do very, very serious damage to land which is remote from the watercourse which is being drained or widened or from which obstructions are being removed, and yet what right of redress has the person who is affected?  What redress is afforded under this Bill?</P>

      <P>I think there will be very sound lawyers to argue that the section, as I have said, places this question of compensation within the jurisdiction of the District Court.  It provides that the maximum amount which a person whose property has been damaged by the operations of a local authority may secure by way of compensation would be what in a libel action would be described as &ldquo;contemptuous damages&rdquo;, contemptuous compensation.</P>

      <P>Perhaps we will have the opportunity of listening to men more able to argue the question than I am.  I am a layman and do not set my authority against that of Deputy Lehane, but I am fortified by the fact that many competent persons believe that the effect of that section would be to limit the amount of compensation that will be given in any case, no matter how serious the damage may be, to £10.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the Bill which the House is being asked to accept as a matter of urgency.  I have expounded it as the Minister for Local Government should have expounded it and dealt with it clause by clause as he has failed to do. I say to this House and to the country that it is an outrage upon Parliamentary procedure to have thrown this Bill at the House in the way it was and to expect a serious legislative assembly&mdash; the Legislature of the nation&mdash;to discuss it and debate it without having given the House due time to examine and consider it.  I have no doubt whatever that if I and my colleagues, the people who sit on these benches, had another week to deal with this Bill we would have shown that it was a most <Col N="2176" /> dangerous Bill.  I have already shown that it is dangerous in all its implications because it lacks the ordinary safeguards customarily enshrined in Bills of this sort where private property is in question in order to protect the rights of the private individual.  These rights are entitled to be safeguarded. Granted there is a sort of diarchy between the rights of the State and the private individual, who is the person on whose security and happiness the welfare of the State depends.  We are bound to give him justice.  We are bound at least to see that the avenues of justice are open to him but this Bill closes them against him, and sweeps away some of the most cherished rights, some of the most important characteristics of private property.  Surely it is important if I own land that no person should be entitled to walk into it arbitrarily at the dictate of any person, even of the Minister. Mind you, the Minister has very wide powers under this Bill.  I have not yet dealt with Section 3.</P>
    <P>Section 3, we were told by the innocent Minister, is a simple section. The only thing that section proposes to do is to help those unfortunate local authorities whose resources are so limited that they would not have the technical staff necessary to enable them, say, to clear the eye of a bridge. That is the sole purpose, he told us, of Section 3.  If the House will read Section 3 it will be seen that it is a very much more far reaching provision than the Minister has pretended it to be.</P>
    <P>First, there is no question about a local authority being satisfied that something is in the public interest or that certain works are necessary.  Not at all.  The local authority is dealt with in the same way as the Minister proposes to deal with officers of the Kerry County Council when he told them that if they gave an unqualified, conscientious opinion about certain proposals that was in any way in conflict with what he thought was right he would deal with them.  There is no question in Section 3 of the local authority having any rights whatever. It gives the Minister full power to <Col N="2177" /> override the local authority in the exercise of its judgment as to what is in the public interest and what is reasonable.</P>
    <P>Section 3 reads: &ldquo;Where the Minister is satisfied&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;  That is very different to what we have been told about Section 2.  That is very different to what we have been told about the rights which the Bill confers upon local authorities.  This is something which confers unfettered power upon the Minister, because where the Minister is satisfied that particular works should be executed pursuant to this Act by a local authority and the local authority are not merely unable but are unwilling to execute the works, what happens then?  When the Minister is satisfied that certain works should be done and the local authority are unwilling to execute such works, perhaps because they do not consider that it is in the public interest to execute them, or that it would be reasonable to execute them, what happens then?  The Minister, who has professed to have such regard recently for the rights of local authorities may, by order, nominate a person to execute the works and thereupon that person may execute the works.  How?  Not, mark you, in accordance with the wishes of the local authority, but in accordance with the directions of the Minister, and in relation to the execution thereof this nominee of the Minister shall be deemed to be acting on behalf of the local authority and shall have all the powers conferred on them by this Act.  There may be some safeguard for private individuals in the fact, even though no other is provided for in this Bill, that the members of the local authorities have to live among their neighbours.  They have to face public criticism at the churches of their own parish.  But here is a section which gives the Minister power to send down an emissary from Dublin, armed with quite dictatorial powers, to go in on any person's land to do anything the Minister is satisfied should be done under this Act.</P>
    <P>Mind you, there is no limitation imposed on the Minister's judgment in this matter or upon his discretion. They may do anything the Minister <Col N="2178" /> likes, enter upon the land of any person, carry out the work and then hie off home again and leave to the local authority, perhaps, the responsibility of clearing up the mess which the Minister has created.</P>
    <P>I think, moreover, the terms of this section open the way to graft and corruption. Under this Bill there is no question about the Minister's appointee being selected by the Civil Service Commission.  There is no provision that the Minister shall delegate to carry out this work only a person who is an officer of the Department or an officer of any local authority or an officer of the local authority concerned. I must say I think it would be very invidious for the Minister to appoint an officer of the local authority which was unwilling to carry out the works the Minister would demand.  I do not think even the present Minister would be so tactless as to do that.  In any event here is the position that the Minister has unfettered power not merely to do anything he likes under this Bill but to appoint any person he wishes as the person to do it.  What an avenue of sinecures and emoluments that opens up to the secretaries of labour clubs.  What a bright prospect there is for all the members of the labour clubs in the Minister's constituency. Every person who has been in the Department of Local Government as long as I was in it knows how the present Minister for Local Government built up a political organisation by making certain that his friends were appointed foremen and gangers on every road work that was carried out in County Cork.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnLymbrickEsmonde" hpid="Sir John Esmonde Sir John Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support this Bill.  In supporting it, I find myself speaking, as the last Deputy announced he spoke, in the full realisation of the obligations imposed upon a Deputy of this House to safeguard the rights of individuals.  I approach the discussion of this Second Reading on that basis.  But, in addition to that, I approach the consideration of this Bill in the belief that, if we have a local authority in this country, no matter whether it be to-day or ten years from now, and if we have a Minister for Local Government in this country, whether it be to-day or ten years from <Col N="2180" /> now, that Minister and that local authority will act reasonably and in the best interests of what they are there to act for and without any ulterior motives.  I will subscribe to that belief until the opposite is proved to me beyond all reasonable doubt.  In discussing a Bill of this character we must remember that we are turning out legislation and handing certain powers to certain of our countrymen who are going to act in the best interests of the people and we are not going to condemn them here as potential criminals for the administration of the particular functions assigned to them.</P>
      <P>I might introduce my remarks by relating an experience I had some time ago in regard to a problem that came before me.  The problem was the very bad state and condition which a certain district in the County Wexford had got into as a result of flooding.  All the parties concerned came together with a view to ascertaining how this flooding could be remedied.  I found the following situation.  They found that in order to deal with the matter there were no less than four bodies who had to be consulted or who had to be brought into co-operative action together.  First of all, there was a board of trustees, and then there were the Board of Works, the county council and the Land Commission.  There were four bodies each of whom was passing the responsibility to the other and, in the meantime, the good land was sinking under the flooding that was taking place.  I believe that this Bill will give to the local authority or, failing the local authority, to the Minister, just such rights and opportunities as are wanting in that particular case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy MacEntee has referred at great length to the infringement of the rights of the private citizen in this particular case.  At the risk of being described as some sort of a totalitarian in disguise, I say that there is nothing that I can see which infringes the rights of the private citizen more than these rights have been infringed in Bill after Bill piloted through this House.  Every single Electricity Supply Board pole on private ground to-day is a greater infringement of the rights of private individuals than the mere <Col N="2181" /> licence given in this Bill to go on to a private individual's land for the purpose of carrying out necessary work. Deputies know that under the housing code a man's property can be interfered with.  I shall give an illustration. A landlord of a tumbled down house in a country town or in any city which he does not want to let can, under the law as it stands at present, be called upon by the local authority, if the house is one which, in their opinion, is capable of being put into such a condition as to be let, to put that house into repair.  Surely that is a greater infringement of the rights of private individuals than the mere licence to go on a person's land in order to ease flooding on a road in order that public traffic may go to and fro.</P>
    <P>Do Deputies realise that under the Local Government Act of 1925, the local authority can go to the district justice and get an order to go on to the nearest land where there is a quarry or sandpit and having got that order, no matter what the owner says, can go in and take the stone or sand or whatever is necessary?  This is not an infringement of any individual private right except what is absolutely necessary for the purpose of carrying out these necessary works.</P>
    <P>In my constituency at present there are three works urgently calling for attention.  They have been waiting for attention for some time past, and the reason they cannot receive attention is that there is no way of dealing with that particular problem.  At any moment we expect the causeway known as the road to Great Island to be swept away by the floods on the adjoining river.  When that causeway is swept away, there will be swept away with it hundreds of acres of good arable land. This simple Bill will enable the local authority, with money furnished from the Central Exchequer, to save that land which is in imminent peril at present. Deputy O'Leary and Deputy Corish have been on deputation after deputation with me to the various Departments concerned with a view to doing something to alleviate the rot that is setting in in what is known as the Macamore district in County Wexford, where an artificial watercourse or <Col N="2182" /> drainage system urgently requires repairs.  That can be done under this Bill.  Then there is the Kilmallock area on the edge of the Atlantic which is gradually moving back into the Atlantic by reason of the fact that there are half a dozen different authorities concerned and, as it is not the particular problem of any one of them, it cannot be dealt with.  That can be dealt with under this simple Bill.  From my point of view, this is not so much a question of employment.  It is important that employment does enter into the matter but, from my point of view, these are urgent necessities which exist in my constituency, as I am sure they exist in every other constituency.</P>
    <P>As regards the question of the private rights of individuals being infringed, it has to be assumed that the officials, the local authorities and the Ministers will act according to their conscience.  Supposing they do not, we have got the courts, and these courts will make the official or the local authority or the Minister concerned amenable.  Fifteen years ago, at the behest of the owner of old thatched cottages in the town of Cashel, a clearance order under the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, which had been decreed by the Cashel Urban Council was set aside and nullified on the basis that the local authority had not reasonably exercised their powers. There are abundant safeguards not only in our ordinary law but under the Constitution.  Deputy MacEntee knows as well as anyone else that any Act which goes through the Oireachtas can be set aside and nullified by the courts if it is an infringement of the Constitution. Some years ago, when I was on the other side of the House and Deputy MacEntee was piloting the Trade Union Bill through the House, I implored him, not as a lawyer, but as a member of this House, to consult his legal advisers and ask them whether a particular section in the Bill was not unconstitutional.  In spite of that, the Bill went through and that particular part was declared to be unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.  The very same sanctions, the very same safeguards, exist in regard to this simple Bill.</P>

      <P>They are safeguards. Coming to the question of compensation, do the Opposition realise&mdash;because I take it that Deputy MacEntee is speaking on behalf of the Opposition when he is dealing with the question of compensation&mdash;that under Section 5 compensation is to be assessed by the District Court?</P>
      <P>Here again, I assume, that every responsible Deputy will admit that even the district justice is going to act in accordance with justice.  Compensation is to be assessed by the District Court on what basis?  According to the argument advanced against this Bill, it can only be assessed on the basis of contemptuous damages in an action for libel.  The Deputies opposite must be aware that, where a local authority has power to go in on land for the purpose of getting stones or gravel, compensation is assessed by the district justice also and his jurisdiction is not confined to contemptuous damages.</P>

      <P>I speak here in my representative capacity.  I am sent here by my constituents and I voice their views here.  There is a competent staff behind the members of the Government, and they have the Attorney-General to advise them.  I am not asked to give an opinion, but I do say, with regard to this particular section, that under the corresponding section which, I think, is Section 32 in the Local Government Act of 1925, the <Col N="2184" /> District Court has power to assess compensation for gravel and stones taken from quarries, and I would find it very hard to believe that the maximum amount ever awarded in such cases was over £25.  However, if there is any doubt as to the efficacy of a district justice to deal with a matter of this kind, there is always a right of appeal to the Circuit Court.</P>

The Deputy might consult his legal advisers.  However, for some reason or other there is opposition to this particular Bill, and I wonder why? There is opposition, I gather first of all, because of the haste with which the Bill has been introduced.  I do not propose to deal with that, but admitting that that is an argument, I take it, then, that the only real ground of objection to the Bill that now remains is that it was introduced in a hurry and that otherwise it is perfectly acceptable.</P>

      <P>I can assure the House that there are four areas at least in the constituency which I and my four colleagues represent which will be very glad indeed when this Bill becomes an Act and is implemented by the local authorities or by the Minister. Some of the sections of the Bill have been referred to in detail by Deputy MacEntee.  Play has been made with what a local authority is empowered to do, such as the making of drains, the removal of substances or things causing obstructions in watercourses, the widening or deepening of watercourses, the making or repairing of walls or embankments and the diversion of water into watercourses.  What would have been said, if it was not properly laid down in the Bill, what a local authority was empowered to do? <Col N="2185" /> If there was just a statement in the Bill that a local authority could go in and do what it liked with land, then, presumably, we would be met with the very serious charge that there was no plan laid down as to what a local authority could do, but because the local authority is, so to speak, put in a strait-jacket with regard to what it can do, and because safeguards are in the Bill to ensure that a local authority must believe that these things are necessary, we are challenged and told that there is something wrong with the Bill.</P>
      <P>With regard to Section 3, which provides:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;where the Minister is satisfied&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  that particular works should be executed pursuant to this Act by a local authority, and</P>
      <P>(b)  that the local authority are unable or unwilling to execute the works,&rdquo;</P>
      <P>one must assume that the Minister and the local authority are not going to carry out a deadly war from morning until night.  One must assume, in the modern state of our democracy, our civilisation and our national charity, that the Minister and the local authority are going to work together for the benefit of the country.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacEntee, in the opening part of his speech, treated us to a lecture to the effect that the Opposition in this House have a duty.  Of course they have.  The Opposition have a duty not merely to oppose and to criticise, but they have a duty to assist, and if the point of view of the Opposition is that, where there is flooding, as contemplated in this Bill, or where there is obstruction in watercourses or where there are any works urgently required to be done, as they are waiting to be done in County Wexford, these works should not be done, they ought to have the honesty to get up and say so, but they ought not to get up and oppose this Bill just because it is one of the first Bills introduced by the new Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely, to goodness there are enough general debates here on which we can let off steam without doing so on a Bill like this which has been introduced for <Col N="2186" /> the purpose of dealing with immediate necessary work.  It is a proper thing, a patriotic thing, and within the walls of duty laid down for every Opposition, that they should give the Government every assistance in this case.  I have not heard one single word throughout all the criticism that has come from the opposite side suggesting the slightest change or amendment in the Bill as it is before the House.  It is to be condemned, and condemned for one reason only, that it has been introduced by the very excellent Minister for Local Government behind whom I have the honour to sit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not being a legal man, or a man with a legal mind, I am prepared to accept the opinion of the experts so far as the legal aspects of this measure are concerned.  I am satisfied that the rights of private citizens are no more being infringed under this Bill than they were under any previous Bill introduced in the Dáil.  Many fears in regard to the Bill have been expressed by Deputy MacEntee.  He said the Bill was dangerous and that it was unknown what kind of trickery the local authorities would be up to.  It is rather significant that a Bill of this character should have been introduced by this Government in view of the fact that the majority of the local authorities are opposed to the present Government. It shows that this Government is not concerned to make political capital but rather to do the work, irrespective of who gets the credit for it.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill as an earnest of good things to come.  It shows a sincere desire on the part of the present Government to face up to the problem of unemployment&mdash;to problems associated with drainage and land reclamation. After all, this Bill has associations with the proposed new scheme of land reclamation.</P>
      <P>With regard to the fears expressed by Deputy MacEntee, it was quite evident that those fears were not concerned with the safety or welfare of the farmers but rather with the safety and future of the Fianna Fáil Party. There is no doubt whatever about it that this Bill is going to be another nail in their coffin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2187" /> Much play was made here by Deputy MacEntee about the reduction in the grants for the main roads and that, as a result, there would be a lot of unemployment. The Minister for Local Government gave an assurance here some time ago that such would not be the case and he asked the local authorities to keep spending money on the main roads until such time as alternative employment was available for the men who were working on them. In spite of that, valuable time was wasted in the House by Fianna Fáil in their efforts to make political propaganda out of the reduction in the grants for the main roads.  Now, when an attempt is being made by the Government to put men into productive employment and not to have them working on main roads&mdash;because nobody for a moment in his senses would suggest that work on the main roads is work of a productive nature&mdash;such tactics as Fianna Fáil has adopted are ill-advised.  Actually, 75 to 80 per cent. of the money expended on main roads goes into material.  The labour content is not as big as we are led to believe.</P>
    <P>I listened to Deputy Childers and to Deputies from my own constituency worrying about the skin on the main roads.  All I have to say is that if the skin on the main roads is half as thick as that on the Fianna Fáil Party, then they need not be done for the next 50 years.  I wonder do the rural Deputies on the Fianna Fáil Benches subscribe to the views expressed by Deputy MacEntee?  Will Deputy O'Rourke or Deputy Killilea or Deputy Beegan or Deputy Lahiffe or any other Deputies on the Party opposite go down the country and criticise the powers that are now being given to the local authorities to tackle problems that have been a worry for years to those local authorities?</P>
    <P>The section of this Bill dealing with the right to go in on a man's property is surely necessary if any good is to be done at all.  How is any drainage work to be carried out if the local authorities, or the people who are going to do it, have not the power to go in on a man's land?  Take, for example, a rural improvement scheme, where 25 <Col N="2188" /> per cent. is put up by the people who want the scheme carried out.  If one individual associated with that scheme objects, then the work cannot be done. In other words, what would be a useful scheme benefiting nine out of ten people has to be thrown away, just because one crank objects to it.</P>
    <P>I welcome that section of the Bill. There is too much of this bad neighbour business, of jealousy and things like that.  There have been many instances where an old maid living at the end of a road has held up the repair of that road or prevented the making of a drain, all out of pure spite to her next-door neighbour.  Under this section that type of crank will get short shrift.</P>
    <P>There is one matter I should like the Minister to give me more information upon.  It is in connection with a certain type of drainage.  I would like to know whether it can be done under this Bill.  Like Deputy Esmonde's constituency, there are a number of drainage problems in my constituency which could not be tackled up to the present. I will give the Minister one example. In the Elphin area there is a drainage district and this district was reconstructed by the Board of Works under the 1924 or 1925 Act and it was then handed over to the county council for maintenance.  Each year the county council spends approximately £600 in maintenance in that drainage district. Several of the streams that comprise that district were not sunk deep enough, with the result that there is constant flooding around May and June, and this holds up the turf season because there is flooding of the bog area.</P>
    <P>Every year Roscommon county councillors are pressing to have these streams deepened or to have obstructions in them removed but, due to the fact that this would be regarded as improvement work and not maintenance, no money can be expended by the county council.  In addition to that, the charge is a county at large charge and naturally enough people in other areas do not feel like subscribing to maintenance or improvement work in the Elphin district.  The county councillors have tried year after year to get this work done and I should like <Col N="2189" /> to know if, under this Bill, it will be possible to carry out this improvement work in the Elphin drainage district?</P>

      <P>I am very glad to hear that.  If it is the case that such a problem as that can be dealt with, then I think this Bill is even better than any of us had hoped and the criticism levelled here to-night was totally unjustified.  I do not know whether it was in a spirit of spite that Deputy MacEntee got on his feet, but he certainly did not convey to the House the opinions of rural Deputies. I am certain that if the Whip were taken off the rural Deputies on the opposite benches, and if they were allowed to speak their minds, they would run Deputy MacEntee out of the House for his contribution to this debate.</P>

      <P>Firstly, I should say that I propose to deal with what is in this Bill and not what is in the mind of the Minister.  The Minister may have good intentions, and some of the intentions as expressed by him in the explanatory memorandum which was circulated with this Bill may be quite sound, but the Minister's intentions and the principles he has enshrined in this Bill are entirely different matters, and I propose to point that out to the House.</P>
      <P>I think it will be admitted, particularly by Deputy Esmonde and Deputy Cowan, that our drainage code represents one of the most difficult and complex types of law on the Irish statute book.  I must register my protest against the rushing of this Bill.  It was circulated to Deputies, particularly country Deputies whom it affects most, and they were given only two or three days to consider its implications.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure Deputy Cowan that no speaker on this side has expressed his intention of voting against the principles of this Bill. There are certain matters in connection <Col N="2190" /> with the infringement of rights that I propose to point out and that we will vote against.  We will endeavour to protect the individual by amendments which will be submitted later.  It is one thing to say that a local authority should get certain powers in the direction of relieving flooding at bridges where they have not already got those powers.  It is quite a feasible proposition to suggest that local authorities should have the right, in connection, for instance, with flooding on roads, to take the necessary action to relieve that flooding. But, apart from that altogether, there is the natural right of the ordinary individual, whose adjoining lands are flooded by water thrown on to them, to proper compensation.  The local authority, as we all know, is the strong body in this case.  It is very difficult &mdash;indeed impossible&mdash;for a poor farmer of £2, £5 or £10 valuation to come into the courts and fight for his rights if the local authority waves the big stick and exercises all the rights that we may give them if this Bill passes into law in its present form.</P>

      <P>Why?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Because, for Deputy Cowan's information, it is impossible for the small farmer of £10 valuation in the West of Ireland to come up to Dublin and pay for the fancy legislation on his constitutional rights before the High Court and to pay men like myself and Captain Cowan and the long list of senior counsel who would be required on such an issue.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may often have done it for nothing.  Many members of the Deputy's profession have tried to help people who did not have funds to pay them.  But I am sure the Deputy will not suggest that in a constitutional action of this kind on behalf of some unfortunate man down the country that the counsel whom he might instruct would have such an interest in the unfortunate farmer as to give their time and services free for four or five days when they could be <Col N="2191" /> more profitably employed earning their normal professional living.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe that any Deputy sitting behind Captain Cowan would accept that proposition.  The Deputy knows quite well that is not so. To suggest to us that it is sufficient protection for some small farmer whose rights may be infringed by the actions of a local authority under this Bill that the generosity of the members of the Irish Bar will come to his aid and fight his case is simply not facing up to the situation, and the Deputy well knows that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says the local authorities should have these powers.  I am quite prepared to give the local authorities these powers but, if I give them these powers, I want to ensure that there will be adequate protection for the ordinary small farmer whose rights may be infringed under this Bill.  The Minister seems to be a very simple man.  He has asked us to accept him as such.  In his opening statement here to-night he did not refer to one solitary thing in the Bill.  He referred to his own intentions.  But what is in the Minister's mind and what is in the Bill are two different matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister gave this House an undertaking that the cost of the work proposed to be done under this Bill would be borne by the Central Fund. There is not a word about that in the Bill.  I accept it that it is the Minister's intention that that should be <Col N="2192" /> so for this year.  I want the rural Deputies, however, and particularly those of them who are members of local authorities, to remember that it is usual, when the Central Fund is going to bear for all time the cost of certain works, such as those envisaged in this Bill, to put in a section providing for that and thereby making sure that it will be for all time and not just for the period during which the Minister may happen to be in office.  The possibility is that at some future date the local authority might be told that the Central Fund will provide only so much of the money and that they will have to make up the rest.  The Minister will have to give some assurance that the local authorities will not be saddled with further expenditure under this Bill.  All that need be done is to insert a simple section on the Committee Stage providing that all expenditure under this Bill will be met out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas. One thing that makes one suspicious of this Bill is the fact that no money has been provided in the Estimate for works to be carried out under this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Money cannot be provided in the Estimates until the Bill is passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister suggests that the Opposition is approaching this Bill with suspicion.  There is every reason why we should approach the Bill with suspicion.  One of the reasons given by the Minister for rushing this Bill through the House is that it would alleviate unemployment in this country.  That is the reason given by the Minister who undertook to absorb all those unemployed owing to the stoppage of the turf scheme and on work on the roads.  That is the Minister who slashed the grants for the maintenance of roads.  Why should we not approach the Bill, therefore, with suspicion, when the Minister who introduces it has let us down before? Because he has slashed the grants for the making and maintenance of roads by the local authorities and thereby created unemployment, he now puts forward his reason for introducing this Bill as being one for the purpose of absorbing these unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2193" /> In connection with the Bill itself, I think it is a very badly drafted Bill for the purpose for which it is required. I think it is one of the worst drafted Bills that has ever been presented.  I propose now to deal with Section 5 because Section 5 is of vital importance to every other section in the Bill. Under Section 5 the Minister purports to provide machinery for giving compensation to those whose rights are infringed or to whom any damage is done as a result of works undertaken under this Bill.  A very significant thing about Section 5, sub-section (1) is that it is the local authority concerned who are liable to pay compensation.  The Minister, in his opening statement, did not elucidate as to who is going to pay for the fun when it starts.  I am satisfied that if this Bill is allowed to go through in its present form without any provision being made for any fishery rights that may be interfered with, without any provision for any interference with the lands round about these streams belonging to people who have rights which are guaranteed under the Constitution of this State, it will be the finest harvest for the gentlemen of the legal profession that ever was abroad in this country.  It is all very fine for Deputy Sir John Esmonde to say that there are safeguards for them. We shall have fleets of actions as a result of the damage that is likely to be done and the rights that are likely to be interfered with under works that may be executed under this particular measure.  The rights of the ordinary private individual, the ordinary small farmer with a £10 valuation, seem to be sneered at here.</P>
    <P>It seems to be the mentality of some members of the Government that a local authority should be entitled to come along and steamroll right across the small man or that the Minister for Local Government under Section 3 of this Bill is entitled to send one of his minions down to the West of Ireland or the South of Ireland to walk in on top of any small farmer and carry out any work which the Minister is of the opinion should be carried out under this Bill notwithstanding the fact that the local authority representing that small farmer has decided that such <Col N="2194" /> work should not be carried out.  For the benefit of the people on the Government Benches who sneer at the rights of the small man down in the country it is well that we should throw our minds back to the Constitution which, I believe, is now accepted by everybody both inside and outside this House.  I hope so, at all events.  Under Article 40 of the Constitution it is provided that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;All citizens shall, as human persons, be held equal before the law.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is also provided under Article 40, Section 3, that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The State guarantees in its laws, to respect, and as far as practicable, by its laws, to defend and vindicate the personal rights of the citizen.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The next sub-section provides that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The State shall, in particular, by its laws, protect as best it may from unjust attack and, in the case of injustice done, vindicate the life, person, good name, and property rights of every citizen.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Are we hereby rushing through this hasty measure to cut across all the rights and many of these personal rights in property that we have enframed in our Constitution to protect the small man against any infringement by anybody?</P>
    <P>Under Section 5 of the Bill it is provided that the local authority concerned shall pay the compensation. The Minister did not see fit when he was presenting this Bill to the House to tell us who was to provide the cost, in the first place incurred by the local authority for the necessary engineers and staffs that would be required to carry out these works.  He certainly provides under sub-section (1) of Section 5 that the local authority shall be the body responsible for the compensation in respect of the infringement of any of the rights of any citizens who shall be affected by works under this Bill.  Sub-section (2) says that:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Compensation ... shall ... be determined by the District Court on the application of the claimant.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I should like to point out to the House <Col N="2195" /> that this sub-section (2) states the &ldquo;District Court&rdquo;.  I challenge the Minister or any member sitting on the Government Benches to show any instance in legislation that has gone before this Bill where a District Court has been given jurisdiction to deal with any claim over £25 in contract or £10 in tort.  I want to point out to the House that this section does not contemplate the appointment of a district justice as an arbitrator.  This section simply refers to the District Court and the District Court's jurisdiction is defined under the Courts of Justice Act.  The District Court's jurisdiction is confined to £25 in contract and £10 in tort.  As I see it, practically all the claims for damages under this Bill would be questions of tort, let the damage be five acres of village flooded, two acres of hay trampled down or the mud and silt of a river thrown across it, the farmer deprived of the right to water his cattle by the stream being diverted, a claim for £10,000 compensation for some vested fishery right in a particular stream being diverted, the claim of a mill owner whose mill is built on the banks of one of these streams, the watercourse being diverted or the water power being reduced so that his mill is adversely affected.  The claim of that case might possibly run into thousands of pounds.  I submit and suggest to the House that the total compensation that is open to any of these people is the sum of £10 tort under the District Court's jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>I ask any Deputy on the Government Benches to point out any instance where a district justice has exercised jurisdiction to the extent of assessing damages in any case over £10.  I will ask any Deputy of the Government to point out any precedent where a district justice exercised jurisdiction that is normally exercised by the Circuit Court or the High Court.  This may be a matter that can be put right, if it is the Minister's intention to put it right on the Committee Stage.  Incidentally, on the question of the drafting of this Bill we are told under sub-section (2) that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Compensation ... shall ... be <Col N="2196" /> determined by the District Court on the application of the claimant.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This sub-section of the Bill does not provide for any form of notice.  Does this sub-section mean, as it stands, that the individual affected&mdash;poor Pat Brown from down in the bog&mdash;can walk in before the district justice without notice to anybody and say: &ldquo;My rights have been infringed&rdquo;?  Does the sub-section mean that the district justice is entitled to say to Pat Brown: &ldquo;Very good.  From what you tell me I find that you have suffered damage by flooding from up the river as a result of this drainage scheme to the extent of £500&rdquo;?  There is no form of notice provided under this section even to protect the local authorities.  There is no form of application set out under this section for the claimant to come before the District Court.  No rule is laid down under this section to guide the District Court or the district justice as to what way they should assess compensation in these cases.  No rule is laid down, no indication is given to this court who never, I submit to this House, exercised jurisdiction of this kind before, as to what basis it should proceed on.  In previous enactments various methods were laid down as to how a court should assess compensation. In this Bill there is no indication given to the court, to the claimant or to the local authority as to what basis the court shall proceed on.</P>

The Minister for External Affairs had been returned to the Dáil sometime about October and if he were concerned with a clean administration of justice, and not with making charges of corruption, he would have raised the matter &mdash;he had ample time to raise the matter before the Dáil dissolved&mdash;had he wished to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>You cannot suggest, Sir, that I am wasting it.  Five months later, on the 24th June last, I tried to raise this matter on the Estimate for the Minister for Justice and I was told it was still <i>sub judice.</i>  That is, from September 27th to the 24th June, the case had not been finished.  That was a period of nine months and if there was undue delay, this Government took at least as much time after the election as we took before to deal with the case.  The Minister said to-day, in reply to supplementaries&mdash;I took a note of it&mdash;: &ldquo;On re-examination, I must admit that there was undue delay,&rdquo; but he admitted that, on the day the charge was made, I gave the letter to the Chief Superintendent of the Detective Division on that very day and therefore he could not charge me with delay.</P>
      <P>I should like to know if he is charging the Guards with delay in investigating this matter and, if he is, what action he proposes to take or has taken of a disciplinary kind to deal with it. He also said that I was wrong in giving this letter to the Chief Superintendent of the Detective Division, that I should have given it to the Commissioner.  Of course, if the chief superintendent had not been on the premises at the time that is what I would have done, but, as it happened, I saved time by giving him the letter there and then, because it was eventually to him as head of the section that it would have come back to complete the investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the statement about there being no file in the Department of Justice dealing with the matter, my recollection is that there was no such file in the office of the Minister and I did not think there was one in the Department itself.  The Minister tells me <Col N="2199" /> there was one in his Department.  Of course, I accept that, but I was not aware of it.  I am still of the opinion that there was not one in the Minister's office, because I handed the letter to the chief superintendent.  I knew there was a police file being built up then, but I have no recollection of ever having seen that file.  If there was one there I must repeat what I said to-day, that I have been caught out by my memory, but my memory, I think, is fairly good and I have no recollection whatever of it.  I know it is the practice in criminal cases, after the cases are dealt with in the courts, that finally the files reached the Department of Justice, but that very often takes months and months, until the case is dealt with.  I knew, of course, there was a police file, but I did not know there was a file in the Department.  As I say, if there was one in my office, I did not know about it and I am surprised to hear it.</P>
    <P>To come to the other question as to the statement by the chief superintendent, the question put by Deputy Lehane suggests that I stated that he said that there was no evidence against persons.  I made it clear when I raised this matter on the 22nd March that he only said there was no evidence against one particular person.  If I was reported in the Press, as I was, as having said that the chief superintendent told me that there was no evidence against persons, that is not correct.  I was reported in the Press as saying that in this House but I did not say any such thing.  I should like to quote in that connection from the debates of the 22nd March, column 1442.  The Minister then stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Indeed Deputy Boland surprised me when he said that this efficient police officer assured him in less than five days after the letter was written that there was not a scintilla of evidence.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The report goes on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Boland: Against one man.</P>
    <P>General MacEoin: There is more than one.</P>
    <P>Mr. Boland: I was referring only to the Senator.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2200" /> I knew there was likely to be a case against several people who were involved in this.  I was reported in the Press as having said that there was no evidence against persons but that was wrongly reported and my statement, as reported in the Official Debates, is the correct statement.</P>
    <P>The Minister admitted to-day&mdash;a thing I was glad to hear and I thank Deputy Lehane for raising the matter in order to have it made clear&mdash;that no file had been interfered with in the Department of Justice, but the impression created by his statement last week was that it was in the Department of Justice that the file had been interfered with.</P>
    <P>He might not have intended that, but certainly that was the impression left on my mind and my colleagues' minds; and when I spoke to a Press man he said that was definitely his impression&mdash;that I had ordered some people to burn files.  If nothing else has been done, I say again that it is due to Deputy Lehane, whether he meant it or not, that that point has been cleared up.  If I may quote once again, from column 1443, covering the same debate:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;General MacEoin: ... This officer did his best and he informed me.  I will say in regard to my predecessor, that the biggest difficulty that he had in securing evidence was that the documents were not forthcoming, the documents had been destroyed.</P>
    <P>Mr. Boland: Where?</P>
    <P>General MacEoin: In Government offices.</P>
    <P>Mr. Boland: In Government offices?</P>
    <P>General MacEoin: They were not forthcoming and were not available.</P>
    <P>Mr. Boland: I do not believe it.</P>
    <P>General MacEoin: I told you this morning and I will give you the information privately.  I will show you the file if you like.</P>
    <P>Mr. Boland: I should like to see it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is what gave that impression, and it disturbed me and ex-members <Col N="2201" /> of the Government and members of this Party, that I had given some such instruction.  I am glad that that point has been cleared up, that the Minister admits there was no interference with files in the Department of Justice.</P>
    <P>To-day he also said, when asked another question about the Departments in which files were interfered with, that an official in the Department of Industry and Commerce, about a week after some committee was set up from different Departments&mdash;from the Board of Works, the Department of Industry and Commerce and, I think, the Department of Justice&mdash;an official was suspended and subsequently prosecuted for interfering with a file.</P>

      <P>My reply is that on the 11th November the Department of <Col N="2202" /> Industry and Commerce appointed an officer for the same purpose.  This officer, however, within a week of the appointment, himself fell under suspicion of offences relating to petrol rationing and was suspended from duty and later was prosecuted, tried and convicted for offences.  That is the reply to Deputy MacEntee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a bad thing for this country, for any Government and for any people, to have charges of that kind thrown around without some way of substantiating them.  I was hopeful that the very fullest investigation would be given to all these charges when we went out of office.  That was one of the things which made me glad we were out, that the public would know whether there was any foundations for them or not.  That ought to be done, if it can be done, now in specific cases.  Surely to goodness, for all our sakes, for the sake of the country, it should be done.  We can fight here and throw insults in the heat of the moment, but in calmer moments surely we ought to want to keep the honour of the country up and not keep constantly charging the Government, as we were charged, with corruption, until we were sick of it and some of us were glad to be relieved of office in order that these things could be investigated? Surely we can find now a calm way of having these things investigated and having a stop put to them unless a specific charge can be made?  If there is a specific charge made, let it be dealt with; but general charges of corruption thrown at a Government, now that the former Opposition is the Government, are very, very damaging, not only to the Government but to the whole country.  I am going to sit down now, having appealed to the Government to have something done to settle the whole question and not have us blackguarding one another <Col N="2203" /> and hurling false charges at one another for which there is no foundation.</P>

      <P>The reason that moved me to put down the four questions that stand on the Order Paper in my name to-day was that I felt there was a matter of grave public importance involved, arising in this manner that allegations had been made of irregularities in connection with the carrying out of contracts placed by Government Departments.  Secondly, allegations had been made&mdash;this is the less serious charge, I presume&mdash;of illegalities and improprieties, on the part of a Senator, a member of the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;let me refer to him as Senator X&mdash;and the chairman of a Government-sponsored public board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that, Sir.  The persons concerned were a Senator, a member of the Fianna Fáil Party and, secondly, a person who was <Col N="2204" /> a close associate of the Senator and closely associated with Government circles.  Involved in charges and allegations concerning irregularities in respect of Government Department contracts were firms with which one of these gentlemen, if not both, were closely associated in business.  In these circumstances, and in view of the confusion that arose as a result of the questions and, to my mind&mdash;I say this with all due regard to the Minister for Justice&mdash;in view of the unsatisfactory and incomplete answers given by him on the last occasion when this matter was raised by Deputy Boland, I put these four questions down.</P>
      <P>I would suggest that one thing does arise from all this matter, one thing has come plainly from it, that Senator X was not approached for a statement in connection with these offences until two days after the polling had taken place in the general election.</P>

The office of the Minister is the office in which he works himself and his Department, but this file was opened in the Minister's private office, if that makes any difference.  It was opened, in the first instance, by a letter dated 27th September from the Taoiseach's office and signed by M. Moynihan.  The second document in this file, addressed by the chief superintendent to the private secretary to the Minister for Justice, is dated 2nd October, and Deputy Boland was, therefore, quite right when he said that he had had a conversation with the chief superintendent five days after he handed the letter to him.</P>

There were no documents missing from the Department of Justice.  Even the one the Deputy says was given to the superintendent is not missing, but they were missing from the Department of Industry and Commerce, from the Office of Public Works and from the Department of Defence.</P>
      <P>When Deputy Boland asked me last June what was the position of the case I said that the matter was still <i>sub judice.</i>  The reason for that was that, in May, the cases were tried in the District Court and convictions secured against three firms.  They were then appealed against by two of these firms and the appeals were pending in June. My hands were still tied, but the proceedings were initiated very early after the change of Government.  I want to conclude on this point: The ex-Minister for Justice said in Kildare that I approached the Attorney-General but the Deputy knows thoroughly well that the procedure is that the Civic Guards report direct to the Chief State Solicitor's Office.  I did not interfere with the Attorney-General and it would be an impertinence on my part to do so. There was no interference whatever with the Attorney-General, but the file I have here shows in the police report that the whole matter was referred to the Attorney-General's office after the change of Government.</P>
