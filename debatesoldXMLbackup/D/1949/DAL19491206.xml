    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether, in view of published statements to the effect that neither the present Government nor any of its predecessors believe in the revival of the Irish language and that Ministers who are public advocates for the language say privately that its revival is impossible, he proposes, on behalf of the Government, to take any steps to repudiate the imputations of bad faith implicit in the statements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have consulted the person who, according to the published report to which the Deputy evidently refers, is alleged to have made the statements mentioned in the question, and I have been assured by him that the report is a garbled version of what he said and that he entirely repudiates it.  I feel, therefore, that it is scarcely incumbent on me to make any statement arising out of the report; but, nevertheless, I welcome the opportunity afforded to me by the Deputy's question of saying that the Government consider the revival of the Irish language to be a primary and fundamental aim of national policy.  We have not deviated from the pursuance of that aim since we assumed office, and we have no intention of deviating from it in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>

      <P>I do not know that there is any foundation for the allegation made by the Deputy, but I think I should say that I ought not to be asked to answer in this House for what is done or said outside the House. Government policy can be questioned in the House, but I have no responsibility for matters not directly related to Government policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Cosgrave) (for the Minister for Agriculture)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture recently informed a deputation of milk producers from Cork that if they were unable to avail themselves of the opportunity which he had afforded them of setting up on co-operative lines a depôt for the pasteurisation of all milk sold for human consumption in the Cork sale district, he proposed to ask the Dairy Disposal Company, Limited, to do so.  The Minister asked the producers to let him have their decision not later than the 31st December and, pending that decision, he has made no arrangements with the Dairy Disposal Company.  As to why it is proposed to require compulsory pasteurisation of milk in Cork, investigation of complaints received by the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Health in regard to the quality of much of the milk sold in Cork indicates that compulsory pasteurisation is the most practical means of safeguarding the consumers.  I can assure the Deputy that there would be no experimentation in this matter and there is no ground for the suggestion that the means indicated would involve any uncertainty about effecting the very desirable purpose in view, namely, the securing of a satisfactory milk supply for the citizens of Cork.</P>

Up to 1946-47 the Ministry of Food contracted before each canning season to take from this country 10,000 tons of canned stewed steak.  Before the 1947-48 season the Ministry intimated that they would take not more than 5,000 tons.  The quantity was brought back to 10,000 tons last year.

      <P>I should point out to the Deputy that I have no duty or responsibility in the matter of providing roads, except to the extent to which a proposed work may form a suitable subject for an unemployment relief scheme, or in cases where the landholders concerned are prepared to pay a contribution for an approved work under the rural improvements scheme. Subject to that, the following is the information asked for by the Deputy, so far as I am in a position to give it. An inspector of the Special Employment Schemes Office visited the site of the road in question in June last, but I am not prepared to give full details of his report, as reports of this kind have always been regarded as confidential.  The first proposal made in connection with the scheme was that a tourist road should be constructed, which, incidentally, would serve several landholders' houses, but as the estimated cost would be of the <Col N="1877" /> order of £50,000, it was clearly outside the scope of the minor schemes carried out by my office.  A number of other proposals have been made having as their object the making of a new road to reach the houses of landholders in the townlands of Cloughvoola and Inichfarranagloragh Glebe. The minimum estimated cost of a work of this kind is about £1,000, and as the unemployment position in the area would not warrant a full-cost grant of anything like this sum, I am not prepared to carry out the work as an unemployment relief scheme.  If, however, the landholders are prepared to contribute one-fourth of the estimated cost, and if they will so inform my office, I shall have the case further considered.</P>

This subject was discussed at the trade talks which led to the Anglo/Irish Trade Agreement of 1948 and has been the subject of repeated representations to the British authorities since then. These representations have not so far been successful but in the case of certain commodities the price differential has, as a result of changes in world market conditions, disappeared.

      <P>Apropos of the Minister's reply, may I point out that this service has recently been substituted for an earlier service?  The bus which leaves Limerick very early and returns very late at night is most unaccommodating, particularly to the rural community. I can give convincing evidence that, owing to the late hour at which the bus returns from Tralee on occasions, there are no passengers at all.  I have witnessd that myself.  The service for which this service was substituted left Limerick at a reasonable time, at 10 a.m., and returned at 6 in the evening and this was most accommodating to the rural community. I would ask the Minister if he can regard this service as being accommodating to the people in general, or an economic proposition, because I have seen that bus with no passengers.</P>

      <P>The matters referred to at (a) and (b) in the question are not matters for which I have responsibility.</P>
      <P>In regard to (c), the mode of admission of patients to the private part of the hospital, consisting of 21 beds, is outside the scope of my responsibility. Admission to the remaining portion of the hospital, consisting of 158 beds, shortly to be increased to 198 beds by the opening of the second of the two new 40-bed units, is from a waiting list consisting of names furnished to the hospital authorities by local authorities.</P>
      <P>The information at (d) is being prepared and I hope to be in a position to furnish it to the Deputy, if he will be good enough to repeat the question in a week's time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to (a) and (b) in the question, I feel I should point out that this institution is only one of a large number of voluntary hospitals, religious and lay, operating with the assistance of capital and/or annual grants from the Hospitals Trust Fund and I do not consider that it is in the public interest that the particulars requested under these heads should be the subject of <Col N="1898" /> inquiry by Parliamentary Question in regard to any of these voluntary hospitals in the absence of an indication of an adequate reason for seeking the information.  The particular hospital now in question publishes the information requested at (a) in its annual reports, issued to subscribers, and I am sure the authorities of that hospital would be glad to forward copies to any interested inquirer.  The Deputy is aware, however, that the number of persons who are prepared to devote their time and energies to charitable works from motives of pure altruism is small and is likely to decrease rather than to increase if their names are given the limelight of publicity in this House.</P>
    <P>With further reference to (b), I feel sure that, even if the matter of staffing were my responsibility, the Deputy would not, on reconsideration, expect me, without specific cause assigned, to burden the records of the House with a full list of the names of the medical, nursing, clinical and domestic staff, 133 approximately in number.  Lest the Deputy should feel, however, that I am attempting to conceal any relevant information, I may say that my position as a member of the medical staff of the hospital is still as set out in the reply to the question addressed to the Taoiseach by Deputy Beegan on 28th July, 1948, namely, that the authorities of the hospital have granted me leave without pay, the duration of which has now been extended to the 31st March, 1950.</P>

      <P>The Standing Orders provide that Deputies must give at least three days' notice of a Parliamentary Question.  In regard to certain types of questions handed in over the week-end, experience has shown that the notice is inadequate to enable Departments to collect from out-lying branches detailed information required by the Minister for his reply.  For example, to a question handed in at or before 4 p.m. on a Friday the Deputy is entitled to an answer on the following Tuesday. Saturday and Sunday intervene and Saturday is a short day.  Consequently the time is too short to enable Departments to prepare the data.  This motion proposes to amend the relevant Standing Order by deleting certain words and substituting others.  The effect would be to disregard Saturday as one of the three days of notice required. If the motion is accepted, it will mean that questions for answer on Tuesday must be handed into the Dáil office not later than 4 p.m. on Thursday.

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to talk very much longer on the Financial Resolution for the Transport Bill.  It is a pity that questions of public transport for the last five or six years should be discussed in an atmosphere of rather heated controversy. Even this Financial Resolution created <Col N="1903" /> the same type of atmosphere in the House last week.  The reason for that probably has its origin in recent legislation dealing with public transport. It is quite clear that no matter what the Minister may desire to do in the present Transport Bill, no matter what effort he may make, Deputies opposite are determined to oppose him and the Bill.  For that reason they are opposing, as Deputy Lemass indicated last week, the Financial Resolution.  It is a pity that that should be so.</P>
      <P>Deputies will recollect that when the Bill was introduced, Deputy Lemass, leading the Opposition on that occasion, expressed his opposition to the Bill as it then stood.  Subsequently, the Minister introduced certain amendments. It was immediately claimed by Deputies opposite, orally and through the columns of their Party paper, that many of these amendments were introduced by the Minister under Fianna Fáil pressure.  Nevertheless, last week, when dealing with this Money Resolution, Deputy Lemass again went on record as saying that he would oppose the Bill and the Resolution and that he would have preferred if the Bill had been left unaltered by the Minister, despite the fact that, some days earlier, they were claiming that the alterations were brought in by reason of Fianna Fáil pressure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main difficulty I see in these discussions, and one of the things which makes it very difficult for any Deputy on this side to discuss any measure dealing with public transport, is the fact that certain Deputies in opposition, and particularly Deputy Lemass, seem to take it as a kind of personal affront to themselves if any criticism is made of Córas Iompair Éireann or of the work done by the ex-chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann, or if any critical word is uttered in connection with the 1944 Transport Act.  Even though that is the attitude adopted by these Deputies, they cannot close their eyes to the fact that Córas Iompair Éireann, while operating under the 1944 Transport Act, had got into a very serious condition, and <Col N="1904" /> if the present Minister were to have let matters ride and were to have decided that he would not interfere and would not take any further steps in the matter, the situation in which Córas Iompair Éireann would find itself, and in which it did, in fact, find itself, would have very serious repercussions on the travelling public, and, in a very particular way, on the employees of Córas Iompair Éireann, many of whom were threatened with practically instant dismissal under the schemes put up to the Minister by those in charge of the undertaking.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I want to get at is that were it not for the fact that this Bill has been introduced and were it not for the fact that the financial provisions embodied in it are going, we hope, to come into operation, this concern would find itself in a very precarious financial position. However, I do not want to elaborate on that further than to say that it seems to me to be perfectly obvious, whether, strictly speaking, it is in order to say so at this stage or not, that if Deputy Lemass and his colleagues succeeded in their opposition to this Resolution, they would have to bear the additional responsibility for any state of further chaos which would be arrived at in the affairs of Córas Iompair Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter which Deputy Lemass dealt with at very great length last week was the Córas Iompair Éireann pensions scheme.  He dealt with it in a manner calculated to prove to the <Col N="1905" /> House that the Minister's earlier references to the scheme and the money required to finance it were false, misleading and dishonest, and he invited Deputies on this side to inspect the Order which he signed in September, 1945, challenging them that, if they inspected that Order, they would see that there was no obligation on Córas Iompair Éireann to agree to a pension fund, that there was no obligation other than a legal obligation to pay the pensions when the pensions became due.  I accepted the Deputy's invitation to inspect that Order and it is true that there is no sentence or paragraph in that Order which makes it obligatory on Córas Iompair Éireann to collect 1/- per week from the employees and put the money into a pension fund.  That is so, if one takes the Order on its own, but I went a little further than Deputy Lemass, and I intend to be more frank with the House than he was.  I saw that that Order was made in pursuance of Section 44 of the Transport Act, 1944. I looked up that section and ascertained that Deputy Lemass got authority under it to pass or approve of a pensions scheme for one purpose and one purpose only, the creation of a pension fund, and while it is true, as Deputy Lemass says, that there is no mention of the words &ldquo;pension fund&rdquo; in the scheme which he approved of in 1945, it is also true that Section 44 (1) of the Transport Act, 1944, says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The company may prepare and submit to the Minister and shall, if so required by the Minister, submit to the Minister within such time as he may direct, a scheme (in this section referred to as a superannuation scheme) for establishing on a contributory basis a superannuation fund for the benefit of the employees or any particular class of the employees of the company.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that the Deputy as Minister did approve of a scheme and that that scheme was approved of under the section I have read out.  I think that the section itself is quoted in the Order.  It is also quite clear to any Deputy who takes the trouble to read the Act that the Minister at the <Col N="1906" /> time had authority only to pass or approve of a scheme for the purpose of creating a pension fund.  That has not been done and that is precisely what the Minister said here last week. If Deputy Lemass wants to make charges of deceit or deception against the Minister, in view of the manner in which he has dealt with this matter, all those charges will boomerang against himself.  I do not know whether he forgot that that section was in existence and thought he was entitled to make the pension scheme Order without any reference to the Act or not. Possibly the true explanation is that Deputy Lemass as Minister should have made it clear on the face of the Order that the contributions payable under the scheme were to be put into a pension fund and that that fund should be preserved.</P>
    <P>My main purpose in speaking to-day was to inform Deputy Lemass that some Deputies on this side do occasionally pay attention to what he says and do occasionally accept the challenges which he is wont to throw down here with such abandon.  If the Deputy will take the trouble to read the Act he passed in 1944 in relation to that scheme, he will see that every word I have said is true and he will see accordingly that the suggestions made by the Minister when introducing the Estimate last week were true and that there is no foundation whatever for the suggestion made by Deputy Lemass that the Minister endeavoured to deceive the House.  If I were not of a charitable disposition, I would say that the position was quite the reverse and that Deputy Lemass made a calculated effort to deceive Deputies on this side.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. McGilligan) Patrick McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the matters very definitely dealt with in connection with this Money Resolution, as well as on the Supplementary Estimate previously, was this question of pensions. I find it very difficult to know exactly where Deputy Lemass stands in this matter.  It is quite clear to anybody glancing through the debate on the Money Resolution that there was no phrase more frequently and consistently flung around the House than <Col N="1907" /> Deputy Lemass's phrase that there was no pensions fund.  At the end of the debate, when I interrupted on the particular occasion, I asked why was £150,000 worth of investments put into the fund, and Deputy Lemass answered, &ldquo;There was no fund&rdquo;. That is all over the debate.  I do not think the Deputy will deny that he used that phrase over and over again. He even went the length of saying, when I said later that the trustees were owed £273,000, that the trustees were not appointed until this year.  In any event, I take it, he is clear on that, that he said there was no fund in respect of pensions and no trustees to look after pensions.  I take it that that is his view.</P>
      <P>I do not know how he reconciles that with the statement he made on the 30th November on the Supplementary Estimate&mdash;I quote from column 1554 of the Official Reports:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;at the close of the financial year 1947, the position was that the company, having paid all its debenture interest, having paid all the charges properly chargeable to its revenue, having allocated £150,000 in each of two years and £100,000 in the third year to the pensions trust fund, having provided £250,000 in interest upon common stock, it had a credit balance in its profit and loss account of £75,000.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>So that on the 30th November there was so much of a pensions trust fund that the company had allocated £400,000 to it.  But when we come to the debate on the 1st December there was no fund and there were no trustees for a fund.</P>

      <P>This year.  On the Supplementary Vote for £4,000,000 odd, there was then a pensions fund into which had to be paid these sums of money, and on the 1st December there was no fund and there were no trustees.  There are trustees.  The trustees are, in the main, a body <Col N="1908" /> known as Transport Subsidiary, Limited, which had an attachment to Córas Iompair Éireann.  Its directors were always directors of Córas Iompair Éireann.  They did not include all the directors of Córas Iompair Éireann, but there was nobody on it except those who were also directors of Córas Iompair Éireann.  They took over a number of funds.  In the first place, they took over a fund belonging to the Dublin United Transport Company. There was a trust deed made in 1943 and under that there were certain moneys to be collected by the staff and contributions to be made by the company.  The statement in Clause 6 of the deed is that the fund has for its sole purpose the provision of pensions for staff members and their dependents.  That is signed by members of Transport Subsidiary, Limited, and they are participants in the deed. The deed was made between the Dublin United Transport Company and Transport Subsidiary, Limited.</P>
      <P>Some years ago there was a new fund established for the Great Southern Railways.  There had previously been a scheme backed by an Order which the Minister himself signed.  That definitely speaks of a fund.  The Order is one of the Orders to which Deputy Lemass referred the other day and was signed by him on the 28th March, 1945.  The Order was mainly a schedule which sets out a lot of details, but the preliminary paragraph is:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Whereas Córas Iompair Éireann has submitted to the Minister for Industry and Commerce the existing superannuation fund established by the Great Southern Railways Company for its regular wages staff:</P>
      <P>Whereas the Minister for Industry and Commerce, having heard all parties desirous of being heard and appearing to him to be interested in the said fund, has thought it proper to modify the fund in certain respects....</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Order may be cited as the Transport Act, 1944 (Section 45) Order, 1945 ... and continues the existing superannuation fund established by the Great Southern Railways <Col N="1909" /> Company for its regular wages staff as modified by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the schedule to which is hereby confirmed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Later there was a deed which again was drawn up between Córas Iompair Éireann and Transport Subsidiary Ltd. in which there are the same provisions more or less.  I shall not weary the House reading legal details, but there is a fund there established. As a matter of fact, in one of these deeds there is a clear obligation on the trustees to invest the money in debentures of Córas Iompair Éireann or such securities as are trustee securities under the law.  Of course the ordinary shares of Córas Iompair Éireann were not that.  These two funds between them accounted for something near 17,000 of the employees of Córas Iompair Éireann; 17,000 of them are covered either by these or smaller funds.  Those who entered into the service of Córas Iompair Éireann after the 1st January, 1945, are covered by these or some type of fund.  There is one other fund which is known as the Salaried Staff Fund.  It is also one in regard to which the company is very definitely in debt at the moment.  There is a fund known as the Córas Iompair Éireann Salaried Officials and Clerks Great Southern Railways Superannuation Scheme.  In respect of that, the moneys that should have been paid in, the contributions running from October, 1948, down to last month, amount almost to £66,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>From October, 1948. That is not the date in which it started.  Apparently, they had been paying contributions and from that date they stopped paying contributions and spent whatever money they got.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The origins of it were away back in the days of the old Midland railway.  It was carried over and enlarged from time to time. Under the Act of 1924, various people came into it.  It was further enlarged in September, 1948, in order that women clerks could get the benefit of <Col N="1910" /> the superannuation procedure.  They had to pay back-money in, but it was found at that time that the company owed those people, on provident funds, over £50,000, so that the company paid that much into this for them.  The result is that, taking that as a debt owed and notionally paid, Córas Iompair Éireann at the present moment owes £87,000 to that fund.</P>
      <P>There was a scheme to which Deputy Lemass referred on 1st December and which had to deal with those who came into the service of Córas Iompair Éireann in certain grades after 1st January, 1945&mdash;new entrants after that date.  That is what is dealt with in the scheme which Deputy Lemass referred to on the last day.  That scheme, of course, has also been transformed into a fund, and Transport Subsidiary, Limited, are the trustees for that.  All these superannuation scheme moneys are now very definitely funded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lemass, of course, was right when he said that there was a certain payment for the benefit of these funds at an earlier date.  There was a payment made in the year 1945 and another in the year 1946.  If Deputy Lemass had only taken the trouble to look at the balance sheet for these two years it would have cleared up the question of whether or not there was a fund into which investments had to be put.  In 1945 the matter is not as clearly put as in 1946, but there is a mention of a transfer to a pension trust fund.  The accounts were in a broken-up fashion. There was in the appropriation account for 1945 a transfer to the pension trust fund of £150,000.  In the balance sheet for 31st December, 1946, on one side of the balance sheet was &ldquo;Pension Trust Fund&mdash;£150,000&rdquo;, and on the other side of the balance sheet &ldquo;Pension Trust Fund Investments at cost, £150,000&rdquo;. That was the last time that Córas Iompair Éireann ever found itself in a position to pay anything to these superannuation funds.  During all the time the complaint was that, in the revenue account, certainly, for the years 1947 and 1948, they showed certain transfers of £100,000, but they made no transfer. What they did, when they came to the balance sheet, was this: these trustee <Col N="1911" /> moneys were simply put in as sundry creditors.  They came into the balance sheet as sundry creditors, but no money passed.</P>
    <P>The situation developed that way until this year.  About mid-June, 1949, Transport Subsidiary began to get alarmed at their position because quite definitely they would be in a very weak position if they had been brought before a court and asked to account for their trusteeship.  They made certain complaints or advances to Córas Iompair Éireann.  I do not know whether Córas Iompair Éireann made advances or not, but at any rate they decided that the thing could not continue on the old footing on which these moneys, protected by funds, were to be used for the payment of various benefits.  Some of the funds had different conditions from the others. They all had been mixed up, and Transport Subsidiary decided that it was wrong to have these trust moneys operating as sundry creditors.  They approached Córas Iompair Éireann, and then something took place which it is laughable to recite here.  If it had to be recited in a court of law it might have a much worse complexion.  Transport Subsidiary said to Córas Iompair Éireann: &ldquo;You owe us £142,000 that you should have paid us for the benefit of these trustee funds.&rdquo;  Córas Iompair Éireann said: &ldquo;We will assume the figure is correct, but we have not the money.&rdquo;  Transport Subsidiary said: &ldquo;We will lend you the money,&rdquo; but they also said: &ldquo;We have not the money either&rdquo;.  Then an arrangement was made that Córas Iompair Éireann would notionally send Transport Subsidiary a cheque for £142,000, and that Transport Subsidiary would notionally send to Córas Iompair Éireann a cheque for £142,000, but not 1/- passed. That is the situation.  I do not know what it would appear like in the next balance sheet.  At any rate, the result was that funds, which Transport Subsidiary should have in their hands, would no longer appear merely as &ldquo;sundry creditors&rdquo;, but would appear as the possessors of I.O.Us., whatever they were worth, from Córas Iompair Éireann.  Two minutes, almost in corresponding <Col N="1912" /> terms, were made.  One was by Córas Iompair Éireann requesting, by way of a loan, a sum of £142,000 from Transport Subsidiary, this being about the total of the net allocations due for the two years 1947 and 1948. Transport Subsidiary having got that, they agreed to the request, and the thing has been in that way, if you can call it so, regularised to that point.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that for a couple of years past Córas Iompair Éireann was taking contributions from people. With regard to some of these contributions, there is a definite obligation to hand them over to trustees, and, once the trustees got the money, there was a definite obligation on them to use the money for no other purpose except the payment of the various benefits set out in the scheme.  The situation developed that Córas Iompair Éireann could not pay, and they simply defaulted on that account.  There was later this sort of regularisation by Transport Subsidiary deciding: &ldquo;Well, we will make a loan to you of the money which you have not paid us if you notionally do pay.&rdquo; That is the sort of plight in which these particular funds are.  If Deputy Lemass is not satisfied with what I have said, I can give him all the details.  I can bring him through the accounts and show him the minutes that passed between these two bodies in order to put the thing on that footing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Why not be frank with Deputy Cowan and tell him that there was no failure to observe the letter of the law?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there was. Certainly, if Deputy Cowan addressed <Col N="1913" /> his remarks to funds 1, 2, 3 and 4, I certainly would say that under three of the funds there was a failure to observe the law, but, possibly, not under the fourth.  The fourth is the one which dealt with about 3,500 people out of the mass of employees which Córas Iompair Éireann have at the moment.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lemass also raised very strongly on the Supplementary Estimate, and not so strongly on the Money Resolution, this question of the future of the company, and how far the future of the company is going to be bound by the provision of debenture interest for it, and also in respect of securing the employment that it may provide for the employees in the course of its existence hereafter.  With regard to the debenture interest, the position is that Córas Iompair Éireann has not been able to meet its debenture interest for a couple of years past. The Minister for Industry and Commerce, when speaking here on the 30th November, put the situation quite accurately when he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Taking the first item, namely, debenture interest, £770,000.  This figure is made up of £561,000 which fell due during the year 1948 and the first half of 1949, and which the Exchequer has already paid under guarantee given in accordance with Section 18 of the Transport Act, 1944.  The balance of £209,000 is required to meet debenture interest which will fall due on the 15th January next.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is an accurate statement.  Deputy Lemass said, taking a technical point under the 1944 Act, that we could wait before we asked the taxpayer to pay these sums.  We could, technically, but what is the good of waiting?  The company has no chance of paying these moneys now, next year or the year after.  Deputy Lemass also spoke of unexhausted or un-issued debentures, and said that, under the 1944 Act, the company could still issue and so it could still issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I met, with my colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the directors of Córas Iompair Éireann about June, 1948, we heard their plans <Col N="1914" /> for the renovation of the railway.  I was told, and was told, without any appearance of either surprise or shame by the directors making the proposal, that they wanted leave to get £3,000,000 debentures. They wanted it to be recognised that part of it&mdash;they did not say the entire &mdash;was required not for working capital or productive assets but to meet operating losses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Would that be legal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the 1944 Act, as drawn, it turns out to be, but nobody ever thought when the 1944 Act was going through that there was any such loophole in it.  When I got the matter examined I was told that because of the loose phrase &ldquo;that debentures may be issued for the provision of money&rdquo; that you really could use these debentures for any purpose. Deputy Lemass gave three figures.  Let us take the round figure of £3,000,000 un-issued debentures.  After a good deal of trouble we said that we would let them have about £1,500,000.  The chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann sent me a letter dividing them into moneys to meet losses and moneys against capital development.  They were divided roughly into about £1,250,000 for operating losses, £1,250,000 for capital development, and then there was the remaining £500,000.  It is the ex-chairman I am speaking of&mdash;Mr. Reynolds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I got the matter examined and I was told that legally these moneys could be paid to them.  The question was, where were they going to get the money?  It is all very well to talk of an Act empowering them to carry out a £3,000,000 debenture issue.  The question is, who will take them up, who will provide the cash?  The then chairman told us that there was a company of a financial type in Dublin which had accommodated him before and he thought he ought to be allowed to see that company. We said, &ldquo;Certainly&rdquo; and he went, but they would not touch him. He said there was another company in London from which he had previously got accommodation and he asked if he <Col N="1915" /> would be allowed to approach that company.  We said, &ldquo;Certainly, go and see them.&rdquo;  He did so, but they, too, would not touch him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps they would not take British money?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, they would not touch him.  At that point resort was had to the Department of Finance.  We asked him had he tried any of the banks here.  At that stage his courage was not as high as it had been when he went to the first company and later when he went to London.  He more or less threw up his hands.  An approach was made to a bank and £300,000 was advanced.  A little later in the same month another approach had to be made to the same bank and, with some reluctance, they advanced £800,000.  A couple of months later the situation of Córas Iompair Éireann was so bad that a further approach had to be made to the same bank and they advanced £400,000 this time.  The first advance was in January, 1948, the second was later in the same month, and the third was made in June.  All these had to be repaid by 1st January, 1950, or not another penny would be lent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is that we are facing the repayment on that date of £1,500,000.  What is the good of talking about an unexhausted residue and the powers of borrowing of Córas Iompair Éireann?  They could not get a shilling anywhere.  Will Deputy Lemass visualise the type of prospectus that might have been issued in connection with a loan, if they had gone for a loan?  They lost £811,000 on the revenue account last year.  In the first half of 1948 they forecasted a loss of £1,250,000 in the year 1948.  They would have to say that to people, if they went into the open market, and they also would have to say: &ldquo;We are issuing debentures, but they are in the main for the purpose of meeting operating losses.&rdquo;  They would not get 5/- on such an appeal to the public and the banks were reluctant to take the matter up.  There is no purpose served in raising at this point any question such as whether a Government guarantee <Col N="1916" /> indicates a sound position.  It was a completely wrong attitude.  That is the situation with regard to debentures.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass apparently thinks this is a subsidy to the new company.  We are recognising reality.  The Minister indicates in the present Bill that there may be debentures issued up to a certain point.  Again, those will not be issuable unless the new company gets under way better than the old, and unless it makes a sort of financial showing when it presents itself to the public for some money.</P>
    <P>The other matter dealt with was, what were the proposals of the chairman and the directors at the point when they met the present Minister for Industry and Commerce and myself in June and at later times?  Deputy Lemass has heard often what was proposed on those dates, but he has said that he does not believe what the Minister and myself have disclosed to the House from time to time.  I have stated that I was present at the meeting. I have a manuscript note of my own about what happened.  I have letters from the ex-chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann on each of the points raised.  Sometimes he deals with points 1, 3 and 4 and sometimes with points 2 and 4, and, again, with three of them.  But that all these points were thought to be necessary on the date when the Minister and I met them, I have not the slightest doubt.  One proposal was to close every single mile of branch railways, and the mileage was stated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>861 miles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>861 miles.  When I asked the question whether that would cause any unemployment, I was told it would mean about 1,000 men.  Later, there was a correction with regard to that figure.  We were informed there might not be the unemployment that was stated at the meeting; that there might not be any unemployment at all, as it was possible that substitute occupation might be found for those people.  What reliance can be put on that statement may be judged from this, that at the first meeting in June there was a proposal to cut back <Col N="1917" /> maintenance, and the cost of that in unemployment was going to be 2,500 men.  Could anybody here find where suitable substitute employment could be found for the 1,000 men who would be put out of employment if the branch lines were closed?</P>
      <P>There was a proposal put forward that over the whole system the charges should be raised, but while they thought that fares could be raised over the whole system they were not too sure about raising charges unless the fourth thing could be done.  They expressed their view that the private motorist, with his private car, taking potential passengers, was not so much a trouble as the trader carrying his own goods in his own lorry and their proposal was that unless these people were put off the road altogether, or very seriously restricted by allowing them only a short run or tying them to deliver only certain types of traffic belonging to themselves, or a mixture of all three of these, they did not think they could increase freight charges. If private haul could be very seriously restricted&mdash;and they proposed that that should be done&mdash;then they said they would raise fares and rates over the whole system.</P>
      <P>In June there were four proposals&mdash; to dislodge 2,500 men by cutting out maintenance work; to close down every branch line and dislodge about 1,000 men; to restrict the private haul of goods in some of the ways suggested and, if that was done, to raise rates and fares all over the system.  They were requested to indicate what saving would be effected if all these things were done and they said it would be about £1,500,000, but they added that that was a guess.  In those days they were forecasting a loss of £1,250,000 on the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case may be made that they did not suggest these things all together, that they were suggested merely as alternatives.  Let me point out that in their own opinion there would be a saving, in certain circumstances that I have outlined, of £1,500,000, and any two of the proposals would, it was estimated, mean a saving of at least £1,000,000 against a loss of £1,250,000. <Col N="1918" /> They put up the whole lot of those proposals to us, and let nobody gainsay that, because the files are full of letters from the then chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann.  At one time he talks about the 2,500 men to be dislodged because of a cutting out of maintenance.  At another time he talks about branch lines.  At another time he talks about raising fares and charges.  But all three were useless. It is right to say that at an early date he had written in terms which would indicate better maintenance, more money to be put into maintenance and more people to be employed in maintenance.  But in between that there had been wages awards given and there were new wages awards in the offing.  Now, it is not for me to speculate, but I think that is what caused the attitude adopted by Córas Iompair Éireann and the stockholders' directors when they came to see us in June, 1948.</P>
    <P>The shareholders' directors issued a memorandum to their holders of common stock later.  In that memorandum they definitely speak of the demand for increases in fares and the reduction of staff.  They go all out for the closing down of branch lines.  At the commencement of this brilliant document they start off by saying that they are satisfied that losses are fundamental to the transport system at present in operation and that exceptional circumstances, such as the fuel shortage, strikes and wage increases only accentuated the losses.  They tell us at one time that if it had not been for the Government they could not have met their debenture interest.  Finally, they say&mdash;and Deputy Lemass might ponder this&mdash;that the railways paid in 1944-45 despite their fuel difficulties because, and only because, cars and lorries were off the roads.  They are hesistant to ask in the next sentence for a complete monopoly or that all citizens should be coerced off the roads, but there is a clear indication that this railway company had made good in earlier years only because private cars and lorries were off the roads.  That is the situation that existed in 1948.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1919" /> That situation can best be clarified as follows.  I first knew of Córas Iompair Éireann, as a could looming on the horizon in the early days of March, 1948, when I had been about three weeks a member of the Government. The information conveyed to me was that the then chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann, Mr. Reynolds, having visited the Minister for Industry and Commerce, told him as his best summing-up of the position: &ldquo;We are now at a stage where, if we were an ordinary company, the debenture holders would be putting in a receiver.&rdquo;  That is how we started off our relations with Córas Iompair Éireann, in the month of March, 1948.  It cannot be said that Córas Iompair Éireann has improved very much from that point, except in so far as we have been able to get certain things that were included in their programme dropped from that programme.</P>
    <P>We are now asking the public to provide money.  A vote has already been taken and part of it is carried forward into this Money Resolution.  Somebody used the expression that this was a sort of &ldquo;inquest.&rdquo;  An inquest should not be long drawn out.  It is also a sort of funeral and if I could hope that this was the only money we would be called upon to spend on the obsequies of Córas Iompair Éireann, I would be very happy.  It is not going to be the last money.  That company will, I think, face a loss for some years to come; and that position arises and will arise because the ill-considered scheme that the Transport Act of 1944 established has left its marks on the entire transport of the country.  Some of these marks we may get rid of in time. Others are just there.  We cannot put back the hands of the clock and those marks will hamper transport development in this country for years to come.</P>
    <P>Deputies who were in this House in 1944 will remember the high hopes and the brittle promises with regard to the efficient transport that would be supplied under that Act.  The new company was a strange one.  Members of the Dáil commented on it as the various sections went through.  They pointed out how anomalous, and at times how <Col N="1920" /> novel, the situation was.  Deputy Lemass will remember that, as Minister for Industry and Commerce in these days, he achieved what he described as a capital reconstruction of the company. That is a nice phrase for knocking down 9/10ths of the property that the common stockholders had in that concern.  He reduced the ordinary holdings to 1/10th of what they had been. He consolidated the assets&mdash;the good assets&mdash;of the Dublin United Tramways Company with this new concern.  He gave the monopoly that to play with; he threw all public transport into one group and, by doing so, he consolidated the workers in transport into the most powerful labour group in the country. Later the employees in this transport undertaking were given access, on the one hand, to the Labour Court and, on the other hand, to the Joint Industrial Council.  But neither of these two groups had terms of reference which at any time directed the minds of these two groups to the ultimate solvency of the company.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass, who was then Minister for Industry and Commerce, established a board under the Act.  At least it was called a board, but it was a monstrosity of a board.  It was presided over by a chairman who could be a quorum on his own and, without him, there could be no quorum.  Under the Act no decision was a decision of the company unless the chairman assented to it.  If the chairman wanted a decision to which the other members of the company did not assent, he could call a meeting of himself and he could have his own way.  Mr. Reynolds was appointed chairman of that board.  May I say now that, at the time when that appointment was made, I considered it an excellent appointment?  I think most people, particularly in Dublin City, thought that from the point of view of business ability and from the point of view of everything, except one thing, that went to make a good chairman to a transport company, Mr. Reynolds had all the qualities.  But the one thing he lacked was railway experience.  He had none and many people in those days were apprehensive, and I heard the apprehensions voiced, because not <Col N="1921" /> merely had he no railway experience but the experience he had before he went into Córas Iompair Éireann had made him unfavourable to rail services.  He was given a general manager who had no experience of railways and very little experience of transport.</P>
    <P>The directors found themselves, as they expressed it later, merely an advisory body.  I think they were rating themselves rather highly when they said they were even an advisory body when one remembers that their presence was not necessary to form a quorum, and the chairman could do what he liked, irrespective of whether or not they liked it.  According to the Milne Report, meetings of this board were held fortnightly.  But we also know that there were certain technical staffs and we know that one technical manager was never appointed, and one, who was appointed, remained for over a year with no deputy appointed to him.  At the directors' meetings, as we now understand the situation, there was no agenda furnished.  The directors did not know what they might be required to discuss prior to entering the boardroom.  In the boardroom the only agenda issued was in front of the chairman and, if they could gather what he was aiming at as he went down the items, then they might perhaps be allowed to voice an advisory opinion.  We also learn from the Milne Report that no formal reports were made to the board, even when the matters under consideration required a technical report, or a report from technicians.  We all know that there were technicians on the staff of Córas Iompair Éireann.  There were no such formal reports presented. So you had your single man, the chairman, not technical, and the general manager also far from being technical; some of the technical men were not appointed and those who were there were not used; no formal reports were presented.  Those are the circumstances under which the board of Córas Iompair Éireann operated.</P>
    <P>It is said that they made money in their first two years.  They did.  Judge Wylie gave the reason why.  It was because cars and lorries were off the <Col N="1922" /> roads and the travelling public were at the mercy of Córas Iompair Éireann &mdash;and little mercy Córas Iompair Éireann showed them.  They were huddled around anywhere; they were taken when Córas Iompair Éireann liked to take them, and no provision was made for exceptional times.  The money was made.  The people had to travel, some of them, and the only means of travel they had was by whatever buses or coaches Córas Iompair Éireann put at their disposal&mdash;and the company made money.</P>
    <P>Then bad times developed.  But the bit of money they had made and the bit of success they had had in the years when success was almost thrust upon them went to their heads&mdash;and they reduced their charges.  Then they found themselves faced with things that any director of a transport concern in this country must have anticipated&mdash;a strike here and there; a hold-up with regard to weather conditions; bad conditions with regard to fuel that the engines had had; bad conditions of different types&mdash;and they ran into the storm. They immediately behaved like any company behaves that sees bankruptcy ahead.  They defaulted on their debenture interest; they defaulted on their appropriations to the pension fund. They defaulted on these.  They used the moneys.  The result is that they have now left the present Minister for Industry and Commerce with the task of putting these into one huge bill and of presenting it to the public.  They were brought to the position that, I think, can most spectacularly be indicated by what the Minister for Industry and Commerce said here on an earlier occasion.</P>
    <P>Imagine the condition of a manager of a big company when he finds himself with about £430,000 worth of cheques solemnly written out and the items put down in the stubbs of the cheque book&mdash;and the cheques stuffed into a safe and the officials of the company warned that only if somebody such as a petrol supplier, or somebody important like that, threatened an action were they to pull out the cheque from the bundle of unissued cheques and pay him, and that, if they did do that, some other <Col N="1923" /> cheque, drawn and on the point of being issued, had to be stopped.</P>
    <P>Now let me deal with the company's overdraft in those days.  They were entitled, under the Act, to an overdraft of about £500,000.  They had very nearly the whole of that £500,000 drawn.  If the accountant in those days had released those cheques, their overdraft would have reached something short of £900,000.  Let me remind the House that the statutory limit of their overdraft, under the Act, was £500,000. I do not think that outside the criminal courts one could get a worse display than that.  One can hear stories from officials of the company of the devices they had to adopt to escape the people who had got beyond the stage of 'phoning up Kingsbridge and who were hanging around the premises to see if they could get the cheque for the three or four months' supply of petrol or kerosene or anything else that was essential for the running of Córas Iompair Éireann.</P>

      <P>There is the situation. Sir James Milne in his report has told us here of the way the management side of the company was run.  He said that he had got information from the company that the management regarded it as being in a transition period&mdash;that was their report for 1948 on a concern which started in 1945.  Deputy Davin has queried whether or not the people running Córas Iompair Éireann in <Col N="1924" /> those days were rail-minded or road-minded or whether there was any bias one way or another.  It is not easy to get internal evidence one way or another.  The general impression appears to have been created amongst the staff that the management were definitely anti-rail.  Sir James Milne recommended a different type of depreciation to what was already being presented in the accounts, but the ex-chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann wrote on this and he described what the method was&mdash;the depreciation method employed is to write down by annual instalments the assets on a replacement basis.  The theory supporting this method is that expenses, at current rate of costs, should be deducted from gross receipts which are earned from charges based on current costs.  He then refers to paragraph 163 of the report:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;As there is no depreciation fund balanced by investments, the provision for depreciation in the revenue accounts has no value from a financial point of view.  The proposals in the report may be adopted, provided all those concerned are made aware that the now obsolete assets are having their useless lives extended, thereby gaining for the Milne proposal an immediate benefit by mortgaging the future.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy Lemass is a strong supporter of that&mdash;mortgage the future and get an immediate benefit.  Sir James Milne's comment on that was that there was no justification for the statement that the proposals involved the extension of the lives of useless assets or that the future would be mortgaged. This comes from his meetings with the management generally:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The company's depreciation policy was empirical and unsound and seems to have had as a background the attitude that within a short space of time most of the railway could be scrapped.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is certainly the impression the management left on Sir James Milne who made the report which bears his name.  There is no doubt that, if you were out to scrap the railway institution, <Col N="1925" /> these depreciation proposals, so much criticised, are the proper ones. As against that, can anybody see logic or sanity in the proposal then to buy at these heavy costs these enormous diesel locomotives?  It looks as if there was a changing policy, as if the directors were in a stage of transition themselves, as well as their staff, and that they had not a clear view.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, through the accounts, there appears to be haste. There appears to be an effort of a hasty type to get rid of railway assets. There was not the same anxiety with regard to the assets that would be counted in on the other side of the concern.  That was the situation&mdash;that peculiar management; the lack of technical assistance; even the way the advisory board was treated.  Yet these members, who say that they were only an advisory board, when they were asked about the capital developments, so much criticised in the Milne Report, said that all the schemes had the full approval of the board.  &ldquo;We thought, and still think, they are necessary for efficient work.  Had we been given an opportunity we would gladly have stated the reasons for the decisions taken&rdquo;&mdash;and in another place they explained that their attitude to these proposals would be given in good time.  That good time has not dawned yet.  They have not told us that they were in favour of these proposals.</P>
    <P>Again may I get the picture?  People, I am sure, have heard of the parody of philosophy which described two blind men sitting in a dark room with an unlighted candle looking for a black cat that is not there.  I want to get the picture of Córas Iompair Éireann further than that&mdash;the chairman who would not let the advisory board know what he was going to discuss at a meeting, who was flanked by his manager who had no transport experience or very little, who had not the backing of a technical staff&mdash;and such technical staff as they had they did not use.  The advisory board, who listened to whatever was said at the table, without formal reports decided these things. Amongst other things they decided on what is known as the Store Street <Col N="1926" /> station which cost the company about £350,000, before this piece of legislation had been through; these boilers costing £280,000; the Broadstone sheds estimated to cost just something short of £1,000,000; the chassis production sheds which were to cost £476,000, and certain other plant and machinery which was criticised in the report at £150,000; the diesel engines, estimated to cost £404,000&mdash;of course the present cost would be far beyond that; the North Wall engine sheds, a mere trifle of £80,000; the Glengarriff Hotel which would have run into £1,000,000; the Clondalkin goods yard and the Hazlehatch yard which were just short of £500,000; the Limerick sheds which were going to cost £500,000; the Kingsbridge Station project which, at its lowest, was going to cost £400,000 and the Limerick Junction project which was going to cost £190,000.  And the people who had no technical advice, no formal reports, no guidance, had, without an agenda, passed all these.  Then they were amazed at the end of the year when they found they could not get issued £1,500,000 of the £3,000,000 debentures which, under the Act, they were entitled to issue unless a Government Department went and coerced the bank into giving them £1,550,000.</P>
    <P>At least £3,000,000 will be saved on these schemes in the sense that it will not be spent, but there are certain costs, apart from the money provided for in the Supplementary Estimate, for which I shall some day or other have to approach the people.  Apart from old charges and fees of certain types, expenses of a certain type had been incurred and that bill has got to be met.  There may be a salvage from some of these things.  I still hope it will be possible to recover something out of the payments that have to be met appropriate to one or two of these items.</P>
    <P>May I say a word about a matter that has been agitating the public mind and that has been a source of much misapprehension?  It is one of those items to which I have referred already.  Apparently, the feeling in Dublin at this moment is that it is a pity that people think of not going on with the Store Street station.  I <Col N="1927" /> think people who feel that way speak as if all the necessary cost had been incurred in connection with Store Street and I think they also feel that if a new view were adopted in regard to Store Street, it could be used as a bus station inside a month or two. Neither of these views represents the facts.  At the moment, the Store Street building has cost £350,000.  If I put it at that figure, I think I am putting it moderately.  It will require another £500,000 to get that building ready without allowing anything for furniture.  That is, it will cost £850,000 to get the partitions up and to get it into a proper condition without furniture, for the accommodation of the traffic people or other civil servants. It will cost, it is calculated, about £150,000 more to furnish it.  There will, therefore, be more than £1,000,000 sunk in that building before it is ever properly furnished and properly developed for office purposes.  It will take about a year to finish it.  It will probably take longer; it might easily go into the second year.</P>
    <P>If people think that they could have some sort of a bus station on the lower level, while the contractors are there with their equipment and their employees running around the upper storeys, then they have no idea of the confusion that would be caused by any such procedure.  A use can be found for that building.  A use can be found for that building by a society which is able to pay the £1,000,000 which it will eventually cost.  If the original proposal of Córas Iompair Éireann were adopted, we were going to have the building as a bus station under the control of the State and we were asked to provide £800,000 for that.  I do not propose to ask for another penny in connection with that building for Córas Iompair Éireann purposes.  It was always a foolish proposal and I am not going to give my vote for a single penny extra being expended on this building for railway purposes.  A good bus station can be erected at Smithfield.  I see by last night's paper that there is some story or some thought of the corporation having to ask for £250,000 assistance in that connection.  The present <Col N="1928" /> Chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann has assured the town planning section of the corporation that that is completely inaccurate.  There will not be anything required for street widening or dislocation of houses there.  A simple structure can be put up at Smithfield.</P>

      <P>No, but not a seven or eight-storey structure; simply a one-storey structure which will give the shelter and the comfort which are now being sought for bus passengers.  That can be done inside half a year and it can be done at a cost that will not be anything like £200,000.  We think that that is quite enough for Córas Iompair Éireann to undertake in that respect for the present or even for the immediate future.  It will be time enough when they have had time to develop under the new conditions, to think of a bus station of a more grandiose type.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We ask the people to give us this Estimate subject to these terms, because having got rid of the monstrous board procedure and having cleared up the debts of the old company, to some extent starting with this group not absolutely on a secure footing, because it will not have that for some years to come, but having provided for these debts which nobody could expect the present Córas Iompair Éireann or the new Córas Iompair Éireann board to be able to pay inside a couple of years, we think that when that is done there may be some chance, although it may be at the cost of the taxpayers, of having some sort of efficient service provided for the people of this country.  We have asked Córas Iompair Éireann to cut out all the grandiose schemes which helped to bring that concern into the state of bankruptcy at which it had certainly arrived if the State had not come to its relief.  We think that under these conditions it may have some chance, but, as I said before, a lot of things will have to be done before it is on secure ground.  The old debts will have to be paid and there are certain commitments which will have to be discharged. <Col N="1929" /> We cannot get rid of the bad results of the old system simply by getting rid of the present board.  It is not a very pleasing prospect for the taxpayer of the country, but for some years at least he will have to give something by way of subsidy towards the company, but we will at least get a board of efficient management, a board constituted of the ordinary type of directors.  We are not seeking the type of board, the directors of which will be merely &ldquo;yes-men&rdquo; on a so-called advisory committee.  In those circumstances, we may get a better approach to a better transport situation in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance has admitted that the financial difficulties of Córas Iompair Éireann, its problem of paying debenture interest, its problem of making appropriations for superannuation purposes, were due to losses in the last two years, losses during the period of office of the present Government.  They are a direct consequence of the refusal of the present Minister for Industry and Commerce to deal with the situation of Córas Iompair Éireann when the board of the company approached him in March, 1948, and intimated, among other things, that an increase in fares was immediately necessary.  Because <Col N="1930" /> of that refusal of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to deal with the situation revealed to him by the board of Córas Iompair Éireann and enable them, by increased fares and charges, to offset the very substantial increase in their costs which had occurred in consequence of higher wages and higher prices for materials, the company was driven into the appalling predicament which the Minister for Finance has just now revealed.  Because of that refusal, because of the inability of the board of the company to get the Minister to modify his refusal during the course of 1948, because of their inability to get from him a clear indication of his intentions regarding them during 1948, they reached at the end of that year the situation that when they drew cheques there was no money to meet them and that they could not pay their petrol bill without dodging some other account.  It is not true, as the Minister for Finance has said, that the company had reached, at the end of 1947, the position in which they could not pay their debenture interest.  They paid their debenture interest in 1947.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The company made a profit in 1945 and in 1946.  Undoubtedly, they made a loss in 1947 and the circumstances which occasioned that loss have been mentioned here frequently.  Apparently, however, there is still some desire to represent that loss as being due to deficiencies of the management in that year.  The company, for many months of that year were unable to run trains at all because they had no coal.  For a large part of the year they were running on their main lines one, two or four trains per week.  For many weeks of that year their road services were stopped because of a trade dispute. These unanticipated difficulties of 1947 caused a loss in 1947.  In addition, in that year they had to increase substantially the amount paid in wages and the cost of materials purchased for the purposes of the company also increased.  In fact, the actual amount paid out in increased wages, plus the increased cost of fuel and materials, more than exceeded the loss in that year.  The amount of revenue which <Col N="1931" /> had to be relinquished because of their inability to run full services of trains during the whole year, plus the revenue lost through the trade dispute affecting road services, more than exceeded the loss in that year.  The company had, of course, accumulated some profits and were able to meet the immediate claims upon their revenue including debenture interest.  The Minister for Finance was wrong in his statement that, because of the special difficulties of 1947, the company was unable to pay debenture interest in that year.  The higher costs that began to operate in 1947 were obviously a serious matter for the company in 1948 because, with the higher wage scales in force over the full year and the higher cost of materials also likely to persist over the full year, then, even with the higher anticipated revenue because of the improved fuel situation and the settlement of the trade dispute regarding the road services, the company realised that they could not pay their way in 1948.  They came to the Minister for Industry and Commerce and said so.  They produced to him the evidence which made it abundantly clear that their case for increased fares was not merely justified on the grounds of higher costs, but was also justified if there was in the mind of the Minister a deside to preserve the financial position of the company.  I am not going again to question the motives of the Minister for Industry and Commerce for refusing the company the relief which the situation called for.  Because of that refusal, whatever motives inspired it, he knew, in March, 1948, that Córas Iompair Éireann at the end of that year would be in the position now so eloquently described by the Minister for Finance.  If there is to be any suggestion that the circumstances of the company at the end of 1948 were due to any other cause than the decision of the present Minister for Industry and Commerce, then I refute it.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, quite true that the board of Córas Iompair Éireann, the representatives of the common stockholders upon that board and the chairman of the board were strongly in favour of closing down uneconomic branch lines.  Nobody has suggested <Col N="1932" /> otherwise.  Prior to the establishment of Córas Iompair Éireann, the directors of the Great Southern Railway were strongly in favour of closing down uneconomic branch lines.  They have been pressing for the closing of branch lines since before I became Minister for Industry and Commerce in 1932.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Who told you that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying it, I know it.  The position in that regard is, however, that I took the point of view that the question of maintaining or closing branch lines was not one to be decided upon the financial results of operating them.  I personally held the view, which Sir James Milne sets out so clearly in his report, that we had to consider the transport facilities of the country as a whole.  Undoubtedly, it was our aim to make the transport organisation as a whole pay its way, but we did not regard it as essential that each single part of it should show a profit.  So we decided that the closing of branch lines would be considered not as a narrow financial question, but as an aspect of transport policy as a whole. We decided that where the company applied to close a branch line or suspend the service of trains over a branch line&mdash;and under the law the company could not do one or the other without legal authority&mdash;that the application would be considered. Provision was made in the 1944 Act for the establishment of a Transport Advisory Committee.  There was power to hold a public inquiry and I informed the Dáil that it was the policy of the Government, of which I was a member, that where there was an application to close a branch line which was opposed, that full public inquiry would be undertaken, that the facts would be ascertained, that the repercussions of the closing of the branch line upon the economic interest of the area affected would be examined, and that a decision would be taken by the Minister responsible to the House, the Minister for Industry and Commerce answerable to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On this question of branch lines, I do not think it is necessary to say more in explanation of what my policy was than I have done.  We found, <Col N="1933" /> however, that the present Minister produced to this House a Bill which proposed to give to the management of the transport concern alone power to close branch lines, power to suspend transport services.  He proposed to give them that power exercisable at their own discretion and to make them answerable to nobody.  In particular, he divested himself, or proposed to divest himself, of any power to question their decision, of any functions which would enable a member of the Dáil to question what was done, much less to propose here the reversal of it. The Minister has changed his mind about that.  He is now proposing to amend the Bill in regard to these provisions. Having gone what I believe to be too far in one direction, he is now proposing to march back much too far in the other direction.  We will deal with his particular proposals on his amendments, the proposals to set up a completely unworkable machine to handle these problems of transport charges and the adequacy of transport service.  You will note, however, that no matter which way the Minister goes, whether too far to the right or too far to the left, he achieves the one purpose all the time&mdash;he bows himself out of the picture, so that he, as Minister, will have no responsibility, so that the Dáil will have no power to query through him the wisdom of the policy being pursued.</P>
    <P>We are told that the board of Córas Iompair Éireann were anxious to curtail expenditure on railway maintenance. I do not believe it.  So far as I know the views of the present members of the Córas Iompair Éireann board or its former chairman, so far as those views have been put upon record in published documents, they were, on the contrary, urging all the time that the rehabilitation of the railway necessitated considerable capital expenditure on the improvement of main lines, so that faster speeds could be run by passenger and freight trains.</P>
    <P>It may be true that the scheme of organisation in the 1944 Act was ill-considered. It is not a term that I would regard as accurate.  It was certainly very fully considered.  The Bill was before the Dáil twice and it was <Col N="1934" /> certainly more fully debated in the Dáil than any other Bill passed in the past 20 years.  The preparation of the Bill had been proceeding on and off for many years.  We had recognised the need for new transport legislation in 1938.  There was a Transport Tribunal set up in 1939 to investigate the situation, and which produced a report.  It was merely the outbreak of the war which had prevented the legislation enacted in 1944 being prepared and submitted to Dáil Éireann much earlier. But in so far as the Transport Tribunal in 1939 recommended that one of the steps necessary was to appoint on the board of the Great Southern Railways Company a representative of the Government, to acquire knowledge of the working of the organisation and to advise the Government in the preparation of its legislative proposals, that was done.  I do not want to suggest that the reason why Mr. Reynolds was appointed as Government chairman of the Great Southern Railways Company in 1941 was merely for the purpose of implementing that recommendation of the Transport Tribunal of 1939.  The reason was that the management of the Great Southern Railways had broken down under the stress of war conditions and it was necessary to put somebody in there to ensure that the main transport services of the company would be carried on, in the very difficult period that we foresaw as the war developed.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has deprived me of one pleasure I was going to give myself during the course of this debate, which was to read out here the tributes to Mr. Reynolds that were paid by him, by Deputy Davin and by many Ministers and Deputies now sitting opposite during the course of the debates on the Act of 1944.  I want to say here and now, in fairness to him, that there is no man who did a tougher job or a better job during the whole of the war years in keeping our transport services going in circumstances of extraordinary difficulty which Deputies who were not in touch with developments could not even attempt to understand.  Mr. Reynolds did a first-class job of work for this nation and if we were able to get <Col N="1935" /> through the war years without permanent damage to our economy and without undue hardship, a large part of the credit goes to him and, in all fairness, should be given to him.</P>

Any Deputy is entitled to hold the view that the scheme of the 1944 Act was defective. I will contest that viewpoint, but I admit his right to hold it.  I do, however, question the right of a Minister who holds that the scheme of the 1944 Act was defective to come here and propose, as an amendment of the Act, this Bill, which does not change it at all.  In what way will the new board be different from the old Córas Iompair Éireann organisation?  In this way only&mdash;that it will consist of different people.  The members of the old Córas Iompair Éireann board were elected by the common stockholders. Their names are known and I will read them out, in case anybody thinks that I might have a political or personal interest in defending their retention: &ldquo;Mr. W.E. Wylie, K.C.; Mr. J.F. Costello, Mr. C.D. Hewat, Mr. John McCann, and Mr. H.B. Pollock&rdquo;. Whatever we may think about them and as to their political views, as expressed in the past by them or revealed through their actions&mdash;I think very little&mdash;we must recognise that they were people of experience.  I grant you that it was a limited experience, experience solely in business management.</P>

      <P>A large number of them were bank directors.  Deputy Davin can say what he likes about them, but at least they were a considerable improvement on the old Great <Col N="1936" /> Southern Railways Board.  I think even Deputy Davin will agree on that. However, we are going to have a new board this time, not elected by anybody but appointed by the Government.  They may be a better board, they may be a worse one. I am prepared to concede the possibility of their being a better board and if the Minister for Industry and Commerce decides to use his powers of nomination for the purpose of getting a better board, he can do it.  But that is the only change.  Even this statement that under the old Act the chairman could act alone and direct the company as a dictator, without reference to the board, will still be true when the new Bill is passed.  Deputies should read the new Bill carefully.  Membership of the new board will consist of such a number of members, not exceeding six, as the Minister may decide; and so far as legislation can settle the matter the Minister can, if he so desires, appoint a board of one only and that one will constitute a quorum.  In fact, we do not think that the Minister is going to do that.  In fact, also, the Chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann never acted without agreement from his board.  The suggestion that he could sit there and overrule their decisions and, by continuing to overrule them, get the decision that he wanted, is unfounded.  I do not believe that, during the whole period of the existence of Córas Iompair Éireann up to the end of 1947, the chairman ever exercised the statutory powers conferred upon him by the Act.  After that date it may have happened because the Minister for Industry and Commerce gave him directions requiring him to do things of which the board did not approve.</P>

      <P>Is it fair to describe the difficulties which Córas Iompair Éireann encountered during the war years in providing a minimum of railway and road services as due to any desire on the part of the directors of the company to play rough with the public?  The Minister for Finance suggested that.  &ldquo;Little mercy they showed the public during those years when no transport services were available&rdquo;. It is a most unfair observation upon the work of men who had a very difficult task to perform and, although they themselves were not pleased with the success of their efforts, we can feel reasonably assured that they did everything that could be done to maintain the essential minimum of transport services during those years.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance has repeated the suggestion that the management of Córas Iompair Éireann was hostile to the development of its rail services.  I will make no further comment on that at this stage except again to remind the House that the burden of the charge which the Minister for Industry and Commerce made against the company, on the ground that they proposed to undertake heavy capital expenditure which he regarded as extravagant, related to their proposals to incur capital expenditure on their railway system.</P>
      <P>Of the £17,250,000 capital expenditure which he stated the Córas Iompair Éireann board intended to undertake, more than £12,000,000 was destined, according to the list he gave, for the railway system and it is difficult for me to understand how the Ministry can hope to sustain both charges against the Córas Iompair Éireann management, one the charge of being hostile to the development of railways and the second the charge of proposing to spend too much on their development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I stated here in 1944, and I still believe, that the survival of the Irish railways depends entirely upon the <Col N="1938" /> adequacy of the capital available for their re-equipment.  We recognise that, not merely is the reconstruction of the permanent way necessary to enable more efficient services to be given, but that a large part of the transport equipment, the locomotives, the wagons, the coaches, are completely obsolete and, furthermore, because of the history of the company, with the various amalgamations, there has been complete absence of standardisation, which made maintenance costs high.</P>
    <P>When did the Government decide that the condition of Córas Iompair Éireann required a subsidy from the taxpayer?  That is a fair question because the speech of the Minister for Finance, like the speech delivered earlier by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, was intended to suggest that the need for subsidies in this year or next year arose from something that happened in 1947 or earlier.  But, Sir James Milne presented his report to the Government in November, 1948.</P>
    <P>The Government had already taken action upon some of his recommendations three months later.  I will name the recommendation to increase fares in February, 1949 as an example. Presumably, that report was under consideration by the Government in the months of December and January last. We know that the Government had taken a decision in February last because that decision was announced. I am not going to raise any query now concerning the manner of its announcement, of the effect that the leakage of information concerning it to one newspaper had upon the price of shares on the Dublin Stock Exchange.  I merely remind the House that the decision of the Government to introduce legislation of this kind was announced by the Government in February last.  In May, the Minister for Finance delivered here his Budget statement and in that Budget statement he made it clear that there was no intention of embarking upon a policy of transport subsidisation. He admitted that provision had to be made in the Budget to recover the amount advanced to Córas Iompair Éireann in respect of the debenture interest they could not pay in 1948, because of the action of the Minister <Col N="1939" /> for Industry and Commerce, but he said &ldquo;That, I hope, will be the last we will have to pay out of the Exchequer to Córas Iompair Éireann.&rdquo;  We know it was not the last.  We know the Minister came back here last week and asked for £4,000,000.  We know the Minister for Industry and Commerce then announced that he is going to ask for further sums next year and the following year.</P>
    <P>Clearly, the circumstances that made it necessary to produce that Supplementary Estimate of last week and to announce now the intention to subsidise transport services next year and the year after arose some time since May, 1949, when the Minister for Finance made his Budget statement. That is very like what would have happened in relation to Córas Iompair Éireann during that period.  We know that there could have been very little constructive planning done.  The chairman of the company was changed.  A new chairman was appointed.  He came to office knowing that legislation was intended.  I do not know if he was aware of the nature of the legislation but, clearly, pending the clarification of the Government's intentions and the enactment of whatever Bill was designed to give effect to them, little could be done except on a very temporary and day-to-day basis.  That method of working almost certainly involved the company in further and unnecessary losses.</P>
    <P>There is, however, clearly a recognition by the Government that even this scheme that they took so long to prepare, between the announcement in February and the appearance of the Bill, in October, cannot and will not solve any transport problems and that explains their reasons for dodging once again their responsibility on this issue by passing them on to the shoulders of the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>It is unfair to Córas Iompair Éireann to say that the appropriations to depreciation over the years of its existence are not represented by any investments. Is there a railway company in the world which finances itself in that way?  It has been the practice of all railway companies to utilise their depreciation allocation, when <Col N="1940" /> they call it that, to finance their renewals and replacements programme. In fact, prior to the establishment of Córas Iompair Éireann the allocations for that purpose were not called appropriations to depreciation.  They were classed as expenditure upon maintenance and renewals.  If it had been suggested that there should be, in addition to the normal expenditure on renewals and maintenance, a further appropriation from revenue for the purpose of building up a reserve fund called a depreciation fund, I would have opposed it as involving an unnecessary charge upon transport users.</P>
    <P>I do not know if any member of the Córas Iompair Éireann board ever expressed the view that most of the railways should be scrapped.  My own view is that most of the existing railway equipment should be scrapped.  I have held that view for many years and have expressed it on many occasions.  Nothing could be done about it during the period of war-time scarcities and probably not a great deal can be done about it yet; but I was far more perturbed by the reference of the Minister for Finance to the capital provision of this Bill than by anything else he said, because it implied that there was going to be no money available for the renewal and modernisation of railway equipment. I had assumed that at least the £7,000,000 additional transport stock, for the issue of which this Bill provides, represented the sum of money which would be available to the company for that purpose, but, if I correctly interpret the Minister's remarks, that figure is put in only as a gesture and in fact no money is going to be raised for capital expenditure in Córas Iompair Éireann through the issue of such stock.</P>
    <P>I am not in a position to refer here to the procedure of the Córas Iompair Éireann board.  I do not know whether Sir James Milne's observations upon the procedure of that board are accurate or not.  I do know that Sir James Milne never met any member of the board.  I want to know where he got his information concerning what happened at Córas Iompair Éireann board meetings.  He never met the members of the board.</P>

I do not claim that my experience is exhaustive, but I can well understand the difference between the method under which the board worked and that normally operated in British railway companies. British railway companies were managed by the railway bureaucracy. They were managed by those who held the positions of general manager, chief engineer or traffic manager.  The directors were, in the main, guinea-pigs, people chosen for the position because of their names or because of the confidence their names would give to investors.</P>

      <P>Exactly; that was the normal procedure.  The manager decided what he was going to do, wrote it out on a sheet of paper and sent it to them and they stamped it.  Here the procedure, I am informed, was completely different.  The board of Córas Iompair Éireann effectively managed the undertaking.  They dealt with the specific points that had to be dealt with by a board of management and kept their officials as technical advisers which is what they should be.</P>

      <P>As regards Store Street, I will make one observation only.  I do not think the Minister for Finance has correctly interpreted public opinion in Dublin.  It is not that public opinion in Dublin is misinformed, as he says, about the prospective cost of the Store Street Station, but it very strongly recognises the need for a central bus station near the main shopping centres of the city.  I refuse to accept the statement that the completion of the bus terminus part of the building in Store Street will involve £250,000. Deputies can hold any view they like concerning the wisdom or otherwise of the Córas Iompair Éireann management in establishing at Store Street not merely a central bus station but central offices for their clerical staffs. They said themselves that the centralisation of their administration in one building would not merely greatly increase the efficiency of their organisation but would mean a saving in cost.  The Minister denied the saving in cost, but he cannot deny the increase in efficiency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I became Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Department was located, if I remember correctly, in 14 buildings around the City of Dublin, and when I wanted to consult any senior officer of the Department, I had to give a day's notice so that he could make the necessary travelling arrangements to get over to my office to give me the information I wanted.  I decided that, if the Department was ever to do the <Col N="1943" /> useful work I wanted it to do, I also had to carry out a scheme of centralisation, and I think the Minister will not deny that the building he now occupies is a far more efficient centre from which to direct the Department than a back room in Government Buildings, with the various sections of the Department scattered all over the place.  I put that point only by way of illustration.  I think there is no question whatever that there is a strong public demand for the establishment in Dublin of a properly equipped central bus station. Every citizen and every visitor to the city is horrified by the spectacle he sees along Aston's Quay of thousands of people, on these wet wintry evenings, queueing up under a leaking corrugated iron roof, waiting for the bus to take them down the country.</P>
    <P>I make no apology to anybody for asserting here that one of the main purposes for which the Córas Iompair Éireann organisation was established was the creation of precisely that kind of facility for the people of this country. The Minister for Finance read an extract from a statement issued by the shareholders' directors of Córas Iompair Éireann.  He left out one sentence from the quotation, which, I think, is worth reading:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The board understood that Córas Iompair Éireann was established to build up a sound transport organisation on a long-term policy and make it capable of ultimately manufacturing its main requirements.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>One of the needs of the Irish public and one of the features of any sound transport plan must be the creation in Dublin of proper passenger facilities for travellers by rail and road and the transformation of the horrible, gloomy structures that pass for railway stations throughout the country into properly designed transport centres where the traveller can get whatever type of transport, be it rail or road, is more suitable to his requirements.</P>
    <P>I think the suggestion of establishing a central bus station at Smithfield is mad.  I say that if you got the two men who escaped out of Dundrum Asylum to pick a site in Dublin for a <Col N="1944" /> central bus station they would pick Smithfield.  If it is seriously suggested that Smithfield is to be developed as a central bus station without widening the streets in the vicinity, then it is twice as mad.  The buses will come out through a bottle-neck on to the quay, will have to reverse two or three times to get facing down the quay and, in the meantime, all traffic stops until they finish manoeuvring.  Smithfield might be made possible if £350,000 was spent on street widening in order to have easy entry to and exit from it. But to establish a bus station at Smithfield with these little narrow roads the only way into it, with all the north-bound traffic, I am told, routed to pass through Capel Street&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Who told you that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The present chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann said it at the corporation committee.  That indicates that this matter is being treated with levity and certainly that no serious consideration has been given to it. If there is to be a central bus station in Dublin, it has got to be near the main shopping centres, or else it only means further intensification of the Dublin traffic problem, because everybody coming from the country to do shopping in Dublin, being debussed at Smithfield, will immediately look for another bus to take them from Smithfield to the shopping centres.  I know that town planners and other theorists can take a map of Dublin and can pick other centres more suitable than Store Street.  Undoubtedly a site in the vicinity of Aston's Quay or even Christ Church Place, which was at one time suggested, in so far as it is west of O'Connell Street, would be preferable. But Córas Iompair Éireann had this difficulty&mdash;there was no such site.  That is a factor which many people ignore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no point in talking about building a bus station on Aston's Quay if it means knocking down McBirney's and several other establishments and offices in that locality.  There is no point in talking about Christ Church Place if it means removing Christ Church.  But there was in Store Street a site occupied by the ugliest building in Europe.  Many of those complaining <Col N="1945" /> about the æsthetic effect of building any bus station behind the Custom House in Store Street were very silent when that site was occupied by a dark, brick store without a window in it&mdash; an unused store.  It was, from the point of view of Córas Iompair Éireann, fortunate that there was available near the centre of the city a site of that kind occupied by a building which should have been demolished on æsthetic grounds years ago.</P>
    <P>One further matter that I want to refer to is this matter of pensions.  The Minister for Finance can confuse this issue very skilfully.  It is quite true that, when the Dublin United Transport Company was amalgamated with Córas Iompair Éireann, there were a lot of pension funds, of one kind or another, which had to be taken care of.  May I clear one misapprehension out of the way?  So far as I know, the great majority of Great Southern Railway clerks were members of the Railway Clearing House Superannuation Fund, and the only recollection I have of dealing with the problem of superannuation for railway clerks involved the winding-up of that fund so far as this country was concerned.  I said that it was a political anachronism that an Irish transport organisation should be a member of the British Railway Clearing House and that it was undesirable that the pensions fund operated by that clearing house should be the basis of the pensions secured by Irish railway clerks on retirement. That change could not be made by our legislation alone.  It involved legislation by the British also.  I understand that that legislation has been passed and I presume that the position is now in order.</P>
    <P>There were other pension funds for different classes and types of clerks who had come into the Great Southern Railway organisation with special rights following the Amalgamation Act of 1924.  There were pension funds for clerical employees of the Dublin United Transport Company.  But let me be quite clear about this.  The pensions scheme which the Great Southern Railway Company established for its wages staff under Mr. Reynolds was <Col N="1946" /> not established as a result of any legal obligation on the company.  It was established by him with the consent of the board because of his belief that the proper working of a transport organisation of that kind required that there should be a reasonably generous pensions scheme and an equally generous welfare scheme.  He had inaugurated these schemes in the Dublin United Transport Company and one of the first things he tried to do in the Great Southern Railway was to effect the same improvements there.</P>
    <P>The Minister tells me that the Order I made in September, 1945, which set out the benefits corresponding to those given under the Great Southern Railway scheme to its regular wages working staffs and the rates of contributions they had to pay, applied only to new entrants.  I am anxious to get some information concerning that scheme.  It is true that there was as the Minister stated, although in a manner which caused me to misunderstand him, some agitation in this House when the Bill was under discussion in Committee in favour of setting up a joint management of that pensions scheme.  I opposed the idea of joint management, because I pointed out that, of the cost of the pensions payable under it, the workers' contribution of 1/- a week amounted only to 20 per cent. and the company's contribution to 80 per cent.  A joint management committee and joint trustees are usually associated with pension schemes established upon the basis of equal contributions and, as it would have been contrary to the interests of the railway workers that the principle of equal contribution should be introduced in the scheme for the Great Southern Railway regular wages staff, I did not accept the suggestion of joint management.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made an Order amending that scheme.  That Order provides for the establishment of a fund and for the appointment of trustees to the fund.  I am anxious to get from him an explanation of one further change which his Order makes. It is a change set out in Section 7 of the Order made by the Minister on <Col N="1947" /> 22nd April this year.  Section 7, subsection (1) reads:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In every year there shall be a contribution from the company to the fund of an amount not less than the total amount of contribution of the members to the cost of the scheme during the preceding year.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That appears to me to limit the obligation of the company to make a contribution to this new fund corresponding to the contributions made, through the 1/- per week payment, by the beneficiaries under the scheme.  In so far as that may mean one of three things, that the fund may be insufficient to pay the pensions, that the pensions themselves may have to be reduced, or that the workers' contributions may have to be increased, I am anxious to get from the Minister a declaration as to whether it is, in fact, intended to effect in that pension scheme the change authorised by Section 7 of this Order.</P>
    <P>The statement made by the Minister to the effect that Córas Iompair Éireann failed to make contributions due by it to the pensions fund in respect of 1945 and 1946 has been admitted by the Minister for Finance to be incorrect.  It is true that in 1947 the company's revenue was insufficient to cover its outgoings. Its accounts for that year set out the charges against its revenue, and it is because of these charges&mdash;the amount which it had to pay in interest and dividends upon certain minor stocks to which it is not necessary to refer and in respect of pensions and in respect of debenture interest&mdash;and because they had not got the money to pay these things that the company's accounts showed a deficit for that year.</P>
    <P>Of course, the amount was a liability of the company, and at any time the company could have met that liability under the terms of the 1944 Act by the issue of debenture stock and the raising of new capital.  That would have been completely justifiable on the grounds of sound financial practice &mdash;to have issued debenture stock for that purpose.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1948" /> It is not true, as the Minister for Finance has suggested, that the board's power to issue debentures to raise cash for any purpose, apart from expenditure upon permanent assets, was due to an oversight in the drafting of the Act.  Not merely was it not an oversight, but I produced an amendment to this Bill to bring the relevant section of it into line with the section of the 1944 Act.  I admit that I did that without knowing&mdash;because nobody knew&mdash;that the Government intended to adopt the policy of subsidising at the expense of the taxpayer.  The fact is that this board, if set up on the lines of the original Bill, would have no means of meeting losses.  I intended to ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce what would happen in the future if the company was making losses and to emphasise to him the need for having some provision in the Bill which would enable the company in such circumstances to continue. I will admit now that, as the taxpayer is going to be salted to meet the inevitable losses, a similar provision is not necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We contemplated, undoubtedly, in framing the 1944 Act that, in the special circumstances of the war period and the unknown difficulties of the post-war years, Córas Iompair Éireann might make an occasional loss. We intended that such a loss should be charged against capital in the confidence that the company would eventually be able to recover its position and meet the higher capital liabilities created.  If that hope had not been realised, and no one can say now whether it would have been, because 1948 and 1949 were the crucial years, we would have had to come back to the Dáil and propose amending legislation. The Minister's attitude is, I take it, that this company can never make a profit.  There is no point, therefore, in <Col N="1949" /> dealing with a temporary loss, due to abnormal circumstances, by incurring capital liabilities because there is no hope of the company ever being able to meet the interest charges or to redeem the liability.  All the financial problems of Córas Iompair Éireann, which have now been relieved by the Supplementary Estimate adopted by the Dáil last week, arose in 1948 and 1949, and occurred because of the indecision, to put it at its mildest, of the Minister over a large part of that period.  They were incurred because of the refusal of the Minister to take the right decision when that decision could have saved the company.  If that is so, and if the Minister will admit that it is so, I am prepared to get down with him to deal with this Bill on its merits, and to make constructive suggestions and proposals on every section where they occur to me. If, however, we are going to have another attempt to shove off his responsibilities on to my shoulders then, naturally enough, I will defend myself.</P>

      <P>The last few words spoken by Deputy Lemass in regard to his approach to this Bill fill me with some hope that he will, notwithstanding his threat, contribute everything he can to help make this a sound Bill so that the amount which the taxpayer will have to contribute under it in the immediate future will be reduced to the minimum.  As I said on an earlier stage of the Bill, I am not one who objects to capital expenditure.  I think that capital expenditure, if it is judicious, is very essential.  We cannot go on living on the things that were done in the past.  It is essential that we provide for the future by proper capital expenditure now.  For that reason, I regret that there has been what I consider to be too much cold water thrown on these projects that entail capital expenditure.  After all, these railways were built almost 100 years ago.  They were very expensive items, but, nevertheless, the <Col N="1950" /> people in those days faced up to the enormous capital expenditure that was involved in their provision.  I think that the people of those days had a greater vision of the future than we have to-day.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to follow this debate into all the byways traversed by Deputy Lemass and by the two Ministers who have spoken.  I am glad to know that both the Minister for Finance and Deputy Lemass devoted a considerable portion of their contributions to the question of Store Street.  The Minister for Finance indicated that it is proposed that the Store Street premises will be acquired by the Department of Social Welfare. That Department may find, and I hope will find, very suitable office accommodation above the first storey of the Store Street premises, but I think that, by no stretch of the imagination, would the basement, and certainly not the ground floor, be suitable for that Department.</P>
      <P>That ground flour has been specially designed and built as a bus terminus, with all the amenities necessary for passengers and, consequently, to close down this particular part of that building that has been designed as a terminus for the bus travelling public is, in my view, a grave mistake.  I understand from people who are competent to speak on the matter that this building in Store Street is one of the finest examples in the world of a mass concrete building.  I understand that engineers and architects from all over Europe are travelling to see it and that those people regard Dublin with envy for having such a magnificent building.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking about the building and what architects think of it and its design.  Deputy <Col N="1951" /> Lemass has made the point that the people in Dublin are very much concerned about this matter, and rightly so.  Right through the whole of the winter in the rain, snow and slush, there are bus travellers from all parts of Ireland under that iron structure that they have along the quays, and while it is bad in the winter, it is equally bad in the summer when the stench of the Liffey is noticeable.</P>
      <P>Smithfield as an alternative site is not suitable and one of the reasons it is not suitable has been mentioned by Deputy Lemass.  That is, that the provision of a central bus station in Smithfield will create a new problem for Dublin transport.  People who travel there will have to get buses to take them to the centre of the city, and when they want to go back to Smithfield from the centre of the city, they will have to take more buses to bring them back.  No such difficulty arises in relation to Store Street, because it is situated on the route of several bus lines; it is convenient to the centre of the city and to all the bus services that travel to all parts of the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite possible, with a little imagination in the use of Store Street, that accommodation could be found, even on the ground floor of the building, for the Aer Lingus offices that are now scattered all over the city.  Then you would have Amiens Street station, the bus station and offices for Aer Lingus all in the one area, and passengers travelling from any part of Ireland could change to city bus services or Aer Lingus buses which would take them to the planes at Collinstown. They can have those amenities that have already been mentioned.  They can have a rest room and a place where they can have a cup of tea.  In other words, every convenience and every amenity will be available in a building on which a considerable amount of money has been spent.  The Minister for Finance said it would cost another £700,000 or £800,000 to complete it, but that money will have to be spent on it whether it is to be used as a bus depot or as offices for the Department of Social Welfare.  I think that, with a reasonable arrangement between Córas <Col N="1952" /> Iompair Éireann and the Department of Social Welfare, the Department could have the office accommodation and Córas Iompair Éireann could have the ground floor portion as a bus depot.  If the Minister does not want to bring the offices of Córas Iompair Éireann into one central place, and if the present manager thinks that is not necessary, then there will be available in the building very ample office accommodation that may be used by the Department of Social Welfare.  But to hand over to the Department portion of a building that has been exclusively designed as a bus depôt and that is unsuitable for offices, appears to me to be a great waste.</P>
    <P>We have in this debate concerned ourselves with the extravagance of Córas Iompair Éireann, with the fact that they are bankrupt, and now we proceed to do something that will lead to greater waste in the future.  I am glad the Minister for Finance has opened up the discussion on Store Street.  I am glad Deputy Lemass has spoken.  To the Bill which will soon be before the House on the Committee Stage and which, I hope, will be dealt with before Christmas, there will be an amendment submitted for the utilisation of the Store Street premises as a bus depot.  I hope that between now and that stage Deputies will give consideration to all the problems that are involved.</P>
    <P>I have heard this building described as a sky-scraper.  It is not; it is very far from being a sky-scraper.  It is one of the very few buildings that, in 27 years of native Government, has been erected in the City of Dublin. The buildings we show to visitors, the buildings we are proud of, have been built, not under a native Government, but under a foreign Government.  This is one of the few examples of a new style of architecture that has made a great impression on distinguished architects from abroad.  This construction is almost completed.  Are we now to turn it into a folly or a gazebo? I hope that commonsense will compel Deputies, irrespective of Party affiliations, to look at the matter from the practical point of view that this building, designed as a bus station, should be used for that purpose.  The Minister <Col N="1953" /> for Finance says that a suitable bus station can be built at Smithfield for something less than £250,000.  I understood that plans had been prepared and subsequently scrapped for such a bus station, but that subsequently the architects were instructed to go ahead with the erection of a sort of super hayshed in Smithfield for the accommodation of bus travellers.  That may possibly prove to be a great waste of money.  The building may prove to be unsuitable, unsightly and useless.  I think that people travelling to Dublin should see on arrival some part of Dublin that is worth seeing.  To disembark passengers at Smithfield will not give them a correct impression of this city.  I think that is a serious objection to the proposed bus station there.  I ask Deputies to think seriously between now and the discussion on the amendment of the undesirability of throwing over Store Street in favour of Smithfield.  When will this new premises be ready?</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance and Deputy Lemass dealt with it at great length.  I shall finish on that note.  Córas Iompair Éireann is now being subsidised to the extent of £4,019,000.  I understand that for a number of years to come this concern will have to be subsidised.  Possibly the sum required next year will be in the region of £1,000,000 or £1,500,000. It is essential that Córas Iompair Éireann should provide facilities for its passengers by rail or bus.  That being so, it is also their duty to provide a suitable bus station at the earliest possible moment.  Store Street is a suitable premises and I think the Minister should use the accomodation that is available.  This building must not be thrown over merely for the sake of <Col N="1954" /> saving something from the wreck of Córas Iompair Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that the attitude in which one approaches the problem of our national transport will determine to a very large extent the opinions which one may hold.  If, for example, on the introduction of legislation the Minister in charge is in an optimistic frame of mind and looks forward with confidence to the enterprise entering upon a prosperous era, it may be a serious disappointment later on if such anticipations are not fulfilled and if substantial losses have to be met.  At any rate we have had the position that we did not have to pay for these losses because we had not foreseen them. Apparently, a great deal of the criticism in connection with these losses arises, if not from perversity, from a lack of appreciation of the difficulties that were there or a pretended disappointment with a concern which so many, even of the present Government, have described as bankrupt and in a position where the taxpayer has to come in to subsidise it.  We have had this change in the situation that, far from looking forward to an era of making ends meet, let alone profitmaking, we are told that for some years to come we are likely to have losses and that those losses will have to be met by Estimates introduced annually by the Minister for Industry and Commerce. Perhaps that is a more realistic approach, but it seems to me that the Dáil is faced with the situation that, immediately the Government presents it with a bill for £4,000,000, the Minister for Industry and Commerce announces for the first time that he foresees, although he confidently expects the demand will be of a diminishing nature, that demands will be made for some years to come.  It does not seem as if the taxpayers' side of the transaction was being safeguarded in the way one would expect, if Dáil Éireann, in the long run, is to be the trustee of the national expenditure and the main watchdog of seeing that the public and the taxpaying community get value for the moneys expended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whatever the Ministers may say about the effect which the present measure will have on the control <Col N="1955" /> which Dáil Éireann will be enabled to exercise, through the Minister, over the company, we all know that what is going to happen is that the Minister of whatever Government may be in office for the time being is going to present his annual estimate for losses and, after some discussion which may be serious or otherwise, that, in the long run, so long as he has a majority, it is a <i>fait accompli</i> and that the money is going to be granted.</P>
    <P>Up to the present Dáil Éireann had, in large measure, only to deal with the provision of finances for the running of the ordinary State services.  In this particular instance, we are going a step further.  We are having now a very large, well-organised service with a very large personnel on the pay roll &mdash;very well organised, as the Minister for Finance reminded us&mdash;and we are going to be responsible for that undertaking in a way that had not hitherto been the case.  Therefore, I think that before coming to the Dáil for such large sums of money and before asking us to give powers to enable capital to be raised, moneys paid from the Central Fund, and annual subsidies granted, as will be the case when this legislation goes through, the Minister should have outlined some of the steps he was taking to see that so far as the organisation and conduct of the company was concerned the taxpayers' interests would be safeguarded.</P>
    <P>From time to time remarks have been made in this House, even by the Minister for Finance himself, about the profit motive&mdash;casting a certain obloquy on that very valuable perquisite of human nature.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has told us that profit making should not be the first concern of this undertaking. Perhaps that is correct.  It should not be the first concern but should it not be a concern, as the Minister has laid down in his Bill, of the undertaking to try and pay its way?  Further, if it does not make a profit and if those theorists whom for the time being I hope the Minister has abandoned, who believe there should be no profit or no profit motive, had their way, what is to be the criterion?  If the Dublin Gas <Col N="1956" /> Company or the Electricity Supply Board or Córas Iompair Éireann, did not run their businesses satisfactorily, if they are not able to make a profit, whatever transformation may take place in the system of control of these companies, in what way are the consumers going to benefit?  Is there any great danger that the consumer will have to pay?  We know that if, in order to meet the difficulties of this concern, the consumer were asked to pay by way of increased charges, he would make himself felt and most effectively felt in the present instance because, far from being persuaded to give his support to the undertaking, to give them his business, he would go elsewhere&mdash;so long as private undertakings are in operation he would transfer his business elsewhere, so the sanction that can be put on the consumer in this particular instance is not as effective as the sanction which, let us suppose, the Electricity Supply Board can put upon us if we do not fall in with their policy.  Therefore, you have not the sanction of the consumer in this case.  The consumer may escape unless the legislation is tightened up in a way the Minister has not explained to us.</P>
    <P>A big step forward that has been made and is being made under the present proposal is that it is being clearly recognised and stated by the Minister for Finance as well as by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that this is a losing concern.  They have not been able to give any anticipation of when it may be able to make ends meet and, so far as I can see, while the Ministers may safeguard themselves by saying: &ldquo;We are only providing for the opening years of the new board's operations&rdquo; this state of affairs may go on and if the experience of nationalisation in other countries is any criterion, it is going to be a permanent position.  We shall not have the satisfaction, because we could never have that position in this House, of examining in detail the operations of the concern.  We shall have, when the critical decisions are being come to, to leave these matters in the hands of the board.  The Minister has not taken upon himself to give even directives or <Col N="1957" /> information to the House as to the effect he thinks the proposals for economies would have.  The proposals in the Milne Report must be examined and considered.  We have to bear in mind that the losses the company is making are in the region of £1,000,000 per year&mdash;that is, about £21,000 per week.  The present year should have been, I think, a reasonably good one and the circumstances were very favourable so far as travel is concerned. Nevertheless, the Minister tells us that the anticipated loss will be £1,078,000. According to the Milne Report, they foresaw that the loss would be about £850,000 a year before interest charges were met.  If the task is put upon the new board of trying to pay its way and meeting those charges, then we shall have to add to the £850,000 a further sum of almost £500,000.  That would come to £1,350,000, of which some £600,000, we are told&mdash;whether that is what is being received annually or not, I am not in a position to say&mdash;has been taken in by virtue of increased fares.  That would still leave a sum of some £750,000 per year which would have to be met, unless certain steps are taken.</P>
    <P>Anybody listening to the Minister for Finance must have the gravest doubts indeed as to whether, with his knowledge and experience of this problem and the statement that he made for us to-day, there is a likelihood that this increased traffic that is spoken of car be secured for the company unless steps are going to be taken that we have heard nothing about so far.  Certainly, there is nothing in the measure and there is nothing in the statements we have heard from Ministers to indicate that this deficit of some £750,000 can, or will in their view, be made up in some way by increased efforts on the company's part to secure traffic.</P>
    <P>We have had reference to the question of superannuation.  It seems to me, with some experience of this question of funds, that while from the accounting point of view it would, no doubt, be good policy&mdash;and I think it would probably be better from the point of view of conservative financial procedure&mdash;to have a fund, there is no <Col N="1958" /> reason why, if the company were in a reasonable condition to carry on and meet its normal obligations, it should not meet the superannuation charges through its revenue in the ordinary way.  I should like to ask the Minister, apart from what has happened up to the present in regard to these funds, what provision will, in fact, be made. There was a difficulty in the past&mdash;I remember we had a good deal of discussion about it on the 1944 Act&mdash;in meeting the superannuation charges. The Labour Deputies were naturally particularly interested in that matter. If the wages and salaries bill has increased from £4,000,000 in 1945 to £6,500,000 roughly in the present year, how will that affect the finances of the company?  Will there be extra contributions paid into these funds or will it simply mean that in the long run, as happens in other cases, increased subventions will have to be made from the Exchequer, seeing that extra traffic is not likely, and the additional contributions that would have to be paid by the men would be out of all proportion and could not be justified?</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass touched on the question of whether, in taking over this concern, we are prepared to liquidate it or to develop it.  The Minister for Finance has naturally taken a very conservative attitude but if his remarks about the Store Street building are any indication of his general position, it would look as if he had set himself rather rigidly against capital expenditure.  I think that if we are going into this business and taking over the concern, we shall have to examine carefully the question whether, if we are going to put it in a position to pay its way and enable the board to carry on and to meet the heavy responsibilities imposed on them, the country will not have to provide a very substantial amount of capital to at least the sums mentioned by Sir James Milne in his report.  I think that a discussion of this kind also gives one an opportunity to put on record one's feeling that the talk that one hears, that you can have better conditions of employment in an enterprise of this magnitude, giving everybody a better time and at the same time have more efficiency and better services all round, <Col N="1959" /> is extremely difficult to understand.  It would seem that those who put forward that point of view&mdash; it has been put forward in the past but I have not heard it on this occasion&mdash;have not gone very carefully into it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking&mdash;I hope I am not out of order&mdash;whether if we are going to have better conditions of employment and at the same time try to give a more effective and a cheaper service to the public, somebody is not going to have to pay.  It is quite clear, it seems to me, that the consumer is not going to be asked to pay because, as I have said, he has his method of evasion.  So far as the present legislation goes, it will be difficult to get him into the net and therefore we come back to the taxpayer, and if we are defending the taxpayer, as I think is our duty&mdash;we will not have an opportunity probably again for a considerable time&mdash;we have to ask the Minister to go carefully into the questions which this report, which presumably is the foundation of Government policy in regard to transport, has recommended should be examined&mdash;the question, for example, of maintenance costs and overheads.  If we were dealing with an ordinary productive enterprise which had been taken over, there would always be the question of putting in better and more up-to-date machinery and of reaching a higher output and in that way making up for the additional capital expenditure that was necessary. In that way also you could, of course, while being fair to the consumer, give better conditions of employment and greatly improve the standards of your employees, but in this particular case, since the success, from the financial point of view, of the enterprise must in the long run depend on the amount of traffic you get, we are faced with the key problem as to the measures that are going to be taken to secure that traffic for it.  It seems to me that we are going to be in for a painful process of education in economic matters under these large schemes of nationalisation <Col N="1960" /> and otherwise.  We shall probably have to undergo the same type of education that for a long period we had to go through in connection with ordinary democratic affairs.  We are now carrying over democratic society into economic affairs and we are going to learn painfully that you cannot have your cake and eat it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister concludes I should like to ask him one or two questions.  With regard to the expenditure of capital money on railways, would he say whether the Government will not take a hand where the expenditure is bound up with big questions of national policy?  I am impelled to put this inquiry because of something that happened in the West of Ireland quite a number of years ago. A number of people started publicising the project about the establishment of a transatlantic port at Galway.  It got a good deal of attention and in fact the head of the Government of the day took a hand in the propaganda end of it.  It did not get beyond the propaganda stage, but shortly afterwards &mdash;as a direct consequence of the propaganda about a transatlantic port, it was generally believed in the West of Ireland&mdash;the main line between Dublin and Galway was singled.  That was interpreted in the West of Ireland as being an attempt on the part of the type of directors we had at the time to sabotage anything that would displace Liverpool.  That was a question in which the Government of the day should have taken a hand, but the Minister for Industry and Commerce was not sympathetic to any representations that were made to him regarding the singling of the railway line.  He accepted the word of the railway directors that the line was not paying and he was not going to interfere with the reorganisation of railway services.  He held that that would be tantamount to nationalisation, and his Government did not approve of it.  The deputation had to be satisfied with the promise that the substitute services would be as good as were formerly provided.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately that is what we are now trying to do, and I cannot say I have got very much help from the other side of the House because the attempt has been made deliberately to place on my shoulders and on the shoulders of this Government full and entire responsibility for the position which obtains in the public transport system of to-day.  This debate was initiated on Thursday last by Deputy Lemass in his first speech on the Resolution.  We had another one from him to-day with which I will deal later.  I am sorry that Deputy Lemass is not in the House at the moment because I would prefer to say the things I propose to say to his face and in his presence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lemass opened his speech on this&mdash;and may I refresh the mind of Deputy Childers on this in view of the appeal he was making over the week-end as to the atmosphere in which it should be discussed&mdash;by accusing me of being deliberately dishonest in my presentation of this matter to the House.  He accused me of deliberately trying to mislead the House, of deliberately trying to misrepresent the position and of deliberately trying to distort the facts.  He went further and he said that the figures which I had quoted relating to the proposed capital <Col N="1962" /> expenditure of the ex-chairman and his board of directors, amounting to £17,250,000, did not exist except in my imagination; that these figures which I had given here in detail and which amounted to £17,250,000 were an invention of mine, a fabrication brought in here by me deliberately for the purpose of misleading the members of this House and the public outside.  The regulations of this House, sir, debar me from describing that statement of Deputy Lemass's in the only way in which it should fittingly be described. Every figure under every sub-head totalling to that £17,250,000 was given by the ex-chairman, Mr. Reynolds, who was appointed by Deputy Lemass, to the officers of my Department and was given by the officers of my Department to me.  I go further and I say that Deputy Lemass knew that. I challenged him on Thursday when he made that statement as to whether he had asked his friend, the ex-chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann, whether in fact those were his, Mr. Reynolds's, figures.  He said he had not.  I did not believe that statement of his and I doubt if anybody else did. The figures are here and not in my imagination.  They were presented to my Department by Mr. Reynolds and I now challenge Deputy Lemass&mdash;or would if he were here&mdash;to say whether over the week-end he has visited Mr. Reynolds and asked Mr. Reynolds whether the figures I quoted and gave to the House were the figures which Mr. Reynolds gave to the Department of Industry and Commerce.  I go further and here publicly challenge Mr. Reynolds himself through this House whether he is prepared to dispute any single figure which I read out here and whether he is prepared to say that he did not cause those figures to be delivered to the officers of my Department.  That was one statement of Deputy Lemass's.  I have not finished with it yet, I will come back to it.</P>
    <P>The second statement he made and repeated was that there was no such thing as a pension or superannuation fund in connection with this transport company and no such thing as trustees. He asserted that.  He became quite truculent about it.  Of course he is <Col N="1963" /> never more truculent than when he is furthest away from the truth.  He repeated over and over again across the House that there were no pension or superannuation funds and that there were no trustees.  He was completely exposed and discredited on that front to-day by the Minister for Finance and he did not even try in his second speech this afternoon to controvert what the Minister for Finance had said.  Then he had a bit of his usual juggling with millions of pounds.  He should be fairly skilful at that because he has been juggling with millions for quite a number of years.</P>
    <P>We got a whole lot of it set out in headlines for us the following morning in the organ known as &ldquo;Truth in the News&rdquo;.

Both those statements were untrue, and untrue to the knowledge of the man who made the statements.  Further down, in the same issue of the paper: &ldquo;Córas Iompair Éireann now authorised to spend £13,000,000.&rdquo;  Another falsehood&mdash;completely and absolutely false &mdash;asserted here by Deputy Lemass for two reasons and two reasons only&mdash; one, for the purpose of trying to mislead the members of this House and, secondly, so that those lying headlines could be put in the following day's issue of the <i>Irish Press</i>, in the knowledge that 95 per cent. of the people who read that rag read nothing else and had no way of checking the statement which appeared in it.

      <P>On Section 2, which <Col N="1964" /> is the operative section of the Bill I assume that we would be entitled to discuss everything that it is proposed to continue under the Bill.  I do not propose, however, to open the debate upon quite so wide a front as that.  I am hopeful, from the moderate and considerate reply from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Second Reading of the debate, that it may be only necessary for me to draw his attention to some of the things that are enshrined or embodied in the Supplies and Services Act of 1946, for him to give the House an assurance that the powers which were thought necessary in 1942&mdash;and which were continued in 1946, because we were not at that period out of the wood of the European war&mdash;will not be exercised in the manner in which heretofore has been the practice.</P>
      <P>Under the Supplies and Services Act, 1946, certain things were done which the House agreed were justifiably done in the circumstances of that time.  Among them, Section 3 continued a great number of Orders which were made before 18th June, 1946, and were in force immediately before the operative date.  I am concerned with one Order, the Order No. 173 of 1942.  This is not a Principal Order, it is not a fundamental Order; but it does significantly and drastically amend what was the basic Order made under the Emergency Powers Act of 1939.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies who were in the House at the outbreak of the great war which began in September, 1939, will remember that the Oireachtas, abrogating many of the safeguards of the Constitution, gave to the Government of the day powers which were universally admitted to be necessary to deal with a very perilous and extraordinary situation. But though these powers were given in the widest measure&mdash;perhaps with reservations, mental reservations, on the part of those who conferred them and of those who were the recipients of them&mdash;nevertheless, when the powers were conferred, the Government of that time were particularly careful, in drafting this Emergency Powers Order, 1939&mdash;which is No. 224 of the Statutory Rules and Orders of that year&mdash;to state certain specific limitations within which it declared, <Col N="1965" /> in effect, that the powers which had been given to it by the House would be exercised.</P>
    <P>In that connection, I think it is highly important for the House and the general public to bear in mind the fundamental reasons why the great powers which were taken under Part VI of this Order were felt to be necessary and the conditions in which and the purposes for which it was felt that these powers should be exercised. Article 31, paragraph 1, of the Emergency Powers Order, 1939, begins with a recital of the conditions under which these powers relating to essential supplies and services are to be exercised. It says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A Minister, so far as appears to him to be necessary in the interests of the public safety or the preservation of the State, or for maintaining supplies and services essential to the life of the community, may by Order provide&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>for a great number of things, including:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;for regulating the production, treatment, keeping, storage, movement, transport, distribution, sale, purchase, use or consumption of essential articles....</P>
    <P>for regulating, restricting or prohibiting the importation or exportation of essential articles;</P>
    <P>for regulating the carrying on of any undertaking engaged in essential work....</P>
    <P>for regulating, restricting, or prohibiting the production... distribution or sale of articles other than essential articles;&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It will be quite clear from the summary which I have given of the opening paragraph and sub-paragraphs of Article 31 that what the Legislature had definitely in mind was to regulate and control, in the interests of the public safety, for the preservation of the State and for the maintenance of supplies and services essential to the life of the community, the production and distribution of commodities and that these commodities were not commodities <Col N="1966" /> merely of ordinary commerce or traffic but commodities without which the State might not be preserved, the interests of the public safety might be endangered or the essential life of the community might not be carried on.</P>
    <P>I do not think that anybody will contend that in the circumstances of the time and in the circumstances as they persisted during the period from 1939 until rather recently, the need for wide reaching powers of this sort applicable to commodities of the essential character which the Order specifies were not necessary and should not be unreservedly granted.</P>
    <P>The Emergency Powers Order, 1939, was drastically amended by Emergency Powers Order No. 173 of 1942.  I concede it was amended in a way which conferred upon the Minister quite an arbitrary power by contrast with the wide but, nevertheless, regulated powers which the Order of 1939 conferred upon the Minister.  Under Article 2 of Emergency Powers Order No. 173, Article 31 of the 1939 Order is amended by the substitution of certain new paragraphs for paragraph (1) of the 1939 Order.  That is to say&mdash;the Order goes on to recite&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;the Minister may by Order or direction, (which direction may be given either in writing or orally) provide&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would like to draw the attention of the House to the contrast between the Order of 1939 and the Order of 1942, and I should like to say here that I was a member of the Administration which was responsible for Order No. 173.  The House, in common with the Government of the day, thought that the almost arbitrary powers conferred by the Order of 1942 were essential and were justifiably given.  There was no challenge to this Order.  It was made, as Deputies are well aware, when war was raging all round us, when war was being waged against the State even inside our own territory.  It was made at a time of general hardship and general peril, when the safety of the State was in the gravest danger, not only from hostile influence abroad, but from&mdash;let us face it quite frankly&mdash; the forces of disorder at home.</P>

There are no hostilities, active and open, now being waged in Europe.  There is no submarine warfare.  There is no aerial warfare directed either against this country or the neighbouring State.

      <P>The Chair can be as arbitrary as it likes.  I have no redress but must bow to the Chair's ruling.</P>
      <P>This Order touches, as I will show, every business in this State.  It is an Order which gives to a Minister the right, by Order or direction, which direction may be given either in writing or orally, to enter and inspect premises used in connection with any undertaking. It is an Order which completely overthrows and destroys the safeguards of the Constitution.  That could be justified in time of war but, as I was pointing out, war has passed.  The &ldquo;vital point of the Order&rdquo; is what is contained in the Order and the relevance of my argument is that these powers, which might as I have said, have been justifiably given when the Order was made&mdash;and it bears on its face the date 1942&mdash;are no longer justified by the circumstances of to-day.</P>
      <P>Consider what this Order permits the Minister to do, not the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the Parliamentary Secretary who represents the Minister for Industry and Commerce and who, on the responsibility of the Minister is asking the House to continue this temporary Supplies and Services Bill.</P>
      <P>This Order recites that</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the Minister may by Order or direction provide</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  for regulating, restricting or prohibiting the production, treatment, keeping, storage, movement, <Col N="1969" /> transport, distribution, disposal (including sale), acquisition (including sale), use or consumption of articles of any description.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Surely that is a very far-reaching power to give to any Minister.  The Minister for Lands may exercise this power; the Minister for Justice may exercise it; and the Minister for Social Welfare may exercise it.  &ldquo;For regulating, restricting or prohibiting... the disposal&rdquo; and then, in parentheses, are the words &ldquo;including sale&rdquo;, so that the Minister may make an Order under the section regulating the making of gifts&mdash;the transfer, if you like, of a father's tie or his old suit of clothes to his son.  It is all very well for Deputies to laugh, but that is one of the powers given in the Order.  I am going to contend that in the circumstances of to-day these powers are quite unnecessarily wide.</P>
    <P>Sub-paragraph (b) of the Order reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;For controlling the prices at which articles of any description may be sold or purchased.&rdquo;</P>

Under that sub-paragraph, without any restriction or limitation whatever, a Minister&mdash;not the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who, under the Ministers and Secretaries Acts, has specific functions in relation to the distribution and exchange of the ordinary articles of trade and commerce, but any Minister &mdash;may come along and make this Order, and the Order is unchallengeable virtually. I think it was the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance who asked me if I was against it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am against it for this reason also, that there are on the Statute Book of this State two Acts relating to the control of prices, under which there is a Prices Commission and a Controller of Prices.  In the circumstances existing to-day, when we are told that supplies are flowing in freely and that in regard to many commodities there is not a scarcity but a surplus, an exportable surplus which it is anticipated will increase, there does not appear to me to be any justification for going outside the well-considered law of the land.  These two statutes were debated at length in the House on Second Reading when the general principle of prices control was accepted, and, on Committee and Report Stages, when the application of that principle was examined in detail, with an eye not only to the interests of the producers, but the interests of the consumers.  In the circumstances of to-day, I cannot see any justification for continuing the wide and, let me repeat, arbitrary powers which were conferred as a war-time measure in a time of great peril upon Ministers in 1942.</P>
      <P>Sub-paragraph (c) of sub-paragraph (1) says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;For regulating, restricting or prohibiting the importation or exportation of articles of any description.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all anxious that there should be a large measure of freedom, the greatest possible practical measure of freedom, restored to international trade.  I have read with great interest the many speeches which the Minister for External Affairs has made advocating the removal of all unnecessary restrictions upon international trade.  Surely it is inconsistent with the eloquent pleas made by that Minister on behalf of this freedom of intercourse and freedom of exchange as between peoples and nations that the Government of which he is a member should propose to continue, as part of the statute law of this land, an Order which confers on the Minister for External Affairs or any other Minister the power to regulate, <Col N="1971" /> restrict or prohibit the importation or exportation of articles of any description.  It is unfair of the Government to ask the House to continue these restrictive powers in force, while, at the same time, the Minister for External Affairs has occupied the limelight in Paris and elsewhere&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;as an advocate of universal and general freedom of trade.  I say that it is unfair to the Minister and it is certainly inconsistent. It is unfair to him because any person who reads this article, or any person to whose attention the article is brought, must immediately conclude that when these speeches were made, the Minister made them with his tongue in his cheek.  I do not believe that.  I think the Minister is very anxious to restore as large a measure of free trade as he possibly can, and I think that he should get some practical support from the other members of the Cabinet, to enable him to maintain the position he has taken up in Europe in relation to the matter by the repeal of Emergency Powers Order No. 173.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sub-paragraph (d) of this Order provides for regulating the carrying on of any undertaking and, in particular, for controlling the charges which are being made by undertakers in respect of the doing of any work by them.  &ldquo;Any undertaking&rdquo;, not merely a transport undertaking&rdquo;, not merely a public utility undertaking like the gas company or the Electricity Supply Board, but any undertaking.  Under this, the Minister would have power&mdash;it might be a useful power to have on occasions if you were a betting man&mdash;to regulate the odds that a bookmaker might lay in certain circumstances.  It might be a useful power to have if you were a betting man and were making a winning bet.  But, is there any justification for conferring that power upon a Minister in these days?  Under this sub-paragraph, if I or any other Deputy, were running, say, a hair-dresser's establishment, the Minister could make an Order regulating the charge which the hairdresser would make, say, for attending to Deputy <Col N="1972" /> Davin's tonsure or looking after my own.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I take more trouble with it.  If I felt it necessary to run a photographer's establishment, and if Deputy Donnellan were to come in as a client, under this Order the Minister could regulate the fee which I would charge Deputy Donnellan, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, for a sitting.  I am quite jocose about these things, but if I am poking a little fun at others as well as myself, it is merely to show how ridiculous it is that, in the circumstances of the present day, we should have an Order so far-reaching as that in existence.  Remember that this power to regulate the carrying on of any undertaking and controlling the charges may be exercised by the Minister either orally or in writing.  Therefore, it is possible for a person to act without the Minister having any very clear, specific knowledge that he did give a direction orally.  If the Order were to be challenged some years after the Minister gave the direction, or if the Minister were no longer available, under this Order there might be no record that such a direction had, in fact, been given.  Things might be done under this Order&mdash;no doubt to some extent they would perhaps be remedied or the evil might be later limited as soon as the abuse of the power was exposed&mdash;in respect of which no direction of any kind or sort had been given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What else may be done under the Order?  Sub-paragraph (g) may enable the Minister to give a direction&mdash; because the power is exercisable either by Order or direction and legally there is a great difference between the two &mdash;for the production of books, accounts, records and documents relating to an undertaking by persons carrying on or employed in connection with such undertaking.  Therefore, the employee of any businessman in this State, the employee of any farmer, a member of any family carrying on a family business under this Order, as it stands, might be required&mdash;I do not say he will be, but he may be&mdash;to act as a sort <Col N="1973" /> of snooper on his employer or on the head of his own family.  Let me say that I have no knowledge that such a thing has been done.  I do not know of any employee who has been asked to give this information.  Nevertheless, that arbitrary power has been conferred on the Minister by this Order in the circumstances as they existed in 1942 and as they do not exist to-day. Whatever justification there may have been for conferring this power in 1942&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Or in 1946 or 1947&mdash; there is no justification for continuing this power in force at the end of 1949 and the beginning of 1950; for the only justification for conferring this power was that, if it were not conferred, the public safety would be endangered, the life of the State might not be preserved, or that supplies and services essential to the life of the community might fail.  The whole argument that we have heard from Government platforms in recent years is that things have got back to normal, that there has been a considerable improvement in the condition of affairs since the end of 1947.  That is what Deputy O'Higgins has been telling us and what the Taoiseach has been telling us.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy likes, since the end of the winter of 1947. That has been the catch-cry of the Coalition Parties since they took office: that things have generally improved, and no one is going to deny that things have generally improved.  The only thing we deny is that the improvement is unique and confined to this country. It has been a general world improvement. So far as essential supplies have been forthcoming, it is now much easier to maintain essential services. Anybody who was abroad in 1945 or 1946, and who was abroad this year, knows how great and how vast the improvement has been in conditions on the Continent.  They are incomparably greater than the improvement has been in this country, incomparably greater because there was less <Col N="1974" /> room for improvement here than there was in any continental country.  But, however, conceding the arguments of the Coalition that conditions have improved in the last two years &ldquo;until now, as they say,&rdquo; we have plenty of bread, we have plenty of tea, we have plenty of sugar, we have sufficient coal to run our railways&mdash;our electricity supply presents a problem&mdash;but in so far as the ordinary everyday things in common use are concerned, they are in reasonably plentiful supply.  Why, therefore, is it necessary in these circumstances to maintain an Order of this arbitrary character imperilling the liberty of every citizen and the fundamental rights of every family, not to speak of every business?</P>
      <P>What else does this Order provide? Sub-paragraph (h) provides:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;For the inspection of and taking extracts from books, accounts, records and documents kept by persons carrying on any undertaking, and the verification, by persons carrying on, or employed in connection with, any undertaking, of extracts from any books, accounts, records or documents kept by the persons carrying on such undertaking.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Is there any justification for that power now?  Does any Deputy know of any particular business, or any particular shop, in respect of which it is necessary that the employee should be compelled&mdash;because that is what this means&mdash;to give evidence against his employer, and to verify that books, accounts and documents, and extracts from these are, in fact, related to the business in which he is employed?  Is there any single Deputy able to get up and say: &ldquo;I know a particular business undertaking in respect of which at the present time that arbitrary power of compelling a person to disclose the confidence of his employer is essential in order to maintain the supplies and services which are necessary for the life of the community or the preservation of the State&rdquo;?</P>
      <P>Sub-paragraph (j) of this Order provides:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;for the entering and inspection of premises used in connection with any undertaking and the examination, <Col N="1975" /> inspection, and taking account of any articles on such premises.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A chemist's shop, or a doctor's surgery, could be entered under this Order if the Minister, or any Minister, gives a direction.  I remember when the Public Health Act was going through this House in 1946 and when we were taking power to enter certain premises in order to ensure that food was processed under hygienic conditions, the uproar that arose on these benches at the mere fact that any person should be given arbitrary power to enter premises in order to see that the food which was being processed on them was being made under conditions that would not endanger the health of the community, or a section of the community. But, here we have in the year 1949, some years later, this power conferring upon the Minister, not in relation to the comparatively limited number of undertakings that are engaged in the preparation of food but in relation to any undertaking, the right of entry.  Take, again, the ice cream parlour, the chiropodist's shop, the doctor's surgery.  Each and every one of these could be entered and account duly taken of any article which might be found on such premises.  The nail file in the chiropodist's shop, the stethoscope in the doctor's surgery, the pot of vanishing cream in the beauty parlour, could be solemnly taken and an account duly filed in the register of the Department of any Minister.</P>
    <P>Again, let me put it, is there any possible justification for continuing in force an article of such wide and far reaching content as this in the circumstances of the present day for the taking of samples or articles found on the premises of persons carrying on any undertaking?  That might be necessary under a Public Health Act.  In that case samples are taken in respect of the public health provisions in relation to milk and butter and under the Food and Drugs Act.  It is admitted that they are necessary, but, mind you, those powers were not given without a great deal of consideration and after prolonged debate, while the exercise of those powers is very carefully restricted and regulated by law.  But here we have, as part of the statute law of this <Col N="1976" /> State at the present time, this comprehensive, omnibus power to enter any premises and take samples of any articles.  It would be an agreeable job to have to do that in a brewery; but, let us look at the facts and ask ourselves again, are we justified in conferring these exceedingly wide powers at the present day on the Executive?</P>
    <P>This House exists as an Assembly of the representatives of the people whose main function it is to ensure that the ordinary rights of the subject are preserved and that nothing is written into the law of the land which is fundamentally inconsistent with the maintenance of the ordinary popular liberties.  Now, it does not matter when these powers are given or exercised.  What does matter is this, that the powers should not be given, that it should not be within the compass of any Minister to exercise powers of such a wide and arbitrary nature, because it may be too late to protest when once these powers have been exercised.  Therefore, the only safeguard the citizens have is that we should be reluctant to concede exceptional powers and, when the exceptional powers have been conceded, we should be impatient to secure their surrender on the part of the Executive.</P>
    <P>I am not reading all these sub-paragraphs, but I will read sub-paragraph (n):</P>
    <P>&ldquo;for any incidental and supplementary matters for which such Minister thinks it expedient for the purposes of the Order or direction to provide.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That means the Minister can, in fact, do anything if he thinks it expedient to do it.  I am not going to say that the present Minister for Industry and Commerce or his Parliamentary Secretary would do some of the things to which I have referred.  But that is not the point.  The point is that it should not be in the power of any Minister, whether we think he will abuse these powers or not, to do some of the things which he will be permitted to do under this Order.  That is the real essence of the matter.  Deputies should be as anxious as I am to ensure that these exceptional powers will be terminated at the earliest possible moment.</P>
    <P>I will concede that in relation to some matters there is a need for them. <Col N="1977" /> Perhaps I have gone too far when I say I will concede there is a need for them.  In relation to essential commodities there may be a case even yet for taking exceptional powers to control and regulate manufacture and distribution and perhaps importation.  I am prepared to concede there may be a case for that.  Accordingly, I would not ask the House, even if I thought I would succeed in persuading it, entirely to deprive the Minister of some of the powers he at present exercises under the Supplies and Services (Temporary Provisions) Act.  I think, however, that we should have, as the minimum assurance that is due to the public, an undertaking from the Minister that the powers conferred by this Order will be charily exercised, will be exercised with full consideration and will only be used in relation to the manufacture and distribution of commodities which are undeniably and beyond all doubt essential to the life of the community, the preservation of the State, or the maintenance of public safety.</P>
    <P>I feel that, simply because the machine gained such momentum during the war years, many things have been done under this Order which have not been fully adverted to.  That is, that simply because things were done in the years 1943 and 1944, they have been done in 1949.  Before Section 2 is disposed of I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will say that he will have a thorough review made of all the activities of his Department which are now being carried out under the powers conferred by Order 173 and that he will definitely give a direction, since he has the power to do so, that henceforth the activities of the Department in enforcing this Order will be confined to the manufacture and distribution of goods which are essential to the life of the community, the preservation of the State and are in the interests of public safety.</P>

      <P>With some of the remarks of Deputy MacEntee I can agree, but it is worthy of comment that the Opposition have only recently taken note of particular provisions in some of these Emergency Powers Orders.  Some <Col N="1978" /> of these Orders were made at a time when supplies were scarce and when other difficulties confronted the country. I think the particular case in which the Deputy is interested first came under notice in 1945, when the accounts of a particular firm were requested for examination in the Department. The accounts were submitted and subsequently an application which had been received for increased charges was sanctioned.  The accounts were again requested in 1946 and 1947 and, also, last year.  Up to 1947 the Deputy was a member of the Government that requested the accounts to be presented and at that time, so far as this service was concerned, circumstances were no different from what they are at the moment.</P>
      <P>As regards this particular case, even before the Deputy raised it here, a direction had been given that no action was necessary and that the accounts would not be requested in future.  The powers provided in Emergency Order No. 173 give the Government and any Minister power to control the export or import of any article or commodity.  I think it is only reasonable that powers of that nature should be continued.  I do not think any Deputy would suggest that we should allow the free export of cement, in view of the fact that we are importing it to supplement our home requirements; that we should allow petrol bought with dollars to be exported; that we should allow butter to be exported freely until we have sufficient to meet our home demands; or that we should allow the export of sugar, or machinery purchased with dollars, or any other commodities that we are obliged to purchase abroad with hard-earned currency and that we need to meet our requirements at home.</P>
      <P>It may be that some of the powers in this Order are unnecessarily wide, but I think the House will agree that it would be difficult to amend in detail a number of those Orders.  We had a review in the past year of every Order, and a number of them have been revoked wherever the examination showed that the powers conferred were no longer required.</P>

      <P>It was a review carried out at the direction of the Minister. The nature of the report furnished to the Minister was such that, as I said on the Second Stage, a comprehensive list will shortly be on sale of the Orders revoked.  As Deputies are aware, whenever an Order is revoked, publication of such revocation is always made in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>, and sometimes in the Press.  Some of these Orders have been revoked because they are no longer necessary.  It would probably require more work than the actual amendments effected would warrant to carry out an investigation into the various sub-heads of individual Orders with a view to having them amended; but, in so far as a general review of Orders is concerned, one has been carried out and all Orders no longer required are being revoked.</P>
      <P>The particular powers which this Order conferred and which were used in the particular case are, in so far as a service of this nature is concerned, no longer required.  It is necessary, however, to control exports just as it is necessary to control certain imports. For that reason it is only right to tell the House that these powers should be continued; but I give the House and the Deputy an assurance that in the particular case to which he referred&mdash; and the House will accept my word on this&mdash;there is a note upon the file to the effect that no further action should be taken.  The Government has given careful and anxious consideration to the various Orders still in operation. All Orders no longer required have been revoked and steps are being taken to revoke those which are no longer necessary in present circumstances.</P>

I would like to make it quite clear that was not the reason why I raised this matter. It was only when my attention was particularly directed to it that I appreciated the far-reaching extent of this Order.  In reference to the matters to which he has referred, petrol, butter and cement, I quite agree that it is necessary we should have power to regulate the import or export of these articles.  They are, however, essential to the life of the community.  My only anxiety in relation to the whole of this exceptional legislation is that we should be alert to ensure that as soon as the conditions which make it necessary to have these laws on the Statute Book pass away, whether in part or <i>in globo</i>, we should be earnest in our endeavour to ensure that such exceptional legislation disappears with the disappearance of the circumstances and conditions which called it into being.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  As Deputies are aware this is an annual Bill which does not embody any new principles or relate to any matters of a controversial nature.  It simply proposes to continue for a further year the Acts specified in Parts I and II of the Schedule which would otherwise expire on the 31st December, 1949.  If the House agree that these Acts should be continued, it will be necessary to have this Bill enacted before the end of the present calendar year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The list of Acts being continued includes all the Acts which were continued <Col N="1981" /> for the present year by the Expiring Laws Act, 1948.  The intention is, of course, to replace these measures by permanent legislation when an opportunity arises.  Deputies will remember that the number of Acts listed in the Schedule was much greater some years ago, but from time to time the vast majority of these Acts were replaced by permanent legislation leaving only five to be continued at present.</P>
    <P>The position in regard to the replacement by permanent legislation of the measures on the Schedule is set out in the explanatory memorandum which has been circulated to Deputies.</P>
    <P>As will be apparent, each of these Acts with the exception of the Local Authorities (Combined Purchasing) Act, 1925, is portion of a code scattered through many statutes and their replacement by permanent legislation must necessarily form part of the wider work of consolidation of the various statutes relating to electoral law, housing, or borrowing by local authorities as the case may be.  I can assure the House that there will be no avoidable delay in preparing the necessary permanent legislation in all these cases. The Local Authorities (Combined Purchasing) Act, 1939, which provides for the repeal of the 1925 Act, will be brought into operation as soon as there can be some certainty of continuity of supplies.  The supply position is, of course, improving very considerably from year to year but it would still be difficult for official contractors to guarantee supplies of commodities over a lengthy period.  The new Act could not be fully effective at the present time, but immediately we are satisfied that the circumstances permit of its operation we will bring it into force.</P>
    <P>This particular Bill does not visualise the introduction of any new legislation. It merely proposes to continue five Acts upon which other Acts depend.  It is of a non-contentious nature and I would ask for the House's approval of it.</P>

      <P>Section 65 of the Local Government Act, 1941, relates to temporary <Col N="1982" /> borrowing by local authorities for current expenses.  I take it that is the authority which empowers a local body to seek an overdraft when it is required for carrying on the business of the body concerned.  I regret to say that it has been brought very forcibly to my notice during the present year that at least one of the two county councils in my area has had to go to the bank for an unusually heavy overdraft at a time when more than the same amount of money was due to the local authority by the central authority. I think it is very unfair that rate-payers should be called upon to borrow money from the bank and pay a high rate of interest thereon when their local authority is due very large sums of money from the central authority. This may be a matter for the Minister for Finance, but I would urge the Parliamentary Secretary, since he is in charge of the local authorities, to keep a close check-up on the position and ensure that moneys due by the central authority are paid to the local authorities at the proper time so that rate-payers will not be called upon to pay high rates of interest in order that certain activities can be carried on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that, as this is an Act to continue for a limited period certain expiring enactments, we might consider the justification or need to bring in a Bill of this sort in order to continue these particular enactments. The two which I have particularly in mind are the Parliamentary Elections Act, 1868, and the Corrupt Practices Commissions' Expenses Act, 1869.  The explanatory memorandum states that the two Acts relate to the trial of election petitions and should be continued pending the publication of the electoral law.  I am moved to ask, by reason of the terms of the explanatory memorandum, when any effective steps are going to be taken to codify the electoral law.  When I was responsible for the local government of this country I devoted a great deal of study&mdash;as much, perhaps, as a layman could&mdash;to the position of electoral law in this State.  I came to the conclusion that it was in a state of utter confusion and that it would be quite impossible for a court of this land to determine <Col N="1983" /> what the electoral law was unless it was prepared, itself, to act as a sort of law-making authority.  Because of that, and after a great deal of trouble, I secured the necessary Finance sanction to set up a body of lawyers to review the whole position, to review the whole <i>corpus</i> of law relating not merely to corrupt practices and election petitions but the whole body of the electoral law, with regard to the practices that might be legal and justified in the case of an election.</P>
      <P>The purpose of that was that we should eventually submit to the House as a whole a report setting out the present state of the law and ask both Houses of the Oireachtas to set up a joint committee to consider the problem and to make recommendations for its solution.  The legal committee for this purpose had been appointed.  I do not know whether it still continues to function or not.  From my own personal knowledge of work which was carried by the particular officer in charge of that section of the Department, by reason of the exceedingly limited staff available to him and the many other demands, all of them exceptional, which were from time to time made upon him, I know it would have been impossible within the ordinary resources of the Department for that investigation to be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I consider that it is essential and urgent that we should have this whole question of the position of the law relating to the constitution of this House reviewed as a matter of urgency.  The Acts which are referred to here relate to quite a different system of election, as the Parliamentary Secretary knows. They were enacted before the system of proportional representation was invented. They give the courts no guidance as to what would ensue if an election petition were to be successfully sustained against any member of this House.  In such circumstances, and particularly if the petition ensued upon a general election, would the seat be vacated and would somebody else succeed without having a new election or would there have to be a new election? There is no guidance in the Acts in relation to these two vital matters but there is a whole body of voluminous <Col N="1984" /> files enumerating other doubtful points and also a great deal of deadwood which is embodied in our present electoral code.</P>
    <P>I am raising this matter to try to impress on the House the fact that there is an urgent need for a review of this position.  I hope, since the memorandum states that we are to continue these two Acts in operation pending the codification of the law, that steps are being taken to have the law codified. It is not the sort of task that can be undertaken in a summary fashion. It is not the sort of task that can be completed within a short time.  It is going to need, in the first place, a very careful review of the existing law, a very careful redaction of the existing provisions of the law, so that the joint committee of the Oireachtas, the committee of the two Houses of the Oireachtas which I hope will eventually be set up, might have as clear a picture as it is possible for human learning to lay before them.</P>
    <P>It is in that connection, I may say, that the position is full of anomalies. For example, if my recollection after the passage of two or three years does not mislead me, some part, perhaps not a very important part, of our electoral provisions dates back to the days of Queen Anne.  Others, I think, are largely determined by an Act passed in the reign of George IV, and, of course, Queen Victoria dominates the whole position.  We have had a change of régime here since 1922, that is 27 years.</P>
    <P>Though we have had the Electoral Act of 1923, and other Acts regulating the election to the Seanad, we have never had any comprehensive review of the law by which election to this House is controlled and regulated.  I think that this matter is becoming one of extreme urgency.  We have been lucky enough, perhaps, in this way&mdash; that election petitions, and so forth, have gone out of date.  But there are other things.  There are disqualifications from membership of this House, I think, embodied in some of the Acts. It is time these matters were subject to review.  It is time, first of all, to decide whether we should determine that a person who has been convicted of a serious offence should or should <Col N="1985" /> not be a member of this House.  I think he should not be.  But if we come to that decision I think we should provide ourselves with machinery whereby that fact will be brought to the notice of some officer of the House who will call the attention of the House to it and the House should now, when there is no immediate case in the offing, set up well considered machinery to deal with that situation. It will be too late to deal with a situation of that sort when the event occurs because you will hardly get in such circumstances the right approach. It is unlikely that it will be dealt with in the same calm detached way as it can be dealt with now.  Would we, for instance, say that a person who is certified to be of unsound mind should be a member of this House?  I think most of us would agree that he should not, even though we may have doubts&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Precisely.  Deputies may notice that the Minister for Industry and Commerce and myself have a mutual admiration for each other's sanity.  Further, we may find ourselves faced with the fact that, due to some unfortunate incident, a person may be confined in a mental institution between the date of his nomination and the date of his election, and may be there when he is elected.  If we are agreed that such a person should be incapacitated as a member of this House, how is that going to be brought to the notice of the House itself? There is no machinery at this moment whereby that can be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of other things but I do not want to be too detailed about this matter.  There are a number of disqualifications that may occur to one.  If a person is found guilty of felony or of an act of treason, are we going to admit him to membership? None of these matters has arisen so far, none of them is likely to arise despite the extent to which some members of the House may have been goaded by the legislation which they have to consider.  None of these cases, as I have said, has arisen so <Col N="1986" /> far, but if we are to have them dealt with in an impartial, detached way, keeping only the public interest in mind, they should be dealt with now. I am not pressing the Parliamentary Secretary unduly but I do hope that if we agree to the continuance of these two Acts in force for another year, in the meantime this matter will be revived. I hope it is not dead.  I hope it has not been put on the long finger because it is a matter that, with the passage of time, is becoming increasingly urgent.</P>
    <P>There is just one other matter to which I should like to refer.  On the 26th October, Deputy Lemass asked the Minister for Local Government whether galvanised iron buckets now being supplied under contracts made with the combined purchasing section were of Irish manufacture.  The Minister for Local Government replied: &ldquo;Some are of Irish manufacture and some are not. The reasons for accepting some quotations for supplies which are not of Irish manufacture were (a) absence of quotations for Irish articles or for Irish articles solely; (b) non-compliance with specification in the case of Irish articles and (c) price.&rdquo;  I do not want for a moment to suggest that the section of the Department which deals with the administration of the Combined Purchasing Act would not, if it were humanly possible for them to procure them, insist upon articles only of Irish manufacture being used.  I know from personal experience what is the attitude of the officers administering that section.  I had experience of three of them, perhaps four of them, and they have always been very anxious to encourage Irish manufacture where possible, but the position is that they have not full control.  I think as the Act stands at present, they have not complete control over the situation.  Local authorities are allowed, I think, under the Act of 1925, somewhat more latitude in relation to this question of Irish manufactured articles than it was intended to give under the Act of 1939. I hope that if the Act of 1925 is going to be continued for another year the Parliamentary Secretary acting for the Minister will endeavour to narrow that latitude and to restrict its exercise to the greatest possible extent.  We <Col N="1987" /> have to remember that the development of Irish industries, to the state in which they now are, has cost our people something and, having got it there, we should not permit the position to be undermined by any local authority which is not prepared to accept as fully as the members of the House do, the fact that, if necessary, we shall make sacrifices in order to maintain our present state of industrial development and to enhance it.</P>

      <P>In regard to the complaints made by the last speaker about the operation of the Combined Purchasing Act, I should like to point out, as a member of a local authority for some years past, that we find ourselves in the position of having nothing at all to say with regard to the purchase of goods.  We find ourselves in the position that we are just told to take something of a certain quality and if we do not take it, we can, if you like, lump it.  Whilst from my boyhood days, I have been very solicitous for the advancement of Irish industries, I would ask that if Irish industries do get preference, they will respect that preference and will give to the local authorities implements and commodities which they could get from outside countries probably at a cheaper price. I think a lot can be said for trying to make these people realise that they are in a very happy position.</P>

      <P>Agreed.  I should like to bring to his notice the fact that the supply of certain articles, which cannot very well at the moment be manufactured in this country, is more or less the monopoly of certain firms.  I speak of such articles as artificial limbs.  I must say that my experience is that we are confined absolutely in the purchase of artificial limbs to a certain firm in a certain city.  Artificial limbs are essential to certain people in this country, such as ex-servicemen and other people, who, through no fault of their own, met with accidents.  I believe that the Parliamentary Secretary should allow purchases to be conducted on a more liberal basis.  I am convinced that in that way we will get a better and more expeditious service. It is not very often that Deputy MacEntee and myself see eye to eye. However, I believe that there is a lot to be said for his suggestion this evening. Undoubtedly, this is a matter that will have to be gone into very carefully, but when you go back to Queen Elizabeth, Queen Anne and Queen Victoria, undoubtedly there is an antediluvian tendency in that type of discussion.  I think if we started in modern times and commenced with 1949 or 1950, we would not be doing a bad day's work at all.  I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will pay special attention to my remarks with regard to the importation of artificial limbs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The only question is whether or not we should continue the Acts as set out in the Schedule to <Col N="1989" /> this Bill, but I do not think that the remarks of Deputy MacEntee were at all out of place.  I might point out in the first instance that the two Acts to which he referred merely provide for making petitions where it is alleged that the election of a person to Parliament has been carried out improperly and for meeting the expense of such a petition and of an inquiry that might be held.  It is perfectly true for him to say that the electoral law in this country is to a large extent out of date, but fortunately or unfortunately, there are certain sections of these Acts which it is proposed to continue which it is absolutely necessary to continue although they may not relate particularly to our system of election in this country.  I think I am right in saying that they have regard only to single-member constituencies and to the single vote, not to the multimember constituency, the transferable vote or the system of election by proportional representation.  I should like, however, to allay any fears which the House or Deputy MacEntee might have as far as the existing electoral law of this country is concerned.  Early last year the Government gave thorough consideration to the question of the codification of the electoral law and bringing it up to date.  Deputy MacEntee and the House will be glad to know that the Department is at present working on the preparation of a Bill to codify it and to bring it up to date.</P>
      <P>Deputy Davin raised the question of borrowing by local authorities and I think I could tell him that the Department is also engaged on the preparation of a comprehensive Bill dealing with the matter.  I cannot promise that these two Bills will be introduced at an early date because the Department of Local Government and the Minister consider that there is other work which is much more urgent and important especially in present circumstances, and in that respect I might mention that there is much more important work to be done in the matter of legislation in regard to housing.  In any case, the Department is working on these two Bills and it is hoped to introduce them as soon as the Department and the Parliamentary Draftsman have prepared them.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1990" /> Deputy Keane, and I think also Deputy MacEntee, referred to the Combined Purchasing Act.  The Combined Purchasing Act of 1925 does allow the local authority a lot of discretion and latitude&mdash;possibly it is too wide.  As far as the Department is concerned, and by the law, the utmost preference is given to goods of Irish manufacture in the acceptance of these tenders, all things being equal.  For Deputy Keane's information, inasmuch as he complained about local authorities being tied down to the purchase of a certain type of goods, the 1939 Act is even a little more strict.</P>

      <P>When progress was reported on this Money Resolution at 7 o'clock I was exposing the series of <Col N="1991" /> falsehoods upon which Deputy Lemass had based his contribution to the debate.  As I said, there was a series of falsehoods, but there were three outstanding. The falsehoods were stated in this House and were repeated the following morning on the front page of the Fianna Fáil organ.  Perhaps the Deputy remembers seeing it.  He was not in the House when I began my reply and I am glad to see he is here now.  In relation to the £17,250,000 capital expenditure scheme by the ex-chairman and Board of Córas Iompair Éireann the Deputy said that those figures existed only in my imagination.</P>

I never knew of those figures, nor did I see them, until they were given to me by the officers of the Department. That is truth number one. Number two, the Deputy's statement that there was no superannuation or pension fund and no trustees, that was rammed home here to-day as a falsehood, by the Minister for Finance, and Deputy Lemass was listening and did not question it in his second speech.</P>

Entirely false and wrong. Those are the three main points.  Why should a Deputy base his speech, which lasted for an hour, on three major falsehoods which could so easily be shown to be falsehoods?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course the Deputy will, and nothing will stop him; but, mind you, there is a difference&mdash;the Deputy has been found out.  His speech was the speech of a desperate man. There is no question about it, only a desperate man would base an hour's speech on three major falsehoods of that type, that can be so easily controverted and that have been so easily controverted.  The Deputy was fighting for his political life.  He has been entirely discredited in relation to this whole transport muddle and yet he has the effrontery to get up here and tell me and tell this Government that we are responsible for the position, that it was we who made the company bankrupt.</P>
      <P>Let me tell the Deputy something, and I want the House to pay special attention to it.  In 1947, the directors of Córas Iompair Éireann approached Deputy Lemass, who was then Minister for Industry and Commerce, for permission to increase charges, to an extent that would enable them to earn an additional £1,000,000.  They got that permission and they increased the charges, but notwithstanding the fact that they got the permission in 1947 to increase the charges to bring them in an additional £1,000,000, they lost in 1947 almost £1,000,000.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Now, that was the effect of allowing them to increase the charges to the tune of £1,000,000&mdash;to save them from losing £2,000,000.  On the 19th February, 1948, the day after the change of Government, they applied for permission to increase charges still further.  Mark the date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>None whatever; but here is something of some significance. <Col N="1995" /> I saw the ex-chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann for the first time since I became Minister on the 3rd March, 1948, within a fortnight of the change of Government.  We were discussing the parlous financial position of Córas Iompair Éireann as it was then, and amongst other things which the ex-chairman said was the following: &ldquo;That if the company were an ordinary joint stock company they would now be at the point at which the debenture holders would be putting in the Receiver.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>No, Sir, but there are certain people who would like to change them to suit their own hand. If on the 3rd March, 1948, within 14 days of Deputy Lemass ceasing to be Minister for Industry and Commerce, the ex-chairman said: &ldquo;If Córas Iompair Éireann were an ordinary joint <Col N="1996" /> stock company at that date the debenture holders would be putting in the Receiver&rdquo; and in the face of that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy now suggesting&mdash;it would be worthy of him if he were&mdash;that a senior officer of my Department, an officer who served with distinction under him when he was Minister, has deliberately concocted that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Do not be quibbling. Whatever had been paid or had not been paid, the position was so serious that the chairman, who had the full knowledge of the facts before him, made the statement that if they were an ordinary joint stock company the debenture holders would be putting in the Receiver at that point.  That is the answer to all this frothy nonsense we have had from the other side about our being responsible for it.  Deputy Lemass ought to be ashamed of himself, very much ashamed of himself.  I suggest that if the Deputy had any real sense of shame he would not speak on this point much less try to shift the blame on to other shoulders.  The Deputy had the effrontery to conclude with the sentence that he was not going to allow me to put the responsibility for this mess on his shoulders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to go into this thing in very much detail.  I can tell the <Col N="1997" /> Deputy what the five other directors thought about it.  This is a copy of a memorandum sent to me on the 9th April, 1948, by the shareholders' directors of Córas Iompair Éireann.  It is signed by: W.E. Wylie, H.B. Pollock, C.D. Hewat, John McCann, J.F.

      <P>&ldquo;This year's working to date has satisfied us that losses are fundamental to the transport system at present in operation and that exceptional circumstances, such as fuel shortages, strikes, wage increases, etc., only accentuate the losses.  We are regretfully driven to the conclusion that there is no middle way and that the combination of public policy and private profit-earning capital cannot succeed.  In conclusion, we are of the opinion that if a national transport system such as exists to-day and which we are satisfied cannot be operated except at a loss, is necessary for the country's welfare, then the private capital invested in such undertaking should be adequately safeguarded and ensured of a fair return.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I gave you, as on the 3rd March, 1948, within 14 days of Deputy Lemass leaving the Department of Industry and Commerce, what the ex-chairman thought about the company.  I am now giving you, as on the 9th April, six weeks after the change of Government, what the other five directors thought about it and its future, and I am giving that to refute this outrageous charge and suggestion that this Government is or was in any way responsible for the financial position. That was the position when we took over and nobody knows that better than Deputy Lemass.  The Deputy and his colleagues have been trying to suggest that, because I did not agree to the proposals made to me by the company, that is the reason they are in their present financial situation.  The Deputy took very good care, when he was speaking this evening, not to enumerate the proposals they made to me.

    <P>I want to remind Deputies again of some of the reasons why the chairman, or ex-chairman, found himself in the position on 3rd March in which he made the statement I have already quoted.  I do not want to go back over them or to repeat any of the things I have already said, but I want to remind Deputies that, in June of 1948, <Col N="2002" /> this company was unable to pay the interest due on the debentures.  I want to remind Deputies that, in October, 1948, in the middle of the Milne inquiry and investigations, when I was informed of the company's intention to proceed with another scheme at a cost of nearly £1,000,000 at Broadstone, I sent a request to the company and the answer I got was that they regretted they could not see their way to accede to my request as Minister to postpone or defer the Broadstone £1,000,000 scheme, until such time as the Government got the report of the experts who were considering the position.  Only very reluctantly at a time which was within two weeks of the time when they had not got enough money in the till to pay the wages of the staff, did they agree not to go ahead with that scheme, and only very reluctantly and after trying to put the greatest possible persuasion on me, did they agree to take whatever steps could be taken at that stage to cancel the contract for the 90 or 94 locomotive boilers, which were not only entirely unnecessary but, even if they had been supplied, would have been of the wrong design.  We got the headline in &ldquo;Truth in the News&rdquo; the previous day: &ldquo;£4,000,000 Subsidy for the new Transport Board.&rdquo; That was on Thursday morning and on the Friday morning we got this headline. I got all that from the Deputy who got up here on Wednesday last to lecture me on truth, on honesty and on being straightforward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the general public, or that small proportion of the general public who confine their reading to this paper, they will never get the truth.  May I ask Deputy Lemass if he will be kind enough to consult Mr. Percy Reynolds with regard to this sum of £17,250,000, even for his own peace of mind?  I know that the Deputy would be terribly uneasy if he had made any accusation against me which was not absolutely true, and I would be worried if the Deputy's mind should be disturbed.  His mind will, and can be, set very easily at rest on this matter by Mr. Reynolds.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), page 5, line 31, to delete &ldquo;January&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;April&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The object of the amendment is to change the appointed day from the 1st January to the 1st April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not opposed to the amendment, but there are certain matters related to it on which I would like to have some information.  When the Minister was introducing the Bill, with the intention that it should operate as from the 1st January, he mentioned the £1,500,000 of debenture stock of Córas Iompair Éireann due for redemption in January next.  He stated that it was not proposed in the Bill to issue transport stock in exchange for these debentures because of the fact that they were due for redemption at such an early date.  The postponement of the operative date from the 1st January to the 1st April leaves the position of these debentures somewhat obscure.  I assume that it is intended that they shall be redemmed on the redemption date, the 28th April.  I want to know by what means that redemption is to be effected.  Córas Iompair Éireann, I presume, have not got the cash to pay off the debenture holders in the large sum of £1,500,000, and, ordinarily, would endeavour to do so by issuing new debentures of a corresponding value.  I understand that it is not intended that Córas Iompair Éireann should, in the remaining weeks of its existence, utilise whatever is left of its powers to issue new debentures. At the same time, as the Bill will not be law, the position cannot be dealt with by the issue of transport stock. How is it contemplated that Córas Iompair Éireann will raise the money, or in what manner is it intended that these debentures will be dealt with?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is provided for in the Vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand then, that of the money we voted last week, £1,500,000 is intended to redeem the debentures issued during the year.  I hope the Minister will communicate that fact to the Minister for Justice. I merely want to direct the attention of the House to the fact that the Minister for Justice stated publicly that £1,000,000 was required to meet the losses incurred by Córas Iompair Éireann.  In fact, we are now to understand that of the £4,000,000 no less than £1,500,000 is required to redeem the debentures issued for the purpose of raising capital for expenditure on <Col N="2009" /> permanent way, rolling stock and other assets of the company of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister not say that capital sums were required for that purpose?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot agree that the £1,500,000 is to be used entirely for the purpose the Deputy has mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyway, it is on record that of that sum £1,500,000 is due to repay the money borrowed, with the sanction of the Minister for Finance, in 1949.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am raising it because of the change to the new date.  The position with regard to the £1,500,000 of debentures, due for redemption next month, arising out of the change in date is left somewhat obscure, and I am anxious to get it clarified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no obscurity, except in the Deputy's own mind, and I doubt if the obscurity is there either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Then, I hope the Minister will co-operate in removing the obscurity.  We are now told for the first time that the sum voted by the Dáil last week includes £1,500,000 for the redemption of these debentures. I asked the Minister that <Col N="2010" /> question in the debate on the Supplementary Estimate and he would not answer it.  We now learn that that is so.  The other £2,500,000 fully accounts for all the working losses to date, for all the debenture interest to date, and provides, furthermore, for the debenture interest payable next year, and provides for working losses anticipated by the company up to April next year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <P>If the Minister had given me the information, which I have now been given, when I asked for it at the relevant time, that is, when we were debating the Supplementary Estimate&mdash;I would not have to ask for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>This is really outrageous. The Deputy is getting up now and asserting that he did not get that information.  That is not so.  Not only was the Deputy informed about that £1,550,000 but he and the House were informed as to what proportion of that was for capital expenditure and what proportion of it went towards working losses.  The Deputy now asserts that he is getting the information for the first time.  That statement is not true.  I can give it to the Deputy again if he wants it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2) to add after the word &ldquo;property&rdquo; in line 39 the words &ldquo;for the purposes of the board&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I tabled this amendment for the purpose of getting an explanation from the Minister as to whether there was any <Col N="2012" /> definite purpose in leaving these words out of the section.  The section relates to Section 9 of the Transport Act, 1944. That section authorised the company established by it to purchase, take hold and dispose of land and other property for the purposes of the company.  These words &ldquo;for the purposes of the company&rdquo; do not appear in this section. Is there any reason?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised by the draftsman that they are not necessary. The Deputy will find, for instance, in Section 5 (2) that it provides that the board should be a body which purchases, takes hold and disposes of land and other property.  The Parliamentary draftsman does not consider the amendment necessary.  The compulsory acquisition of land under Section 15 (1) is limited to land required for the purposes of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand the Parliamentary draftsman saying the amendment is not necessary, but perhaps the House might consider the words necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised that the words proposed to be inserted by the Deputy are not necessary and that the omission of them does not limit the operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>But should we limit the operation of the powers of the company in this regard?  Admittedly, they can only acquire land compulsorily for the purposes of the company, but apparently they are authorised to spend money on land and other property which is not required for the purposes of the board and I am not sure that it is desirable we should extend their powers in that regard.  There is in some section a slight suggestion that the board might go into other activities than the operation of a transport service. If there is any intention of that kind, the Minister might say so.  I will not press the amendment, but it seems to me there may be good reasons for limiting the powers of the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy I am guided entirely in this matter by the advice I have got.  I have no personal point of view and I <Col N="2013" /> am merely going on the advice that it is not necessary to have these words there.  There is no ulterior motive so far as I am concerned.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add the following sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(3) For the avoidance of doubts it is hereby declared that the use or occupation by the board of any hereditament or tenement, within the meaning of the Valuation Acts, is not use or occupation of a public nature or for a public purpose, within the meaning of Section 63 of the Poor Relief (Ireland) Act, 1838, or Section 16 of the Valuation (Ireland) Act, 1852, or Section 2 of the Valuation (Ireland) Act, 1854, or any other enactment conferring exemption from a rate leviable by local authorities generally or by a particular local authority or class of local authorities.</P>
      <P>The object of the amendment is this. The Bill proposes that Shannon navigation should be transferred to the board. Shannon navigation, because it is under the Board of Works, does not contribute to the rates.  The amendment seeks to ensure that the new board shall, in respect of Shannon navigation, be liable for rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), paragraph (b), line 46, to add after the word &ldquo;six&rdquo; the words &ldquo;or, for any period longer than four weeks, is not less than four.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is much more than a drafting amendment.  I mentioned earlier to-day that as the Bill stands the board to be set up may consist of any number under seven.  The Minister, it seems to me, can appoint one, two, three, four, five or six members to the board. There is no minimum number prescribed. I admit there are certain practical difficulties in operating the minimum in so far as the death of a member or a member's unexpected resignation may impede the working of the board if only the minimum number has been appointed.  I have endeavoured to meet that point by providing in this amendment that the board shall consist of not less than four for any period longer than four weeks.  If there are four members appointed, and if one should die or resign unexpectedly, the Minister must fill the vacancy within a period of four weeks.  The practical difficulty can be met in that way.  The House should insist on the principle of a minimum membership and not leave the Bill as it stands, so that whatever the Minister intends he or his successor is authorised to operate this concern with one director only.</P>

      <P>To delete sub-section (2).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment has been put down to ascertain from the Minister the necessity for the provision of this particular sub-section.  I can think of nothing that the general manager can do as a member of the board that he could not do as an ordinary general manager. From experience in another place where there is a general manager, I can see no necessity for promoting that particular individual to the board. I can, however, see certain disadvantages in making the general manager a member of the board.  He is the chief executive officer and the chief administrative officer of such a concern.  It is to be presumed that he will be taken into consultation at board meetings.  It is our experience that he is.  It is good business that the general manager should be present at all meetings of the board.  He is the individual upon whom the directors must rely for guidance. If, however, he is placed on the board, in the light of this particular provision, I can quite see circumstances arising where, by reason of his being a member of the board, he might prevail upon other members to take responsibility for actions for which he should be solely responsible as general manager.  I think that is undesirable.  I have put down the amendment to ascertain the Minister's viewpoint.  I hope it will be the practice of the board that the general <Col N="2016" /> manager will have, as a matter of right, liberty to be present at all board meetings to give the board the benefit of his particular knowledge.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>They are linked in any event.  If the Minister contemplates a board consisting entirely of directors who will not be personally concerned with the administration of the company, then I think Deputy O'Sullivan's view is correct.  If, on the other hand, he has in mind a board like the Electricity Supply Board, the majority of the members of which are executive officers of the concern in charge of clearly defined departments, then I think it is obvious that the general manager must be a member of the board.  I favour the former type.  I cannot say from experience that the Electricity Supply Board has not worked satisfactorily, but my knowledge of difficulties which it encountered convinces me that it was a mistake originally to have the board consist of a majority of people who were departmental heads.  I am sure that everybody has some idea of the rivalries that may and can develop between different sections of a large organisation; and it is obviously undesirable that these rivalries should find expression in the form of conflicting advice given to the board when matters of policy have to be decided.  It is much wiser that the views of departmental heads should be channelled to the board through some officer, or some section, in a position to vet such views, analyse them and put them before the board in a form which permits of a decision without reference to the personal offence which such decision might give. Nobody likes to be turned down in relation <Col N="2017" /> to a certain recommendation upon technical matters by a body of which he is a member.  If the chief mechanical engineer, the traffic manager or the road freight manager puts forward a proposition with which the other technical officers of the company do not agree, if they are all members of the board, that will certainly not make for harmonious work.</P>
      <P>Either type of organisation is practicable. We have already had experience of both kinds in this country and I think that experience justifies the appointment of a board of directors, the members of which have no executive functions to perform and are free to give the whole of their time to the general type of supervision of the activities of the concern which such a board should exercise.  There is, of course, a compromise arrangement possible, one which to some extent does exist in the Electricity Supply Board, in so far as there is one part-time member still remaining there and one further member who does not at present, I think, carry out any executive functions. I think that arrangement is the least satisfactory of all because the non-executive members are very often put in the position of being arbitrators between the executive members.  My feeling is in favour of a board with no executive function, exercising a general supervision.  If that is the Minister's intention, I agree with Deputy O'Sullivan's amendment.  If it is not the Minister's intention and if it is proposed to have a board consisting in whole or in part of the executive officers of the concern, then it seems to me the general manager must be one of them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this amendment is a very wise one because the board may from time to time have to consider either the competence or the efficiency of the general manager.  If the general manager is a member of the board, it might be very difficult for the board as a whole to consider that particular aspect.  Sub-section (5) of <Col N="2018" /> Section 7 says that where the general manager of the undertaking of the board is for the time being a member of the board, the board may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, remove him from office as a member of the board.  Obviously, then, occasion might arise when the board might have to hold a kind of caucus meeting in the absence of the general manager for the purpose of discussing his competence or otherwise.  The general manager of such an undertaking as this ought to be a person of responsibility.  I think it would tie the hands of the board considerably if the general manager is appointed a member of the board and if there is provision for his removal from the board on the board's recommendation to the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>I think that is an entirely unsatisfactory position and that it is better that the executive functions should be carried out by the general manager and that his attendance at board meetings should be required whenever it is necessary for him to be there.  If the board is doing its work properly they will be considering very often the steps taken by the general manager to implement their policy.  For that reason I would be strongly in favour of the amendment proposed by Deputy O'Sullivan and I would recommend it to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that we cannot deal with the amendment which stands in the name of Deputy O'Sullivan unless we have regard to the matters which were raised by Deputy Lemass.  If we are going to have a position where any administrative or executive officer would be a member of the board it seems to me that automatically the first person to hold membership should be the general manager.  That is almost selfevident. I suggest that we first decide whether or not, in principle, we feel that executive officers should be members of the board.  On a number of occasions I expressed the view that, where we are dealing with boards charged with matters of wide public policy, it is preferable to have membership of those boards confined, as far as possible, to those free from <Col N="2019" /> executive responsibility in so far as the carrying out of that policy is concerned. When it comes to matters of policy related to economic, social and industrial questions I have no special veneration for the technical expert.  I feel that his technical knowledge has to be drawn through the sieve of the minds of men and women who have acquired, in actual life, a broader and deeper understanding of social, economic and industrial problems than, possibly, is available to him who must, of necessity, be immersed in his narrow field of activities.</P>
      <P>So far as transport is concerned, one of the problems already raised in regard to the nature of the Bill, and which the Minister dealt with already, is that, in the setting up of the board, we are going to charge them with the responsibility of advising the Government on very grave issues of policy. Therefore, from that point of view, we should decide, in principle, that the board will be constituted as far as possible, I think to be preferable, of whole-time members charged with the responsibility of dealing with policy and that the membership of the board should not be open to those who will then be charged, when policy is decided, with the carrying out of that policy on a technical basis.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lemass referred to the Electricity Supply Board.  I do not want to criticise him in any way but, at the same time, I think that if the balance on that board had not been so weighted in the direction of technical experts we might have had, on many occasions, a broader approach to problems they had to deal with.</P>
      <P>Before deciding on Deputy O'Sullivan's amendment we should have an indication from the Minister as to what his approach is in regard to this matter.  I urge him to confine membership of the board to those who will have to deal with policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I think every one of us is anxious, in regard to membership of this board, that it will be a type of board that will get away from anything that has happened in the recent past.  I may say that we can block <Col N="2020" /> out of our memory, for that purpose, the discussions that have gone on here on the cause of the failure.  The expression &ldquo;general manager&rdquo; means, as far as I am concerned, and from my limited knowledge of the working of public service corporations, the chief executive officer.  I do not know of any public service corporation where the general manager, as such, is a member of the board.  We have had in this country many instances where the chief executive officer is a member of the board&mdash;where he is there as managing director, with the right to attend all meetings of the board and, in many cases, he is regarded as the person next to the chairman in some of our public service corporations.  I think it would be no harm if Deputies were to look back a little bit on the distant past and examine the situation for themselves.  Many Deputies know&mdash;and Deputy Lemass, in particular knows&mdash;that from time to time the old boards that worked the transport system of this country conducted their business in a satisfactory manner. Even under the railways, before the amalgamation scheme, the framework of the administration then was a board appointed by stockholders, with the chairman selected by that board and with a general manager whose duty it was before every board meeting to summarise the proposals and suggestions that came to him from the departmental heads&mdash;information that came to him and proposals that came to him for the purpose of getting a policy decision from the board.  That system worked very well and particularly from the point of view of the service given by the railways in those days to the trading and travelling public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Larkin that, at this stage, the members of the House will be at a disadvantage in discussing this matter in the way that it should be discussed until we hear from the Minister concerned the kind of board he has in mind.  I should like to hear from the Minister, before saying very much more about this matter, whether this is to be a full-time board consisting of experts or alleged outside experts or whether the board is to consist of the senior officers of the company in charge <Col N="2021" /> of the different departments&mdash;in the same way as it was worked fairly successfully, before the nationalisation of the British railways, by the different regions that now make up the nationalised system in that country. There is nothing wrong with four or five chief executive officers, if they are so styled, going in with the chairman, or the president, if you like, and arguing questions of policy and arriving, if necessary, at a conclusion by a majority vote.  That is democracy in action and there is nothing wrong with it.  The decision on policy that is finally given by a majority is a democratic decision and certainly a safer decision from the public point of view than the decision given by one man.</P>
    <P>I do not understand the reason why the expression &ldquo;general manager&rdquo; is included here and it is very difficult for me to understand why the general manager, as such, and as is understood generally in relation to public service corporations, should have the right to be a member of the board.  I do not think the general manager, as properly understood, should have the right to come to a meeting and decide policy because, from past experience, the general manager attends the board meetings.  He used always attend the railway board meetings, at any rate, and gave advice but he had no vote and he was responsible afterwards for carrying out the policy of the board whether it was in agreement with his views or not.</P>
    <P>We are at a decided disadvantage in discussing this matter, however, until the Minister gives the House and the country his views in regard to the type of people whom he considers should constitute this board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself in this difficulty that I conceive that the new board has to tackle problems and that advice actually by way of a board consisting of departmental heads might be the very wrong type of advice.  The position is that a broad national issue will ultimately have to be decided before the board can come with really concrete proposals to the Government as to how best this new transport board can work with the minimum amount of loss.  I conceive that if you <Col N="2022" /> mix up policy matters with executive administration you are going to run into serious trouble.  Initially, you have arising the perfectly normal human reaction, that if the general manager as such becomes a member of the board, by virtue of his executive position, he gets a weight and significance on the board that may not be in the best interests of the board itself. I, like Deputy Davin, urge on the Minister to indicate to us what type of board he conceives. To my mind, it has to be one or the other and it cannot be a mixture of both.  I think that we are tackling a problem now which is a difficult problem and, leaving the heat of controversy out of it, it is a vital problem nationally.  I think the Minister will have to conceive of a board that will be, as Deputy Larkin suggested, a full-time board mainly responsible for the evolving and direction of policy and to see that that policy is implemented by the employees of the board.  I think it is not going to get the best results unless it is completely free and has control of all its executive officers up to the most senior executive officer, because the difficulty that arose with Córas Iompair Éireann was that, for some unknown reason, too much power was vested in an individual.  The board, in consequence, had no right to challenge the decisions of this individual. I think the Minister will have to face up to the fact that it would be better that this board should be a controlling directing board, having at its disposal at all times the technical experts and senior officials for the purposes of advice and, therefore, in a position, in its daily administration to formulate policy and to have people within its ken to see that that policy is carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputies ought to advert to the fact that this sub-section is merely permissive.  It enables the board, if at any particular time it conceives that it would be to the advantage of the board that the general manager should be a member, to appoint, with the permission of the Minister, the general manager a member of the board.  I think there is a lot to be said for that.  It is quite clear <Col N="2023" /> that there are advantages in having the executive head of a particular concern, if he is a man of outstanding ability, a man who may not only have technical knowledge but also great administrative experience, as a member of the board.  It is desirable that the board should be permitted, if they consider it well so to do, to appoint that person a member of the board.  There is nothing new in this and there is not very much point in saying that the general manager is equivalent, if you like, to a managing director.  I know and several Deputies know that throughout various companies&mdash;and I may say in particular transport companies&mdash;in all the countries in the world, the chief executive of the board has on many occasions been also a member of the board.  Deputies should keep in mind that the board will consist of not more than six members and, if we accept Deputy Lemass's amendment, of not fewer than four.  Say that four, five or six members of the board sit down around the board table, and with intimate knowledge of the general manager, decide whether it would be in the best interests of the board to appoint him, with the consent of the Minister, to a seat on the board.  I think there is everything to be said in favour of it.  I can see no serious objection to it at all.  I can see that it could be of very great advantage to have that close link between the board and the managerial or executive side of the organisation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to remark that I thought that this amendment was a case of much ado about nothing, and I think the Minister's remarks have confirmed that.  Under this section we are setting up a board and that board is going to run the company. We must leave it as free as we can along certain lines.  They will know their general manager and they will decide whether the best interests of the company are to be served by having him on the board or keeping him off it. I think it is one of the matters which we cannot decide in Parliament.  We cannot decide whether it is good or bad to put general managers on boards.  That must be left to the wisdom and discretion of the board itself. A Deputy has asked what are the advantages to be gained by his being a member of the board.  He would be there all the time if he were a member of a board.  If he were not there, he would presumably be called in to deal with such questions as the board wanted him to deal.  I think the best course is to leave the matter open to the board.  If we leave it at that they can appoint any executive officer including the general manager.  We may tie their hands in a way we would not like to do and that they themselves would not like to have done.  I think, in the best interests of all, the section as it stands would meet ordinary business practice and custom.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not satisfied with the explanation given by the Minister as to why the general manager should be a member of the board.  He states <Col N="2025" /> he would have outstanding qualities, but I think that if he has outstanding qualities it would be all the more reason why he should be left away from the board.  He might have very advanced ideas about transport which the other members might not have and in that case he would be going against the majority.  If he is left as general manager only it will be better for them and for the transport of the country. I would be surprised if a board constituted of four or six persons could sit down and discuss the question of transport without having the general manager and engineering and technical advisers at the meeting, but it would be much better to have them free to do their executive work with the board as dominating factor than to absorb the general manager as a member of the board.</P>

      <P>I think that there is a lot to be said for both ideas, but it very largely depends on the character of the general manager, if he were invited to the board.  There will inevitably be a clash in the future between rail and road freight and between bus and rail services if any of the proposals of Sir James Milne are adopted by the new board.  It may be desirable that the general manager should carry out the orders of the board without being responsible himself for having made those orders.  I think we could make up our minds about the sub-section if the Minister would go further and tell us the character of the members of the board. Will they be full-time servants, experts in a business capacity and will they be expected to give most of their time to the work of administering Córas Iompair Éireann?  Quite definitely it is more than possible that the general manager himself may be prejudiced as either a road or a rail man and it would be eminently desirable that the board should be able to meet without him so as to overcome his prejudices, without the disadvantage of having a prejudiced person present.</P>

      <P>I want to ask the Minister one question in relation to this amendment.  My reading of Section 6 of the Bill&mdash;I may be entirely <Col N="2026" /> wrong and I want to get it clear in my own mind&mdash;is that, if the amendment is passed and sub-section (2) is deleted, will the position be that the Minister, without the limitations imposed by sub-section (2) of having to obtain the advice of the board, could under sub-section (1) of Section 6 be entitled to appoint the person who for the time being is general manager as a member of the board if he wanted to. I may be reading it wrongly, but sub-section (1) (a) provides:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The board shall, subject to sub-section (2) of this section, consist of such number of members as the Government may from time to time appoint.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Sub-section (2) provides for the appointment as an additional member of the person who is general manager with the consent of the Minister.  Assuming that sub-section (2) went out, is there anything to prevent the Government from appointing the person who for the time being is general manager as a member of the board?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>In answer to Deputy O'Higgins, if the Government did that they would have a vacancy and this person would be a member of the board and no longer general manager. That is, assuming that what the Minister has in mind is a board that will not be technical in the sense of being a board of experts in the services of Córas Iompair Éireann.  That question has been put to the Minister by Deputies Larkin, Davin and Childers and he has not answered as to what type of board he visualises appointing under sub-section (1).  I think it would help in further discussion if the Minister indicated clearly what type of board he has in mind and what type of people he believes will be appointed to this board and if they will be full-time or part-time.  Here is a situation that can arise.  You may have a board of six; the chairman and two members may have one point of view and three other members may have a different point of view.  In which case, as I see it, the chairman would have a casting vote, in other words his viewpoint would prevail.  If the general manager, who is really the executive officer of the board, is on <Col N="2027" /> the board, in that set of circumstances his vote can decide the issue.  That is a very important position in which to place an executive officer.  In the event of an equality of views the general manager would decide the issue, so not only would he carry on the administrative functions imposed upon him by virtue of his duties and responsibilities&mdash;because I take it that if you have a general manager in a concern such as this his duties would be laid down by agreement&mdash;but he would decide the policy in his own way.  If you have a very strong-minded general manager&mdash;as you might have&mdash;he will inevitably use his influence with the members of the board to bring them round to his point of view, and as a result the position may arise that arose in the American navy not long ago when they simply had to get rid of a particular admiral.</P>

The Minister should not allow that condition of affairs to continue.  If the general manager is such a wonderful person, let the Government decide to get rid of a member of the board who is not so satisfactory and make the general manager a member instead.</P>

      <P>The general manager visualised by this sub-section may be a <Col N="2028" /> genius and a gentleman, and probably will be both, but he cannot be a Jack-of-all-trades, as understood in the world of transport.  I would appeal to Deputy Childers and to Deputies who are thinking like him to get their minds clear of the imaginary conflict there is going to be between certain people on the board as representing road and rail or any other interest.  If Deputies clear their minds, they may be able to arrive at a satisfactory conclusion.  I am personally at considerable disadvantage in pursuing a discussion on this amendment, until such time as the Minister states whether it is going to be a board of outside experts or a board of inside experts or executive officers.  If it is a board of outside experts, it will meet some day after the 1st April, 1950, and the first meeting will be a fairly long one.  In any case, in their wisdom, they will demand returns and particulars and proposals from the different sections making up Córas Iompair Éireann&mdash;the financial side, through the accountant; the commercial side, through the commercial manager; the operating side, through the operating superintendent; the civil engineering side and the chief mechanical side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These proposals will come along to the general manager, as properly understood, and his job will be to summarise them and submit them for consideration at the next board meeting, and for the views of the members of the board on the proposals.  I venture to suggest that, if you have men who will study the position, as they would be bound to study it, they are not going to accept the summarised proposals of the general manager without bringing in the chief mechanical engineer, the chief civil engineer, the operating superintendent, the commercial superintendent and the accountant. They will hear all those officers one by one, so that they may give to the board in greater detail the meaning of their proposals and so that the board may, as it is bound to do, take a policy decision on the merits of these proposals.  If the general manager is present there, it is quite possible that his point of view may be in conflict with that of the operating superintendent. The general manager may be a <Col N="2029" /> man who has never associated with the operating side of the transport concern and, with great respect to him, whoever he may be, may know less, because he has no experience, than the man who had come up to the position of operating superintendent because he had been trained in the hard school of experience.</P>
    <P>If I were a member of the board in such circumstances, when the operating superintendent was putting a positive point of view, and if I knew he was putting it because it was based on knowledge and long experience, I might, as a member of the board, vote against the point of view of the general manager and in favour of the point of view of the operating superintendent in regard to particular proposals because of the knowledge and experience of the man who had put proposals which were opposed, let us say for the sake of argument, by the general manager.  However, if there is going to be a body composed of inside experts, I would put forward a different argument.  Before the discussion goes further, as there are other amendments on this whole section, the Minister should now give us more information. We are entitled as Deputies to be told, here and now, or before this section goes through, whether the new board is to consist of a body of inside or outside experts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinOSullivan" hpid="Mr. M. O'Sullivan Mr. M. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The main argument in favour of the retention of the sub-section is that it is permissive and that the balance of advantage lies in the form in which it is now presented to the House.  The case was made that, if the Board found they had an excellent general manager, they should be free to appoint that particular person to the board.  I think that the House would agree that, if there were circumstances which warranted it, that there was that type of person available and the board felt it was in the interests of the concern that that should be done, and if liberty were taken to make provision of that kind, the House would be satisfied. That is, provided of course&mdash;and this is all based on the assumption that the board is going to be a full-time board&mdash;that if the individual is to be <Col N="2030" /> promoted from general manager to the position of a member of the board, he would cease to hold his position in an executive capacity.</P>
      <P>I want to turn the House to the main objection that I saw in connection with the proposal which is in the Bill, that is, that the moment you make the general manager a member of the board, he being the chief executive officer of the whole concern, responsible for the administration and carrying out of the directions of the board, you will, at that moment, give him a certain shielding within the board, in respect of the members of the board, on matters affecting his own personal administration.  That is my submission.  Occasions are bound to arise where he has taken certain executive action which may be the subject of condemnation at the board meeting and he is in a rather peculiar position.  Other members of the board would also be placed in a peculiar position, if he is a member.  Some members of the House apparently favour the idea of a new board as a set of technicians.  Quite frankly, that is not my view.  If it were to be a board of technicians, it might be all right, provided that they detached themselves immediately from the departments to which they are attached and were going to give their whole-time services to the board.  If they are to be placed on the board for their technical qualifications, that would be all right, but it should not mean merely having heads of sections coming onto the board.  I suggest that the best type of board would be one composed of persons who would have knowledge of transport in some form or another and who would be in a position to evolve policy along the lines that they feel this House desires for this national concern.</P>
      <P>It may not be possible to get people of that type, but any suggestion that we should have a board of technicians is not a sound one.  There may be necessity for a technician, or two or three, but we must be clear that the new board will be a whole-time one, giving full service to the Minister and to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While there may be difficulty in discussing an amendment of this kind in <Col N="2031" /> the absence of information as to the type of people going on the board, we are still free to arrive at a conclusion that the Minister's argument&mdash;when he says the transport interests would be served the better by having the general manager a member of the board&mdash;is, so far, not too convincing.</P>

      <P>The section as it stands is, I think, an ideal one.  The Minister states it is permissive and, although I may not be an expert on railway work, I have the commonsense to know that we are not dealing with a normal position but with a very abnormal one. For years we have had the spectacle of successive Governments trying to make the transport of this country pay. Various actions were taken and various people were appointed, but the fact remains that the railways as they stand to-day are bankrupt.  There is no use in talking hypothetically about what may happen if certain directors disagree. If the members of the board so <Col N="2032" /> desire and think it is in the interests of the undertaking&mdash;and, mind you, it will require great care and attention on the part of every member of the board and the general manager to bring back the railways to anything approaching a solvent position&mdash; Deputies need not be splitting hairs about what will happen at meetings of the board.</P>
      <P>I have no illusions in regard to the work these men will have to carry through when the board is set up on the 1st April, 1950.  Deputies should recognise that fact, that it will require the best of luck and the co-operation of everyone to put the railways back in the position in which they will give some little return for the millions that are to be expended on them.  I move to report progress.</P>
      <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 7th December.</P>
