      <NameTxt>Dr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare whether he is aware that Mr. James Casey of Killyneena, County Monaghan, lost his right arm in a flax mill accident in 1937 at the age of 18; that the employer was declared bankrupt following the going into liquidation of his insurance company&mdash;the Irish Employers' Mutual Insurance Association&mdash;and that, as a result, Mr. Casey has received no compensation except for a period of two to three months following the accident; and if, in the circumstances, he will consider granting him some form of compensation or indicate if it is his intention to make provision in future social service schemes for cases of exceptional hardship such as this.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of the case mentioned by the Deputy.  I regret that there are no funds at my disposal from which this worker could be granted compensation, but what is stated to have happened in this case will be borne in mind in connection with the framing of any new scheme of workmen's compensation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare whether he intends to introduce proposals to amend the Insurance (Intermittent Unemployment) Act, 1942, so as to bring quarry workers, especially the employees at <Col N="822" /> Muckish Mountain, County Donegal, within its provisions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to a question put to me by Deputy Seán Dunne on the 15th June, 1948, in which I indicated that there had been no general demand for the inclusion of quarry workers in the wet-time scheme.  I also stated on that occasion that I would be glad to consider any representations which might be made for the extension of the scheme to additional classes of workers.  I have not since received any indication that quarry workers desire to be brought within the scope of the wet-time scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The mountain where this work is carried on is high above the Donegal coast and the workers there are exposed to all kinds of weathers.  There is only a sort of shelter.  This industry is a very important one of procuring sand for glass-making.  Would it not be in the interests of the industry to bring these people within the scope of the Act?  As the Minister is already aware, some county councils are making provision for broken time for the workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that if quarry workers are brought into the scheme they must be brought in as quarry workers nationally employed over the whole territory of this State.  I cannot merely take in those in an exposed part of Donegal and exclude those from other portions of the country.  As I said to Deputy Dunne some time ago, I am willing to discuss with any representative body of workers or employers the extension of the wet-time scheme to any classes of workers, bearing in mind all the time that such funds as have accumulated&mdash; what might be described as the &ldquo;wet-time treasury&rdquo;&mdash;have been put there by the contributions of other classes of workers and their employers.  That must be borne in mind in considering any extension of the scheme to other classes of workers.  However, the net position is that I am willing to discuss the matter with anybody who claims to be able to speak authoritatively for quarry workers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Seeing that this particular industry is not quarry work like county council work but a quarry producing sand for a glass-making industry, and in the interests of keeping the industry in full swing and probably stopping the importation of glasses from abroad, could not the Minister look into this particular industry in Donegal apart from including any other workers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no such power. I doubt very much whether I have any power under the Act as it now stands to extend the scope of the Act to any workers other than building trade workers or what might be described as ancillary workers.  I doubt if I have any power to extend it to quarry workers as such without new legislation. If I had such power, however, it would be to extend it to quarry workers as a whole and not to workers employed in a particular part of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that the position is as stated by the Deputy. I am, however, considering a proposal put forward by the Clare County Manager to reinstate in a permanent capacity a person who was employed by the Clare County Council for some years prior to 1922 and who joined the National Army in that year.  As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the policy at that time was that the place vacated by a person joining the National Army should be kept open for him.  In this case that policy was not implemented despite numerous attempts by the person concerned to secure reinstatement. He is now, and has been for the past two years, employed as a temporary clerk in the offices of the council.  The permanent appointment of temporary clerks has been by no means unusual in recent years and this case is one which in equity appears to deserve sympathetic consideration.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he has now ascertained whether the room in which two attendants in Dundrum Criminal Lunatic Asylum were sleeping when they successively contracted tuberculosis was disinfected after the condition of the first attendant had been diagnosed and he had been removed to hospital and before the second attendant contracted the disease; and if he will state (a) the manner; (b) by whom; and (c) the date on which the mattress of the first attendant's bed was destroyed and when it was replaced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made further inquiries in regard to this case and I have ascertained that the floor of the room occupied by the two attendants referred to by the Deputy was washed with disinfectant on several occasions during the short period in which the first attendant, whom I shall continue <Col N="832" /> to call attendant B, was confined to bed therein.  The floor was similarly washed after attendant B had been removed to hospital.</P>
      <P>On the basis of information supplied by the Dundrum Asylum authorities, I stated in reply to the Deputy's previous question of 16th December, 1948, on this subject that the mattress on the bed of attendant B was destroyed immediately after the attendant had been taken to hospital.  I am now informed that, while the mattress was taken away on the day following that on which the attendant was brought to hospital, the mattress itself was not actually destroyed or burnt, but that it was cast away in a separate storeroom, together with other stores, condemned as unfit for further use.  The mattress was replaced three months later in April, 1947.  As I have already informed the Deputy, I am satisfied that the precautionary measures generally taken by the Dundrum Asylum authorities were adequate to prevent the likelihood of the spread of the disease.</P>

Further, is it not obligatory when a person is removed to hospital suffering from an infectious disease&mdash;even from a private dwellinghouse&mdash;to have the room occupied by such person sealed and disinfected?</P>

In that investigation I hope I shall receive the assistance of the Deputy in carrying it out. <Col N="833" /> With regard to infectious diseases and the sterilisation of rooms, disinfecting is carried out in certain cases but the absolute necessity of doing this is not completely established.

      <P>The amount provided by the Dáil in respect of health services grants for the current year has proved insufficient for the reason that the estimates of expenditure furnished by health authorities prior to the date upon which I took up office have been exceeded for various reasons, including (a) the provision of over 800 extra beds for persons suffering from tuberculosis, (b) the payment of increased bonus to <Col N="834" /> health authority staffs and (c) the introduction of a 96-hour fortnight for nurses and mental hospital attendants, etc.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is aware that the Estimate for my Department for the health services grant must necessarily be based upon the figures furnished by health authorities, and that any substantial increase in actual expenditure by health authorities in excess of these figures involves a Supplementary Estimate for the health services grant.</P>
      <P>There is no date fixed by statute by which these grants must be paid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am obliged to the Deputy for directing my attention to this characteristic falsification of the news in the <i>Irish Press.</i>  The statement referred to appeared in a paragraph the heading of which is &ldquo;Cattle Export Drop&rdquo;. The paragraph then sets out that cattle shipments from Ireland in January, 1949, were 17,343, or 1,468 more than in January, 1948.  This, of course, reveals a satisfactory increase in our shipments, so the enterprising journalist then sets out cattle shipments from Northern Ireland for January, 1949, at 5,685, representing a drop of 1,987 on the figure for January, 1948; he then blandly justifies his heading by the Northern Ireland figures, though the clear implication of the heading is that the decline in shipments referred to shipments from Ireland.  This is just another cadenza in the symphony of falsehood for which this so-called newspaper is notorious.</P>

      <P>I am not aware that there has been any recent increase in unemployment in the furniture trade in Cork.  If there is unemployment amongst members of the National Furniture Trades Operatives (Cork Branch) it cannot, I suggest, be due to the importation of furniture, the imports of which in 1948 represented something less than 8 per cent. of the total home market.  The present tariff of 75 per cent. (50 per cent. preference) has, therefore, proved effective and I do not consider it necessary to contemplate measures for prohibiting importation.</P>

      <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the great dissatisfaction that is felt against his officials and his Department due to the delays that local authorities are experiencing in getting a reply from his Department.  When the Minister was in Cork last April he urged everybody to speed up things as much as they could, since he wanted to go ahead with his work.  I believe it was his intention to do so at the time.  Since last October, however, there has been a complete slow up in his Department in its relations with the local authorities of which I happen to be a member <Col N="850" />&mdash;the South Cork Board of Assistance, the Cork Joint Sanatorium Committee and the South Infirmary, Cork.  On last Saturday four weeks, the Cork Joint Sanatorium Committee held a meeting to consider the provision of accommodation for nurses and maids adjacent to the new chest hospital.  If that accommodation was provided the committee would be able to accommodate about 24 extra patients.  The Minister was very anxious that we should go ahead with this.  As I have said, on Saturday four weeks we sent up a communication to the Department and pointed out that we were holding a special meeting on that day fortnight to consider the Department's reply so that we could go ahead quickly with this project.  The meeting was held on Saturday fortnight.  Members of the committee attended from all over the County Cork, from Skibbereen, Clonakilty, Boherbee, Buttevant, Mitchelstown and the City of Cork.  All these members attended the meeting at considerable expense to the ratepayers, but they discovered when they assembled that there was not even an acknowledgment of their communication of two weeks earlier from the Department.  At a meeting of the joint sanatorium committee Deputy McAuliffe presided, and Deputy Seán Keane, Deputy Corry and myself were also present.  The meeting unanimously adopted a resolution protesting against the delaying tactics of this Department.</P>

      <P>Yes, but if work in respect of which grants are given is not carried out, then I think I am entitled to talk about it.  This motion of protest that I am speaking about was proposed and seconded by supporters of the inter-Party Government.  A further meeting was held last Saturday in connection with the same thing and even then no acknowledgment had been received from the Department to our communication.  There is a waiting list of 55 patients before the joint sanatorium committee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister went down to Cork, and I am sure he will agree with me in this, that the people in Cork very readily handed over the hospital in Mallow in order to help him in his campaign against tuberculosis. The Minister has agreed to give back that hospital in another four years to the people in North Cork.  I am pointing out to him that, if he does not move more quickly, the work will not have been carried out at Mallow Hospital by the time that he will have to hand the hospital back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think there is any use in dwelling any further on that.  Deputy Desmond, Deputy Lynch and myself waited on the Minister last November about another hospital in Cork.  We were told that we would be written to. Since then, however, neither the South Infirmary in Cork nor any one of the <Col N="852" /> Deputies on that deputation has heard anything.  Last week the South Cork Board of Assistance had to draw attention to the fact that they were not getting any replies from the Department and that matters relating to their hospital were being held up. We were asked to consult with the university authorities about the appointment of a gynæcologist and an obstetrician in the county home.  We agreed with them, and when we submitted the result another reply came down about something else, which all tended to delay the scheme as far as possible.  We had to appoint another deputation to come and interview the Minister.  Last April the Minister came down and spoke about the regional sanatorium at Sarsfield Court, and complained that when he went to his Department a grazing lease was handed to him for his signature for the grazing of Sarsfield Court.  He said that was a Fianna Fáil policy and that he would not do that.  He waited until the 1st December and then advertised the letting of the grazing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Another advertisement appeared again for the letting of the grazing from the 1st March.  I agree that when the Minister was talking like that he was a very inexperienced man as far as the Department was concerned.  I am sure that he has learned that he cannot do all the things that he said he would do. I think he should withdraw some of the things he said about the laxity of his predecessors.  I am asking him now to see that local authorities will get replies to their requests, and I think it is his duty to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy MacEntee had a question down to-day asking the Minister for particulars with regard to the increase that is now required.  During Question Time I think, Sir, that you indicated that the supplementary questions could be postponed and dealt with under this particular Supplementary Estimate.  In answer to the question, the Minister put it to the House <Col N="853" /> that the main reason why this additional amount of money was required was due to the fact that there were 800 additional beds installed within the last year for tuberculous patients.  I should like the Minister to tell the House the exact amount of the extra cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Minister to tell the House to what extent this particular reason comes into the calculation apart from the other reasons because I know, as Deputies who are members of the Dublin Corporation know, that the biggest number of beds that was provided in last year was provided in Dublin.  They were provided in an institution which was taken over and handed to the Dublin Corporation not at a cost to the Department of Health but at a cost to the corporation itself.  It has to be paid for over a period of years as a result of a figure being assessed and fixed by the Department of Finance.  In addition, the cost of the upkeep of this particular institution falls again on the Dublin Corporation.  It is true that the Dublin Corporation will be able to recoup after a period the excess of expenditure on health services over the standard fixed in the year laid down. I am anxious to know, as I think other Deputies are, how much of this additional supplementary amount is actually related to the one item of the many to which the Minister referred. I am very interested to know that because I should like to relate this additional charge to our own experience and costings in the Dublin Corporation.</P>

It is to that end I am attempting to direct my remarks. Perhaps I am failing to do so.  The question was raised to-day at Question Time by Deputy MacEntee and was again adverted to by Deputy Briscoe, as to the responsibility for the 800 beds referred to by the Minister in respect of the sums included in this Supplementary Estimate.  I should like the Minister to let the House know, if I have correctly understood him, on other occasions, that the position in so far as the waiting lists for beds for tuberculous patients west of the Shannon are concerned, is now nonexistent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to know from the Minister what portion of the extra allowance he is asking for under <Col N="856" /> sub-head H has already been paid or will be paid towards providing those extra beds.  As I understand it, capital expenditure of such a nature may not rank for recoupment at all.  In the matter of new buildings provided through loans no portion will rank for recoupment.  Could the Minister inform the House, as regards the 800 beds that he claims to have provided, what portion will rank for recoupment to local authorities?  That would be an interesting thing to know.  I believe a very small portion will be found to be included in the £1,681,000, if any.</P>
      <P>We have a fair idea of the position of local authorities in relation to a big proportion of this increase.  Since the Minister took up office, local authorities on several occasions received communications from his Department telling them that he was prepared to sanction increases in different directions. He did not consult the local authorities or the county managers for an expression of their views.  He determined in his office what increases should be granted to particular sections of the staffs of local authorities engaged on health services.  He also informed local authorities that in his opinion they should have a 96-hour fortnight for their staffs.  The local authorities quite naturally did not object to that, but the Minister has not told the House what that may involve.  He did not indicate that it has not been found possible up to now in many health institutions to have those staffs employed because of the fact that there is no housing accommodation for them, no nursing quarters.  He did not indicate that buildings must be provided before the 96-hour fortnight can be brought into operation in mental hospitals, fever hospitals and sanatoria.  I do not know how many public health authorities have put the 96-hour fortnight into operation; I doubt if there are very many, because they have not the accommodation.  Some cannot get the extra staff because extra nursing personnel are not available and it will probably be in the year 1951 before the full cost of the 96-hour fortnight and the additional staff required will come on the Estimate of whatever Minister for Health is there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main portion of this increase <Col N="857" /> has arisen from the fact that the Minister sanctioned substantial staff increases in different institutions during the year.  We are not objecting to that, but the local authorities had no say in the matter.  If the sanction comes from the Minister, and he suggests that the staff should get certain remuneration, the local authorities have no option but to pay. If the Minister's Department interferes with regard to the remuneration of staffs down the country the county managers or the local authorities have no say after that.</P>

We hear talk about the functions of local authorities being taken from them. It does not matter what functions you give them, if that system is to continue. It may be a good system and it may not.  I suggest to the Minister that <Col N="858" /> if, in the future, improvements are to be made in the status of the staffs employed by health authorities, there should be consultation between the Department and the county managers, or those who are directly responsible. In law it is the county manager who should determine the rates payable in any of the services, and not the Minister. I definitely object to that practice.  Again, on the matter of these extra beds that the Minister tells us he has provided, I believe that little or no portion of the cost of these extra beds comes within this Estimate.</P>

In regard to the house which was taken over for the purpose of treating tubercular cases in the County Waterford and County Kilkenny &mdash; Ardkeen &mdash; is there any money voted in this Estimate for the purpose of developing that institution? So far as I can gather nothing has been done up to the present in reference to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to explain to the Deputies that the present position has arisen in regard to payments to local authorities and to expenses in which they have become involved because of the fact that we are going through a transition period. The terms of payment and the terms of recoupment will in future be altered. These sums under the health services grant were estimated prior to the completion of the audit of the local authorities.  These are grants assessing the amount of money spent in the standard year, 1947-48, upon which all future expenditure will be based.  The grants were estimated on that year, and we also have to take into consideration any estimates for the current year.  Consequently, there is a number of items included in this Supplementary Estimate which it was not possible to forecast with any great degree of accuracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies are concerned with my reply to Deputy MacEntee's question, in which I mentioned the 800 beds for tuberculous patients which have been provided since February last.  The House is very anxious to know how much of the total Supplementary Estimate reflects this increase in beds. <Col N="860" /> I am most anxious indeed to supply this information, but I would like it to be known that the information I am giving can be only very rough.  If Deputies appreciate that the cost of providing one bed at present is approximately £1,200 to £1,400, it will be obvious that the provision of 800 beds would involve a very much greater capital sum than is mentioned in this Supplementary Estimate.  The amount for which these beds are responsible in my Estimate is approximately £166,000.  That is a rough figure.</P>
    <P>The grants under sub-head H.&mdash; Grants to Health Authorities&mdash;include the allowances for dependents, which were amended during the year to include a wider range of patients and which, in my opinion, added to the benefits which these allowances confer on tuberculous patients and patients suffering from infectious diseases who come under these allowances.  The success of this scheme, I think, is best seen in the fact that in the middle of last year&mdash;there were no figures available for February; they were not kept; I got them in July &mdash; approximately 1,050 persons were awaiting admission.  Since this time last year we have provided approximately 850 beds.  If we had a static waiting list, our problem would be a very tiny one indeed to-day; it would have left us a waiting list of approximately 150 patients.  But, due largely to the fact that these allowances have enabled men and women to accept early diagnosis and treatment for their disease&mdash;a very good thing and a very desirable thing&mdash;our present waiting list has grown to approximately 991 patients, that is, 850 beds have been eaten up and we are now left with nearly 1,000 patients awaiting admission. I am not worried about this. I feel quite certain that with a continuance of the very considerable degree of co-operation which we have received throughout the country from all local authorities and from the members of all political Parties, we shall meet this problem in the reasonably near future and completely absorb the present waiting list.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen is anxious to protect the rights of local authorities and he <Col N="861" /> gave expression to his conception of democratic government.  I am in wholehearted agreement with him that local authorities must be accorded the fullest degree of independence, and must be in a position to use their own initiative in regard to problems concerning their staff, their organisation and their hospitals. I would point out to him that any notifications which he received from my Department&mdash;in view of what Deputy McGrath says, I am glad to hear that he does receive them &mdash; are in the form of recommendations, and that, if local authorities feel that I have recommended anything which is in any way inequitable or unjust, it would be wrong of them, as local representatives of the people, to implement any suggestions which they consider wrong or unjust.  As a matter of fact, I think I have carried out to a very much fuller degree than previously, this attempt to leave to local authorities as much responsibility as possible. In pursuance of that, in the last few months particularly, I think it right to say that practically every county manager and medical officer of health has been in my Department where we have had most fruitful and useful discussions concerning the whole health problem throughout the country.  We in the Department have found these discussions very helpful indeed.  We now feel that the local authorities are aware of our problems, and we are beginning to see more fully their difficulties.  That is a policy in which I have the strongest and firmest belief.  I hope for a continuance of that co-operation from the members of all local authorities, particularly in view of the fact that in the near future it is believed that representatives on local authorities will have restored to them some of these democratic rights which hitherto had been, may I say, rather curtailed.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lemass referred to sub-head M (4)&mdash;Prevention and Treatment of Tuberculosis.  The total sum required is in respect to projects on which money was expended prior to <Col N="862" /> 1948.  Deputy Little mentioned Ardkeen House.  I investigated that problem and decided that Ardkeen House of itself was practically useless so far as meeting the tuberculosis problem in that area was concerned.  It was too small and inadequate and subsequently we decided that it was more desirable to make provision for a 250-bedded sanatorium.  We decided that Ardkeen House should be the nucleus around which this institution would be provided.  Of itself, the house would be too small but it will, however, serve as the nucleus and administration centre for a larger institution.  As to the Deputy's complaint that nothing has been done, I am afraid the Deputy has been misinformed.  A considerable amount of work has been carried out on the planning of this hospital.  We have at present reached a very advanced stage with the planning and hope that it will be possible to start the work in the next few months.</P>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Lehane, may I say that the position in the West has reached a stage in which I should like to see the position in the rest of the country?  Deputy Briscoe observed that the only major institution provided was in Dublin.  That is incorrect. The institution provided in the West, at Castlerea, at present is the biggest and holds the largest number of patients, consequently our problem in Connaught is practically non-existent. There are a few patients here and there.  We hope that it will be possible to serve some of the counties in Leinster while we are waiting for additional accommodation at short intervals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McGrath raised a number of points in regard to Cork and the difficulties which he experienced in getting replies.  All I can say is that there are some problems which take a longer time to consider and to decide than others.  I think he should bear in mind that the provision of the Mallow Sanatorium, with its staff and equipment, has been of very great assistance to the solution of the problem in the southern area, and that it was provided with the minimum of delay.  Again I should like to thank the members of the local authorities <Col N="863" /> in that area who did appreciate the problem and who assisted me very much in providing that hospital.  With regard to the appointment of an obstetrician and gynæcologist, this whole problem is concerned with the position of the maternity hospital, the university and the county home in Cork.  The future of our maternity and gynæcological services for the whole southern region must, to a certain extent, be considered in deciding any future appointments in that area.</P>
    <P>Obviously, it is a very involved and complicated problem.  Nothing would be simpler for me than to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to letters received, to agree with suggestions made, but I feel that in a matter which so very deeply involves the welfare and health of these women and children, in which the best interests of a university are concerned, and the interests of the whole regional organisation in regard to health are involved, it simply cannot be decided to suit the convenience of anybody by return of post.  However, the South Cork Board of Assistance have been invited to send representatives to a conference to discuss this whole position and the Deputy can be quite certain that nobody is more anxious than I am to overcome the considerable arrears which have arisen from the delays over the many years previously in regard to the provision of adequate hospital facilities in Cork.  I hope there is no point which I have missed.</P>

The position regarding Foynes is this: that we are investigating at the moment the desirability of converting the Foynes Hotel into a chest hospital for the south-western area.  I have looked into that problem, but there are many difficulties to overcome.  The Deputy is aware that the Limerick County Council have shown no enthusiasm to take over the Foynes institution, and I tentatively approached the Kerry County Council to ask them if they would care to consider the proposition. <Col N="864" /> The whole arrangement, however, is completely tentative and nothing definite has been arrived at because we are examining other possibilities. There is nothing final in this.</P>

      <P>The position is as the Deputy says &mdash; that as a sanatorium it would be unsuitable, but as a chest hospital it has possibilities.  The Deputy may not understand the difference.  In one case there is a very large percentage of patients completely in bed under operation.  In the other there are ambulatory patients walking around and it would not be desirable to have them in that particular area.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The necessity for this increase arises from the fact that the estimate made of the cost of children's allowances during the year was not as accurate as it might have been.  That is due to the fact that this is a relatively new service and it is not possible to estimate with complete precision what the demands on the Exchequer will be. As the service develops and as more experience is gained of the operation of the service, it may be possible to estimate with greater accuracy.  This year the demand for the additional £50,000 arises out of the fact that there are more applications for children's allowances than were originally estimated and to the fact that children's allowances are being encashed more promptly than formerly.  These are the factors which render it necessary to <Col N="865" /> ask the House for an additional £50,000 to meet the charge for the service to the end of the year.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £26,913 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1949, for Expenses in connection with Unemployment Insurance (including contributions to the Unemployment Fund and the cost of Supplements), Unemployment Assistance (including the cost of supplements and allowances), the Special Register of Agricultural and Turf Workers, and the provision of Labour for Harvest Work (9 Edw. 7, c. 7; 10 &amp; 11 Geo. 5, c. 30; 11 Geo. 5, c. 1; 11 &amp; 12 Geo. 5, c. 15; 12 Geo. 5, c. 7; No. 17 of 1923; Nos. 26 and 59 of 1924; No. 21 of 1926; No. 33 of 1930; Nos. 44 and 46 of 1933; No. 38 of 1935; No. 2 of 1938; No. 4 of 1940; No. 3 of 1941; No. 20 of 1943; No. 23 of 1945; Nos. 22 and 37 of 1946; No. 39 of 1947 and No. 17 of 1948).</P>
      <P>The necessity for this increased Estimate is due in the main to the modification during the year of the Employment Period Orders.  The original Estimate of the cost of unemployment assistance was based on the assumption that the Employment Period Orders made during 1948 would be similar to the Orders made during 1947.  As was revealed during the year, however, that was not the position.  In 1948 the Second Employment Period Order was for a lesser period than in 1947.  The Order of 1947 debarred occupiers of land exceeding £2 in valuation from applying for or receiving unemployment assistance benefit during the currency of the Employment Period Order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1948 Employment Period Order raised the valuation limit of occupiers of land from £2 to £4, and thus enabled those with holdings of land of a valuation <Col N="866" /> not exceeding £4 to apply for unemployment assistance benefit during the currency of the Orders, whereas in 1947 they could not have applied for that assistance if the valuation of their land exceeded £2.</P>
    <P>A supplementary cause of the necessity for this Estimate is the fact that the Second Employment Period Order in 1948 was for three weeks less than it was in 1947 and thus three weeks' additional expenditure on unemployment assistance had to be met arising out of that cause.  It may be taken that the cost of the modification of the Employment Period Orders in 1948, as compared with 1947, was in the region, as far as we can estimate, of £120,000. The increased cost of unemployment assistance during the year may also be contributed to by reason of the fact that persons who were previously unable to obtain unemployment assistance were entitled to apply for, and to qualify for, that assistance during the past year.</P>
    <P>Another contributory cause arose out of the fact that during 1948 the new Social Welfare Act enabled persons who are living in houses in rural areas which were owned by urban authorities to obtain unemployment assistance benefit at the urban rates instead of the rural rates which previously obtained.  It is the combination of all these factors that is responsible, in the main, for the Supplementary Estimate which is now necessary in order to finance the service to the end of the financial year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Every Deputy in the House knows that unemployment has increased, and I am sure every Deputy is disturbed by that knowledge.  However disturbed we may have been heretofore, we have much more reason for it now in view of the speech made by the Minister for Social Welfare.  Does the Minister seriously expect us to believe that the whole of the £375,000 required, in addition to the sum already voted this year for the payment of unemployment assistance, is due, solely, to the causes that he mentioned? Are these additional unemployed workers recorded on the register not entitled to unemployment assistance? <Col N="867" /> Are they not getting unemployment assistance?  Is not a substantial part, if not the larger part, of that sum required to pay unemployment assistance to workers who were in employment in the previous year and who, it was anticipated when the Estimate was being prepared, would also be in employment this year?</P>
      <P>A 20 per cent. increase in the cost of unemployment assistance cannot be explained away by a reference to minor changes in the scope of the Employment Period Orders, or in the regulations governing the payment of unemployment assistance.  We know that the live register of unemployed workers has shown an increase for every month since February, 1948, with one exception, the month of November last, and that over the whole 12 months' period there has been an average increase of 6,700.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the primary reason, I submit, why an increased Estimate for unemployment assistance is now required, and the Minister would have been far franker with the House if he had given that reason.  I am also perturbed at the Minister's attitude, because I have always believed that if the problem of unemployment here is to be tackled adequately, if public support is to be got for the measures necessary for dealing with it, whether they involve increased taxation, the regulation of trade or interference with private interests, we cannot hope to get it in adequate degree unless we inform the public fully of the position, and the gravity of the position.  I know that there is, in some minds, the idea that the problem of unemployment can be disposed of by concealing it.  Before I became Minister for Industry and Commerce in 1932, my predecessor tried these tactics.  He had suppressed the unemployment statistics and so arranged matters in his Department that it was not possible to extract from them, even by way of Dáil question, accurate information as to the number of unemployed in the country.  I reversed that policy, and I think I was wise in doing so, even though the reversal brought <Col N="868" /> the other problem.  I felt that if we were to get here in this country the right outlook on the problem, we had to bring its gravity home to every citizen, and to that end we arranged not merely for the republication of the weekly unemployment statistics, but set up this inter-departmental committee, which publishes every year a report on the trend of employment and unemployment and which gives a comprehensive interpretation of the whole picture for public information.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister for Social Welfare that he is on the wrong line of policy if he seriously intends that effective action should be taken to deal with the growing problem of unemployment in trying to pretend to the public that it does not exist, or is less serious than the public know it to be.  I know that during the course of the year he gave statistics which were intended to convey the impression that unemployment was decreasing and that emigration was decreasing.  I am sure he did not himself believe that interpretation to be accurate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy refer me to the occasion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister gave information concerning the sales of unemployment insurance stamps which was intended to suggest that the problem of unemployment was contracting, and he gave far more dishonest information concerning the movements of passengers in and out of the country in the height of the tourist season for the purpose of conveying the suggestion that emigration was declining.  If the Minister believes that, then it is about time that some of the back bench members of the Party told him what is happening in the country.  I do not want to exaggerate the picture but I know that there are parts of the West of Ireland&mdash;and I mention Kerry and Mayo in particular&mdash;where the exodus of the population at the present time is as great as it was in the year after the civil war&mdash;in 1924.  Last week there could have been seen at the railway stations in these counties the crowds of people, which we saw in that year saying farewell to their relatives departing for the emigrant ship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="869" /> I have never pretended that there is an easy solution for unemployment or for emigration.  I have never suggested, as others suggested, that there was some secret method which, if applied, would solve these problems overnight.  But when I am faced here with an Estimate for £375,000 to pay out more unemployment assistance and interpret that Estimate as meaning that, instead of moving towards a solution of these problems, we are moving away from them, then I feel obliged to remind the Minister that both he and his colleagues professed in the most specific terms to have a solution for these problems which could be operated overnight; and, if they have that solution, is it not high time that they produced it?</P>
    <P>On the last occasion that I came here with an Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce my successor used the following words:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I said here 12 months ago, and I want to repeat it now, that without the slightest trouble every able-bodied man and woman in this country could be put into useful work to-morrow morning.  There is not a shadow of doubt about that.&rdquo; (Volume 105, column 847 of Dáil Debates.)</P>
    <P>The man who spoke those words is now Minister for Industry and Commerce. He is now in a position to put into operation whatever ideas he had in mind when he spoke those words in 1947.  Why has he not done so?  Has he endeavoured to do so and found that his ideas were not so good?  Has he been prevented by his Cabinet colleagues from applying his ideas?  What is the explanation of the fact that instead of having every able-bodied man and woman in this country put into useful work overnight, we have to record a substantial and growing increase in unemployment and in emigration? Again, at column 950 of the same volume there is the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;When we look for expanding employment a most doleful picture confronts us.  Emigration is still draining the country of its manhood and its womanhood.  The most striking aspect of the problem of emigration <Col N="870" /> is that, although the war in Europe is over for two years, and although we ought now to be setting about the task of reconstruction, and the task of economic and agricultural expansion, the fact remains that we are still exporting from the country men and women on a scale comparable to, and, in some instances, greater than, the rate of exportation during the war period.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have no doubt the Minister recognises the phraseology; it is his own.  He went on, in column 952, to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I do not blame these unfortunate people seeking employment in Great Britain.  It is their only alternative to the workhouse or to beggarly pittances. They have been driven there by economic conditions.  No sense of love of work in Britain induces them to go; no sense of love for British food standards, no sense of affection for a different concept of life.  They go for one reason only, that employment there is a passport to the means of sustaining themselves and providing for their families at home.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The flow of emigration in 1947 was serious.  It gave the Government then in office grounds for concern, and urged them to adopt various emergency devices in an effort to check it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister wants me to concede that we did not end unemployment, I agree fully.  I think that we made very substantial progress in the matter of increasing the number of people in work but the progress did not go fast enough or far enough to achieve the objectives we had in view. However, so long as we were going in the right direction, I did not mind. Now we are going in the wrong direction and, before we are presented with another bill for further unemployment assistance payments because of a further increase in unemployment, I think the Minister for Social Welfare has an obligation to bring the facts to the notice of whichever Minister is responsible so that some steps can be taken to check it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If, however, we cannot discuss on this Supplementary Estimate the Government's failure to check the increase in unemployment and emigration, the failure to put into operation the plan which the present Minister for Industry and Commerce told us could solve unemployment in 24 hours, let us consider the precise significance <Col N="872" /> of the Estimate that the Minister has given us.  It is well known to every Deputy that the increase in unemployment which occurred during the past year and which is still occurring is located mainly in the rural areas.  So far as industrial employment is concerned, we note from the most recent figures published in the <i>Trade Journal</i> that between March and September last year there was no diminution; there was in fact a small increase of 493 in the number of persons engaged in the manufacture of transportable goods.  One might express disappointment that the year 1948, the year in which the most serious shortages of the war years ended, the year to which we were looking forward as a year of great industrial recovery and expansion, should have been able to record an addition of only 493 to the number employed in industry.</P>
    <P>If there has been this increase in unemployment, averaging 6,700 per month, and if that increase is mainly located in the rural areas, the Minister must be aware of the fact that all the indications are that next year the increase will be greater still.  I do not know and cannot estimate what may be the effect on rural employment of special Government schemes for drainage or anything else but the indications are that employment on the land and employment in rural occupations is steadily declining.  There are Deputies on every side of the House coming from counties where it was never the practice to employ agricultural workers on a temporary or seasonal basis who will say that that is now becoming the practice and that workers are being employed by farmers only as and when required.</P>

      <P>I do not want to interrupt the Deputy, but the Minister for Social Welfare is, by statute, supposed to provide money for the relief of unemployment by means of unemployment assistance and unemployment insurance.

Personally, I would have been far less concerned with discussing the matter if the Minister had been a little more frank with the Dáil in his introductory speech.  He knows as well as I do that the reasons he gave for coming here to seek a Supplementary Estimate do not explain the whole or the half of the magnitude of the situation.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Lemass feels that he is entitled to discuss unemployment on this, then as a corollary he may discuss why particular people are unemployed or why people are unemployed in a particular industry with the result that I might appear to be held responsible for a falling off in employment in a particular industry.  My functions are clear and simple.  It is accepted by the legislature that there will be unemployment, that people will be unemployment, and my function is to provide rates of benefit at the scales laid down by statute.  I have no other function.  I cannot, as Minister for Social Welfare, put one single person in employment in industry, agriculture or commerce.  I am not permitted to enter that field of national activity.  My function is to administer the statutes laid down by the Dáil.  I would like <Col N="875" /> you to say, Sir, whether this discussion is to cover the whole field of unemployment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I can relate some of the observations which I would like to put to the Dáil to sub-head H of the Supplementary Estimate.  The special register for agricultural and turf workers has been abolished.  The register was established at a time when we thought it necessary during the war to impose restrictions upon the emigration of persons skilled in agriculture, or of turf workers.  In justice to those who were so restricted, and who might, nevertheless, be from time to time unemployed, we felt that the restrictions should be accompanied by administrative arrangements which ensured to these persons the payment of unemployment assistance at higher than ordinary rates, and the payment of unemployment assistance in circumstances in which they would not be entitled to receive it under ordinary law.  The necessity for the special register for agricultural and turf workers, while these restrictions were in force, arose from the seasonal nature of the employment of many agricultural workers.  Roughly about half of the workers employed for wages in agriculture in past years were temporary employees, while the other half were classified as permanent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I point out to you, Sir, and to the Deputy, that this service was terminated in December, 1947, and is, therefore, not normally on the Estimate of this year?  How the Deputy is going to discuss a scheme which he abolished himself I do not know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to urge <Col N="876" /> upon the Minister the advisability of restoring it, and I do so because, to my knowledge, the proportion between permanent and temporary employees in agriculture is being distorted.  I, perhaps, would not be in order in discussing the reasons operating to that end, but that that is happening is well known to everybody, and if we are to give a new impetus to agriculture by reason of an intensification of the seasonality of agricultural employment, then, as an immediate measure for coping with that situation while longer-term plans are being worked out, the reintroduction of that register might be considered.  The actual financial cost in the past was never very considerable; the organisation to administer it is there and it has the necessary experience to bring the scheme into operation with very little delay.</P>
      <P>The total amount which is required to meet the increased cost of unemployment assistance is £375,000 but the actual amount of additional money required is only £26,000.  It may be no harm to remind Deputies that one of the reasons why it is possible to face this heavy increase in the cost of unemployment assistance without imposing a corresponding charge upon the Exchequer is the fact that by legislation during the course of the year the Minister for Social Welfare transferred the cost of cash supplements under the unemployment assistance scheme from the Exchequer to the insured contributors.  That has brought into the Exchequer in the period in which it has been in force the sum of £178,000.  It is not an insignificant contribution by the employed workers to defray the cost of supporting, if one can use that term in relation to unemployment assistance, the growing number of unemployed workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sub-head G sets out the Appropriations-in-Aid. I note that under Section 3 of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1933, a further sum of £36,800 is required.  I think that section of the 1933 Act, which amended a section of the earlier Act of 1920, relates to the contribution towards the cost of administration of the unemployment insurance <Col N="877" /> scheme, which is met by the Unemployment Insurance Fund.  The contribution, if my recollection serves me correctly, is three-twentieths of the income.  If that is so and if this increased contribution from the fund is due to an expansion of the income of the fund, I should like the Minister to explain to me, if he can, the extent to which that expansion of income is due to the changes in the law which were made last year and to what extent it might be attributable to an increase in insurable employment such as would occur if private turf producers were transferred to temporary road schemes. We know that the number of insured contributors was increased last year when the scope of the Unemployment Insurance Act was extended to include non-manual workers with incomes up to £500 per annum.  I do not know that the Minister attempted to give any advance estimate of the number of additional contributors likely to be created by that change.  I am anxious that that figure should be brought out and that the Minister should do so now, if possible.  In the past we endeavoured to measure fluctuations in insurable employment by calculating the average weekly number of employed from the number of insurance stamps sold.  Clearly, any similar calculations in respect of 1948 will not be capable of valid comparison with earlier years because of this addition to the classes of persons who are required to pay contributions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy appreciates that that only came into operation on the 1st of last October.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>No, I am wrong.  The figure is only published up to the end of September, but as the issue of the journal is for December, 1948, I was hoping that the Minister would by now, March, have later figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the next issue of the <i>Trade Journal</i> is in course of preparation at the present time. However, if the Minister cannot give the information now, that is too bad. I think, nevertheless, that he himself will appreciate the importance of publishing such information as will enable persons who study the statistics available to calculate to what extent increased contributions under the unemployment insurance scheme are to be attributable to an actual <i>bona fide</i> increase in insurable employment or to expansion of the number of persons required to make contributions or to the increase in contributions for which the legislation last year provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see that the Minister anticipates a deficiency in the contribution from county boroughs and urban area councils under the Unemployment Assistance Act.  The House is, I think, aware that the rates of unemployment assistance payable in boroughs and urban areas are higher than those obtaining in rural areas, but, to offset that advantage to these areas, their ratepayers are required to make a contribution to the cost of unemployment assistance.  One would have thought that there would have been no difficulty in calculating to a penny the <Col N="879" /> amount to be received from an urban area or borough on foot of that provision. I should like the Minister to explain how it is that a deficiency of £9,000 is envisaged.</P>
    <P>I would have said a lot more, Sir, if you had not confined me to the particular sub-heads of the Estimate.  I hope I have said enough to convince the Minister for Social Welfare that, if his present function may be limited to the submission of this supplementary Vote to the Dail, there is a matter of such grave importance that the Dáil should have an opportunity of discussing it soon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Lemass can scarcely have been unaware of the fact that he was taking liberties with all previous procedures when he attempted to discuss such wide problems as emigration and unemployment generally on an Estimate for a Department which, he must know, is not empowered to deal with unemployment or emigration but which merely administers services which are consequent on the fact that we have unemployment and emigration. We have had unemployment for a long time and we have had emigration for a long time.</P>

      <P>Well, we shall see.  One would think that the problem of unemployment was a new problem to hear Deputy Lemass talk about it.

That figure would have been very much higher in February last year were it not for the fact that quite a goodly number of people were put into employment at the end of 1947 and the early weeks of 1948.  I am not at all convinced, from looking at the step-up in employment during that period, that some folk who were responsible for putting them into employment had not their eyes on the fact that the 4th February, 1948, was polling day.</P>

      <P>We are carrying on the register this year, to some extent, people who can now qualify for benefit under the Act passed last year and who could not previously qualify.  I do not know to what extent that is so, but we are carrying on the register, to some extent, some persons who were previously deprived of the right to claim unemployment assistance because they would not join the Construction Corps.  These people were previously told that, if they were unemployed, they must join the Construction Corps and would not be allowed benefit if eligible to join the corps.  The Construction Corps not being in existence now, these people can claim benefit and they come on to the register in the <Col N="881" /> employment exchanges and branch offices throughout the country.  To that extent, therefore, they add to the number of persons registered as unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to conceal in the slightest the fact that we have an unemployment problem and must face up to it.  No matter what Government is in office, it is morally bound to face up to that problem.  I do not want to underestimate it, nor do I want in any way to suggest that it is not a serious problem.  The very fact that there are idle men and women in the country where work is available for them is national waste, and I should like to see the problem, because it is national waste, tackled with vigour, with courage and with enthusiasm. My views on the problem and the way in which it might be dealt with are well known.  I hope, however, that some of the schemes already announced this year will make a considerable contribution to easing our difficulties in that respect.  The scheme under which £40,000,000 will be spent on field and river drainage for a period of ten years ought not only to provide substantial employment but should provide it in areas where the problem is greater than it is in others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A calculation which I made the other day for my own information revealed that approximately 28 to 30 per cent. of our unemployment assistance applicants come from the four areas, Kerry, Mayo, Galway and Donegal.  Out of about 48,000 unemployment assistance applicants in the whole country, about 20,000 come from these four areas alone.  I think that, so far as employment is concerned, the problem in these areas is not a problem of industrial employment but an agrarian problem in its roots.  You have in these areas small landholders trying to live on small patches of land.  There are no industries and when there is no work for them on the small and hard patches of land on which they try to live, they come to the employment exchange and try to get there the benefits which are provided under the <Col N="882" /> Unemployment Assistance Acts.  The remedy in these cases is either to industrialise the area, and Deputy Lemass ought to know the difficulties in doing that, after 16 years in office, or to provide some kind of agricultural employment for these people.  But there again the serious problem presents itself because of the quality of the land in the areas where the claims for unemployment assistance are highest.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not desire to follow Deputy Lemass further along that line, except to say that, in many cases and over large areas of the country, the payment of unemployment assistance, as, I think, Deputy Lemass will agree from his previous experience, is a concession to life to people who live in these areas, because there is no employment for them in these areas and unemployment assistance is a means of sustaining life there; but it is not an accurate measure or a measure in any sense of industrial employment. If it is a measure of anything, it is a measure of the width and the depth of the agrarian problem in these areas.  I do not want to be facetious by quoting against Deputy Lemass some of his own hopes in respect of the relief of the problem of unemployment.  I do not want to go back to the merry old days when all the emigrants were to be brought back.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>No emigrants came back, so it was not necessary to provide money, as Deputy Lemass knows well. It is generally agreed that, so long as we have unemployment, it is necessary for the Legislature to provide money to finance the Acts which the Legislature passes for extending relief to those who have necessarily to apply for it, and I need not widen the scope of the discussion, if there is general agreement on that point.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lemass asked why it was anticipated that there would be a fall in the remittances due from the borough councils.  I understand that the deficiency in the receipts from these councils is due to the fact that some of the moneys which we expected to receive this year were in fact paid last year and the local authorities are not going to pay a second time.  That makes it necessary, therefore, to anticipate a reduced income from the borough councils for the current year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He raised the question of the restoration of the agricultural register.  My predecessor in office found it necessary to abolish that register, because he felt it was not being widely availed of. Even though it was abolished when I went into office, I looked at it very critically to see if it was worth while restoring it, but I am afraid that all the evidence which convinced my predecessor that he should abolish it was present, and reinforced my view that its retention was not justified because of the extremely small number of people availing of the arrangement.  I do not see any evidence, nor is any evidence available to my Department, that the reconstitution of the register would induce people to register in the way previously provided, and Deputy Lemass, I am afraid, must accept the view that the abolition which my predecessor thought desirable must still hold, because I see no evidence of any <Col N="884" /> likelihood, if it were reinstituted, that it would be availed of by employers on the one hand, or agricultural workers on the other.  During the year, whenever a shortage of agricultural workers was notified to the Department, we endeavoured not merely to put agricultural employers in touch with the neighbouring employment exchanges but also to relay the needs of farmers to neighbouring exchanges, in the hope that, in that way, persons seeking employment in agriculture might be tempted, by payment of reasonable wages, to migrate within the country for agricultural employment wherever that employment was available.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £30,900 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1949, for Wound and Disability Pensions, Further Pensions and Married Pensions, Allowances and Gratuities (No. 26 of 1923, No. 12 of 1927, No. 24 of 1932, No. 15 of 1937, No. 2 of 1941, No. 14 of 1943 and No. 3 of 1946); Military Service Pensions, Allowances and Gratuities (No. 48 of 1924, No. 26 of 1932, No. 43 of 1934, No. 33 of 1938, No. 5 of 1944 and Nos. 11 and 34 of 1945); Pensions, Allowances and Gratuities (No. 37 of 1936 and No. 9 of 1948); Payments in respect of Compensation for Members of the Local Defence Force (No. 19 of 1946); and for sundry contributions and Expenses in respect thereof, etc.; and for an ExtraStatutory Grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The circumstances that made it necessary to bring in this Supplementary Estimate as shown in the White Paper are as follows:&mdash;Under sub-head C, £4,000 is needed to cover the arrears of wound and disability pensions which come in the course of payment during the year.  When the original Estimate was drafted in the winter of 1947 it was estimated that there was an average of four months to be met. <Col N="885" /> In fact, that average has been greatly exceeded and in some cases there were arrears of pensions falling for payment up to as many as three years. Under sub-head G, there is a sum of £10,300 falling for payment which was not reckoned on this year, the reason being that, in connection with the abatement clauses of the Military Service Pensions Act, the abatement in the case of Civic Guards was heretofore reckoned on their pay and allowances of various kinds.  This year it was found that that was incorrect and that we were only entitled to make the abatement on the pay of the Guards without taking into account the various allowances.  Therefore, under this sub-head we have to make a refund in the abatement, going back as far as 20 years.  The amount of money involved in that refund to members of the Garda Síochána is £10,300.  In addition to that, there is £5,000 in respect of the deficit on current abatement.  It was reckoned that under the appropriate section there would be a reduction of £28,000 and in the working year it transpired that that Estimate was not fulfilled. The abatement came to only £23,000. The balance, £2,700, is simply a normal variation in the expenditure under this sub-head.  The small figure, £131, under sub-head K is required to implement the abatement clause in connection with the Connaught Rangers Act, which was introduced in the course of last year.</P>
    <P>Under sub-head M, Special Allowances, when framing the Estimate for the financial year coming to an end, it was calculated that the number of people falling for special allowances would be at the rate of 20 a month and that the average allocation made to each of the 20 would be £62.  In the working of the scheme throughout the year, we found that we were dealing with and putting through 40 a month and that the average allowance to each person was £65.  That accounts for the extra sum asked for under that particular heading.  That makes a total of £43,000 odd required under this Supplementary Estimate and there is a drawback under other sub-heads amounting to £12,000, leaving a <Col N="886" /> balance of the amount I mentioned at the outset.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister a question?  Did he give any consideration to his promise of last year regarding the men who went out on an earlier Act&mdash;I think it was the 1946 Act &mdash;who were induced to go out, I think, on the 2nd September and where it occurred that immediately afterwards there was an increase in the pension rates to the men who remained on? When the matter was raised by Deputy Cowan and myself, and I think Deputy Cosgrave, the Minister promised that he would go into the matter and asked us not to press him until he had time to consider all the facts.  There are three or four hundred men who gave 21-23 years' service and who went out on a smaller pension than those who remained on and went out three months later.  I forget the dates, as I was not prepared for this just now.  I remember the Minister himself being asked by Deputy Cowan and myself, and I think Deputy Cosgrave, to give these men consideration, and the Minister promised that he would consider whether he could introduce amending legislation to deal with the matter and include them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>A Supplementary Estimate of this kind has become a more or less normal procedure in this House, due mainly to the reasons which the Minister himself has explained.  Looking through the Estimate, there is nothing that I can say very well on any of these points.  I am glad, naturally, to see that the special allowances have been increased to the extent that they have been increased, and the explanation which the Minister has given in respect of sub-head G accounts largely for the sum required under that sub-head.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="887" /> The Minister will remember that, on the Estimate proper, which was discussed during the present financial year, I made reference to two matters to which I asked him to give sympathetic consideration.  I think the Minister himself promised to inquire actively and vigorously into the particular point which I made.  Having fully explained them on the Estimate proper, there is no necessity for me to go over them again.  One referred to the question of the forfeiture of pensions.  The Minister is aware of the circumstances in which these military service pensions can be forfeited.  The idea originally was probably quite all right but a lot of things that appear quite all right very often work out all wrong when they come to work out in practice.  While I was acting as Minister for Defence I came across at least two or three cases in which I felt an injustice was done to the unfortunate people who came under those particular cases which I have in mind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>It would require Ministerial examination.  That is all I am asking and that is all I did ask for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other point which I referred to was that in which the means test was operating very hardly against certain of the recipients of that allowance. Again I outlined one particular case in which the hardship was, to my mind, very extreme.  A sister was supporting her brother and because the brother was securing that means of livelihood from the sister his means were assessed at some extraordinary figure which reduced the special allowance to a niggardly sum of something like 7/- a week.  As I said on that occasion, neither the Government nor any Deputy in this House ever visualised that the ideas which we had in mind when we brought in that legislation would ever operate in that way.  The Minister promised at that time to look into these two cases.  Of course, I have not raised the matter since and from that point of view the Minister could <Col N="888" /> not have given me any information, but I am availing of the opportunity which this Supplementary Estimate provides to ask the Minister if he has been good enough to take any action in the matter and, if so, what was the result of the action.</P>

      <P>This Supplementary Estimate deals with the question of a large sum of money that covers the adjustment of the abatement of pensions. In other words, it covers a good deal of money that has to be refunded to members of the Garda Síochána for the pay which the Minister has discovered through his scrutiny was not correct.  I should like to ask the Minister if he has considered the plea which I made and which, I think, Deputy Traynor made on the main Estimate&mdash;particularly in view of the statement which the Minister has made now that instead of saving, as he had thought, £28,000, they had, in fact, recouped only £23,000.  On the question of the abatement of pensions is he now in a position to state whether the Government would consider the question of abolishing the pensions completely?  I should like to take this opportunity, and I am entitled to do so in view of the fact that the Supplementary Estimate deals with moneys that arise under the abatement of pensions to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am very pleased to see an increase of £21,000 in the amount for special allowances.  I think that shows that quite a considerable number of persons entitled to those special allowances are receiving them now.  I think Deputies on all sides of the House will be glad to know that the machinery of this Act is being administered in such a way that an additional sum of £21,000 is necessary to provide these supplementary allowances this year.</P>
      <P>I am also glad to know that the matter of the abatement of pensions in regard to allowances as distinct from the salaries of Gardaí has been adjusted.

It was a claim that members of the Gardaí made over a long period and I am glad to know that that is being satisfactorily settled and that only the salary will be liable to abatement while this business of abatement lasts.</P>
      <P>While there have been declarations made by the Minister from time to time in answer to questions here and in answer to deputations that he was considering as sympathetically as he could the claims of a number of people for military service pensions who are not now in receipt of those pensions, I can see at once that legislation will be necessary for that purpose.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to know from the Minister, as regards special allowances, if anything can be done about the age and the means test, so that people may qualify.  I think the Minister will agree that people of 68 or 69 years are hardly capable of selfsupport. We have had a few cases like that in Cork and when questions were put the reply invariably was that these people had been found capable of supporting themselves.  I am sure the Minister will agree that nobody will employ a man of 68 or 69 years. Such a person is incapable of getting employment sufficient to support him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the means test, I do not <Col N="891" /> know if the Minister can interfere there.  Perhaps he can through the medium of the Ministerial Order that Deputy Collins spoke of.  The means test in connection with that special allowance is extra severe, especially for people with children.  If there is a boy or girl working up to 18 years of age all the earnings are taken into account as income.  When the child is over 18 it is only the profit from the earnings after the cost of support is deducted that is taken into consideration. With the old age pensions and other means tests the position is entirely different.  I do not know whether the Minister can do anything about it.  I merely draw his attention to the hardships involved.  A few cases were brought to my notice recently. People could not draw a special allowance on account of the earnings of their children; they could not do anything until the children reached 18 years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am thankful to Deputies for the way they discussed this particular Supplementary Estimate. There is evidence all round that any suggestions made were certainly made with the idea of helping on the work and assisting the unfortunate people who have to depend on Votes such as this for assistance.</P>
      <P>With regard to the special allowances and the regulations governing them, there are two things very definitely and explicitly laid down in the Act, matters over which no Minister has any control short of amending the legislation.  A person must be definitely and permanently incapable of earning a livelihood because of bodily infirmity.  That is a matter for a medical board and not a matter for any Minister.  No Minister can interfere with the findings of such a board.  Most medical people, if not all, are weighted on the side of the patient.  Most medical men are oversympathetic as between a patient and the State.  It is on the findings of the medical board, and solely on those findings, that incapacity is decided on.  It is merely a political accident&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister will excuse me for intervening?  I think they take the age of 70 as being the <Col N="892" /> qualifying age for the special allowance. Would the medical board be induced to accept 65 years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The medical board is tied down to finding the person incapable, by reason of health or his physical condition, of earning a livelihood and no Minister can interfere with the finding of the board.  If the medical board sent to a Minister a report that an allIreland footballer was unfit to earn his livelihood because of physical incapacity, that is the end of it, as far as the Minister goes.  The man gets his allowance even though he could break the Minister's neck in a tussle.  The Act lays it down that it is a matter for the board, and the Minister is powerless to interfere.  All my information, and all the information available to my predecessor, is that those medical people approach that work in a sympathetic frame of mind.</P>
      <P>I admit cases come along that any individual Minister would rather he got another report on, but we have to put up with the report we get.  All the Minister can do, if he thinks it is a fairly hard case, is to get it reviewed 12 months later.  That is laid down in the Act, that the case can be reopened that day 12 months, but it cannot be reopened within the period of 12 months.  Both my predecessor and myself, since this Act started to operate, reopened a great number of cases at the end of the 12 months' period.</P>
      <P>With regard to the means test, in order to save the time of the Dáil I read through the introductory statement rather rapidly and I gave only the bigger items.  The reason that the average of £62 in the original Estimate was raised to £65 was that any modifications that could be made in a means test were made in the course of the year arising out of things raised here last year.  There have been certain modifications in the means test, with the result that the average allowance has been raised by £3 per head.</P>

      <P>Deputy Traynor <Col N="894" /> raised the question of forfeiture.  I agree with him absolutely that there is an unduly harsh continuing penalty on certain unfortunate individuals because of the law which governs forfeiture at the moment.  That particular question of giving to the appropriate Minister the right after a certain lapse of time to review forfeiture is actually under Governmental consideration at the moment.  I do not know what the outcome will be, but it is under consideration.</P>
      <P>Deputy Byrne put a question as to the different scales of pensions applicable to people who left the Army on certain dates.  I think that owing to the confusion created by the multiplicity of small Acts dealing with the Army the Deputy was under a misunderstanding. That does not come within this group of Army pensions at all.  A promise was, however, made to the House to have the matter considered. That promise was kept and the matter has got very, very careful consideration.  Whatever the outcome may be, it is being considered.  But none of us has our own way absolutely in this world.  Perhaps it would be a better place if we had.</P>

The gross total of the additional sum under the three sub-heads is £993.

      <Col N="897" /> Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann considers that action should be taken without delay to obtain a survey of the natural resources of the country with a view to their early development&mdash;(Deputies Connolly and McAuliffe).</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoderickJamesConnoll" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I was giving to the House last night a brief résumé of the attitude of the Labour Party for a considerable period to this question of an organised survey of the resources of the country with a view to their speedy development.  I instanced the first elaboration of that idea in the constructive programme issued by the Labour Party 13 years ago.  This was followed as a matter of dealing with the emergency, by another document entitled <i>Planning for the Crisis</i> issued in 1940.  I may say that in every election programme of the Party, and in particular, in the programme for the 1943 election, there was embodied, among other demands, a demand for a survey with a view to the development and utilisation of the nation's resources.</P>
      <P>To our mind the principal work of the Dáil and of the Government should be directed towards these questions of economic importance.  The scope for such a survey is extremely large.  One could dilate upon it for a considerable time but I do not propose to delay the time of the House in an attempt even to sketch in the basis of that survey. The arguments that I have adduced already I believe to be sufficient to show the necessity for some authoritative body giving us the basis, the facts and the figures on which any plans can be erected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is heartening in one respect to know that the Statistical Branch will enlarge its activities, will cope with the demand for more detailed information and thus may function to assist the industrial authority to which I referred in the first portion of my speech. However, even that to my mind would not be sufficient, and would not give us <Col N="898" /> what this motion asks for.  It is just one of many indications of the method of tackling these various problems which have been pronounced over a number of years and have led to lamentable results.  Everyone in this House, for instance, is interested in the economic development of the country and in particular in that development as a means of providing employment, as a means of breaking the back of this problem of unemployment which has consumed the time of this House and the energies of Ministers and the Government for many years.  To my mind we have not yet, even after 20 years, got that basic information that would be essential to dealing with this problem in a manner that might possibly hold out a solution for it.</P>
    <P>We had to-day, on an Estimate, an inquiry by Deputy Lemass in regard to certain aspects of the unemployment figures.  I have every sympathy with him and with any other Deputy who desires information on every aspect of that matter, who wants it fully analysed, who wants these figures brought into a perspective that will give us a real view of the situation, because only by doing so can we possibly harness the resources of the country in a proper manner.  As the Minister said, there is a hard core of this unemployment problem.  Up to now, it appears we have not taken cognisance of how that hard core should be shifted or whether that hard core is a permanent feature of the present capitalist system obtaining in this country.  Governments may take credit for an abatement of unemployment; Governments may be blamed for an increase in unemployment but what we really require to know and what we should know, as a basis for any real development of the country, is the type of unemployment which can be solved by economic and Governmental measures. There was instanced to-day the fact that, of applicants for unemployment assistance, from 28 to 30 per cent. came from poor areas along the western seaboard.  In these areas there is not any type of industrial employment which could be considered as giving constant employment to the people <Col N="899" /> resident there.  In other words, as understood by economists in the past at least, this is a peculiar type of unemployment that bears very little relationship to the unemployment existing in any of the large cities and along the eastern coast.  The effect on the individual may be the same.  He may be deprived of his livelihood; he may have to rely on the State for assistance but, from the point of view of economic development, from the point of view of what can be done, it is quite obvious that this mass unemployment there cannot be looked upon in the same manner in which one looks upon the seasonal or temporary unemployment that takes place along the eastern seaboard and in the main industrial towns.</P>
    <P>It is questions like these that a survey such as is indicated by the motion, as being required, would bring to light.  Problems like these would be thoroughly analysed.  We would get the full facts of the matter and, at the same time by an examination of the resources in these areas, it could be the task of some planning commission or some industrial authority to relate the particular type of unemployment to the actual needs of that countryside and the potentialities of that countryside for the abatement of that peculiar type of unemployment.</P>
    <P>It may be that it is only by some particular type of home craft or home industry that some little inroad might be made upon that.  On the other hand, it would be much more feasible to my mind and more likely to break the back of the problem if large works of public importance could be undertaken in those areas.  Up to the present time there is very little data on which to base any real plans for those areas.  There are fugitive reports here and there and there are schemes for re-afforestation and for different types of works in those areas.  Whether they have any reality or not in relation to the natural resources of those various areas, the climatic possibilities and all the other factors that have to be taken into account, is a matter of opinion.  They could be only definitely solved or put upon a practical plane by <Col N="900" /> the establishment of such a survey as I have indicated.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to say that this question is as urgent as any question could be.  We have in the past indicated what has been done in other countries. On the famous occasion when I drew the attention of the House to what is being done in New Zealand the then Minister for Finance, the present President, Seán T. Ó Ceallaigh, gave reasons why this country could not be compared with New Zealand and desired to hear no more about New Zealand.  If we take his objections as valid, we can retreat from that idea of comparing what has been done by a Labour Government in New Zealand to something near home and seek in Denmark, for instance, what possibly might be some inspiration to us in regard to this matter of national development.</P>
    <P>No one, I think, who has any acquaintance with the situation of these two countries will fail to agree that the situation in Denmark is far more unfavourable than it is here.  They have not the fertility, they have not the natural resources that we have. But they have, by their planning and by development, been able to do far better than our industry or our agriculture has been able to do.  They have not the possibility of re-afforestation that we have.  Most parts of their country is swept by very severe wind which retards growth.  Their growing season, not only with regard to trees, but every other from of plant life, is far shorter than ours.  They have no natural resources such as we have.</P>
    <P>They are in the same position as we are in regard to coal, they have to import coal as we do but, as well as that, they have not the possibility of hydro-electric development such as we have.  They have to produce their electricity from imported coal or to obtain the electricity from neighbouring countries, such as Germany.  Yet, despite all these disadvantages and many others which could be mentioned in relation to a comparison with this country, Denmark is able to maintain, with a far higher standard of living than we have in this country, twice as many persons to the square mile as we can maintain.  That, <Col N="901" /> I think, is some sort of indication that a small country can do a lot better than some of the pessimists think.</P>
    <P>If we do harness our resources in this country, there is no reason why we should not step up the productivity of the country; there is no reason why we should not maintain a greater number of persons to the square mile. We want to get a basis for all that by such a survey as is asked for in this motion.  I cannot see that the Government will seriously resist this motion and, if it does meet with the approbation of the Dáil, I think that this type of work is work that should commend itself to the people of the country, not only as a temporary measure but as something of a far-reaching significant fact.  I therefore recommend it for acceptance to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion.  It is impossible to address oneself to this motion without, first of all, saying to oneself: &ldquo;This is my own, my native land.&rdquo;  All that is in this country, all its resources are for us to develop to the fullest extent and utilise for the benefit of our nation, for our people and for posterity.  In my opinion, this motion is very wide and far-reaching in its scope.  It covers almost everything from the centre of the earth below this island to the sky.  When I say this island, I mean this island, because in considering our resources we should ignore the temporary boundary which divides our country.  The great resources of this country which Deputy Connolly suggests that we should survey might be divided into three main groups: first of all, the people of this country, who are the greatest resource that any nation can have; secondly, the land of the country; and thirdly, our industrial and mineral resources.  In that regard, we have in our people a resource which <Col N="902" /> other nations might envy.  We talk about the overcrowded condition of the western seaboard; we talk about the overcrowded condition in the immediate vicinity of the mouth of the Liffey, and we fail to realise that the people who overcrowd these areas and the people who are sparsely scattered over the rural areas are amongst the best in the world.  Given the opportunity, they can do great things in this country.  That is why it is so urgently necessary that we should accept the spirit of this motion and survey our further resources calmly and dispassionately.</P>
      <P>The land is the next great resource. It is on the few inches of soil spread more or less evenly over the face of our country that our people will have to depend mainly for their existence. What is wrong with the land is that it is impoverished, short of the necessary fertilisers and the mineral ingredients which make for maximum production. Into the land we must put phosphates and lime and from it, so far as possible, we must take the surface water which tends to deteriorate such a large area of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the full utilisation of the land, I do not intend to dwell on that aspect of our national life.  I consider that this motion is mainly concerned with other of our resources than land. We can seek to ensure that our industrial potentialities are developed to their maximum.  First of all, it is essential I think, that there should be a spirit of confidence in our capacity to produce and, secondly, of products which it is essential to produce.  Any spirit of defeatism should be eliminated from the mentality of our people.  It is a true fact that the people who are engaged in non-productive work in this country form a very large section of the total population.  They include the best educated and brainiest section of our people because non-productive occupations almost invariably yield a higher income than that which is available to the producer whether in industry or agriculture.  We have in our professional classes, in our Civil Service, and in our commercial classes a huge section of people, well educated and influential and with considerable wealth, and yet adding little or nothing <Col N="903" /> to the actual wealth of the country. Amongst that big section we have a sort of ingrained prejudice against the producer whether he be an Irish farmer or manufacturer.  It is impossible for one to mix with these non-producing sections without finding amongst them a certain contempt for both the farmer and the manufacturer.  I do not know how that mentality originated, but there is no doubt that it exists and that it is detrimental both to agricultural and to industrial progress. Until we can instil into our people, young and old, and particularly the young, a spirit of confidence in the Irish producer, in the ability of Irish people to produce goods and commodities as efficiently as anybody else, it will be difficult to make progress and to increase the output of the nation.</P>
    <P>I believe that in the case of our industrial resources there is a wide scope for development.  A number of manufacturing industries have been established here over the past 25 years.  It is essential that those engaged in them should be given the clearest and most emphatic assurance that their rights will be safeguarded in the future, and that the whole nation will be behind them in their efforts to make their industries more efficient and more capable of delivering the goods which the country requires.  Lack of confidence amongst those engaged in productive industry always makes for inefficiency. If workers feel that the industry in which they are engaged is likely to collapse at any time, they cannot give of their best or become really efficient.  In the same way, if owners believe that there is no real security they cannot go all out to develop their industries and plough back into them more capital or more of their profits.  I think that these are the first essentials to industrial development.</P>
    <P>I am not so enthusiastic about too much surveying, controlling or regulating. I believe you cannot develop any industry without taking considerable risks.  Too much planning often defeats its own purpose.  I knew a farmer who planned an ideal farmhouse and outoffices. The buildings were so efficiently designed that they would be the most efficient that could be thought <Col N="904" /> of.  He spent years drawing up plans but never got down to the actual work. Every time that he finished a plan he found that there was some little defect in it, and then set about making something more perfect on paper.  The point is that one has to get down to the actual work in order to achieve anything.  That is why I say it is better that industries should be established which may be not entirely perfect rather than that we should go on planning and planning and do nothing practical.  Provided reasonable security is given, I believe that private enterprise is capable of very wide development in the industrial field.  I believe that, if there is reasonable security for industries which have been established and for others which may be found desirable, they will go on producing until they are in a position to supply the country's needs and perhaps compete with each other, thus providing the competition which is so essential for industrial efficiency.</P>
    <P>I do not believe in the idea that protection, either by tariffs or quotas, is something that should be applied only to infant industries and then be completely withdrawn.  Protection means more than that.  It is the idea that our nation should stand up for its own native industries, and that even though an industry may be established for a long time it should not be exposed at any time to unfair competition. Take, for example, such industries as those engaged in the manufacture of woollen goods, clothing and boots.  It would not be fair or right, even though our own industries in these lines were long established that they should be exposed to unfair competition from some outside source.  These are ideas which, I think, the Minister will agree with.  Still I think it is necessary that they should be stated.  There will always, of course, be the danger that in certain sections of our industrial life there may be a certain amount of exploitation either by the owners of industry or the skilled workers engaged in it.  Exploitation can take place by either of these sections and must be guarded against.  It is necessary to guard against exploitation by those engaged in the production of a key raw material for industry.  A great deal of <Col N="905" /> the trouble during the emergency arose from the fact that people engaged in the production of key raw materials exploited their position and thus held the industry and the community up to ransom.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>At first glance, I assumed that natural resources meant mineral resources but, on reading the motion and listening to Deputy Connolly, I am convinced that it has a much wider meaning.  In considering natural resources we should contemplate broadly the type of industry which is desirable. I do not believe that industrial efficiency can be secured only through mass production.  There can be a considerable degree of efficiency in the small type of industry and in having industries distributed throughout the country.</P>
      <P>If the discussion on this motion were confined to mineral resources I would direct the Minister's attention to County Wicklow where there are valuable mineral deposits which have been developed and utilised over a long period of years.  It is absolutely essential that exploration and development should continue until the extent of the minerals in the area is discovered exactly.  That work should be carried out by the State as there is no mining firm in this country that has the necessary capital to engage in exploration on a large scale.  I hope the Minister will have something to say about the future of the Avoca mining area.  I am interested in this particular area, not only from the point of view of the employment entailed in the development and utilisation of the mines, but also from the point of view of using to the best possible advantage the natural resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the question of anthracite deposits in the Leinster area. During the emergency we realised the value of native coal and it is essential <Col N="906" /> that we should take all possible steps to develop the mines to the fullest possible extent.  During the emergency there was a shortage of skilled workers in the industry.  We should guard against that by steady and progressive development.  We must bear in mind that it is vitally necessary to enlarge the supply of native fuel.  Fuel and power are vitally necessary.  Supplies of native fuel can be very largely expanded by the development of machine won peat.  It should be possible to extend the use of machinery to the smaller bogs and even to privatelyowned bogs.  That is a matter which would require some consideration.  The question of producing a small type of machine for turf production should be considered.  Consideration should be given also to the development of our power resources.  Nothing should be left undone during the next few years, when plans may be developed for schemes of electrification.</P>
    <P>These are some of the thoughts which occur to one in connection with this motion.  We want from the Government actual work.  We want, first, the fullest encouragement given to private enterprise and, secondly, large-scale development of those branches of enterprise which cannot be undertaken by the private individual and which are urgently necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Morrissey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not any difficulty whatever in accepting this motion and I think it was well that the motion was put down. It certainly gave Deputy Connolly an opportunity of covering the whole field very fully and that was an example which Deputy Cogan was very glad to be able to follow.  However, I am glad to say that the position is not quite as bad as one might gather, listening to Deputy Connolly's speech, because the Deputy seemed to suggest that no survey had been made in this country and that we had very little information&mdash;if any at all&mdash;regarding our natural resources.  It is, perhaps, true to say that we have not as much information regarding our <Col N="907" /> natural resources, particularly on the mineral side, as we would like to have, but it is only fair to say that geologically the survey of this country has been completed some years ago and the geological surveyors are engaged all the time in revising and supplementing the information which they have got. It is also true to say that we have a considerable amount of information regarding whatever coal deposits there are in the country and we have a lot of information about what is, perhaps, the most valuable, and what is certainly the most extensive, deposit in the country, namely, gypsum.  That deposit is probably one of the most valuable deposits in Europe.  That should not be anything new to the House, because I am only repeating a statement which my predecessor made here some time ago.  I would like to inform the House that the very extensive drilling and boring which is still going on on that deposit is being paid for by the State.  The work is being done by, I think, a Swedish firm under the supervision of our own geological survey, and I am informed that that work will be completed within the next six or 12 months.  Deputies are probably aware that two companies at least are working some of the gypsum deposits and one of the reasons why the present boring and drilling operations are being carried on is to ensure that the further working and development of that deposit will be done on a properly planned basis.</P>
      <P>As far as coal is concerned in the Leinster area, Castlecomer is being worked as usual and worked, as far as I know, to the fullest extent.  The State is paying for the work that is being carried out at Slievardagh to a maximum of £50,000, and a new pocket or shaft has been opened up in a different part of that district.  We are hoping that coal of a fairly good quality may be discovered which may be worked as a commercial proposition.  At the moment I cannot say more than that. As Deputies know, Arigna coal is being worked to some extent by private enterprise and a fair quantity of that coal is being marketed, though mainly, I am afraid, to State or semi-State companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="908" /> A private company has started work at Silvermines in North Tipperary and zinc and lead are the main commodities which they expect to get there.  There will, perhaps, be other minerals also and those people seem to have faith in the future of that particular deposit and are backing it with their own money.  The position at Avoca is that the Government have decided to go ahead with what was planned up to a point.  We had further concentrations and we got further information from the experts employed by Mianraí Teoranta and work has been authorised to the extent which, they say, will be necessary to enable them to say whether it would be desirable to go any further.  The experts informed the Government that for an expenditure of £120,000 they believed they would be able to say whether the project should be dropped altogether or else make a recommendation that it would be desirable to expend further moneys on it to continue the workings another stage.  That is the position about Avoca.  Work is going on there and it will continue up to that point.  I do not know whether I am leaving out any other mineral area or not.  It is a question, as Deputy Connolly said, of our natural resources.</P>
    <P>Deputies are aware that it was announced during the last couple of weeks that the Government had decided to proceed with the full development scheme planned by Bord na Móna, that is the first development scheme with provision for increased cost over and above the original scheme, the provision of 2,000 houses and the second development scheme.  That was decided, as Deputies were informed, to secure at the end of ten years an output of machine turf of approximately 2,000,000 tons.</P>
    <P>Deputy Connolly and Deputy Cogan spoke about the necessity for land development and land reclamation and I do not think there is any issue there on any side of the House.  I think we are all clearly of the opinion that the land of this country has not been developed and that even that part of it which is arable is not being worked either to the fullest or the best purpose. It would also be agreed that not merely <Col N="909" /> hundreds of thousands but millions of acres of land in this country are now practically useless but that they could be made fully productive, by drainage mainly, and by liming, manuring, clearing rock and scrub and so on. The Government scheme in that direction has been announced.  The Government proposes to embark on a scheme over a ten-year period which, we hope, will lead to the reclamation of somewhere in the neighbourhood of 4,000,000 acres of land.</P>
    <P>That is more than one-third of our present total acreage of arable land. That scheme envisages more than merely draining or reclaiming in the sense of clearing scrub and rock and other obstruction.  It will also liven the land, where necessary, and there will be a certain amount of fertilising of that reclaimed land.  I think myself that that is a scheme of great magnitude. It is a scheme that will be of immense and lasting value to this country and it will develop in the most practical way our greatest natural resource.</P>
    <P>We have also announced our intention to step up as quickly as it is humanly possible to do so the acreage to be put under trees, with a minimum target of 25,000 acres per year.  That is not going to be easy.  That is not going to be done overnight.  I am speaking now from recollection, but I understand that up to this year our highest annual acreage in that connection was somewhere in the neighbourhood of 6,000 acres.  I do not profess to be an expert&mdash;indeed, I do not profess to know a great deal about forestry. Nevertheless, Deputies may recollect that I have always been a bit interested in it.  I have invariably spoken on the Forestry Estimate in this House because I never could understand, and I cannot understand, why greater progress in planting was not made in the last 25 years.  Unquestionably the necessity for it is there.  Undoubtedly the land which is suitable for afforestation and not suitable for anything else is there, and there is no question but that the labour is there.  However, as far as this Government is concerned, we are aiming at that target.  We believe it <Col N="910" /> can be done and we certainly are going to do our best to get it done.</P>
    <P>There was a great deal of talk about Irish industry, about Irish industrial development, about lack of confidence, about unfair treatment of people engaged in industry, and so forth.  Deputy Cogan told us that a clear assurance should be given to Irish industrialists to the effect that they would get that measure of protection which would enable them not merely to start but to develop their industries.  If there is any person, industrialist or otherwise, in this country to-day who is in doubt as to the position of this Government in relation to Irish industrial development then that person is in doubt only because he wants to be in doubt and only because he refuses to see or to listen.  I certainly have tried to the best of my ability to make my position and the position of this Government in relation to the development and future of Irish industry as clear as I possibly could.  The Taoiseach himself at the annual dinner of the Federation of Irish Industries and on other occasions also, but particularly on that occasion, made the position, in my opinion, crystal clear.  The attitude of the previous Government to the development of Irish industry is well known.  The attitude of this Government is, I believe, equally well known. I want to say here what I said at the annual meeting of the Federation of Irish Industries.  No Irish industrialist and no person who is thinking of starting an industrial project in this country need have any fears from the point of view of Government policy.  I went further and I said that he need have no fears not merely from the policy of this Government but, so far as I could see, from that of any Government that is likely to succeed it.  If there is lack of confidence to-day&mdash;if there is&mdash;it is due entirely to the fact that certain Irish industrialists and other people who are not industrialists are deliberately and maliciously mixing politics with industry. There is no question whatever about that and there is no doubt about it.</P>
    <P>I know that there was a deliberate campaign&mdash;it is weakening; it is dying out&mdash;to create that very lack of confidence <Col N="911" /> in the hope that industrialists who were contemplating starting industry here would not start and in the hope that existing industrialists who were thinking of expanding and taking on additional employees would not do so.  That is a very dangerous game to be playing, whether that game is being played by industrialists or by politicians and, frankly, it is not fair that that should be used as a political weapon.  It is not fair to the country. It is not fair to the industrialists and it is not fair to those who are dependent upon these industries for their livelihood.  If there is any Deputy in this House or any industrialist either inside or outside the House who is in doubt about any specific point relating to the policy of this Government in connection with the development or future of Irish industry then I would be glad if that point were put specifically. But nobody, of course, believes that everything in connection with Irish industry is 100 per cent. right.  I do not believe it.  My predecessor in office did not believe it.  The previous Government did not believe it.  That was one of the reasons why they introduced the Efficiency Bill.  Am I to be taken, therefore, as being antagonistic to Irish industry if I say that whilst we are prepared to give the fullest measure of protection necessary to protect a sound Irish industry we are not going to put a protective wall around inefficiency in this country?  I am not prepared to do that and my predecessor was not prepared to do it, as he made perfectly clear.</P>
    <P>I do not want to have my words twisted when I say, as I have said on more than one occasion, that industries, and particularly certain industries, in this country cannot expect to remain all the time in the nursery, that some day or another they are expected to grow up and must be expected to stand on their own feet. If statements such as these are to be construed as exhibiting antagonism towards Irish industry and the development of Irish industry, or as showing a desire to injure Irish industry, and if Irish industrialists are so deficient in intelligence as to swallow that sort of propaganda, then <Col N="912" /> I am afraid it is difficult to see them in the rôle of efficient industrialists.</P>
    <P>This Government has shown in many ways its desire to see industry develop and expand, and we came to the conclusion very shortly after our election as a Government that there was something lacking in regard to the measures necessary, if Irish industrial development was to be brought to the pitch to which we hoped it would be brought and all believed it should be brought, within a comparatively short time.  Irish industry has made very little expansion in the past ten or 12 years and I have no hesitation in saying that one of the things that shocked me in connection with it recently was the discovery that, in respect of protected industry, no fewer than 51,000 duty-free licences had to be issued for the import of goods, and I say that, on the face of it, that indicates that there is something wrong, and radically wrong.</P>
    <P>If the rate of industrial expansion and development was to be accelerated, it was quite clear that there was a necessity for a body such as the body the Government has announced its intention of setting up, the industrial development authority.  It is because we want to see that that work will be done thoroughly and expeditiously that it was decided that this body should be a full-time body and it is because we decided that the work should be done thoroughly, expeditiously and well that we decided also that, so far as it was possible to secure the men, nobody would be a member of that board except a person with practical experience, a person with knowledge of industry and industrial development and a person deeply interested in that drive towards the fullest possible development of manufacturing processes in this country.</P>
    <P>That board has been given very wide terms of reference and it will be given every assistance, but naturally it will be expected thoroughly to investigate every project put before it.  Nobody will question that.  I do not think anybody will question this statement that, up to now, there was not in existence in this country any body or any machine equipped to make that <Col N="913" /> thorough examination of applications which were made for various forms of protection, nor was the machinery available to make those searching inquiries which should be made, and certainly there was not available any body which could of itself initiate anything, which could, as the motion says, survey the country and see if it was possible that a particular industry&mdash; let it be small or large&mdash;should be started in a particular part of the country, to see whether there was in that part of the country some native raw material which could be processed here and no body whose duty it was to bring to the notice of would-be industrialists or promoters the possibilities of any particular area.  That was the position as I saw it and that is another reason for the establishment of this board.</P>
    <P>This board will have a big job to do. It will have perhaps the most important task from a national economic point of view that was ever entrusted to any board.  It will need the help, the assistance and the co-operation of everybody who is interested in the development of what is called the industrial arm.  It will have to examine what very often could not be examined as fully as it should have been and what cannot be examined as fully to-day as it should be, the impact which the imposition of certain duties or quotas may have upon other industries, and very often other protected industries.  Of course, above all, we must have machinery which will see effectively that the consumer will not have to pay one halfpenny more than he should reasonably be expected to pay.  Now, again, I hope that that will not be distorted into an accusation of profiteering or looting against Irish industrialists, but I am afraid that, too often, people talk as if there were only one side to this problem, as if the consumer side were hardly worthy of consideration.  I should say also that, for the sake of Irish industry, one of the duties of a board such as this would be to see that a particular industry was producing the best quality article that it was possible for that industry to produce.  I am not talking about comparisons now, or of what is produced in New York or London or somewhere <Col N="914" /> else.  It should be producing up to the quality which it is competent or able to produce.</P>
    <P>Another very important side of this matter for which there was no proper organisation and which is not only desirable but, in my opinion, very necessary, if not essential, was to ascertain the effect and the use being made of protection, no matter in what shape it was given, over a number of years, to ascertain whether that protection was being utilised by the person who got it for the purpose for which it was given originally, or whether, having reached a certain point where he was deriving a fairly decent profit, he was merely quite happy and was sitting down behind that protective wall and making no real effort so to expand his particular industry as to meet the requirements of the Irish market.  Those are just a few of the matters&mdash;I will probably have another opportunity of discussing the industrial development authority&mdash;with which they will have to deal.</P>
    <P>Reference was made&mdash;and I was glad it was made&mdash;to the prejudice which undoubtedly exists in this country against Irish products.  Deputy Cogan said it existed against agricultural products as well as against industrial products.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It exists against the producer, but not against the products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe it exists against the producer, either, as far as the agricultural side is concerned. There is no doubt whatever that there is a blind prejudice there against Irish industrial products.  There is no doubt that there are people in this country&mdash;and, in particular, there are distributors in this country&mdash;who never lose an opportunity of belittling the article merely because it is produced here at home.  That is something that all of us ought to try and put an end to and we ought to kill it.  The best way to kill it and the most effective way of killing it is for the Irish industrialist to put an article of the best quality he is able to produce on the market.  But there must be more than merely the article itself being of the highest quality: it must be <Col N="915" /> marketed in the right way.  Very often an article of the very highest quality is so badly marketed, so badly presented for sale, that the inferior article, which is more attractively marketed or more nicely boxed and papered, is bought at a higher price in preference to the superior Irish article.  I know that that prejudice obtains; and, for some extraordinary reason, within the past two or three years, it has been on the increase, I think.  I would like to see some sort of a national campaign started to break down that prejudice.</P>
      <P>We have all heard of people who have bought a commodity made in Ireland and who have complained bitterly about the finish or about the bad quality, but they usually content themselves with complaining to their neighbours or writing letters to the evening papers.  Now, if they would only send some of the samples of badly made, badly produced or badly finished articles to my Department or to the Federation of Manufacturers or to some public representative, so that that article could be brought straight home to the manufacturer and he could be asked to account for it, then they would be doing a much more effective piece of work, to ensure that that type of article would not again appear on the market here, than if they wrote a hundred letters to the papers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to take any more of the time, as other Deputies want to speak and there is only a limited time on this motion; but I would like to say this, in conclusion.  I have faith in the future industrial development of this country.  I believe there is a wide field there yet to be tilled and I believe there are many commodities that we are now importing that we could produce ourselves.  All I can say&mdash;and apparently it does not penetrate&mdash;is that, as far as I am concerned as Minister for Industry and Commerce, I am prepared to recommend to the Government the fullest measure of protection that is necessary for the development of any sound industry. Let me be quite clear on this, and nobody knows this better than my predecessor. There are many projects put up to the Department of Industry and <Col N="916" /> Commerce that no Minister with any sense of responsibility would recommend to a Government or would stand over, and there are many applications made for protection that no Minister would recommend or stand over.  I do not think that will be contested.  I want to suggest that we are not helping the development of Irish industry by trying to make merely a political plaything out of it.  We are getting an opportunity&mdash;when I say &ldquo;we,&rdquo; I do not mean the present Government: I mean this present generation&mdash;for the development of our country that no previous generation of Irishmen got.  I believe that, if we settle down to the job, we can make a very marked advance, but it requires co-operation and understanding.</P>
    <P>It also requires that certain industrialists in this country&mdash;there are few I am glad to say&mdash;will get rid of the belief that this State protects their industry merely to enable them to put more money in their pockets.  There are certain industrialists in this country who believe that protection is given to themselves personally.  It is not. It is given by the State because it is believed that it is in the national interest to do so.  Whilst this Government is not averse to any industrialists or anybody engaged in commerce or trade in this country making reasonable profits or even generous profits, it certainly will not tolerate people who are trying to get away with profits which are utterly unreasonable.  I do not want to say any more on that line at the moment.  There will be other opportunities.  However, industrialists and would-be industrialists ought to get this into their heads.  There is no political Party in this House, or in this country so far as I know that is not in favour of protection for Irish industry. There is no political Party in this House so far as I know that is not desirous of seeing industry expanded and developed in this country.  As we have said on more than one occasion, the development of the industrial arm is the only alternative to the emigrant ship.  This country never could, cannot now and never will, in my opinion, be able to accommodate all its people on the land.  The people who cannot be <Col N="917" /> accommodated on the land must be put into industry either in this country or in some other country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>When Deputy Connolly, in the course of his speech proposing this motion, told us that he was going to outline briefly the Labour Party's plan for national economic development I thought that this debate was going to get a rather historic significance because it is a plan we have all been waiting to hear.  It emerged that the plan is the old one of establishing a council to prepare a plan.  All my life or, at any rate, all during the famous 16 years to which so many references are made in this House, I have fought this idea of a national economic council.  It is the panacea of theorists but it is the nightmare of planners. Industrial development in this country has enough obstacles to overcome before it gets going.  Drop this idea of a council.  It is not merely a fifth wheel to a coach.  A coach with five wheels could conceivably move.  It is like asking the racehorse to win the Derby harnessed to a plough.  What do we want with a council?  Set up a dozen councils with the general functions to which Deputy Connolly refers and the only thing they can do is to interfere with the work of men and organisations that are already there doing the precise things that have to be done.  A survey of our natural resources, if it is related to material things, will be concerned with minerals, water-power and turf.  If it is related to activities it will cover things like drainage and afforestation.  I have not assumed that the Deputy contemplated a survey of agricultural resources.  There is, of course, a need, and perhaps the only need that is not met by an existing organisation, for what I might call a man-power survey and to which I will refer briefly later.  For mineral exploration there exists an organisation with adequate legal powers to carry out all the exploration that is required. The extent of its prospective activities has been planned by experts.  I congratulate the Government upon their change of mind with regard to that development programme.  Now that they have changed their mind and are prepared to authorise Mianraí Teoranta to <Col N="918" /> cope with the exploration work that was planned I have no fear that they will not give it enough money.  It has been my experience that once mineral exploration is started upon the danger is that it will be continued long after the reasonable possibility of discovering workable minerals has passed, rather than stop too soon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why we took precautions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I had taken all necessary precautions before proposing the Bill to the Dáil.  So far as water-power plans are concerned the Electricity Supply Board is fully authorised to explore them and is exploring them.  There is one doubt in my mind in that regard.  The demand for electricity in this country grew rapidly in each year before the war.  I assumed personally, and I think the experts of the Electricity Supply Board, while more conservative than I, were nevertheless prepared to agree that the annual increase in the demand for current after the war would be double or nearly double the pre-war increase. On that basis the five electricity generating stations which were planned during the war and which are now under construction will, when completed, be barely sufficient to meet the electricity demand existing when completed.  In the following year there will again be a deficiency in generation capacity which, if it is to be met, will require the construction of a new station to come into operation that year, which must be planned about this time.  It is, of course, a rather technical matter to relate generation capacity to production capacity because in this country, where water-power stations are backed by steam stations, there always may be at any one time a generation capacity sufficient to meet the immediate demand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the basis of reasonable safeguards against the possibility of a very dry season which would reduce the water-power stations' capacity and other difficulties arising at the same time, we will, in 1951 or 1952, be in the position that we will have inadequate generation capacity unless the programme of new generation stations which was prepared during the war is <Col N="919" /> expanded now and the necessary steps taken to bring a new station into production in that year or very shortly after that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that the Electricity Supply Board has been preparing plans for the development of various rivers but the actual formation of the detailed proposals for development takes a long time and although the legal process of approval was curtailed by the 1944 Act there is still a process to be followed.  I am glad also that the Government has decided to proceed with the larger machine turf programme which the board proposed in 1947.  I am anxious, however, to get some information from the Minister in that regard.  Because of their hesitation about proceeding with that plan last year, one year was lost.  We are now into the beginning of the turf-production season of 1949 and, as I understand it, the board will not have the capital resources to embark upon that larger programme until legislation has been passed by the Dáil.  It is unlikely that that legislation can be passed and brought into effect in time to increase these production activities in this year, but it is obviously desirable that there should be no delay about producing the legislation; otherwise another year will be lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be no avoidable delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as drainage is concerned, there was a drainage commission. Drainage is not a matter similar to the development of a material resource like turf.  It is something that can be examined from the point of view of preparing a general strategic plan.  Once that was done the implementation of that strategic plan in each catchment area was entrusted to the Board of Works.  I do not think that establishing an economic council will improve upon the work which the Board of Works is capable of doing in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As for afforestation, I think it is not sufficient for the Minister to say that <Col N="920" /> the Government propose to step-up the rate of planting from 6,000 to 10,000 or 25,000 acres a year.  That is not the point.  The point is, will the Government use for afforestation purposes lands which they can get voluntarily, or will they acquire land compulsorily?  If you are going to rely on land voluntarily offered for afforestation, there is no use talking about any particular target, because the area that can be planted depends on the amount of land available.  If you acquire land compulsorily, I advise you that you are stirring up a great deal of difficulty for yourselves, because where land is acquired compulsorily there is always local opposition to its acquisition and that local opposition has, on occasions in the past, been demonstrated in the form of the destruction of the young plantations.</P>
    <P>The issue for the Government on afforestation, therefore, is whether they will confine themselves to the area of land that can be voluntarily acquired for the purpose, or whether they will take the step that we would not take of compulsory acquisition. My recollection is that the aim of the Forestry Department in our time was to step-up planting upon the basis of land voluntarily acquired to 10,000 acres a year and our advice was that 10,000 acres a year would in the course of time yield all the commercial timber that would be required industrially here.  I do not want to discourage the Government from going further than 10,000 acres in the year.  If it can be done, it will not be a directly commercial undertaking, although it may be justified and even have commercial advantages from the point of view of scenic improvement.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to discuss the Government's proposal with regard to the establishment of an industrial advisory council because, even despite what the Minister said, I do not know enough about it to express a definite view.  I understood the Minister to say that this advisory council will have functions similar to those of the old Tariff Commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say any such thing.  Of course, the Deputy is bringing <Col N="921" /> out the old Tariff Commission as part of the game that is going on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister agrees with me that it is not desirable that we should reconstitute, under any name or in any form, the old Tariff Commission, we can start off to examine this proposition, with the prospect of arriving at some common view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no desire to revive the old Tariff Commission, and the Deputy knows it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood the Minister to say that any person proposing to the Government to engage in industrial activity which would require protection or assistance would be required to go to this advisory council and have the proposition thoroughly examined there.  That is what the old Tariff Commission did.  It did it in a very elaborate and roundabout way.  The objection to it was not the procedure that was followed, but because it necessitated this prior examination by such a body of proposals for industrial development before action was taken by the Government.  If that is going to be the position here, then it will be impossible in times of normal trade to prevent the forestalling of Government action through the importation of substantial quantities of the goods concerned and there will be, in fact, very little gain to the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The trouble never was to examine the case made by persons seeking protection. That examination was carried out efficiently in the past by the officers of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  The case put forward by everybody who got Government assistance in that form looked to be a good case and no amount of investigation could have demonstrated that it was not.  The only trouble that arose was that occasionally the plans of the industrial promoters did not work out precisely as they had anticipated, and honestly anticipated.  Their costs proved to be higher; their capital expenditure was greater than anticipated and ultimately they came to say: &ldquo;You gave us assistance on the understanding that our prices would be equivalent to the prices in Great Britain.  We find <Col N="922" /> we cannot do it and we will have to go 5 or 10 per cent. above the British prices.&rdquo;  Your Tariff Commission could never find that out in advance.</P>
    <P>I have no objection to that body investigating the desirability of continuing protection to any industry or requiring protected industries to justify the continuation of the protection.  All that type of examination is useful in keeping protected industries up to a reasonable level of efficiency.  It does no damage in so far as the protection which has been given in the securing of a market remains in effect while the examination is proceeding.</P>
    <P>I have always argued in favour of examination after protection had been imposed and against examination in that public way beforehand.  But, if there is to be this requirement upon people proposing to engage in industry to submit their plans to this council and have them fully investigated, I hope there is no truth in the report in the newspapers that it is intended to put upon this council a member of the Oireachtas.  I cannot conceive any circumstances in which persons proposing to engage in industry would agree to have their plans investigated in that way by a person not merely active in politics, but a member of the Oireachtas.  If there is to be a member of the Oireachtas, is it intended that he should have any functions in taking responsibility for the decisions of this body in the House of the Oireachtas in which he is a member?  Can he be questioned there about its work and can he speak on its behalf and be regarded as its public spokesman?  The report may not be correct but, if it is, I would urge the Minister to change his mind.</P>
    <P>I have no objection whatever to any of the other names mentioned.  They seem to me to be obviously indicated by their present positions and past experiences, but I think it would be very wrong to put upon a body of this kind, carrying out the functions which the Minister outlined here, a person who is a member of either House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoderickJamesConnoll" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy, I think, did not hear the Minister saying it <Col N="923" /> would be a full-time body, and obviously it would not be compatible with the duties of a full-time body to have a member in either House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  Deputy Connolly spoke about the need of a survey of man-power.  I am not sure what he has in mind, but I think it is time that we had a thorough investigation of our live register of unemployment.  I do not believe the live register is an accurate register of unemployment in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>When did you find that out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have always asserted it.  Deputies on the other side of the House are now beginning to learn that I was always right.  However, I want to discuss this in a less contentious way than Deputy Davin usually deals with subjects in this House.  I do not believe that the 80,000 people who are on the live register are in fact all available for work and, to that extent, the register exaggerates the number of unemployed.  On the other hand, I believe there are people available for work who are not on the register.  One of the most remarkable experiences in my time was that although by all our efforts in industry and otherwise we increased the average number of people at work by practically 100,000 there was no corresponding diminution of the number on the live register.  It is quite clear, therefore, that there is a pool of labour available in this country which is attracted to new employment when it is created and which is not represented by the persons on the live register.  When Deputy Smith was in charge of the Office of Public Works he encountered some anomalies in the administration of Government grants for one purpose or another, such as the anomaly of a Government contractor in a particular town excusing himself for the non-fulfilment of his job on the ground that workers were not available when the official register showed 50 or 100 potential workers as unemployed in the town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Smith carried out a personal <Col N="924" /> examination of the position of the live register in the year 1946 and the reports of the work done by him and his staff in that year should be available to the present Government.  My recollection is that it showed that from one-quarter to one-third of the persons on the register were physically or mentally incapable of continuous employment; from one-quarter to one-third of the remainder were capable only of clerical work and certainly could not be usefully employed upon the type of work usually available under Government schemes; and that the actual number of persons that could be taken off the register by an expansion of Government or local authority activities of a constructional kind did not represent more than one-third, or from one-third to 40 per cent. of the total register.  I would not, however, like the House to conclude from that that the size of the unemployment problem which we are facing is very much less than is suggested by the employment register. There is, as I have already said, that unknown pool of labour mainly in the western parts of the country, the full dimensions of which have never been measured.</P>
    <P>Unemployment assistance in the towns is a form of help to unemployed persons; but over the whole of the west of Ireland it is a subsidy to endemic poverty and many of the people who are in receipt of it do not regard themselves as unemployed. Nevertheless, they are there available for employment and they will accept more remunerative employment if it is offered to them.  There are immense difficulties in meeting the unemployment problem in the west of Ireland through industrial development.  I tried to do that.  It will be recognised that if anybody starts a new manufacturing enterprise in some western town he is at a disadvantage as compared with his competitor in the same industry in Dublin.  I tried to meet the situation by the enactment of legislation which gave me the right to confine particular industries to those who undertook to carry them on in these western districts. There are Deputies in this House who know the abuse and misrepresentation to which I was subjected <Col N="925" /> and the attacks that were made upon me on the ground that I was conferring monopolies.  The sole purpose of those monopolies was to try to keep the industries in the west of Ireland. If any Deputy has the time or leisure to go back over the old debates he can read there what was said about that effort, particularly by the present Minister for Agriculture.  Yet, if we are not going to reverse Cromwell's policy of &ldquo;to Hell or to Connacht,&rdquo; there is I think only one way of getting rid of that endemic poverty in the west of Ireland and that is by industrial development based upon available mineral resources, if they are there and, if not, industrial development helped to establish itself there by the use of such special powers as the Control of Manufactures Act confers, or by other forms of assistance.</P>
    <P>I think there is need for that examination of our man-power position which Deputy Connolly has in mind. I do feel that we have not got in relation to that particular natural resource all the information that it is desirable we should have.  I note that the statistics service has been transferred from the Department of Industry and Commerce to the Department of the Taoiseach.  If that is merely a change in the machinery for the administration of the Department it is of no great consequence.  Deputy Connolly suggested that the scope of our statistical service should be enlarged. I think the scope of it is large enough.  There have been published by our statistics service reports of a more comprehensive kind than are available in most European countries.  The trouble is they do not come out quickly enough and the one need there is in relation to this statistics service is to expedite its work.  We are still in the position that most of the reports consequent on the 1946 census are not yet available; so far as data relating to national income or consumption expenditure is concerned the latest year for which we have figures is 1944.</P>

      <P>The point I am trying to <Col N="926" /> make is that I would not urge upon the Minister to follow Deputy Connolly's advice to extend the scope of the service. I would rather urge upon him some improvement in the existing services in the matter of speed in the publication of reports.  I do not think the Minister for Industry and Commerce should be unduly perturbed because industrialists and others, as he said, had doubts and expressed doubts as to the industrial policy of the Government. I think it is perhaps useful that they did so, certainly in the first months of the Government's existence, because they got from the Minister for Industry and Commerce, from the Taoiseach, and from other Ministers declarations which were essential and declarations which might not have been made if these doubts had not been expressed. I think it is desirable such declarations should be made because, no matter what the Minister for Industry and Commerce may feel inwardly about industrial development, it is not as easy as all that for his Party to lay down its past.  I am not now questioning his sincerity or the sincerity of the declarations made by the Taoiseach in that regard, but I still say that where the work of the Department of Industry and Commerce overlaps the work of the Department of Agriculture or the work of the Department of Finance there is at the present time a conflict of policy apparent which is leading to dead-lock.  I am prepared to support that statement by specific illustrations. I have not time to do that now and I do not propose to do it now, but I shall take the opportunity of doing it on the Vote on Account.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief. The most satisfactory feature of our industrial statistics is the speed with which Irish industry recovered after the war.  Almost immediately after the war we were able to record a volume of industrial production higher than pre-war and, at the present time, substantially higher than pre-war.  I think that is an indication that the enterprise and energy of our industrial leaders and the capacity of our workers to work were not diminished.  I think Deputy Connolly completely misread the significance of the figures relating to the output per worker between 1938 and 1944.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1944 in many industries supernumerary workers were being employed. The output of these industries had fallen, owing to the contraction in the supplies of raw materials but there were many employers who had not reduced their staffs in proportion to that contraction in output.  Consequently, you got a false picture of the number of employees in relation to output for that year.  I am quite certain that the figures for 1947 and 1948 will show that there has been a substantial recovery in the output per worker employed.  It may be lower than the pre-war figure but it will be higher than the 1944 figure.  The 1944 figure does not indicate either a lessening in the capacity for work on the part of the workers or <Col N="928" /> a lessening of efficiency in the equipment of industry.</P>

      <P>I am prompted to rise to utter a very enthusiastic &ldquo;hear, hear!&rdquo; to the statement of the Minister, when he referred to the attitude of certain sections of the purchasing public and, particularly of some distributors, towards Irish manufactured articles.  It is unfortunately only true to say&mdash;and it is a sad reflection after our national Parliament has been in existence for 27 years&mdash;that there is a very big number of our distributors who push the imported article in preference to the home-manufactured article and who are inclined to say that the very fact that an article is Irish manufactured makes it an inferior article, without any further inquiry into the matter.  I do not know how the Minister is going to deal with that problem or what the Dáil can do about it.  The Minister referred to the necessity of educating public opinion in this regard.  For my part, I merely wish to say that I agree with the Minister that it is a very sad state of affairs that such a feeling should exist amongst certain distributors in regard to Irish-manufactured goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoderickJamesConnoll" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the statement of the Minister for Industry and Commerce that this motion is acceptable to him.  I trust it will be duly and quickly implemented according to its terms.  The Minister traversed quite a wide field, but I should like to emphasise again that it is not with the individual activities of individual fields that we are concerned in pressing this motion.  What we are concerned with is to integrate all the different activities, to which he and Deputy Lemass have referred, into one economic whole. The Minister referred to several points. He talked about a geological survey with which we are all familiar, about the gypsum deposits, the coal mining industry at Castlecomer, Avoca silver mines and about the reclamation of 4,000,000 acres.  He also talked about the extension of the activities of Bord na Móna.  He referred to the reafforestation programme which is to be stepped up to 25,000 per year. Finally, he dealt very elaborately with <Col N="929" /> the points I have raised in reference to the industrial authority.  So far so good.</P>
      <P>What we want in the survey is some method of co-ordination of these various activities.  Deputy Lemass has shown himself to be an unrepentant upholder of <i>laissez faire,</i> a good old Liberal.  He has stated that he has fought a fight for 16 years, to use his own words, against this idea of an economic council, but he has lost the fight.  It was a losing fight.  It was the fight of the old Liberals against the idea of a planned economy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>He used the argument that it is a fifth wheel to the coach but he forgets, and those who think like him forget, that he wants an orchestra without a conductor.  He states that there are bodies with adequate legal powers to do certain things, that there is a body that can carry on the exploration of mineral resources and that the Electricity Supply Board can examine into the question of the development of our water-power resources.  Then he says that the other bodies that control drainage can look into and examine the possibilities of the catchment areas and so on.  But these are separate activities, and the complaint inherent in the motion is that these activities went on, in so far as they did go on, without any relation one to the other, without any relation to a general economic plan for the whole of the country.  That is what is desired in this motion and that is the necessity for an economic council&mdash;that there would be such a fitting together, such a dovetailing of all these plans that we shall derive some greater benefit from their exploitation than we could out of the unrelated activity of the various bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We shall have the stimulus of cooperation and we shall be able to get an examination into the man-power resources of the country in certain areas such as Deputy Lemass referred to.  He agreed with me on the one <Col N="930" /> hand that there should be an examination into labour forces.  On the other hand he did not like the idea of the development of the activities of the Statistics Branch which must be part of the work of such an authority as will be set up to take a survey of this country.  These are contradictory ideas.  If we want to have an examination into the figures of unemployment, if we want to get a true idea of the real hard core of unemployment, how it is constituted and how it can be broken, that is a matter that will come within the scope of the Statistics Branch.</P>
    <P>When I talked of productivity in 1944 as compared with 1938, I was well aware of the point which the Deputy mentioned, but I was emphasising that without such an authority, we have no up-to-date information in regard to this whole matter.  All his talk about an unemployment register and his exchanges with the Minister for Social Welfare on this matter had no reality because there was no such body which had conducted a survey or made an investigation which would have given us basic data, with details which would enable us to frame our policy on sound grounds.  For these reasons I think it will be agreed that where you have so many conflicting forces and where so many factors have to be taken into consideration, there will always be necessity for an economic council to coordinate the activities of the various bodies we have heard mentioned here, for the common good and that is the plea behind this motion.</P>

      <P>I move :&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that, in order to ascertain costs of production in agriculture with a view to ensuring that the efficient farmer will get his cost of production and a reasonable profit, one or more medium-sized farms should be acquired by the Department of Agriculture in each county, and under the direction of the county agricultural officer should be run entirely by hired <Col N="931" /> labour employed at the minimum rate of wages fixed by the Agricultural Wages Board. &mdash;(Patrick Cogan, Patrick O'Reilly.)</P>
    <P>I should like to express my regret that I do not see the Minister for Agriculture present.  I am not sufficiently optimistic to assert that anything I might say might influence him very much, but his presence at any rate would have a stimulating effect on the discussion.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite sure the Minister would be present if it were possible.  This motion is very similar to one which was tabled by me some years ago, I think it was away back in 1945, when we had a different Dáil, constituted on different lines.  It is just a repetition of an idea which has been expressed in many forms by farmers all over the country.  Farmers naturally say: &ldquo;Here is the Department of Agriculture setting out to teach us how to farm.  Why do they not, instead of telling us what to do, take a farm and show us how well they can do it themselves?&rdquo; That is one aspect of the problem.  But another and more important one is that there is nothing more urgently needed at present than that the costs of production in agriculture should be accurately ascertained.  There is only one way to ascertain them accurately and that is by running a farm under the auspices of the State and seeing how much profit or loss can be made out of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for such an investigation of costings is very apparent to anybody engaged in agriculture or even mildly interested in it.  In every portion of this city and amongst every section of the community outside the agricultural population we hear people talking about the enormous profits farmers are making out of the land.  We hear people talking about the extraordinary prosperity of agriculture at the present <Col N="932" /> time and when farmers seek to dispute those assertions they are just told that they are not serious, that they are trying to put their finger in somebody's eye.  The farmer, however, has no redress. He may produce figures; he may spread them over days or years and he may work them out as accurately as possible; the rest of the community will not accept them but simply say that the farmer is trying to make a case for himself and trying to deceive the rest of the community.  But if the State, that impartial body, that body which is representative of all sections of the community, that body which is supposed to govern in the interests of all sections, were to undertake the running of a farm, then the figures would at least bear evidence of not being prejudiced in one way or the other.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, two established methods by which costs of production may be ascertained.  One is to adopt the method which was adopted in this country during the first world war and for a year or two afterwards and which has been adopted in Northern Ireland and Great Britain, that is to take a number of farms and record the accounts of those farms as accurately as possible.  That is one method and I am not saying anything against it. I feel, however, that a better method would be for the State to run a farm. I should like to see the two methods adopted.  I should like to see this survey carried out here as in Northern Ireland.  Some years ago we got a promise that such an investigation would be carried out by the Department of Agriculture but, for some reason or other, the then Minister ran away from it and the present Minister has not made up his mind to adopt it.</P>
    <P>Great credit is due to the Irish Sugar Company for undertaking a costings survey in regard to the production of sugar beet.  That progressive company, which is under very able direction, did decide a few years ago to meet representatives of the Beet Growers' Association and in conjunction with them set up a costings investigation.  I believe that that investigation is giving good results.  In addition, some time ago we had in Cork an investigation into <Col N="933" /> milk production costings carried out by Professor Murphy.  More recently we had an investigation into general farming costings in Roscommon carried out by Mr. O'Connor.  All these surveys are desirable and a step in the right direction.  I think, however, the investigation which this motion envisages would go further and would be more definite, more concise and clearer than anything carried out up to the present.</P>
    <P>When, practically four years ago, our motion for a demonstration farm to investigate costings was before the House it was extraordinary the peculiar ideas which were expressed by various Deputies in regard to the matter.  I hope there will be no misunderstanding in regard to this motion.  I hope nobody will say that he does not understand it.  I hope nobody will say that it is proposing that the State should waste the taxpayers' money running farms because, if agriculture is reasonably prosperous, there is no need to waste one shilling upon these farms. These farms, if acquired, must pay if agriculture is prospering, if they are typical of the average farm, and if they are run with reasonable efficiency.</P>
    <P>I should like to explain the idea which Deputy O'Reilly and I had with regard to this proposal.  What we suggest is that the county committees of agriculture, under the direction of the Department of Agriculture, should acquire one or two farms in each county.  They would be put under the control of a manager who would employ workers and pay them the standard rate of wages.  They would keep accounts of all items of income and of outlay, and the farm, in addition would act as a demonstration farm and be open to inspection by the general farming community.</P>
    <P>This is one of the ways in which the ideas of the Department could be very effectively put across to the general farming community.  These would be places which farmers would visit on Sundays and Holidays, or during their spare time, to see how things were being done.  They would study the accounts which would be publicly displayed and be published in the local papers.  Thus we would have in every <Col N="934" /> county an agricultural centre.  We would have the Department of Agriculture put on its mettle to prove what it can do.  Unless prices were so low as to make farming an entirely uneconomic proposition there is no doubt whatever but that this farm should pay.</P>
    <P>I know some of the arguments that will be used against such a proposition. One is that it might not be fairly conducted, that the Department in its anxiety to prove that farming was profitable would cheat, as it possibly could cheat, unless it were carefully watched.  For example, it could go in for some specialised branch of farming that would not be available to every farmer. The first condition, in order to make it fair and equitable, is that it should be an ordinary commercial farm, run on the lines of the ordinary farm in the county.  That is to say the Departmental farm would not engage in any line which would not be open to every farmer in the county to engage in. Again of course the figures in regard to income and outlay would be carefully recorded and would be available for inspection at any time of the year.</P>
    <P>Another argument that might be used against this demonstration farm is that the Department in running it would be at a disadvantage as compared to the average farm.  I do not accept that argument.  The Department would, of course, be running it with paid workers.  We know, of course, that very many of our farms are run with family labour.  That might be regarded as one disadvantage, but against that you have a number of advantages. First you have the selection of the manager.  He, of course, would be the most efficient man that could be found. That is an advantage it would have over the ordinary farm which in course of time, goes to a farmer's son or a relative.  They have not the power of selection which the Department would have in this case.  The Department would also have the advantage that the manager, in all probability, would be a young man in the full vigour of his health.  That would be an advantage over the ordinary farm in the country which may be run by old people or a widow and in some cases by invalids who might not have the physical <Col N="935" /> strength to work a farm with the highest possible efficiency.  Thus the Department would start off with the initial advantage of having a man of youth, vigour, experience and efficiency in charge of the farm.</P>
    <P>From the farmer's point of view the argument might be put up that the Department would have one tremendous advantage over the average farmer in that it would have unlimited advantages at its disposal.  I do not think that should be so because I think the Departmental farm should be financed in the same way as the average farm is.  If credit facilities and capital are readily available to the ordinary farmer they should also be readily available to the demonstration farm.  Thus the Department farm in each county would start on an equal footing with the ordinary farm.  If they are able to make profit on this farm then there is no reason why every farmer should not make a profit.  If they are unable to make a profit, then there is an established case for a revision of agricultural prices.  Of course that is the keynote of the entire experiment.</P>
    <P>I think we are all agreed that the farmer who runs his farm efficiently is entitled to a fair price for his produce, one that will leave a reasonable margin of profit.  This experiment carried out in each county will enable the Department and the Government accurately to ascertain what is a fair price, and on that basis the prices of such commodities as are fixed by the State can be ascertained.  There is a controversy going on in the country at present in regard to the price of milk supplied to creameries and to the cities and towns to consumers.  Cows will, of course, be kept on this farm.  The cost of producing each gallon of milk will be ascertained. In the same way, we have had controversies in this House as to what constitutes a fair price for bacon pigs.  On this demonstration farm pigs would be kept and fattened, and so we would be able to ascertain what constitutes a fair price, based on these accurately ascertained costings.  Everything depends, of course, upon the experiment being carried out with absolute fairness.  If there was any <Col N="936" /> attempt to cheat in one way or another the experiment would be of no use, but if carried out with honesty, accuracy and absolute impartiality this demonstration farm would, I think, become of immense advantage to progressive agriculture: it would become a spear point in each county and would be followed by the entire farming community in that county.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that this farm would be a demonstration farm in addition to carrying out ascertained costings. It would not be an experimental farm, because as such it could not be used as a means to ascertain costings. For example, if the Department were to try out new varieties of seeds on that farm and they failed, of course that would completely invalidate the entire investigation.  On the other hand, if it were to produce on the farm some variety of seed of superior quality, not available to the ordinary farmer, then it would make the test unfair and unsatisfactory.  If it were carried out on the lines which Deputy O'Reilly and I suggest in this motion, it would be of immense value.  It would deprive critics of the Department of the argument that the Department are preaching what they are afraid to practice.  An ounce of practice is worth a ton of precept.  It would drive home any progressive theory that the Department would have with double force if they could show that theory put into practice and if it proved profitable.</P>
    <P>It may be said that various demonstrations are carried out on farms throughout the country, that is to say, plots of land are manured in a special way that is recommended by the Department or seeded in a special way that is recommended by the Department, but such demonstrations do not show the all-in crop produced on an entire farm.  They are simply piecemeal demonstrations.  On a farm run by the Department on the lines suggested in this motion there could be a complete and comprehensive demonstration which could be followed by any farmer.</P>
    <P>A question might arise as to the size of the demonstration farm.  My view is that the farm should be typical of the <Col N="937" /> farms in the county or, if it was not possible to decide on a farm which would be typical of the farms of the county, there could be two farms of varying size, say, one of 30 acres and another of 60 to 80 acres.  I recommend the motion to the House and trust that it will be accepted.</P>

      <P>I have already apologised to the Deputy for the absence of the Minister for Agriculture.  He asked me to convey his apology as the particular occasion when this motion came on happened to coincide with the date and hour that he had already committed himself to meet other agricultural interests and to express on his behalf the hope that this debate would not terminate this evening and that he would not miss the benefit of any of the remarks passed by the mover of this motion but, rather, that he would get greater value from them by reading them at his leisure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a person intervening in the debate, I find it difficult to understand exactly why the urge is so strong from agricultural representatives for a detailed system of costing.  As a person on the ditch, I am prepared to say very emphatically that the system of fixing prices for any commodity without a very detailed knowledge of costing is crude and fallacious but that, once you do fix prices based on a knowledge of costing, in fact what you are compelled to do is to limit profits, and that is a two-way sword that, if I were depending on farming, I would not be too anxious to put into the hands of any Administration. The principle of price fixing is in fact dependent on the principle of ensuring reasonable profit, limiting those profits in the good years and ensuring or guaranteeing those profits in the lean years.  I do not know that, all round, farmers would be too enthusiastic to have a two-way sword of that nature wielded up and down the country.  I agree with Deputy Cogan that it is more or less a slander to refer <Col N="938" /> to the farmers as people that are making gross profits, growing enormously wealthy.  It is equally fallacious, unsound and misleading to refer to farmers as a body of the community that are, as it were wallowing in destitution. Farmers have their good years; farmers have their bad years and, unfortunately for the country as a whole, there are far more bad years than good years.</P>
    <P>This idea of some costing system is a generally accepted principle in the modern State.  Up to a couple of dozen European nations have adopted different systems of costing and if we are, as we appear to be, either in the middle of or approaching a phase of price-fixing all round, it is obvious then that some system of costing must be adopted sooner or later.  But, accepting the principle that we should have some system of costing, it is quite a big step from that to say that we must have a definite system of costing and that we must base that costing system on a plan that is as unlike the average farm in the country as it would be possible to devise.  If any value is to be derived from a costings system, it can only be because the system adopted approaches as nearly as possible the average conditions under which the average farm is worked.  I do not think that anybody, be he the most militant or enthusiastic farmer, would challenge the soundness of that.  To say that costings must be based on a special farm in a special area where there must be no labour whatever but hired labour and where the farm is run by a part-time overseer who has other duties for which he has specialised training and other calls on him is to paint a picture as unlike the average farm conditions in the country as it would be possible to conceive.</P>

      <P>That is getting further away from the average picture. On this farm there is to be no labour except hired labour at the minimum rate of wages, a whole-time and, presumably, highly-paid permanent manager and the part-time supervision <Col N="939" /> of an agricultural instructor for the area.  This man must be compelled to engage in unusual administration which is never asked for in any holding.  Every egg broken or unbroken will have to be accounted for in the most thoroughly modern Civil Service manner.  We are to take the results of that particular scheme and apply it as though it were average.</P>
      <P>That is not an argument against costings, but it is certainly an argument against the particular system of costings, advocated here.  I do not know &mdash;I am open to correction&mdash;of any one of the 12 to 20 countries that have adopted a costings system for the benefit of farmers and for the guidance and information of the State that has adopted a system on the lines advocated in this particular motion.  As far as I understand and as far as I have any information of the systems adopted, they fall into three crude classifications.  One which may be referred to as the financial system, is based on a simple profit and loss system of accountancy over a very considerable range of farms.  It has the advantages of simplicity and that an unlimited range of farms can be covered and that it does not give any particular headache or worry to the farmer, but what can be said against it is that it is merely a rough-and-ready kind of indication.  It may give you a reasonable picture of the prosperity or otherwise of the industry in an over-all degree, but it is of no assistance whatsoever in dealing with the particular matters that interest Deputy O'Reilly and Deputy Cogan and which have been thrown around between themselves and the Minister for Agriculture such as the costing of one particular branch of the industry, dairying, wheat or beet, or so on.  It is merely a rough indication of the health of the industry as a whole and beyond that it is of no particular value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another system is the analytical system based on a very close analysis of every little phase of activity on a particular group of farms with a rigid system of bookkeeping, stocktaking and accountancy, where everything is costed down to the man hour, the child hour, the horse hour, etc., etc.  That does <Col N="940" /> undoubtedly give valuable results and gives them in detail, but it is liable to the fallacy indicated, I think, by Deputy Cogan that it is so very detailed and comprehensive that without an immense staff it would only be applicable to a very small number of farms.  In this country farming conditions are so very varied that no matter what particular small group of farms you took it would be open to anyone to say that it was not a fair illustration of the farming industry generally.</P>
    <P>The trend in most countries recently is towards indulging in what is called the survey system.  Under the survey system you can cover a very considerable number of similar or dissimilar farms.  It is based on a questionnaire which can be sent out generally, a questionnaire of a simple kind but of a practical kind.  It is usual for somebody like the chief of the agricultural committee to be there to advise or assist the individual farmers to whom the questionnaire has been sent in the compilation of the answers.  Valuable information can, of course, be secured from a number of those questionnaires sent out over a great number of holdings.</P>
    <P>A Minister for Agriculture who is desirous of having a costings system from his own angle will have to select the costings system which is best for his own country.  It is one of those things where we should learn from others, learn through the mistakes of others and let others do the spending while we get the benefits.  This whole matter and the various designs have been under consideration by different Ministers for Agriculture and the Department of Agriculture since price fixing became a feature in our agricultural economy.  Various tentative steps have been taken over a small geographical range of country and over small fields of the industry.  Deputy Cogan referred to some of them which took place in Cork last year.  Very valuable surveys of one kind or another have been carried on with the assistance of University College, Cork, mainly by Professor Murphy.  Many of those returns are available but some of them have not yet been published.  I think that it would be a mistake, by <Col N="941" /> way of challenge or by way of motion, to rush the Department or to rush the State at this particular moment into any particular plan that happens to appeal to any particular Deputy or any particular group of Deputies.  When Deputy Smith was over here he took up the office of Minister for Agriculture with enthusiasm and with certain ideas on this point.  Six or eight or ten months later he came to this House and stated candidly that as a result of closer study of the question he had changed his mind on that particular point.  It is possible that if Deputy Cogan were here he would change his mind and that he would not be so wedded to sample farms of an artificial kind with a whole-time supervisor and so forth.  The Deputy is just as experienced in world affairs as any of the rest of us.  Let us be honest with one another.  Suppose you had State-owned farms, that is, farms owned by the State and financed by the taxpayer. Suppose you had State-owned farms where the man running the same sized farm across the road would have three labouring men and perhaps two part-time.  How many do you think they would have on an estate farm&mdash; with the Minister and the Government subject to political pressure all their lives?  Why, you would have a score of them no matter what Government might be in power.  Everyone of us knows that, and none of us knows it better than Deputy Cogan.  The result of running farms on that line would be that you would wonder if the people who were living and working on them were the ghosts of the farmers who should have died of starvation&mdash; because every farm would be running at an appalling loss.  That would not help the Deputy.  It would merely be a joke.  It would not help the Government and it would not help the State because it would be crazy and unreal.</P>
    <P>If we are to have a system of costings let us have a system of costings that will stand up to any normal test. Let us have a system of costings that approaches as nearly as possible to the average farming economic unit in this country and when you get that system of costings let it be maintained if you like by the State, let it be run by the <Col N="942" /> State, but let it be helped by the industry as a whole.  I believe you would then be getting somewhere in the way of price fixing, in the way of profits fixing, in the direction of ensuring that the farmer on whom the whole life of the nation depends would, directly or indirectly, not only find it possible to live fairly well in good years but would have a certain shield, a certain protection, against the blizzard of bad years.  In that way prices would then be fixed firmly and soundly according to the reasonable cost in the good year and in the bad year.  But such a system, in order to stand up to time and tide and criticism, would have, as nearly as possible, to approach the conditions existing on the average farm and certainly should not be as far as possible removed from the conditions that exist on the average farm.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. T. Walsh Mr. T. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Defence has asked why there is an urge for experimental farms.  The urge is very apparent at the present time because a system which has been in operation for the past ten or 15 years seems to be going out of existence, namely, price fixing of agricultural produce.  I should like to know on what basis present prices are fixed or how the income of a farmer is assessed.  In what way do those civil servants, who recommend to the Minister the assessment of a farmer's value and the assessment of an acre of land, arrive at their figure?  It is for reasons such as these that it is necessary to put forward a motion such as this motion which Deputy Cogan has put forward. The farmers of this country have been, as we know, from time immemorial the hewers of wood and the drawers of water.  The same applies to agricultural labourers.  Who has assessed the value of the professional gentleman? Who is the person, and who has had the right to say, for instance, that a doctor's salary should be £700 a year? Who decided that a solicitor should have a fee of 6/8 or maybe 10/- nowadays for writing a letter?  What right has any body of men&mdash;even if it was an organisation composed of those men themselves that decided their own fees&mdash;to say, that their services <Col N="943" /> are worth a particular figure? The farmer has this right, anyway.  He is entitled to live in the same comfort as any one of those professional men.</P>
      <P>I contend that even though he may not be known as a professional gentleman it takes him a greater number of years to qualify for his profession than it takes a man to qualify as a doctor, as a solicitor or as a barrister.  A farmer can be working on his land for 20 years and still be learning.  It is not so with the professions.  With them, a certain course is specified.  When it is completed, after passing the final examination, a man is fully qualified. But that is not the case with the farmer or the agricultural labourer.  He learns something new every day.  Consequently, a farm, such as has been suggested by Deputy Cogan, would not be the slightest bit of harm in every county.  It would prove to our civil servants, if for no other reason, that their system of assessment and valuation may be all wrong.  We know that if we are growing a particular crop, say beet, it is costing a certain amount of money.  But our trouble is to convince those people who are responsible for the fixing of the price of that product&mdash;and who do not grow it themselves&mdash;that our figures are right.  Why deny us the right of having costings of our production costs?  We are not afraid to face costings.  We are not afraid to let anybody examine our costings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same remarks apply in regard to the production of milk, wheat and, in fact, all agricultural products.  Give us the right to decide what should be the fixed price for these products. Further, why not give to that section of the community the right to live in the same comfort as that enjoyed by our professional gentlemen?  Is a farm of 100 acres, for instance, worth a good solicitor's practice?  I submit that it is and worth more and that it should be worth more.  Was any farmer in this country, during the past 15 to 20 years, after starting in his farm and living on it for five years, able to drive around in a high-powered motor-car?  He was not.  How often has it happened, in the case of a small farmer with a number of <Col N="944" /> sons that, having apprenticed one or two of them in the town to the drapery, hardware or grocery trade, to serve their time they came back to the farm after three or four years and asked the father to help them to buy a shop for them?  How often has it happened, in such a case, that after two or three years the son could afford to drive around in his motor car?  Is there not something wrong&mdash;because the brothers who were left at home to work on the farm are still struggling?  Very often they have to wait until they are 35 or 40 years of age before they have sufficient money to get married.  In many cases they are never able to buy a farm.  That is one of the reasons why we have depopulation of the rural areas.  We hear a lot of talk about late marriages, and so forth, but the fundamental reason is that a man who is being brought up as a farmer's son has not sufficient capital to go into farming himself.  Because he has not, he will not get married, for the reason that if he did so, he would have to come down to a lower standard than that on which he was reared.</P>
    <P>That is why the farmer wants a proper assessment in respect of the crops he produces.  Why should anybody deny him that right?  He is entitled to know what it is costing him to produce the commodities he produced, and, once you have discovered what that cost is, the farmer should get a fair margin of profit to enable him to live in the same conditions as the professional gentleman.  The argument may be put forward by the professional gentleman that it has cost more to educate him, but his education is a one-track education.  I defy any of these professional gentlemen to tell me that he knows as much as the ordinary agricultural labourer in the country. He does not.</P>
    <P>These experimental farms should be run on a system whereby the whole countryside would know what they were costing and there is no necessity for the Minister for Defence to say that, if the State were running them, they would be regarded as State concerns. It is not necessary, for instance, to have a qualified man to run one of these farms&mdash;any good steward in the county can be selected to run it.  Let <Col N="945" /> him run it on the same conditions as the ordinary farmer living next door runs his farm.  There will then be only this difference between the farms, that a strict account will be kept of every penny spent on production on that farm during the year and every penny derived from that farm.  Then, we will know whether it is necessary to have a fixed price for our produce or not.</P>
    <P>We come up from the country on deputations to the Minister, who is advised by his experts, and we ask for an increase in the price of milk.  We are told that the price of milk is sufficiently high.  The Minister is not looking at the problem from the point of view of the farmer's production costs but from the consumer's point of view. The consumers will always have a greater number of votes than the producers and he is perfectly right in looking at it from that point of view, if, by increasing the price of milk, he is going to lose a few votes.  That is what he will do and what his civil servants will advise him to do.  The same applies to the price of beet&mdash;the price of sugar must be considered.  The ultimate consideration is the price at which the sugar can be sold to the consumer and there is no regard whatever for the farmer who grows the beet.  The same applies to all the other commodities produced on the farm.</P>
    <P>These experimental farms can be tried for a few months under the direction of a manager who is not one of the experts.  We do not want theoretical experts at all.  We want practical men to run these farms, as the farms beside them are being run, who will see that proper accounts are kept, so that when we ask for reasonable returns for our work, we will be able to put up sound arguments in favour of a reasonable price, so that the farmer may have a reasonable profit from which to pay a reasonable wage to his worker and to enjoy life as he is entitled to enjoy it.</P>

      <P>While I have every sympathy with the movers and supporters of the motion, I am not one of those who would support it, because I am satisfied that it would be nothing but a waste of money, and the farmers have seen enough waste of public money in the past 15 or 20 years.  To <Col N="946" /> my mind, there is no need for such farms as these because, in all our counties, we have scores of well-run and well-balanced farms which are an example to this House and to the country, farms which are run by men who mind their business and get proper returns from work well done.  These farms are more important than the farms which the motion seeks to have established.  How are farms of this type to be set up?  What size farm would you set up and what type of farm is it to be?  What capital would you set aside for it and what economy would be carried on there?  We must realise that there are 101 types of farmers, 101 types of farms and 101 types of economy.  There are no two farms run alike and no two farmers with the same type of mind.  The whole thing is preposterous&mdash;simply nonsense. I regard the proposal as being a bit sloppy coming from men who, I believe, are themselves balanced farmers.</P>
      <P>What this country needs is a lead and it never got a lead.  We were running from Billy to Jack for the past 25 years&mdash;bringing out farmers to the right on one occasion, to the left on another occasion, and shoving them into the ground the next time.  They never got a chance, because they never got a fixed plan which they could follow. Happily, at present, there is some hope, in that there is a five-year term ahead of them whereby they know where they stand.  They can base their economy on that five-year plan with a reasonable chance of a fixed market and fair prices.  That is what the farmers want and not the type of farms suggested here which would merely bring poor results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the guidance of our county committees of agriculture, there are at the moment good schemes by which various plots are laid down in different areas on which a farmer can see where a crop should be sown, how it should be sown and the returns it should give. These are there in every county for every farmer to see and there are demonstrations month after month for our farmers to attend.  Whether horticultural or agricultural work, they are all there, and they are costing a vast amount of money.  Now we are asked <Col N="947" /> to start a new type of farm, but I cannot see what type these new farms will be.  I should like those who urge this proposal to realise that one man and his family can live comfortably and well on a ten-acre farm, while another farmer with the same family and in the same conditions would not live in comfort on 100 acres&mdash;he would go burst. The whole thing depends on the type of man in charge of the farm.</P>
    <P>I come from a county in which there is a vast amount of farming of different types.  We have the balanced farms, the uneconomic farms, and the rancher farms.  I am one of those who was born on a middle-class farm, and, in the area from which I come there is nothing but labourers and middle-class farmers of from 30 to 70 acres.  For the past 300 or 400 years scarcely one of these farms has gone out of the possession of these families.  There was always a fair-sized family coming on, and, though the sons and daughters went away, one was left behind to carry on the old tradition of thrift, good management and hard work from morning till night, while, at the same time, getting a fairly good living and a fairly good measure of comfort out of the farm.  He was always able to meet bad and good times as they came along.  That is what I stand for.  Let us get rid of a lot of this nonsense. We are whining and crying for 25 years about the poor farmers being down and out.  I never heard anything but that&mdash;&ldquo;the farmers are down and out.&rdquo;  The farmer is never down and out.  I never knew a farmer who was not in a good way of living if he had five or 50 acres. He was never down and out.  A man can be broken and down to the bottom and he will rise again if he has the spirit.  This whining and crying and cringing about the terrible times the farmer is going through is all wrong. Many farmers are going through bad times and many farmers were going through bad times in the best of times, in many cases because they are no damn good.  Many farmers were living well in the worst of times, because they took off their coats and ploughed through their work and took everything as it came.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite satisfied, as far as costings are concerned, that there is no hope from this type of farmer, for giving any costings that would be of any use whatsoever, because I do not see how you can get costings from smaller middle class farms of the type.  You have a type of farmer who has got a family and you cannot tie him down to costings, because there are a hundred and one ways of spending the money.  There may be two or three sons on the farm and one son would live for the whole week on 5/-, while another son wants £2 and another wants £3.  One of the sons would wear a pair of pants out in a month, while another would take six months.  One son would wear a pair of boots out in a month, while another would make them last 12 months.  You could not get balanced costings on such a basis.  You can send one son to the fair with the father's cattle and it won't cost 10/- and he could send another son and he would spend £5. How can you make up costings on that?  Another son will want to go to a dance and not alone will he bring one &ldquo;mot&rdquo; with him but he will bring three or four.  He will hire a car to take them and before he gets there he will call into two or three publichouses and have a right royal time; and in the morning he will be looking in every pocket to find the £5 note he had in his pocket the night before and it will be gone.  The father can only shake his head, because he knows well that if he says anything to Johnny, he will skip away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The less we have of this talk and the more common-sense the better.  Tell our farmers exactly what should be told them&mdash;that they are the finest type of people in the country, that they have the finest living in the country and whether they have bad times or good times the job they have is almost a sacred one.  I would not change my living in the country with the Aga Khan or the President in the Park, because their living is only a miserable one, while the life of a farmer out the country is a God-given <Col N="949" /> life, with free fresh air and your own time.  You can lie in bed all day long and no one will put you out of it or you can get up at six in the morning and work until ten at night and there is no one to stop you or say anything. That is what I call full and perfect freedom and that is what we have. Our farmers are proud of that and hold to that, and as long as we have that we are going to hold Ireland for the Irish people.  I tell the movers of this motion to examine their conscience and see if they are bringing the farmers along the proper road, or trying to make proper fools of themselves and the farmers.</P>
    <P>I know there is a vast amount of difference between Cavan, where Deputy O'Reilly comes from, and Meath.  In Cavan you would live on five acres of land and have £1,000 in the bank, but I would not take a Cavan man's way of life for a Meath man's for £1,000 a day.  The Cavan man's way of life is a hard one and the majority of them are toiling and dragging from morning till night to make money and the poor devils have to do it, because they have very little land.  In Meath a man with 50 or 70 acres of land can have a good living; there is one thing about him, he hardly ever puts a shilling in the bank.  He lives up to every penny and gets a good life.</P>

      <P>I think what I am saying is really worth saying, as it is nearly as good as the costings.  This thing about costings is proper rot and cod.  You will never get proper costings. If you are going to put up a demonstration farm in a county, you must put up an uneconomic kind of farm.  You must have the kind of farm like that of the Cavan men who have about 20 acres, you must put up the farm of 50 acres like the balanced farm, and you must have the 75 or 100 acres of the gentleman farmer; and take the costings of those three and see which is the best means of living.  I do not know what farm you are going to get to evolve a system and see the results. What type of farm or what size of farm would you take?  There are 101 types. There is one which would give you 25 barrels of wheat to the acre, which I get myself, while the man beside me can get only six barrels to the acre, no matter what he does, no matter what manure he uses and although he carries on with proper husbandry.  How will you compare these farms?  It cannot be done.  I have said enough to put before most of the House my view. Let the farmers alone and leave them in the hands of the leader they have, Deputy James Dillon, and I am satisfied they will get their own economy and get a balance on it.</P>

      <P>The mover of the motion seems to have two sides to his character.  In dealing with land prices and fixity of tenure he is exceptionally conservative, but he has a socialistic side to his nature, apparently, which we had displayed to-night.  The idea of very meticulous costings on a farm of a special type savours something of a Five-Year Plan.  If the idea proposed by Deputy Cogan were put into operation, it could not be anything but a complete failure.  Costings, outgoings, incomings and profits on a farm are things in which there are many imponderables which cannot be accounted for.  If we had the organisation of a farm on the basis proposed by Deputy Cogan, the control of it, apparently by an inspector of the Department of Agriculture, the employment of a number of men at the full agricultural rates, and if that were <Col N="951" /> worked out to its full conclusion I think that, as a result, we would have an Agricultural Efficiency Act&mdash;of which the farmers might not be tremendously enamoured.</P>
      <P>To my mind, a farm is something altogether different from a factory: it is also a homestead.  I cannot see how the stag party that is proposed by Deputy Cogan is going to function on a farm of the type he proposes.  In the farm, as I know it, and I have a good deal of experience of it, the woman of the house is the centre-piece and I would not like any old bachelors&mdash;not being in any way personal to anybody &mdash;in charge of a farm of that type.  I did suggest to the Minister for Agriculture some time ago that there is a necessity for the ascertainment of costings and for the provision of a certain type of demonstration in each county or in each district that might encourage farmers to a more efficient type of production.  Instead of purchasing a farm, putting an inspector from the Department of Agriculture in charge of it and hiring a number of men who would have no personal interest except in drawing their wages, if the inspector in each particular area concentrated completely on one farm and tried to select a farmer who was efficient, whatever the size of his farm, and who would concentrate a good deal on his work trying to make of his farm a demonstration farm and at the same time trying to ascertain the costings, you would have in every district a farm which would be a good example to all the local farmers.  I suggested that during the debate on agriculture to the Minister and he agreed at that time that he would carry out such a proposal. I think that this experiment proposed by Deputy Cogan is altogether wrong and would not work.  I think that the idea behind Deputy Cogan's proposal would be more successfully put into operation by adopting this scheme which I proposed to the Minister and which he said he would accept during the debate on agriculture.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have every sympathy with the farmers of this country in their efforts to meet the contingencies <Col N="952" /> arising from various conditions which the industrialist does not have to calculate against.  The farmer has to contend with climate for which he is not responsible: farms are on different types of soil; even next-door neighbours may be on a different type of soil and there are other circumstances where it is quite obvious that no two farms are alike.  I cannot agree with the suggestion that the setting up of a farm under the direction of the county committee of agriculture would give us figures on which we could rely as a basis for agricultural prices throughout the length and breadth of the land.  It does not even apply in respect of different areas.  Certainly, so far as the running of a State farm is concerned for the purpose of ascertaining costs, I feel that the costings would be absolutely false.  I would be far more prepared to accept figures put forward by an efficient farmer than by any State-run concern, such as a farm which would be under the direction of the county committee of agriculture concerned.  The farmer is in a very different position from the professional classes and fees, such as legal fees, are usually attached to the personality concerned rather than the service given.</P>
      <P>In the case of agriculture prices are affected, no matter what we may say, by the world market price.  If barley is £3 a barrel in this country and £1 a barrel in Japan we will certainly feel the effect of it because those who mainly absorb the crop will travel great distances in order to cut down their costs and get the commodity at a cheaper price.  The question of State versus private enterprise enters into the suggestion that we should set up State farms in counties.  I believe that, for obvious reasons, private enterprise is always capable of producing greater efficiency and greater economy than organisations run by the State.  There is a personal interest in the case of private enterprise where it does not exist in State concerns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again I want to say that if farmers ever find a certain branch of agriculture not paying there is nothing to prevent them going out of that branch and going into another.  We can always <Col N="953" /> rely on the farmers to be the best judges of their own business and we can expect that if they find that the dairy business, for instance, is not paying they will go into another branch of agriculture.  However, the figures are very different and we find that, although there is a certain amount of agitation concerning the price of milk regardless of the enhanced price of calves during the past 12 months, the number of registered milk producers has increased since last year.  The farmers are not fools.  They are not going to go into the dairy business just to make a loss when they have the choice of going into some other branch of the industry.  There again if you are choosing a State farm what are you going to choose?  Are you going to choose a mixed farm, are you going to choose an all tillage farm or are you going to choose an all live stock farm? Suppose you choose any one of those, you will find that you will have a set of prices which will not apply to any one farming area let alone to any one normal farmer in the country.  Therefore, I feel that, however desirable it is that we should be able to get costings which we could consider as being a guide for the country as a whole, that is not feasible.  I will just give you an example.  Look back over the years and you will see that when the farmers found that it was not good economy to produce pigs they went out of pigs. Until last year we nearly had to select a specimen for the museum.  Then again the farmers went out of sheep and we saw also the cattle population being reduced to a considerable extent. However, if pigs, cattle or sheep at certain times were enjoying what the farmers regarded as an economic price having regard to the feeding stuffs available and the cost of production there is no doubt that the population of these classes of live stock would not have gone down.</P>
    <P>Captain Giles rightly mentioned that we have committees of agriculture all over Ireland and they are at the service of our farmers.  Any farmer can write a penny postcard to the county committee of agriculture and ask for advice on any particular subject. Whether it be fruit growing, cereals or root crops the service is there.  The <Col N="954" /> farmers have the advice of men who are regarded as being highly efficient and qualified to give the advice which they need.  When we are considering the possibility of setting up a State farm the size of the farm definitely has an effect on the economies.  There are holdings in Rush, not far from the City of Dublin, of not more than four or five acres and those people are enjoying a very good living.  It is well known to the people of Dublin City because it is the garden of Dublin.  A large quantity of fruit and vegetables which comes on the market here every day is produced from small holdings. I have no doubt that the families on those small holdings are far better off than other farmers in different areas living, perhaps, on 100, 200 or 300 acres and that their income is far higher.  So that I believe that even if we try to select a sizable farm and pursue a certain economy we still will not get a reliable set of figures.  In the case of a mixed farm it may not bear a similar relation to the remaining farms which exist in that county or in the surrounding areas.</P>
    <P>I feel that the law of supply and demand will always regulate prices, whether they be agricultural prices or prices in relation to manufactured products. For that reason I feel that the farmers will be well able to judge, according to the volume of produce which comes on the market, which class of produce will pay them best and that they will not continue producing any particular commodity which will not pay them.  There is, I believe, a rosy future for the people on the land.  I believe there is a new spirit of enthusiasm and optimism among our people.  They have a sympathetic Government in office, a Government which is calling out to them to produce more, to increase the volume of their output, to give us the goods, not alone for ourselves, but for export.</P>
    <P>At the present time we realise that no matter what quantity of live stock could be produced during the next two or three years, there is a ready market for all classes of live stock, even horses, for meat in Britain and other parts of Europe.  I am not suggesting that we ought to rear horses in order <Col N="955" /> to sell them to people on the Continent for meat, but the fact remains that the demand is so great for every class of animal on four legs that we will get a ready market in Britain and in other parts of Europe during the coming couple of years.  Naturally, it will take a considerable time to bring our livestock population up to what we could regard as a reasonable level.  We cannot just increase those classes of live stock overnight.  We did succeed in increasing our poultry, with the result that poultry and poultry products are being exported in large quantities to Britain, where there is a ready market.  That does not apply to cattle, because it will take several years before our cattle population can be brought up to a desirable level.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to be guided by the farmers, because I know how they have been carrying on for years and I know, too, that they are free to sell out if they find they are not making money.  If they find that if they hold on to the farm they are clinging to a liability, they will not do that.  They will adapt themselves to circumstances. I believe there is no branch of agriculture which the farmers cannot make pay.  There are farmers on different farms who cannot make a certain branch of the industry pay, but, if that is so, they will not continue to interest themselves in that particular branch.</P>
    <P>I have the utmost sympathy for the farming community, and I hope that some kind of standardised prices will be arrived at.  I feel this could not be reached by the establishment of these State farms.  Deputy Giles mentioned, quite rightly, that the mode of life existing among our farming community has a certain bearing on farming economy.  One farm is asked to bear more in the way of cost than others, because the individuals live in a different way.  Some people eat well and some people drink well, but whatever the position may be, we cannot regard two farmers as living exactly in the same way.  Their methods of living may be very different.  There is no such thing as a steorotyped farmer and for that reason <Col N="956" /> I do not think that any useful purpose would be served by setting up the nearest thing to a steorotyped farm, which could be regarded as the type of farm suggested under the control of county committees of agriculture.</P>
    <P>The best class of work that the larger farmer can perform is of a mixed nature, not wholly devoted to tillage and not wholly devoted to live stock. It is quite evident, and we have seen it especialy during the emergency years, that the farms depend on farmyard manure when it comes to the production of certain clases of crops, particularly wheat.  We saw during the years where the farmers succeeded in getting only an average of five and even four barrels per acre&mdash;that is according to statistics.  I feel it cannot be said that the farmer who got only four barrels an acre could say he would make a profit.  He would have to engage in some other branch of farming in order to recover whatever loss he was at, so as to help him to pay his grocer and to meet his other liabilities.</P>
    <P>I believe we must, on the larger type of farm, have mixed farming, because one thing depends on the other.  Live stock thrive on cereals and roots, which can be produced more cheaply. There is no use in any farmer thinking that he can go to the market and buy roots and cereals and feed them to his live stock.  That would be bad economy, because, naturally, he can grow these cereals and root crops more cheaply and efficiently on his own farm and are available to the live stock on the holding.  On the other hand, the type of soil has an important bearing on the productivity of the land.  In addition to the efforts made by the Minister for Agriculture towards placing that industry on a sound economic basis, the Minister has also set up an excellent soil-testing station which will enable farmers to find out what deficiencies exist in their soil, not only on the farm as a whole but in any particular corner of it.  The farmer will be able to have his samples tested by qualified scientists who will be in a position to advise him.  This must have the effect of ensuring that in time all the soil on his land will be productive.  I think that is the best contribution that can be <Col N="957" /> made towards improving farming economy at the present time.  For years past we have been producing crops on hungry land.  We have been producing crops on land that was incapable of growing the crops which stood upon it.</P>
    <P>We had examples of that type of starved land in relation to the growing of wheat where, when the wheat had grown to a certain height, it fell down because there was not sufficient nourishment in the soil to feed the plant and keep it healthy or enable it to withstand the weather.  I believe that this scheme of soil-testing will help considerably in improving our farming economy.</P>
    <P>There is no reason why our farmers should be alarmed because they now have a sympathetic Minister for Agriculture. I think they have before them a very bright future, because there is a greater demand now for the products of the land than there has ever been in our history.  No doubt there are certain commodities in which overproduction can take place.  There are certain commodities which may be unmarketable at certain times; but, on balance, we can rest assured that the farmer will show a profit at the end of the year if he devotes his best efforts and energies towards making a success of his business.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would ask Deputy Cogan and Deputy O'Reilly to reconsider their demand for the setting up of these farms all over the country in the light of the now known facts.  I think such farms are absolutely unnecessary and I do not think that they would provide a true picture of our agricultural economy.  I think the farmers are the best judges of their own business.  I think they will continue in the future to do as they have done in the past, namely, to put their hearts and their minds into their work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>Reading over the motion before the House I have no doubt at all as to what the mover and seconder of the motion have in mind. They have years of experience of farming and, in their knowledge of farming, they know that those who engage in agriculture are not rewarded for their labours commensurate with the efforts they put into their work.  They <Col N="958" /> are not rewarded on an equitable basis with those engaged in industry or manufacture in this country.  I suggest, however, that we do not really require the setting up of experimental farms in this country to establish the fact that if agriculture were placed on a paying basis with proper rates of wages for those engaged in it, with all the assets under a particular control, the experiment would be an unqualified loss.  Everyone in this country has survived because agriculture has survived. Farmers in this country have never sought a fair reward for their labours; they have never counted their hours of work per day.  Agriculture at the moment is carried on even in this country under somewhat abnormal conditions. Those conditions are governed to a certain extent by world conditions. Prices have soared to abnormal heights.  Those engaged in agriculture may find it profitable at the moment; but it will never be as profitable as industry or manufacture.  Agriculture is carried on in this country mainly because it is done on a family basis.  On the small farms all over the country you find children of eight to 18 and adults of 28 and 38 employed under slave labour conditions.  There is no standard wage for them.  They know little of the comforts of life.  Their hours of work are not limited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The man who at this stage tries to establish a standard rate of wages for every worker employed in agriculture will bring this country to bankruptcy within 12 months.  It is the only industry in which we have an export. It is the only industry which permits us to take in the imports we require. That is possible because agriculture is carried on under slave labour conditions. Alter the present system What is the alternative?  We can fix the price the consumer will pay for agricultural products.  We cannot fix the price that will be paid by those who take our exports of agricultural produce. Who is to fix the price?  If we cannot get an economic price what will become of our produce?  We cannot store it as we would hardware or timber.  We cannot keep it until the price is an economic one.  We must sell it as soon as it is ready to market.  But <Col N="959" /> we have no means of controlling the price for our agricultural commodities except within the confines of our own country.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>I addressed a question to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs yesterday about the appointment of an auxiliary postman in a place called Banemore, Listowel, County Kerry.  The question I put to the Minister was a very simple one and required a simple answer.  I am afraid the Minister did not give that simple answer and it is because I was not satisfied with the nature of the reply that I deem it my duty to raise the matter on the adjournment this evening. The question I put to the Minister was:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To ask the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he will indicate the considerations that led to the discharge of Mr. Edmund O'Sullivan from the job of auxiliary postman at Banemore, Listowel, and the appointment of another man in his place.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister's reply was as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Mr. O'Sullivan was temporarily employed on a vacant auxiliary postman position at Listowel pending a permanent appointment being made. His claim and qualifications were carefully considered with those of the other eight candidates nominated by the exchange authorities, but the circumstances did not admit of his selection.  The most suitable candidate was appointed.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most suitable candidate!  The position is that a vacancy for an auxiliary postman occurred at Banemore nearly two years ago and at that time there were a good many applicants for the post including Mr. O'Sullivan who was afterwards appointed and also including the person who has been now appointed.  I understand <Col N="960" /> that in all these appointments certain considerations arise.  In the first place, inquiries have had to be made as to whether the applicants have had service in any of the national forces during the emergency.  The Minister told me yesterday, replying to a supplementary question, that that was still Government policy.  The consideration also arises as to the applicant who is in receipt of the highest amount of unemployment assistance and, I hold that the Minister or his Department or whoever was responsible&mdash;and the Minister must be held responsible&mdash;did not act according to these considerations.</P>
    <P>I understand that Mr. O'Sullivan, the man who was actually in the job, was, when he was appointed, the person who was in receipt of the highest amount of unemployment assistance. I have also here a letter from the postmaster to indicate that Mr. O'Sullivan had national service in the Defence Forces during the emergency although when I mentioned that yesterday in my supplementary question the Minister treated it with a certain amount of derision, because Mr. O'Sullivan had not very long service to his credit.  In any case, the fact remains that he offered himself for service.</P>

      <P>The Minister treated this matter with derision yesterday.  I have a communication here from the postmaster which reads as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I am directed to inform you that your services as auxiliary postman <Col N="961" /> will not be required after the completion of duty on Saturday, 8th proximo.  Your claims and qualifications for the vacant post were carefully considered with those of the other applicants but it is regretted that the circumstances did not admit of your selection.  Your discharge certificates are returned herewith.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have no personal interest in this matter whatever.  What I am concerned about is that in this case the most deserving applicant would be selected.  I had hoped that the most deserving applicant would be selected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>

      <P>It is correct.  That is why I decided to raise the matter on the adjournment, to focus public opinion on these appointments because it is only right and proper that the most deserving applicant should be appointed in all these cases.  I am not one of those who say that a person who is secretary of this branch or that branch should not be appointed.  What we have to examine is, not the political affiliations of any candidate, but his qualifications for the post and then decide who is the most deserving applicant. I hope that in appointments of this nature in future, the appointment will be given to the most deserving applicant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Everett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very sorry that Deputy Kissane should consider it necessary to introduce politics into this matter of a small job.  It is not because a Deputy recommends a man to me for a job, because that man happens to be a member of a particular party, that I appoint him.  I try in all these cases to give the job to the person I consider most deserving, irrespective of politics, just as this week I appointed a man who was recommended by the Deputy to another job, not because I believed he was a member of the Fianna Fáil Party, but simply because I believed he was the best candidate for the position.  When the Deputy asked this question yesterday he spoke about unnecessary delay. There was unnecessary delay in this case.  The matter remained undecided in my office for a very long time.  My predecessor, realising the difficulties of appointing anybody to the office, left it for six months before I came into the office without coming to a decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>Was that in connection with this appointment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The case came before me.  It was lying in the office, as my predecessor was unable to make up his mind about it.  Probably, if he selected somebody there would also be a discussion on the matter here because there were eight other applicants for the position.  I sent it back to find out had this man been in the National Army.  I received a communication from <Col N="963" /> the postmaster stating that he had lost his Army discharge but, from a very old discharge, he took it for granted that the man had given service in the National Army.  Some delay then took place because I had to communicate with the Defence Department.  I mentioned yesterday that the man absented himself.  I want to be charitable, because this man may be seeking other employment.  According to the Defence Department, he was in the Army.  His date of attestation was the 15th June, 1939.  He was called up for permanent service in September, 1939, but he failed to report.  He was apprehended on the 9th November, 1940, and demobilised on the 11th November, 1940. He was discharged on the 4th December, 1940, after having two days' Army service.  I may say that he was discharged as medically unfit.  I am sure the Deputy realises that for the position of auxiliary postman you must have a person who will be able to get around highways and bye-ways on a bicycle, and you do not want a man for whom you might have to try to find a bed in a hospital after six months.  I am glad that the man has recovered. As I said, I do not want to say a word which would injure him.  The Deputy said he was appointed permanently.  He was not.  The Deputy was aware that he was only there temporarily pending a permanent appointment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>The man appointed was a married man who served in the Army and was allowed out on compassionate grounds, because his father is blind and his mother is an invalid.  He served in the National Army and remained a member of the Defence Forces until 1946.  As he had a blind parent and a wage of 42/- a week, I am sure the <Col N="964" /> Deputy, if he were placed in my position, would have acted as I did and given preference to a man who had been in the National Army and who had the responsibility of keeping a blind parent on a wage of 42/- a week. I am not concerned with what his political opinions are.  As I said yesterday, the fact of being recommended by a Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or Labour T.D. should not be regarded as a qualification, but neither should it be a disqualification if a person has all the other qualifications.  The Deputy will find that I shall act fairly and impartially to all sections of the community. I am not tied to Fine Gael or any of the other sections.  I am here in my capacity as a Minister for all Parties and for the State, not for any individual or for any section.  I hope I shall carry out my duty to the satisfaction of all.  If I do make mistakes, I can assure the Deputy that I shall have the best intentions.</P>
      <P>After hearing my statement, I am certain the Deputy will be sorry that he raised such a petty matter on the Adjournment.  As I said, a question might be raised next week as to my appointing a Fianna Fáil supporter because Deputy Kissane had recommended him.  I know the position Deputies are in; that supporters of all Parties may come to them for a recommendation. I received three or four recommendations.  These are not any guidance to me.  I try to select the person with the biggest responsibilities, the most deserving person and the best qualified for the job.  I am certain that the Deputy now regrets he brought up the matter.  I hope anything I have said will not injure this man or prevent him from getting employment elsewhere.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.15 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 9th March, 1949.</P>
