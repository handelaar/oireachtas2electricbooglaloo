      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if the Government has considered the serious implications of the proposed visit of Her Royal Highness Princess Elizabeth of England to our six north-eastern counties and if any protest against the visit has yet been, or will be, made by the Government to the British Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's views on the Partition of our country, which are, of course, identical with the views of all Parties in this House and of the overwhelming majority of the Irish people, have been frequently stated and are well known to the British Government.  The proposed visit by a member of the British Royal Family to the Six Counties is merely incidental to the general problem of Partition, and feelings of resentment against the visit on the part of the Irish people arise out of the existence of that problem.  In the Government's opinion, it would not be helpful towards the solution of the problem to make the visit the subject of a protest to the British Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the sense of resentment and indignation felt by all sections of the Irish people at the visit of a representative of the power which criminally occupies portion of our territory is greatly intensified by the recent gratuitous and insulting endorsement given by the British Government in the so-called Ireland Bill to the anti-democratic Fascist system under which our people in the <Col N="628" /> Six Counties are compelled to live, and would the Taoiseach in those circumstances consider apprising the British Government through their representative here of that fact?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>All Parties in the House are fully, appreciative of the resentment that exists on the lines that the Deputy suggested.  I merely want to underline that while every method will be availed of to end Partition, we feel that there is a growing volume of opinion both in the six north-eastern counties and amongst the decent people in Great Britain in favour of the ending of Partition.  We wish to mobilise and make more vocal that growing volume of opinion and we feel that the interposition of any matter connected with the British Royal Family would not be helpful.  It is for that reason we do not intend to make a protest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that the subject matter of this question pales into insignificance in the light of recent events?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.D. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether he is aware that many farmers suffered very serious loss due to the seizure of their stock when they were unable to pay their land annuities because of the economic war; that the property was sold indiscriminately and in most inappropriate lots, resulting in the sacrifice of the farmers' interests to those of the buyers; and, if so, whether he will have an inquiry made into the various transactions concerned and arrange to compensate those farmers who were badly treated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>While I, naturally, have the greatest sympathy with any farmers who suffered serious loss on account of the seizure of their stock for the non-payment of land annuities during the economic war, I am afraid that it would be quite impracticable at this stage, after the lapse of so many years, to have an inquiry made into the various transactions concerned with a view to the payment of compensation to any farmers who did, in fact, suffer loss. <Col N="629" /> Many hardships and injustices were suffered by decent men during that disastrous period, but, in existing circumstances, it is hoped that the increasing prosperity of the agricultural industry will be shared by those who so seriously suffered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDesmondLehane" hpid="Mr. P.D. Lehane Mr. P.D. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.D. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach not aware that because of the losses a number of farmers suffered on that occasion they were not in a position to get back into production and enjoy the prosperity that has taken place?  I think also that the Taoiseach was of opinion that the seizures under the 1933 Act were in many cases used as punitive measures against the farmers.</P>

Any exports of hand-woven tweed are brought to account under the heading &ldquo;Woollen tissues&mdash;all wool,&rdquo; of which the f.o.b. value of exports during the period August, 1948-March, 1949, inclusive was (a) £126,900 to Great Britain, (b) £3,516 to the United States and (c) £53,875 to other countries.

      <P>The Minister has not answered my question, whether the expectations that he held out, in recommending the Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement to the House on the ground that it would provide a market for Irish homespuns and hand-woven tweeds, have been fulfilled.  I should like to ask him also whether he agrees with the statement made by the Minister for Lands in the Dáil last week, when he said that there was virtually no market here now for Irish homespuns.  He went on to say that in spite of all their efforts, the Department had been unsuccessful in finding a market there to sell either homespuns or hand-woven tweeds.  Furthermore, does the Minister agree with his colleague that there is no hope &ldquo;in the near future or even in the distant future of disposing of 120,000 yards of excellent homespuns which we have now in the Gaeltarra Éireann depot&rdquo;?</P>

      <P>May I say, in regard to the first part of the supplementary question, that the Deputy is aware, of course, that hand-woven tweeds were not allowed into Britain before the agreement of last year was made?  The Deputy is aware that there was a certain parcel post trade which, according to the British, was illegal.  Under the agreement which was made last year the British agreed to let in through the ordinary trade channels hand-woven tweeds to the value the Deputy has mentioned.  Unfortunately, we were not able to induce or to compel British traders to buy hand-woven tweed to that extent.  The point is that the gate was open.</P>

      <P>We trust that even if the Labour and Clann na Poblachta Deputies were mute as mice, yesterday, they may pluck up a little bit of courage to say what they really think of this Budget.  One of the characteristics of the old Cumann na nGaedheal Budgets was very evident in the Budget that was introduced by the present Minister for Finance yesterday.  The dead hand of Cumann na nGaedheal has come back on the country&mdash;with the assistance of the Clann na Poblachta Party and the Labour Party.  They succeeded in crushing out 1,000 factories during their time and there is no evidence from this Budget that they mean to deal with the economic, financial and social factors in this country in such a way that additional production will be got from farm and factory to enable more of our people to live at home at a higher standard of life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is right that when a Budget is being introduced by a Minister for Finance he should advert to the principal economic, financial and social factors and that he should give some indication as to how his budgetary proposals are meant to improve the conditions. There was no such indication given yesterday by the Minister for Finance.  He did indicate that certain parts of the Fianna Fáil programme were going to proceed in the coming year, but he gave no indication that he was going to restore some of the parts of the Fianna Fáil programme, which had been cut down, in order to deal with the shortage of production about which he complained or to deal with the very greatly increased unemployment and emigration during their régime.  During this last year, 1948, 13,000 people emigrated from the country.  In the previous year 11,166 people had come back into the country. The Minister made no attempt to estimate the factors which caused that change and he gave no indication that he had in mind policies to right the situation or to attempt, as far as a Government can, to provide more employment and give greater opportunities to our people to remain at home. I do not claim that any Government <Col N="639" /> can, over-night or in a year or in 16 months or in many years, create such conditions as will enable every person to remain at home, particularly if they have any desire to go abroad.  But I think it was up to the present Minister for Finance to give some indication that he was aware of the major problems of unemployment and emigration and to show how his Budget would improve the situation.</P>
    <P>When Fianna Fáil introduced the Budget in 1947 for £57.7 million there was a great outcry from some of the present occupants of Government Benches.  They said it was ruining the country.  When the present Fine Gael Ministers were speaking in elections during 1947 and the beginning of 1948 they said they would decrease Fianna Fáil expenditure by £10,000,000. Instead of decreasing Government expenditure by £10,000,000 they have increased it by £8,000,000&mdash;so they are £18,000,000 out.  A lot of people were led to vote for Fine Gael and for other members of the Government Benches in the belief that this thing could be done. All over the country, on many political platforms, they denounced the extravagance of Fianna Fáil with phrases such as those quoted by Deputy Lemass yesterday and they promised that they would relieve the burden of taxation on the people.  In fact, instead of decreasing the burden of taxation, as Fine Gael promised, they have increased it by £8,000,000.</P>
    <P>The changes in taxation during these last 16 months are significant.  The present Budget proposes to increase taxation on dancing and on legallyheld firearms and it proposes to reduce the taxation on income-tax, on corporation profits, on wine and on a few other little matters.  Last year the Labour Party gave a warning to the Minister for Finance that they were not going to stand for the abolition of the excess corporation profits tax and they demanded that, although he did not see his way to introduce it in the Budget of May, 1948, he should in 1949 reintroduce it, and I want to know from the Minister for Finance why he did not reintroduce it, not that I would be in favour of it, but at least <Col N="640" /> the Minister for Finance, speaking for the Coalition group, owes it as a duty to the people whom he misled into believing that he would reintroduce it to show and explain to them why he has not done so.  The Tánaiste fulminated against the abolition of the excess corporation profits tax in a very vigorous manner.  He alleged that we abolished the excess corporation profits tax because we wanted to give £3,500,000 to the &ldquo;racketeers&rdquo; who were Fianna Fáil friends.  Is it because the Minister for Finance wants to give £3,500,000 to the Fianna Fáil &ldquo;racketeers&rdquo; that he has not made some effort to reimpose the excess corporation profits tax?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance did not mention a word about the excess corporation profits tax; he did not mention anything about profits; all he indicated was that last year he estimated that the receipts from income-tax were going to go up by nearly £1,000,000 on last year's rate of income-tax and that surtax and supertax were going to go up a little.  The Tánaiste, during the year, made the allegation that corporation profits were too high.  Indeed, he said: &ldquo;I am certainly more satisfied from what I have seen and heard behind the scenes during the past ten months that a goodly number of men who had tariffs to help industrial development made a pile of money out of the tariffs imposed.&rdquo; He went on denouncing in the usual rotund way which is characteristic of the Tánaiste, and concluded by saying: &ldquo;I think that in a wellgoverned country gentlemen of that kind ought to be the guests of the Government in power in the thickest walled jails we have&rdquo;.  Instead of putting them into the thickest walled jails we have, income-tax and supertax have been reduced and the corporation profits tax is being reduced.  Will the <Col N="641" /> Minister say whether the Tánaiste had any basis for his accusation of inordinate profits being made by industrialists in this country?  The Minister for Industry and Commerce did not agree with him in that statement, and I want to know whether the Minister for Finance agreed with him.  Should our industrialists be put in the thickest walled jails we have and what would be the result of the imposition of excess corporation profits tax?</P>
      <P>The re-introduction of the excess corporation profits tax was made the basis of a very strong promise by the Labour Party on January 24th, 1948. The Tánaiste said that by &ldquo;returning a strong Labour Party the people would have a guarantee that excess profits would be taxed to provide money to subsidise prices and thus reduce the cost of commodities.&rdquo;  The people returned a very much stronger Labour Party than the Tánaiste expected.  As members of the Coalition they are in a position of strength if they want to exercise it.  If they are not exercising their strength within the Coalition to reimpose the excess corporation profits tax, I want to know why?  Why has it not been reimposed in order to subsidise prices and thus reduce the cost of commodities?  Is it a fact that the Tánaiste now knows that his ranting throughout the country was nonsense? Is it a fact that he now regards his ranting about the excess corporation profits tax as a mere political stunt to win votes and that, in fact, it was not justified?  At the time we tried to explain to the people that we could not have an excess corporation profits tax here, even should we desire it or even should we think it might be desirable from a social point of view, when the British Labour Party had abolished it in England, but that explanation did not satisfy the Tánaiste when he was in opposition.  Does it satisfy him now, and will somebody on behalf of the Labour Party, if the Tánaiste does not think fit to intervene in this debate, explain why they are agreeable to the non-imposition of the excess corporation profits tax?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the good things that the country may get out of the evil of this <Col N="642" /> present Government is a slight advance in political education.  I want to do what I can here in this House to force the members of the Coalition to explain to the people how wrong they were in a lot of the propaganda upon which they got votes and to explain also why they have not, in many instances, fulfilled the promises upon which they persuaded the people to vote for them.</P>
    <P>It was not only Deputy Norton who spoke about this question of excess corporation profits tax.  Deputy Larkin last year gave a clear indication that he was prepared to stand for the non-reimposition of the tax last year, but this year he would expect it to be imposed. Anyone who wants to look up Deputy Larkin's speech here on the 12th May, 1948, can see for himself the strong criticism he made of the Minister for Finance and the warning he gave that he was not going to stand for it this year.  I want to hear from Deputy Larkin in this debate as to why this strong Labour Party, in a position to make and unmake Governments, has not lived up to its threat or its promise &mdash;whichever you like to call it&mdash;that it would reimpose this tax and use the £3,500,000 for the reduction of the prices of commodities.  The reason cannot be that there is no necessity to reduce the price of commodities.  The cost of living has gone up during the Coalition régime.  In fact, the taxpayers are paying a very considerable sum to public servants to compensate them for the increased cost of living. If it had not gone up, there would have been no necessity for the extra £1,000,000 or so for civil servants, Guards, and so on.</P>
    <P>It must be admitted that there is necessity to use every means possible to reduce the cost of living.  Indeed, such a reduction was made a major issue in the General Election of January, 1948.  There are people sitting on Government Benches who promised that they were going to reduce it by 30 per cent.  The Fine Gael Party also promised that they would reduce it. The allegation was that the Fianna Fáil Government could easily reduce the cost of living, only that they were so incompetent and so desirous of taking <Col N="643" /> the last ¼d.  off the poor.  Instead of reducing the cost of living in these last 16 months, the Coalition have allowed it to rise.  Not only have the taxpayers, who are non-public servants, to bear the increased price of bread and other commodities, but on top of it they have to pay an addition this year of £8,000,000, part of which goes to compensate public servants and others for the increased cost of living.  Therefore, there is a double burden&mdash;an addition in the cost of living and additional taxation to pay for that increased cost of public servants.</P>
    <P>I was very interested in the manner in which the Minister for Finance dealt with the stamp duties.  Indeed, the offhand way in which he described what he was going to do almost made me think he himself had imposed the duty last year and that now he was going to stop some gaps that had been found in the operation of the duty during the 12 months.  Some members who were here in 1947 will remember that the stamp duties were introduced, not by the present Minister for Finance but by his predecessor&mdash;myself.  I proposed to the Government and got their acceptance of the increase in the stamp duties, up to 5 per cent. in the case of citizens of this country and to 25 per cent. in the case of others&mdash;in order to put a brake on inflation.  We had quite a long discussion here as to the effect of that stamp duty.</P>
    <P>I believed that it was a good tax in the then circumstances.  I am still convinced that it was good in the circumstances of that time.  Many members of the present Government were not so convinced and, indeed, indicated their disapproval of my suggestion in no uncertain way.  The Minister for Finance did not take any trouble, in this particular Budget Statement, to justify the reimposition of the increased stamp duties under the present circumstances. We regard the increase in the stamp duty on the transfer of property as anti-inflationary taxation.  This increase in the stamp duty does not go with the other inflationary steps which the Minister proposes in this Budget.  The Minister made no justification for that proposal and justification for reimposing <Col N="644" /> this stamp duty at the present time is called for by him.  Have we an inflationary situation which necessitates putting a brake on the inflation of house and land values, or have we a deflationary situation which calls for the spending of money, whether borrowed or collected otherwise than by means of taxation?</P>
    <P>When I introduced the stamp duty in 1947 the present Taoiseach denounced it.  He said, as reported in column 1065, Volume 108 of the Official Reports:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I believe this tax will merely result in making house property dearer and housing for persons with limited means impossible.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is that going to be the result of the reimposition of the stamp duty this year?  Will it make &ldquo;house property dearer and housing for persons with limited means impossible&rdquo;?  The Minister for Finance owes it to the House and to the country to explain what his view of that is.  Does he agree with the Taoiseach in what he said about it when the matter came before the Dáil first?  Indeed, the Taoiseach was very calm in his denunciation of the perfidy of the increase of the stamp duty in 1947. There were other members of the present Government who were not quite so calm in their denunciations as the Taoiseach.  The Minister for Agriculture also objected to it and he regarded it as a &ldquo;dirty fraud&rdquo;. Exactly what the Minister for Finance is trying to do at present he described as a &ldquo;dirty fraud&rdquo; when I introduced it.  He also called it a &ldquo;dirty, deceitful game&rdquo;.  He also said that it was &ldquo;flat-footed incompetence&rdquo;; that it was &ldquo;a shuffling and a cloutish way of dealing with that problem&rdquo;.  He also described it as &ldquo;a dirty wangle&rdquo;, and a &ldquo;vicious, contemptible, mean jab at those who are defenceless&rdquo;. He warned up in his speech and described it in these words:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is a dirty, contemptible, vicious and disedifying proposal, well worthy of the mind of the Minister for Finance who conceived it, and a disgrace on the House that adopts <Col N="645" /> it; a confession before the world that there can survive here a meanness of spirit that was unknown in this country in the darkest days through which our people had to live.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Does the Minister for Finance regard it in the same way as the Minister for Agriculture regarded it in 1947?  If so, why has he introduced it?  Do Deputies who are supporting the Government regard the Minister's proposal as a &ldquo;dirty fraud&rdquo;, a &ldquo;dirty, deceitful game&rdquo; and, if so, why do they propose to support him in inflicting it upon the country?  If inflation is stopped, I think the Government might very well consider abolishing this tax and imposing some tax which would be easier to collect and which would not lead to so many legal arguments in the courts for which the people have to pay.  The Minister for Finance should tell us what he thinks of the situation.  Is there an inflationary situation which necessitates the reimposition of the stamp duty?  I think he owes it to the country and the voters who were deceived into voting for the Coalition group in the belief that these proposals were a &ldquo;dirty fraud&rdquo; to explain to them that he now believes it was not a &ldquo;dirty fraud.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>One of the proposals in this Budget is to give a subsidy of about £16,000 to the importation of tobacco from Rhodesia by way of a preferential reduction in the customs duty on tobacco.  If the Minister thinks it is necessary to encourage the importation of tobacco from Rhodesia rather than from the United States in order to save dollars, would he tell us why the Government are not making some greater effort to increase the production here of commodities like wheat, which would save very many more dollars?</P>
    <P>He might also explain to us, if we have to go to that extremity to save dollars, what is the net product of the calculation of importing dollar maize and selling our eggs for sterling? Yesterday the Minister for Agriculture explained to Deputy Cogan why he had departed from his promise to give 3/-a dozen for eggs.  He said that we were <Col N="646" /> able to import maize now at a cheaper rate and, therefore, the farmers would have to stand the reduction from 3/-to 2/6 a dozen for eggs.  We are selling these eggs over in Great Britain for pounds and, instead of getting 3/- a dozen for them, we are getting 2/6.  A lot of these surplus eggs which we are exporting are the result of the increased quantity of dollar maize we are importing.  I wish the Minister for Finance would give us the calculations he has made to see where the profit lies in that particular transaction, particularly when he is driven to the point of subsidising Rhodesian tobacco in order to avoid buying dollar tobacco.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance suggested what we might do to balance our international payments.  He spoke about an increase in agricultural production as being one method by which we might do that.  He said that in 1948 our gross agricultural output had only gone up by .8 of £1,000,000 over 1947 although he admitted that 1947 was a disastrous year from the point of view of weather. Indeed, it was one of the most disastrous. We had a disastrous spring following a disastrous winter, which was preceded by the most disastrous harvest in the last 100 years.</P>

      <P>If we had got the King to live over in Phoenix Park it might have gone up.  However, the Minister for Finance said in his speech yesterday that in the terms of 1938-39 prices the gross agricultural output for 1948 has <Col N="647" /> been provisionally valued at £50,000,000 as compared with £53.5 million in 1938-39.  He said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There was a slight recovery as compared with 1947, which was a year of unfavourable weather, when the gross output figure on the same basis of valuation was £49.2 million.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>£49.2 million from £50,000,000 leaves £800,000.  Therefore, in the year of favourable weather, when we had a large increase in artificial manures, our gross agricultural output&mdash;that is what he is referring to&mdash;went up in the terms of 1938-39 prices by £.8 million.  If our gross agricultural output only went up by £.8 million it might be possible that our net agricultural output went down because in 1948 the farmers undoubtedly purchased more fertilisers and more foreign foodstuffs of various kinds.  I wish the Minister for Finance would whisper in the ear of the Minister for Agriculture and point out his view of the agricultural situation.  We might then hear less boasting round the country from the Minister for Agriculture.</P>

      <P>We all know that our agricultural output in 1948, 1947 or back to 1932 or 1924 was not as high as is necessary if we are going to provide a reasonable standard of living for our people.  We all know that everything possible should be done to increase agricultural output and particularly to increase agricultural net output.  It is no use to increase gross output by our buying maize and so forth from abroad and selling the eggs or poultry or beef that we produce thereby at less than we have paid for the feeding stuffs.  We want to increase our net output and it will require the goodwill of the farmers and a belief in the Government policy. Bombastic speeches by the Minister for Agriculture or by the Minister for Finance are not going to improve the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance is this year imposing £18,000,000 of taxation more than he and his leader promised during the 1948 election.  I should like to know from the Minister for Finance why this £18,000,000 is being imposed in this particular year.  Surely it would be easier for him to print the notes as he used to advocate when he was here in these benches.  Why did the Minister for Finance not live up to his promises and tax the people £18,000,000 less this year and print the notes, as he advocated? An explanation is due to the people whom he deceived into believing that all our ills could be cured by printing notes if there was any good purpose for which we wanted notes. The Minister for Finance, of course, may have educated himself to the point where he recognises that his propositions when he was in opposition were simply crazy.  I think he should show the mental processes he went through during the course of his education to the people whom he deceived so that they might follow and undeceive themselves about his propositions, as he appears to have undeceived himself.  It would be much easier for the Minister for Finance to have printed these £18,000,000 and for a number of members of his Government who undoubtedly <Col N="649" /> do not like taxation.  At least, they said they did not like taxation when they were on these benches.</P>
    <P>The present Taoiseach denounced the Budget of 1947, which was £8,000,000 less than the present one by saying that</P>
    <P>&ldquo;there is no doubt that the high rate of taxation is very largely responsible for the under-production we are faced with here.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He went on, at that time, to sneer at the then Minister for Finance &ldquo;in his high-powered Dodge car&rdquo; running around the country.  A high-powered Dodge car is not sufficient for the present Taoiseach, but that is by the way.  His attitude then was that there was no doubt that taxation was too high for production, and he advocated abolishing a lot of taxation.  How did the Minister for Finance, who used to advocate the printing of notes, persuade the Taoiseach to stand for an extra £8,000,000 of taxation?  We would like to hear the conversation or hear the synopsis of the arguments with which the Minister for Finance persuaded the Taoiseach that taxation should be increased.</P>
    <P>In the year 1948 the Minister for Finance issued a loan, and his excuse for the issue of that loan was that every penny of it had to be paid to meet the debts that Fianna Fáil had left.  One would take from that that the State debt had been reduced by £12,000,000 in the first few months of the Coalition régime, but instead of that we find, according to the White Paper which the Minister has issued, that the State debt has gone up in this last year by a further £10,000,000.  Does not the Minister know, or will he now admit to the people, that his statement that he used the £12,000,000 borrowed in the spring of 1948 in the reduction of debt was a fraudulent statement; that what he used the result of the £12,000,000 loan for was not to repay the State debt but to change one form of State debt into another? The result of this change of the State debt from one form into another, and the increased debt which he has incurred, is shown in the details of the <Col N="650" /> estimate of expenditure for this year. If Deputies look at the service of public debt for 1949-50, as against 1948-49, they will find the service of public debt has gone up by almost £500,000 in this last year.  What the Minister for Finance did with portion of his first loan of 1948 was to change the State debt bearing 1? per cent. interest into a State debt bearing 3 per cent. interest. That may or may not have been a good thing to do, but the receipts of the first loan certainly were not used in the reduction of State debt, as the Minister for Finance said in the Seanad on the 30th June, 1948, column 325, Volume 35.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to hear from the Minister why he has imposed this additional taxation on firearms.  There are Ministers in his Government who think that certain sections of the community should have firearms without any taxation at all, but, in the case of other citizens who have paid taxation up to the present, if they have a .22 rifle, heretofore they got a licence for 5/-.  Now he is going to charge them £1.  Why is he doing that?  Heretofore, a farmer could have a shotgun for killing vermin on his land for 5/-and the Minister now proposes to charge him 10/-.  Doubling taxation of that type is rather steep and quadrupling it in the case of the .22 rifle is a bit steep.  The Minister can see his way to reduce the tax on wines and to reduce the corporation profits tax.  Why should he charge this extra £30,000 to lawabiding citizens who have paid for their firearms certificates up to the present time?  He should give them a bit of a break as against the citizens who pay no taxation on firearms and carry them around with the approval of the Minister for Justice and the Minister for External Affairs.</P>
      <P>The Minister proposes to spend the Marshall Aid Counterpart Fund here on the scheme of land drainage and improvement devised by the Minister for Agriculture.  He makes the plea that the money spent by the Minister in this way will increase agricultural production.  Everyone knows that, while land drainage might be a very desirable social service in the case of small farmers, portion of whose lands are flooded, swamped or covered with rushes, from an economic point of view there is not any great increase of production to be expected from the expenditure of the money.  However, a corner of a field to a man with a couple of acres is a valuable increase in his property, and, in the case of small farmers in congested districts, every effort should be made to add to the productive land at their disposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know, however, that from an economic point of view, from the point <Col N="654" /> of view of the balancing of international payments by increasing exports or by producing here things which we formerly imported, a much quicker and surer result would be obtained by putting extra fertilisers on good land. The encouragement given to the putting of fertilisers on land which Fianna Fáil provided, the subsidy on artificial manures, has been abolished this year, and the Minister wants us to believe that agricultural production will be increased by the land improvement scheme which the Minister for Agriculture has somewhere in his bonnet but has not brought forward in concrete proposals to the Dáil yet. From a purely financial accountancy point of view, I want to know how the Minister justifies the borrowing of money in this year for that scheme, and how, indeed, he could justify the printing of money.</P>
    <P>When the Minister was looking for a loan a few weeks ago he sent a circular around to people from whom he might expect subscriptions, and in it he talked about the danger of inflation and asked them to subscribe in order to reduce the danger of inflation. Surely, if there is a danger of inflation, the Minister is merely adding to it if he spends borrowed money for purposes which are not immediately productive. I had hoped that the Minister, in his Budget statement, would have dealt with the monetary situation, and not only would have explained to us the balance of payments, but would have given us his estimate of the situation, as to whether it was inflationary or deflationary.  If inflationary pressures are to be expected it will merely be adding to these pressures to spend borrowed money, or, even if you had printed money, to spend that printed money.  He proposes not only to spend borrowed money in this year for this purpose, but to spend money which we have borrowed and which we are bound by contract to repay in dollars.  What hope has the Minister of procuring the dollars to repay the European Recovery Programme moneys by spending it on all sorts of drainage schemes, good, bad and indifferent?  Surely it would have been better, if there is an inflationary situation which necessitates the reimposition <Col N="655" /> of the stamp duty, to collect this money either through savings on present expenditure or by additional taxation.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Government carried out a lot of land improvement.  They did not talk about it as something which should be introduced in the future.  We recognised that land improvement in certain cases could not be regarded, from a strict accountancy point of view, as economic and we asked the people to subscribe through taxation for land improvement and for the improvement of farm buildings.  We were prepared to take the political unpopularity for that or any other necessary taxation.  If the Minister is going to seek political popularity through avoiding taxation when taxation should be imposed, he is going to do a very bad day's work for this country. There is very little use in the Minister for Finance giving a greater rate of interest on moneys which he borrows if the result of that borrowing, the expenditure of these moneys, is to decrease the value of the loans which he has obtained.  When the Minister is replying he might please explain for the benefit of members of the House and people through the country how he justifies the changing of the basis of finance for land improvement from taxation, as under Fianna Fáil, to borrowed money, money borrowed in this particular case from America which is due to be repaid in dollars.</P>

But they will continue saying &ldquo;or else&rdquo; every month and there will be no action taken.  We will hear Deputy Lehane and others and we will see them voting for various increases and reductions in taxation, even though the Minister has not said a word about the comprehensive social security insurance plan.</P>

    <P>For a number of years we were <Col N="658" /> criticised for not doubling up social security payments of all kinds.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>After the war, one of the first things that the Fianna Fáil Government did was to examine the question of our social services of various kinds.  We decided, after examination, to set up a special Ministry which would deal comprehensively with all the social services.  For instance, instead of old age pensions being administered by the Department of Local Government and the means test being administered by the Revenue Commissioners under the Department of Finance, and unemployment assistance being operated by the Department of Industry and Commerce, and so on, all these services would be gathered together in one Department, administered by one Minister who would have the responsibility of producing for the Government's consideration a comprehensive scheme of social services.  That Ministry was in operation for a year before Fianna Fáil was put out of office.  That Ministry had collected all the statistics necessary and had made all the necessary calculations to enable the Minister to put a proposition before the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why has it taken all this time for the comprehensive social security insurance plan to reach this Dáil?  According to the Minister for Social Welfare it has not yet gone to the Government.  The White Paper, even, has not been produced. There was great criticism as <Col N="659" /> I said, of Fianna Fáil for not producing it.  If Fianna Fáil had remained in office a comprehensive social security insurance plan would have been produced long ago, but it has not yet seen the light of day, and the Lord knows when it will see the light of day.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, who used to ask that all sorts of State payments should be doubled, that the Guards should be double wages, and so on, seems to have been successful up to the present time in blocking any such social security plan.  I have no doubt that, just as Clann na Poblachta and the Labour Party remained meek as mice regarding his failure to produce the plan up to the present time, they will do so for another year.  They may give another warning to-day that if the Minister does not behave himself and have a more liberal mentality, next year they will vote against him, but if they were to remain there and there did not happen to be a general election sometime in the offing, they would continue making that threat as long as the Tánaiste would continue making promises, and that would be a long time.</P>
    <P>I see a number of other Deputies who want to speak and, as the Minister for Finance seems not to be returning, I shall give the quotation which he asked for.  The Minister or any Deputy can look at Volume 94, column 2062, of the Dáil Debates and find this quotation:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Banks and all sorts of houses simply create money... We print notes when people present us here with British legal tender and demand Irish legal tender instead.  We print it for them, and I suggest that we should print it at least as readily&mdash; always guarding against the dangers of over-printing&mdash;when the demand comes not from people who have English money and want it changed into ours, but when there is some good purpose for which Irish money is required.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When Deputy Cowan is speaking later on and when he is advocating, as he may advocate, the printing of notes, he will be able to quote the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>If the present circumstances are such that it would be wrong to print money, why does he not explain that definitely to the public? He is taxing the people under the present Budget £18,000,000 more than Fine Gael promised they would tax them.  They said they would reduce taxation by £10,000,000.  Instead, they have increased it by £8,000,000.  Why is the Minister taxing to that extent rather than printing?  When the situation was very much more inflationary than it is at the present time, he said that we should print the money.  He urged us to print ourselves out of all our difficulties.  We had plenty of good purposes over the years for the spending of money, but we thought that, in an inflationary situation, it would be wrong to add to that inflation by either printing or over-spending borrowed money.  We tried, therefore, to balance and even to overbalance our Budgets in an inflationary period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present Budget gives two contradictory indications as to what the Minister's view is of the present situation. He wants us, first of all, to spend borrowed money, which we have to repay in dollars, on land improvement. That would seem to indicate that he thinks there is a deflationary situation existing.  If that is the case, well then, why not print the money? Why tax?  If, on the other hand, he holds by his circular of a few weeks ago which he sent out when he was looking for subscriptions for the loan, <Col N="661" /> he should not spend borrowed money unless it secures an immediate improvement in the economic situation and he should continue to impose stamp and other duties in order to cut down inflationary pressure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Frankly, I think this is both a realistic and useful Budget. I have very little sympathy with sour, disillusioned and rambling Deputy Aiken.  I have listened to him now for an hour and 35 minutes, to use one of his own expressions, ranting rubbish. The only thing that Fianna Fáil realises is wrong with this Budget is that it is a good Budget.  In fact the <i>Irish Press</i> has gone to the extent of adopting a new technique; when they had nothing bad to say about the Minister for Finance they kept quiet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the situation to those of us who face it realistically and practically? There is one thing which no ranting can overcome.  This Government, in the coming financial year, proposes to spend over £12,500,000 on capital expenditure.  That is a considerable increase from the £2.6 million that the late Minister could afford to spend in the last year in which he was in office.  Deputy Aiken will not tell us honestly that he does not want the reclamation schemes of the Minister for Agriculture and that he does not want the local government drainage schemes.  But he tries to damn them with faint praise.  I think that is even worse than ranting.  It is not national to suggest that improving the quality and heart of the land should be in any way impeded.  It may well be that because of the peculiar economic outlook of Deputy Aiken he cannot realise the ultimate value or the ultimate gain to this country of reclaimed land being put into production.  Fortunately, the Deputies on this side of the House, and possibly some of the more reasonable ones behind Deputy Aiken himself, realise that if we are going to invest money in anything, the soundest and safest investment we can make from a national point of view is to recapitalise the value of the land itself.  Deputy Aiken talks about the increasing taxation.  I do not know whether Deputy Aiken has succeeded <Col N="662" /> in fooling himself by trying to fool other people.  The fact remains that no matter what he may say now we realise that it was indeed providential for the taxpayer of this country that we got Deputy Aiken out in time.  We are now facing a situation where the Minister for Finance, after 12 months in office, presents us with a Budget that shows more than an earnest of the promise he gave that he would increase national expenditure on productive schemes as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>This Budget is a welcome omen of still better things to come.  Despite all the sneers and jeers of some of the oafs on the Opposition Benches, we are conscious of a duty to the people to provide them with productive employment and decent conditions of living. We are glad of this earnest of increasing capital expenditure on productive schemes, schemes which we hope will dispel for all time unemployment in the rural areas.  I do not believe that we have not reached the stage where we can get down to the job of making conditions better for the people generally.  I think that the Minister has succeeded in overcoming the enormous difficulties with which he was faced last year.  Perhaps some of us do not realise how fully and how successfully he has overcome them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Aiken and his colleague, Deputy Lemass, spoke about disappointment. Deputy Aiken, Deputy Lemass and the people know full well the unexpected burdens that the Minister for Finance had to carry last year owing to the crass stupidity and gross incompetence of the last Government. The debentures of Córas Iompair Éireann had to be paid.  The wages of Córas Iompair Éireann had to be paid.  This was the monument erected to Deputy Lemass's &ldquo;brilliant&rdquo; stupidity.  I do not put a tooth in it.  Anybody who does not accept what I say can look through the figures of expenditure for last year.</P>
    <P>Deputy Aiken is sore because this Government has been able to give civil servants long-deferred increases in pay without any Supplementary Estimates or Budgets.  There is provision now for pensioned teachers in this Budget.  There is provision for the <Col N="663" /> Garda Síochána.  I am glad, too, that there is provision for increases to my former colleagues in the Army.  These are concrete things.  Deputy Aiken, following in the footsteps of Deputy Lemass, has blundered and wandered round a comprehensive social insurance scheme.  The first thing this Government did was to implement their promises to the blind and the aged.  A case as bad as the one Deputy Aiken has made could only be made worse by Deputy Aiken himself.</P>
    <P>He has left one impression on me. For a long time I realised that we were a tolerant people.  But I never realised as fully as I do to-day that we suffered him gladly for so long as we did.  He comes in to this House unable to face facts.  He is not even able successfully to distort them.  He deliberately stands praying that a Minister may come back so that he can sit down and keep quiet.  If that is the only contribution that Fianna Fáil can make in opposition to this Budget it is typical of what their present state is.  They are completely devoid of all hope.</P>
    <P>I welcome the relief the Minister has given to those who have been neglected for so long.  The small wage earner will welcome the relief in income-tax. It may be said that the Minister could have done something else.  I think this section of the community deserves the relief they are getting.  I am glad the Minister saw fit to give it to them. Deputy Aiken made some half sneering references to dancing and the tax the Minister proposes to put on that.  It is amusing to find Deputy Aiken now occupying the role of defender of dance halls when we remember his speeches about beer, tobacco and luxuries and what he would do with them.  We remember what he tried to do with them until we had the good fortune to get rid of him and restore some sense of reasonableness from the point of view of the unfortunate consumer.</P>
    <P>A very welcome relief has been provided in this Budget for the small cinema owner and the owner of the little mobile cinema who operates in rural areas.  I think that the reliefs given are of a rational type and were it not for the fact that they are not <Col N="664" /> given under the drab cowl of their long hungry shadow, I do not think that any of the Fianna Fáil Deputies would really quarrel with this Budget at all. The Budget to me is one that gives earnest hope that the day is coming when money spent in this country will be spent where it is likely to do the most good and where it is likely to do that most rapidly.  I think the day of wasteful expenditure has gone and that this Budget can be welcomed by us as an earnest of an era of progressive work on behalf of the nation and not on behalf of any individual or any particular group.</P>
    <P>The criticism of the Minister for Finance by people like Deputy Aiken because he was forced to borrow money to get rid of this extraordinary thing that could be conceived only by a man such as Deputy Aiken, this kind of floating deficit as a result of unbalanced Budgets, seems fantastic.  Deputy Aiken took the precaution to move off. I am sorry he did because I was going to put a few pertinent rhetorical questions that might have tested his appreciation, if any, of normal finance. His criticism seems even more fantastic when one realises the number of commitments from previous years that were not provided for in our Budget last year at all, but were met by the Minister for Finance and met successfully during the past year to enable him to bring before the House a rational Budget for the forthcoming year.  I do not know exactly what is gnawing at the vitals of Deputy Aiken when he becomes critical of the fact that we are going to use money under the European Recovery Plan to finance schemes that will benefit the actual land of the country.  I do not know if Deputy Aiken was in earnest but I hope the <i>Irish Press</i> will have the courage to put in big black lines his statement about reclaiming land in certain parts of the country&mdash;that it was wholly uneconomic, that it might be desirable as a social service, but that he knew it was impracticable.  If that is the considered outlook of an alleged responsible Deputy, it is a pathetic future to put before the water-logged and hardpressed farmers of this country.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to follow the Deputy <Col N="665" /> in his verbal meanderings in his speech of one hour and 35 minutes, but I do say that his would-be derision of a Cumann na nGaedheal Budget carries very little weight because this is a Budget under which at least it has been possible to stop, for the first time in a very large number of years, the appalling rise in taxation.  In the framing of this Budget it has been possible to make available over £12,500,000 for capital expenditure.  If any Deputy on the other side sits down, reads the Budget and sees the money that is to be expended on various schemes such as electricity development work, Bord na Móna and various other projects of national consequence, and if he adds to that the money that is going to be made available under the European Recovery Programme for various other schemes of the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Local Government, he will realise that this year, no matter how Deputies opposite may sneer at it, the Government will be able to make available by way of capital expenditure money that will finance these schemes, that will keep people in employment, that will confer on this country a lasting benefit, a benefit that can reproduce itself in increased production and in the increased value of the land of the country.</P>
    <P>I hope this marks the commencement by the Minister for Finance of a series of Budgets that will provide larger sums for useful expenditure while giving as much relief in taxation year by year as is humanly possible, Budgets which will bring this country back as quickly as possible to a condition which will allow the people to spend as much of their own money as they can, instead of having a continuance of the former tendency of grabbing everybody's money into the State's coffers to be disbursed at the whim of the then one-Party Government. I hope that we are standing on the threshold of an era in which we shall see a gradual drastic reduction in taxation and that that reduction will be brought about by the increased productivity of our industries and of our land, by the increased good-will and the increased co-operation of the people with their own Government for the purposes <Col N="666" /> of making this a better country in its very soil, in its institutions and in its outlook.</P>

      <P>This Budget in many respects, except the reduction in the rate of income-tax, is an &ldquo;as-you-were&rdquo; Budget.  Last year on this resolution the Clann na Poblachta Deputies accorded a welcome with reservations to the Minister's financial proposals.  I do not think that our attitude to-day can be said to have changed greatly. Deputy Aiken tried to pursue a Fabian policy in the hope that the Minister for Finance would be present to hear his observations.  I am very much tempted to emulate the Deputy in the hope that he would be present to hear mine.  Unfortunately, Deputy Aiken, in his opening remarks, drove me out of the House to the Library and thus deprived me of the intellectual treat that would have been mine were I here to hear his criticisms in full.  Of course poor Deputy Aiken is a year behind the times.  In the first four or five sentences that dropped melodiously from his lips we heard references to the dead hand of Cumann na Gaedheal and to a Cumann na Gaedheal budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Later on in the course of his observations he referred to the alleged fact that the Labour Party Deputies and the Clann na Poblachta Deputies were as mute as mice&mdash;implying an unwillingness to criticise and an inability to make suggestions.  I do not know whether he repeated his phrase of last year or not, that we had to jump at the crack of the whip.  That was the general tenor of Deputy Aiken's contribution to this debate.  It is unfortunate for Deputy Aiken that his literary tastes are so high that they prevent him from reading the <i>Irish Press,</i> because his colleague, Deputy Gerald Boland, speaking at Jury's Hotel on the 1st May, expressed the view, according to the <i>Irish Press,</i> that the Clann na Poblachta Party would smash the Government if he, the Minister for Finance, dared to disagree with Mr. MacBride; that the Clann na Poblachta Party threatened drastic action if the Minister for Lands did not adopt their forestry programme of planting 25,000 acres per annum and that the Minister <Col N="667" /> has promised to toe the line.  According to Deputy Aiken, in so far as this financial resolution is concerned, we are as mute as mice, and the dead hand of Cumann na Gaedheal lies all over the Budget.  Deputy Aiken, before commencing to pursue this thoroughly dishonest side-wind attack on two at least of the Parties forming the inter-Party Government should have consulted his colleague, Deputy Lemass, in whose newspaper, the <i>Irish Press</i>, in an article which all Deputies have heard referred to before&mdash;a weekly feature which appears on Wednesdays in the <i>Irish Press</i> and which is written by a gentleman who thinly disguises his identity under the <i>nom de plume</i> of &ldquo;Dáil Reporter&rdquo;&mdash;on the 4th May last&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Some people think it is Hans Andersen.  He referred on the 4th May to the proposals in the following terms:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A year ago the view was commonly held that the Government would not survive its second Budget.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think six months or six weeks was the original lease of life we were given.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;This opinion was based on the assumption that Mr. McGilligan's announced intentions were to be taken seriously and that his efforts to carry them out would make conditions impossible for the smaller Coalition groups.  But by discarding the Fine Gael economy programme and meeting the demands of the non-Fine Gael Ministers for increased financial allocations he has strengthened the prospects of keeping the Government in office for another year.  After today's Budget the word `economy' is likely to disappear finally from the Coalition vocabulary.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For once I am in agreement with Deputy Lemass and Deputy Boland but Deputy Aiken came in here and, not with a view to offering constructive criticisms on the business before the Dáil but with a view to making a backhand attack on the Clann na Poblachta <Col N="668" /> and Labour Party, trotted out the hoary old myth that we were mute as mice.  I regret exceedingly that Deputy Aiken is not here to listen to the views of his colleagues, Deputies Lemass and Boland.  Last year on this debate we expressed the view that last year's Budget was not the Budget that we would introduce were Clann na Poblachta in sole control of the Government. But let me be frank.  Within the financial system that operates in this country, this Budget is a good Budget.  Admittedly, it is, as I have already described it, an as-you-were Budget, but the allowances given in respect of income-tax must be welcomed by anybody approaching this question in a spirit other than that of purely destructive criticism, which was evidenced in the case of Deputy Aiken.</P>
    <P>Another Deputy already referred&mdash;I would like to endorse what he said&mdash;to the fact that it is now possible, as a result of these proposals and of the passage by the Dáil of the American Loan Counterpart Fund, to spend more than five times as much money on capital development in the country to increase employment and to put an end to the awful haemorrhage of emigration.</P>
    <P>It may be presumptuous for me to pit my opinion on a purely technical revenue question against that of the Minister, but I think that the increase of the dancing tax may not produce the results which the Minister anticipates. The Minister has had this year further to reduce the duty on wines. He had been forced to do that because, according to the law of diminishing returns, the rate of duty was such that the tax yield was decreasing.  I am afraid that the Minister may find that the imposition of a tax on dancing may have a similar result.  However, I am not an expert. I throw it out to the Minister for what it is worth.</P>
    <P>The main criticism that any of us on these benches can make concerning this Budget is one which goes to the root of our whole financial system. We in the Clann na Poblachta Party, despite the sneers and the jibes of people like Deputy Aiken, believe that <Col N="669" /> until such time as we cut the link with sterling and make money our servant rather than our master, it will be impossible for us to ensure the maximum development and productivity of the country.  Our policy is that set out in the third Minority Report of the Banking Commission of 1938, and it ill-becomes Deputy Aiken to indulge in the sneers and the jibes which we had to listen to this evening at a report which epitomised the policy which a majority of those in his own Party at one time supported.</P>
    <P>We welcome this Budget with reservations. It places no new imposition on the weaker section of the community. It does, as has been pointed out, implement a decision already taken by this House and gives us an opportunity of developing to a much greater extent than heretofore the natural resources of our country and of increasing its productivity.  I do not believe that this is a place either for unreasoned criticism or for fulsome praise, and within the limits prescribed for him the Minister has done a satisfactory job.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed with this Budget because, like many people outside as well as representatives in this House, I feel that some scheme or some promise of a scheme might be introduced in this Budget to show the country what is going to be done with the unemployed and when the inter-Party Government are going to make an attempt to stop emigration. This Budget is being introduced under very favourable circumstances.  The present Government are not up against the problems the previous Government were up against during the greater part of their time in office; they have not to try to fight an economic war; they have not to try to work within the financial resources of the country to try to keep the people supplied with food and fuel during a world war. Conditions have improved a good deal and I anticipated that we would hear something worth while for the people of this country.  It is very sad that after a year of prosperity and peace and of things settling down to normal we have, in the words of Deputy <Col N="670" /> Lehane, &ldquo;the same Budget; much as you were.&rdquo;  That phrase will apply to the unemployed of the country and to the people going on the emigrant ship. Speaking of prosperity, production and the state of our country generally, it is essential and desirable that, under the favoured conditions under which this Government brings in the Budget, the Government should face up to that position.  There is no use in telling us that increased production will bring increased wealth, for that statement is as old as the hills.  I was expecting that the Minister for Finance would tell us what he was going to do for the rural parts of our country that are fast being depopulated, and for the manhood who are going into the emigrant ship day after day.  In view of the grandiose schemes we have heard of from time to time on the platforms of the Parties making up the inter-Party Government, I for my part was looking forward to some concrete scheme on this occasion, but to my amazement the unemployed and the people of rural Ireland can still look forward to the emigrant ship.  They will get no relief from the Minister for Finance or from the Parties making up the inter-Party Government.  These are facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Listening to Deputy Collins speaking on capital expenditure, one would imagine that he had forgotten that capital expenditure will be carried on as a result of borrowing £24,000,000 last year and not from taxation.  We welcome, of course, any money that can be put into capital expenditure, but it is very hard to listen to a man misrepresenting facts.  As a result of the policy of a certain Minister in the inter-Party Government we are going back to the position where a number of schools in rural Ireland will be closed up.  We had the experience here of the Minister for Lands making a very bad statement regarding Gaeltacht Services.  We were told in history that we are the real Irish men and women that every Government was to look forward to save.  Any scheme or new industry introduced by the previous Government to help those people was jeered at by the present Minister for Agriculture and the grants have been <Col N="671" /> cut down by the present Minister for Lands.</P>
    <P>The policy of the present Minister for Agriculture where rural Ireland is concerned means that many of our agricultural workers will be unemployed. Some have been unemployed already and there will be more in a year or two.  &ldquo;Ill fares the land.... where wealth accumulates and men decay.&rdquo;  That is the short-sighted policy of our friends here, Clann na Poblachta, Labour and, of course, Fine Gael, and that is all they are going to give us&mdash;no definite policy, nothing but promises.</P>
    <P>We have Irishmen anxious to invest money in Irish industry and it was the policy of Fianna Fáil as a national Party interested in the welfare of every section of our people, to encourage them.  To-day you have a Minister who holds the very honoured position of Tánaiste referring to those people as rogues or such like.  We were trying to get these people to invest money in Irish industry, but now they are being threatened with jails.  If a responsible Minister of State can find grounds for complaint, it is his duty to see that the people concerned are put in jail, but the making of wild statements not supported by facts is most discouraging.</P>
    <P>Some time ago, I had reason to deal with one Irish industry here.  I was totally misrepresented by the Minister for Agriculture.  I was concerned with that industry for the sole reason that it was another Irish industry and deserved reasonable protection.  The people of Ireland want to know how they stand.  They have been threatened by one Minister and grossly misrepresented by another.  Any Deputy who makes a case for the people in the House here is grossly misrepresented. It is said that he has some axe to grind or that he is trying to protect vested interests.  While we are on this side of the House, just as when we were on the other side, we are concerned with making the country prosperous. As far as is humanly possible, we are anxious to see that our people are employed.  During the time Fianna <Col N="672" /> Fáil was in office, with its much despised Minister for Finance&mdash;according to Deputy Collins&mdash;there was a vote of £3,000,000 for the relief of rates on agricultural land.  Our agricultural community to-day, instead of getting an opportunity to increase production, is saddled with increased rates, as a result of the policy of the present Government in cutting down the road grants.  We thought so much of the farming community that we gave £3,000,000 towards the relief of rates on agricultural land.</P>

      <P>The agricultural community in County Dublin as well as in the remainder of Ireland were told by the Minister for Agriculture to grow potatoes and oats and, in a number of cases, they found that the oats and the potatoes were left on their hands.  The Minister for Agriculture did not come to their aid.  When questioned about it in the House, he always had the happy knack of misrepresenting the facts.  All the national schemes introduced by Fianna Fáil were despised by that Minister as well as other Ministers and they were supported by the people who are alleged to be the leaders and the saviours of the working people of the country&mdash;the members of the Labour Party.</P>
      <P>I thought I would see something in this Budget which would be responsible for reducing the cost of living, about which we heard so much.  After 12 months of this inter-Party Government, I thought we were going to get the promised reduction of 30 per cent. in the cost of living.  Instead of that, we are faced with an increase in the cost of living.  The Minister for Agriculture, who misrepresented me when I tried to get reasonable protection for an Irish industry, spoke about the poor.  He did not mind the poor having to pay 7/- per stone for flour or 7d. per lb. for sugar.  The whole programme of these people is a totally dishonest one.</P>

It is one of our national industries that could be developed in the way it is developed in other countries.  I shall have an opportunity of dealing with that at much greater length on the Vote for Agriculture.  As <Col N="675" /> there is one representative of the Labour Party in the House, he might be able to tell us when this wonderful comprehensive social insurance plan, which I am very anxious to see introduced, is to come into operation.  As a member of a national Party I am concerned with the welfare of all sections and would like to know when this plan will be introduced.  Will the time ever come when some of the promises made by Government supporters will be redeemed?  Under a Bill brought in here recently, some small increases were given to certain people, but the workers had to pay for that by a larger contribution.  Liberal grants were given under the 1947 Housing Bill.  If this Government want to do anything worth while for the people who are in receipt of moderate salaries or small wages, and are anxious to help in that regard, this Budget should have given some relief to these people and to the ratepayers generally.  However, it is just a go-as-you-please Budget, something similar to that introduced last year.  As to the reimposition of the tax on dances, I am very sorry that it has been decided to cripple the local dramatic societies, the local football clubs and the local social clubs in the villages by compelling them to collect tax on dances which they hold.</P>

      <P>We were told that they were to have a scheme under which tractors would be kept in a village and a person requiring one had only to get on to a tractor and drive it into a field and work it.  Of course the Minister for Agriculture took very great care that the tractors would not be needed.  He has, however, so many &ldquo;yes-men&rdquo; behind him that, no matter what he does in that regard, he will get a very strong backing from them.  Of course the tractors are not needed now. I should also like to know when the Garda Síochána are to be paid the increase in salary.

To the country as a whole, to the unfortunate people who are expecting some relief in rural Ireland, to the unemployed in the various parts of our <Col N="677" /> country and to our youth, it is a very depressing Budget without any encouragement at all.

Speaking here this evening in regard to this Budget and in regard to the inter-Party Government, he seemed to enjoy his own doleful prophecies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been said that budgets are concerned not so much with the raising and the spending of money, although that is an important part, as with giving effect to the industrial, commercial, economic and social policy of the Government.  Deputy Lehane this evening described the Budget as an &ldquo;as-you-were&rdquo; one.  To some extent Deputy Lehane is right.  I believed last year, and I believe this year, that it is the duty of the Minister to consolidate the position first.  I believe that is what he attempted to do in his first Budget, and I believe that is what he has succeeded in doing in his second Budget. The position is consolidated when we can make advances.  That is part of military tactics and I think it is part of good sound financial tactics.  In such a condition of affairs as we have had over a number of years, a condition created by the Fianna Fáil Government which has to be reversed, it is necessary that there should be a period of consolidation. That period of consolidation <Col N="678" /> is covered by the two Budgets produced by the present Minister.</P>

      <P>Looking at this Budget from the point of view of an indication of social policy I think it is a good indication because it does provide constructive provisions for employment; it gives constructive provisions for the rebuilding of the wealth of the country.  Under this Budget there are going to be increases in pay for the Army, for the Garda and for the teachers.  Last night the Minister for Education announced very substantial increases in the pensions of the teachers who have been crying out for years for such an increase.</P>

If those millions of pounds that the Minister for Agriculture spoke of are spent on rehabilitating the land, in making it more fertile&mdash;and that scheme is going to be put into operation on the 1st July&mdash;there will not be one unemployed man in the rural areas.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (1) to insert the following sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  (a) In this section the expression `the Committee' means a committee consisting of&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  the Chief Justice,</P>
      <P>(ii)  the President of the High Court, and</P>
      <P>(iii)  the Attorney-General.</P>
      <P>(b)  The Committee may act by a majority of its members and a warrant under this section shall be sufficiently authenticated if signed by two members of the Committee.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I gave an undertaking last night signifying my consent to move an amendment in response to the views put forward by the Leader of the Opposition.  I have consulted the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court and the Attorney-General and they are prepared to act on the committee. Therefore, I am moving that Section 2 be amended in the form set out, and that a committee be set up. The Chief Justice, the President of the High Court and the Attorney-General will act as the committee in this matter.</P>
      <P>I might refer to the fact that last night a good deal of stress was laid on 65 as a retiring age.  I find that, in the case of county registrars, both myself and my predecessor have very often exercised the right to extend the age in their cases from 65 to 70.  Therefore, the principle involved is not a hard and fast one.  I think that this amendment will meet with the wishes of the Opposition, and I am glad to be in a position to give way to their views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, I heard the discussion that went on across the House last evening between the Minister <Col N="681" /> and the Leader of the Opposition in regard to this suggestion.  The time available for submitting amendments to this Bill was very short.  I think the Bill will be improved by this amendment, which is, substantially, an agreed one.</P>
      <P>I would like to see on this committee some people who are outside the law It was agreed last night that the Chief Justice has no contact with district justices.  The President of the High Court has very little contact with them.  There is this objection to the Attorney-General being on the committee&mdash;that the Attorney-General directs prosecutions.  Prosecutions before district justices are taken in the name of the Attorney-General.  While I believe that any person who would occupy the position of Attorney-General would be an honourable person and would carry out this function, which is a semijudicial one, in the same correct way as he would carry out any other function, there is the danger that if a prosecution or certain prosecutions were initiated by the Attorney-General before a district justice in the last year of his service, the district justice might consider that the fact of his application going before a committee consisting of three people, including the Attorney-General, it might unconsciously influence his decision in the case.  For that reason, I, personally, would prefer if the Attorney-General was not a member of this committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it would be a wise thing&mdash;it cannot be done now unless the Minister agrees, though probably it can be done in the Seanad&mdash;if there were laymen of standing on a committee of this kind.  I think there ought to be.  My suggestion would be, if there had been an opportunity to put down an amendment, to include the president of the Trade Union Congress and the president of the Congress of Irish Unions, those two men to represent the ordinary people of the country as members of this committee.  I do not think this is just a humorous matter at all.  I think that the ordinary people have, and ought to have, some say in important matters of this kind.  I am perfectly certain that the two people I suggest would carry out their functions <Col N="682" /> in a responsible way, and that my suggestion, if acted on, would give greater confidence in this committee.  As I say, I am not in a position to move an amendment now, unless the Minister agrees to it.  It may be that some person will move such an amendment in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>I know that all stages of this Bill have been promised to the Minister to-day.  I take it that he will take the Bill to-day as it is, and there is nothing that I can do about it.  I raise these two points now, the first with regard to the Attorney-General and the second, that the committee could be enlarged by the two individuals I have mentioned, or by some other two people who would not be lawyers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Minister for receiving the suggestions that I made last night and for bringing forward this amendment.  The objection that has been raised by Deputy Cowan did not occur to me.  I thought of the three mentioned in the amendment because they happened to be members of the former disciplinary committee.  I would like to say to the House that another suggestion occurred to me to-day.  I was not going to mention it because it might be suggested that I wished to change the committee for some reason.  If the Minister were considering an alternative, I might say that when that committee was the disciplinary committee we did not have the judge who is President of the Circuit Court.  He possibly might be regarded as a suitable person to act on this committee since he is not concerned in an official way with District Court prosecutions.  However, the Minister can see why I did not like to amend my suggestion, but if the Minister wished to consider it I would be quite happy about the change.  If the Minister thinks there is any substance in the objection that has been raised by Deputy Cowan, I mention that as an alternative that he might consider.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like very sincerely to compliment the Minister on accepting the suggestion that was made to him last night and for incorporating it in the Bill.  Although I compliment him, I do so not because <Col N="683" /> I agree with the suggestion.  I think that the Bill was probably better as it was.  I believe that the more simple the type of machinery you set up the better purpose it will serve.  I believe it is important, particularly in what should be non-contentious Bills of this sort, that the Government should give very careful consideration to suggestions which are put forward in a reasonable way by the Opposition.  I think that will encourage all Deputies in their work here in relation to Bills, particularly on the Committee Stage. For that reason I would compliment the Minister on accepting Deputy de Valera's suggestion.  Once that suggestion has been made and accepted, I would not like to see any alteration made in it.  As far as I know, the Attorney-General is the person responsible for appointing district justices. I may be wrong about that.  I am sorry; I was thinking about State solicitors.  The Attorney-General has much more close contracts with district justices than either the Chief Justice or the President of the High Court. The fear which Deputy Cowan has expressed might be a real fear, but I do not think it is likely to have that effect at all.  In so far as it is necessary to have a committee that will know something about district justices and something about whether or not they are fit to continue, it is essential that there should be on the committee somebody who is rather close to them and who will know what work they have been doing and what work they are to be called on to do.</P>

      <P>The committee must, under the measure as it is, come to a decision and can come to it by a majority.  They, I take it, will meet <Col N="684" /> without the Minister.  He is not on the committee, but he may be consulted by them, and, at the committee meeting, I feel it essential that someone with rather close knowledge of the district justices should be functioning. For that reason, I should like to see the Attorney-General retained.  I think he would be more suitable <i>ex officio</i> than the President of the Circuit Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is a point of considerable importance in what Deputy Cowan has submitted in this regard.  It is desirable that these people who are administering the law should be completely independent of the Executive and that was always one of the big arguments urged against the appointment of temporary justices and assistant justices.  The Attorney-General is virtually in the same position as the Executive, even though he is a law officer.  In principle, there is the relationship to which Deputy Cowan has drawn attention and I personally think that, if the Minister were to consider a further amendment, there is substance in that point and it would be desirable to replace the Attorney-General by somebody else.</P>

      <P>I think the arrangement with regard to a decision by two being final obviates any danger of the Attorney-General being capable of carrying out his view, no matter what the view of the Executive would be.  I think it is ample protection.  It is true that you may have the Attorney-General and a judge putting a person on instead of knocking him off.  I am afraid there is something in what the Leader of the Opposition has said, that there will be a certain amount of softness in favour of the applicant and I do not want to take that away.</P>

The Leader of the Opposition has mentioned the President of the Circuit Court, but there is another man, the Master of the High Court, who also is in an independent position.  I do not want to hold up the Minister, but if, between now and the time when the Bill goes to the Seanad, he considered making a change, it would be only a matter of his coming to the House to be facilitated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I simply want to point out that, although we will not divide on this, our fundamental objection to the Bill stands.  We voted against the principle of the Bill and we do not see any particular point in having a vote on this stage, seeing that we have not got the numbers to ensure that our point of view will obtain.  At the same time, we think it a pity that the Dáil, within a year or two, should be asked to make changes with regard to a matter on which there is obviously a considerable difference of opinion, a matter in respect of which it is easy enough to come down on one side or the other.  I think it unsettles things and gives room for the suggestion that if you have sufficient interest in matters of that sort you can get the Government in power to change in favour of a particular section.  That is a mistake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to reaffirm my view, that if this is based on the idea that the years of service of a district justice would not be sufficient to entitle him to a full pension, that could be met in another way, even though it might not appear to be favourable to the Treasury.  I said on the Second Reading that the important thing is to see that the money is spent on efficient service.  If you do not get efficient service the money is wasted, no matter what reasons are given for spending it. These justices are really the men who safeguard the rights of a large section of the community and it is a very important <Col N="688" /> matter that they should be in full possession of their faculties at their best, that they should be active and should be able to do their work with reasonable rapidity.</P>
    <P>In this case there could be a wiser arrangement instead of giving a possible extra five years and getting, perhaps, inefficient service for it.  It is not so easy to judge these things. It is all right if you can keep a person under constant observation.  In that way you know whether the person is constantly in good health and is able to do the work properly.  But there is no machinery by which you can do that.  The service of the public demands that you should have, as district justices, men who are quick and whose judgment is sound.  It would be better, instead of adding the five years by this indirect method, that you should directly give them five years by cutting down the period required for full pensionable service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a few remarks on one aspect of this measure.  When district justices were originally appointed there was a new system of government and it was essential that young people should be appointed to the position in order, as it were, to bring the new system into operation.  At that time, looking at it from the point of view of providing pensions, the Department of Finance calculated that the average age of appointment was 35 and they decided to make the justices serve for 30 years. As a practitioner in the courts I would say that no matter how efficient a justice may be, you get fed up with him after 30 years.  I think the period is too long and I suggest to the Minister that when he comes to consider this aspect in the new legislation he has in mind, he should consider paying full pension to a district justice on completion of 20 years' service.  That will enable a much older man to be appointed, and I think this is one of the positions in which age counts and helps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. G. Boland Mr. G. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister was dealing with the amendment he said that county registrars had had their years of service extended occasionally, but that was before the pension <Col N="689" /> conditions of county registrars were improved.  I am prepared to agree with Deputy Cowan that they were not improved sufficiently.  I think that in some respects the county registrar has a more important position than a district justice.  A shorter time for pension purposes would have been a much better way of settling this.  On Tuesday we had a declaration of Government policy by the Minister for Health.  Medical officers were in question then and he said it was in the public interest that they should retire at 65 years.  I subscribed to that and I was in full agreement with the attitude of the Dáil in 1946 on this same matter.  On that occasion our Party and the Labour Party&mdash;the Labour Party in particular&mdash;were very strong indeed about the retiring age being 65. We had to assume that the principal Opposition Party at that time were also satisfied.  They had an amendment down to extend the age of retirement of all district justices, but they withdrew that.  It is a good principle and it was reaffirmed by the Government on Tuesday.  Then the next day this Bill reverses that decision.</P>
      <P>I firmly believe this committee will extend the period in every case that comes before them.  If they do not there will be all sorts of recriminations. Every man who is turned down will have a grievance and he will say &ldquo;If I were so-and-so I would get it.&rdquo;  That is bad business.  It would be much better to have the same law as for the civil servants.  There is a great loss to the State by the enforced retirement of experienced civil servants, some of them in the prime of life at 65.  At the same time it would be bad not to have the rule to retire at that age.  It could be said that so-and-so could get it done, but that is not advisable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a bad Bill and it is a pity the Minister gave way to some sort of pressure&mdash;I am afraid he did.  I had to stand up to it on a few occasions.  The cases were hard cases but I felt it was in the public interest to keep to the law as it stood.  I have a feeling that I will not get the prayers of some of the district justices that I allowed to go.  They were good men but I could not do anything else.  If that is the <Col N="690" /> way things will work here it will be very bad.  We may have one Department saying that it is in the public interest to retire officials at 65 while other Departments will take a contrary view.  We will have no public confidence and it will be simply an invitation to other sections of the service to bring pressure to bear on the appropriate Minister to have the same applied to them as in the case of the District Courts.</P>
    <P>I would say 20 years' service is ample. A man 45 years of age should be in a position to receive a pension after 20 years.  A judge in the higher courts can get the minimum pension in five years and the maximum in 15.  I dare&mdash; say that is all right because you require more experience for a High Court position.  This is not a matter that is approached in a Party spirit.  We are all anxious to see this matter settled in the best interests of the community and that the people will be served in the best possible way.  When the Minister brings in legislation, as I believe he intends to, he should reconsider this matter.  The whole House is united on getting the best service for the people and the Minister should induce the Minister for Finance to improve the pension position rather than resort to this method which could never be satisfactory.</P>

      <P>I am glad that this measure has been received by the House in this way.  In the case of the lawyers, there has been this particular extension of years which has not been given to any other section and the reason is that the lawyers were appointed late in life.  The Civil Service cannot be compared with the lawyers in this case.  The civil servants are caught young and they are trained in the arts and crafts of the service and they have a long period before them.</P>

      <P>The fact is that civil servants and this sort of people are not exactly the same.  As I say, <Col N="691" /> power is being left with the Minister for Justice to extend the period of service of the registrar.  In the Gaeltacht area the Minister has power to extend the period of service of a district justice.  I agree that there should be one guiding rule and, as far as I can ensure it, that will obtain. When this has been working for a while and we see how it goes, when the Minister for Justice is bringing in a further Bill at some stage, all this can be reviewed.  I think I shall have to set up some further committee to examine the matter in detail because the whole question of the jurisdiction of the District Courts is a very elaborate matter.  I am glad the Bill has been received in the way it has been received and I am very grateful to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (General Mulcahy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Various matters of importance were referred to during the discussion on these Estimates that one would like to deal with in certain detail but I do not think this is exactly the time to do it.  Deputy Butler, for instance, referred to the old monitorial system and made a rather plausible case for thinking that some first-class material was being prevented from coming into the teaching profession by the abolition of that system.  As far back as 1924-25 and 1926-27, that system was generally commented on.  I will give as a sample an extract from the Department of Education Report of 1924-25:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="692" />&ldquo;It will be seen from the above figures that since the beginning of the present century the monitorial system has been on the decline.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the subsequent year the report dealt with that matter also.  In 1931 the leaving certificate examination was made the basis of entry to the teaching profession and the report said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is difficult to see how the old monitorial system based on the appointment of suitable boys and girls to national schools throughout the country, urban and rural, could be operated if the leaving certificate is to be the minimum test for admission to training.  There is the desirability, if it could be successfully worked, of testing the candidates' vocation for teachers before accepting them for training but, if the present standard of scholarship is to be maintained, not to speak of its being improved, the monitorial system of giving vocational experience in national schools, and testing the candidates' suitability as a result of such experience, could not be the solution of the problem.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I suppose that would be fairly generally agreed.</P>
    <P>Certain questions were raised also with regard to the number of places in the training colleges and in the preparatory colleges allotted to certain areas of the country where Irish is spoken.  There is a certain allocation of places to people with an 85 per cent. knowledge of oral Irish, that is, persons who are candidates for the preparatory colleges and sit for special competitive examination.  Fifty per cent. of these places are reserved for candidates who get 85 per cent. in oral Irish and half of these 50 places must be given to the Fíor-Ghaeltacht.  That gives a 25 per cent. representation in the preparatory colleges.  In the training colleges about half of the places for girls and half of the places for boys are reserved for the preparatory colleges.  So, there is a substantial, but not too substantial, provision there made for people who can be expected to be natural and traditional speakers of the language.</P>
    <P>Again, that is a matter of recruitment and I feel that it will be appreciated <Col N="693" /> from what I said last night that I am not necessarily putting too many things on the long finger just for the sake of avoiding taking decisions with regard to them.  I am avoiding making changes in certain things at the present moment because over a rather wide sphere a considerable number of changes may be desirable, all dovetailing into one another, and I want to see that when these changes are proposed by myself or proposed by anybody outside they will not be decided on a narrow personal or narrow Departmental issue, that I will have the satisfaction of knowing that either my proposals or any other person's proposals are being reviewed by a body competent to discuss the matter with me and to advise me generally with regard to them.</P>
    <P>The same applies to the primary certificate. I do not think it is fair to deny children leaving the primary schools a type of certificate that employers are looking for and, while Deputy Palmer asked last night that the standard of the primary certificate should be advanced so as to be set at the age of 16 years, I think that where children go through the full primary school programme satisfactorily and have to leave before they come to the age of 16, they are entitled to have whatever certificate they can get.  At any rate, the primary certificate has been established and I do not propose to interfere with the primary certificate in any way until there is a better understanding of why it is necessary or why some kind of certificate is necessary for children who are going out into employment from the primary schools.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the radio should be more extensively used for schools.  I am not proposing anything in that line at the present time for the reason that, having regard to the difficulties that arise out of the programme and the syllabus, the cost that is involved and the organisation that would be necessary, I do not think it is worth bothering about at the present moment while there are so many other things to be decided and that require attention and that require money.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies have spoken <Col N="694" /> of the difficulty of talented children of workers getting advancement through the educational system.  I do not think that that can be really seriously argued. There may be cases where talented children have not been advanced, but, with the system that there is of scholarships from primary schools to secondary schools and the system of county council scholarships from secondary schools to the university, I think there is a very fair opening.  I do find a difference in standard between some of the various bodies that give these scholarships, particularly in relation to the means test and, in some cases, in relation to the amount of the scholarships that they give.  I have been considering how we can have that matter harmonised a little more so as to make it clear that there is a fair opening both from primary to secondary schools and from secondary schools to the university, and that the provision that is made of giving scholarships is such a provision as will enable children to take advantage of it.</P>
    <P>The question of the amalgamation of certain schools has been advocated here by quite a number of Deputies.  A certain amount of amalgamation has taken place and there has gradually been an extension of the transport system to more central schools.  With regard to amalgamation, while there are very strong grounds urging amalgamation in certain places, there is the admitted difficulty in the one and two-teacher type of schools that the one or two teachers have to teach the whole gamut of the primary programme. On the other hand, I have great hesitation in shutting down a school in any area because I feel that the removal of a school from any area means the hastening of the passing of the population there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been particularly impressed by that feature in regard to removing schools in Irish-speaking districts or places where the language still has any great strength. In that case it is almost as bad as uprooting the Church.  While there are circumstances in which I have to exert <Col N="695" /> strong pressure to get schools amalgamated, all my instinct is to preserve small schools in rural areas even against difficulties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister passes from that point, has he considered the question of residences for the teachers so that the teachers will not have to travel miles to and from their schools, thereby practically completely divorcing themselves from the little community which they serve?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the fact that in certain areas there is a sense of loss, particularly where teachers teaching in rural schools live in nearby towns and not in the areas the schools serve.  There is no doubt there is a social loss there.  I do not know what the size of the problem would be in relation to building residences for our teachers.  I do know, however, that our difficulties in getting local finance and local support to build the schools themselves are so great that it is very doubtful if we would succeed in the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel the situation in the matter of teachers' residences has gone so far now that until we are able to deal more effectively with the school position itself we would be taking on a little bit too much.  I certainly would favour any kind of scheme that would ensure that the teachers lived among the people whom they served.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hickey raised the question of rent allowances.  The only exception to the general rent allowance scheme <Col N="696" /> is an exception in the City of Dublin in relation to secondary schools.  I understand it affects only two schools. I admit it is illogical to have a difference there but I have not considered whether the irregularity is so great that it requires to be smoothed over. The fact is that the only exception in the whole scheme is in respect of secondary schools in the City of Dublin and it only affects teachers teaching in two schools.</P>
    <P>With regard to secondary education, a point was raised by Deputy Mrs. Redmond.  It is an important point. She asked that the results of the intermediate and leaving certificate examinations be published earlier. There is a difficulty there.  About 4,000 girls and 4,000 boys sit for the intermediate certificate and about 2,500 girls and 2,500 boys sit for the leaving certificate.  The really important results are the leaving certificate because it is upon these subsequent advancement towards university or other work depends.  I hope to have the results out this year by possibly the 4th August.  I think that is a reasonable date in view of the difficulty of getting the papers examined. The results of the intermediate certificate will not be out until some time in September.  I am persuaded that there is no real disadvantage in people having to wait for the intermediate certificate results because the fourth year pupils pass on automatically to the fifth year.  The real difficulty is that the chief examiner in any particular subject can only handle about 20 or 25 assistant examiners.  Each of these can only do approximately 25 papers a day over a continuous period. We cannot have more than one chief examiner for any particular subject and the number of assistant examiners that he can effectively use is, therefore, limited.  In the case of a subject like mathematics where three different sections of the paper have to be examined by three different assistant examiners there is the added difficulty of the association of the markings. From the physical point of view there is an enormous job to be done.  I am satisfied that it is done as expeditiously and as systematically as possible. If there is any way in which I can <Col N="697" /> improve the situation my Department will only be too glad to undertake it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mrs. Redmond also raised the question of non-nationals in our schools.  The position is that non-nationals are allowed to take the examination without doing Irish in order to get an examination certificate but they are not recognised as pupils in the secondary schools; that is, fees are not paid for them.  In respect of non-nationals who begin their secondary education in this country no concession of that particular kind is given and I am not, therefore, quite clear as to what the point of complaint is.</P>
    <P>On the general question on which Deputy Derrig referred back this Estimate for reconsideration&mdash;that is what might be described as a general attitude on the part of the Government as indicated by certain reductions in the grants dealing with Irish which might operate to convince the people that the Government was not serious with regard to the Irish language&mdash; I should like to make a few points. It takes us generally to Vote 49. I think I made it clear yesterday that the cut of £1,000 in regard to the National Museum is not a cut definitely restricting expenditure. There is at the present moment about £3,000 in the Suspense Account of the National Museum and the cut of £1,000 is made simply because that money would not be used, if it were voted.</P>
    <P>The apparent cut in respect of the Irish Committee of Historical Sciences arose out of the fact that the committee intimated that they will not be able to go ahead with the work necessary on the history of the Famine.  They will not be ready to incur any expenditure in connection with that this year and for that reason it is not necessary to provide any money for them.  What is provided is the annual grant of £100.  If and when they are ready to go ahead with the work on the Famine, these moneys will be available. I appreciate the Deputy's references to my attitude in regard to this matter, and I should like to assure him that this committee, in its general work, will have the fullest support of the Government.  We appreciate fully the work they are doing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="698" /> With reference to the cuts in the grant to the National Film Institute, it was given substantial grants over a number of years.  The annual grant was about £2,000.  Last year we did cut the grant from £2,000 to £1,000 on the grounds of economy but actually during the year only £300 was spent by the Film Institute.  Naturally having spent about £2,000 per annum over a number of years, they have accumulated a fair library of educational films and the fact that they have cut down their expenditure so much, is probably because the type of films for which they are looking are not available.  At any rate, out of the £1,000 available last year they spent only £300.  We appreciate the necessity for maintaining the Film Institute and it will not be left stranded in respect of any work which it is really necessary to have carried out.  As regards the provision for the making of films there was an inter-Departmental Committee set up in 1943 by the Minister for Education. Two films were completed under this scheme.  One was a sound film of the ceremonies in connection with the Presidential inauguration in 1945 and another was the film <i>A Nation Once Again.</i></P>
    <P>Certain sound-tracks in Irish of films have already been carried out to the number of about six.  The officers of the Department have been anxious to get some more of these and for that purpose they examined quite a number of films but in fact they have found it very hard to get suitable films on which they could get an Irish sound-track. A number have been examined and some of them have been found to have faults from the point of view of history, religion or philosophy or to suffer from some other defects.  We are doing everything we possibly can to see whether we can get an additional number of films with an Irish sound-track.  I want to see in what way we can get an Irish sound-track on some of the films shown in the ordinary picture-houses.  I do not know whether it would be possible to get an Irish sound-track on say, newsreels, but I think it would be a useful thing if we could get an Irish sound-track on reels coming out in the natural ordinary way.  I propose to have that matter <Col N="699" /> investigated with a view to seeing if it is possible and to ascertain what the cost would be.  It would be a simple and ready way of getting the Irish language brought out in a prominent and interesting manner in connection with current matters shown in our cinemas.  It would avoid what is a great difficulty&mdash;the difficulty of procuring and getting films made for ourselves. We realise the importance of the film just as we realise the importance of radio in getting the Irish language out on to the streets.  If it is possible to do anything in that way, we shall do our best to have it done.</P>
    <P>Objection has also been taken to the cut in the grant for the Place Names Commission.  I appreciate to the full the value of the investigation, and the development of the use, of our place names in spreading an appreciation of the language and, in relation to that, the re-clothing of our traditions with the history of past civilisation.  While it is true that it was part of the economy move to cut down the expenses of the Place Names Commission last year, we were also influenced by a feeling that there should be a better type of organisation to deal with the matter.  We have maintained one of the principal officers dealing with place names, and the records have been properly kept but Deputies will realise the spirit and the purpose for which we have extended the grant to the Folklore Commission.  I propose to consider whether the work on place names cannot be suitably associated with the work of the Folklore Commission.  I feel that it will be fruitful in many ways to have the place names work associated with the work of the Folklore Commission because there is a considerable amount of voluntary work, and a number of voluntary workers available in the Folklore Commission field that can be most useful on the work of place names.  I feel that it is very hard to draw a clear line of demarcation between our place names and our folklore and all that is meant by that.</P>
    <P>There have been criticisms of the cuts in the grants for the Irish papers &mdash;<i>Feasta, Comhar</i> and <i>Indiu.</i>  They do <Col N="700" /> not come under my Department, but I am very interested in the matter.  That interest is inspired by educational rather than by purely financial considerations. I appreciate how important it is to give an opening for young writers to try their hand at producing work in Irish to-day.  I feel that unless there is an opening of that particular kind we shall not get over the difficulties we are experiencing in getting writers to produce books for the Gúm or any other public concern through the medium of Irish.  If it is necessary to get writers, it is also necessary to get readers, and the blot there is at the present time on the paper position with regard to <i>Feasta, Comhar</i> and <i>Indiu</i>, is that while substantial sums have been spent on them to keep them in being, there has not been anything like a corresponding response from the reading public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a very small expansion, even after a very considerable amount of organisation and work.  I appreciate that we want that expansion increased.  Probably the reading public, whether in English or in Irish and in spite of all the literature, magazines, and so forth we see floating around, is not as numerous as we might expect it to be.  It is easier to look at an illustrated paper than at a paper which asks you to think, as any of the periodicals in Irish will ask you to do.  There is not, as far as I am concerned or as far as the Minister for Finance is concerned, any intention to withhold help from any of these papers that will keep them going for another year or two&mdash;at any rate, until they have an opportunity of seeing what they can do.  It will be necessary, in the case of each of these papers, that they will look after their own organisation and expenses and finances and that they will look after their circulation.  There is, therefore, a problem to be discussed there, and there is a problem to be discussed there with the bodies that are running these papers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="701" /> There are three different and distinct types of papers.  The <i>Comhar</i> is a paper that, I realise, is attracting writers among the younger university section of our people.  There is a rather interesting scheme in the universities generally for developing writing in various categories.  University College, Dublin, has given a cup for, say, short stories.  Trinity College has given a cup for, say, something else, Irish poetry.  University College, Cork, has given another and University College, Galway, has given another for annual competition among university students with a view to attracting writers.  <i>Comhar</i> gives them an opening for the publication of these writings during the year.  I think it would be a pity that <i>Comhar</i> would be allowed to drop, but there is a limit to the amount of money that, from the point of view of commonsense, can be spent on these organisations if there is not a very business-like and systematic drive on the part of those who are really interested to produce the periodicals systematically and economically and to have them circulated.  I appreciate that the cost of printing to-day is a very serious burden on people producing any kind of an organ and particularly people producing an organ through the medium of Irish.  Therefore, I expect that conversations and discussions will take place with the organisers and the managers of these papers with a view to having an understanding as to how they can economise, where economies are possible, and how they can best improve their publications and either make them more attractive to the people or get them better appreciated by the people as they are.</P>
    <P>That leads us to the Gúm.  Deputy Timoney raised in a very small way some question about Cumann na Scribhnéoirí and some suggestions that had been made on their behalf.  Briefly, the proposal is that the machinery of the Gúm would be done away with and that a separate body would be set up and that something like £70,000 a year would be given to a board that would look after the procuring of writers and the remuneration of writers and the publishing of books.  I have not been able to go fully into the whole of the <Col N="702" /> difficulties that are involved in regard to the Gúm but the principal difficulties that are involved in the production of books in the Gúm come from printing. There are quite a number of books from the Gúm that have been in the hands of the printers for three and for four years.  There have been so many things to do and there is such a big problem there that requires very close and detailed going into that I have not been able to do it.  When the experience of the Gúm&mdash;the experience of the writers and of the officials in the Gúm, and of the officials in the Stationery Office and of the printers&mdash;is fully examined I doubt if the setting up of a separate body and the providing of that body with money is the solution of the difficulty at the present moment.  I feel that the Gúm is, in very difficult circumstances, doing difficult work and that it is doing as much as any other body could do at the present time.  During the last year it has put on the market six translations, 13 original works, five pieces of music and one or two publications.  It is not a very substantial output but it is something and, just as there are difficulties on the printing side, there are serious difficulties on the writers' side.</P>
    <P>We have had a couple of books presented to the Gúm that might be regarded as real catches for a publisher if they were in English and if there was a substantial public.  However, even as they are, from the point of view of Irish and style and so forth, you would like to take them and to publish them but, on questions of unsuitability&mdash; from the point of view of the nature of the books, historically or in any other way&mdash;we could not accept them. So you get difficulties of that particular kind.  There are difficulties in that you have not numbers of really good writers coming along and there are also great difficulties in some cases in regard to the way in which the manuscripts are presented.  These are questions, I admit, that require urgent, but also very deep and systematic examination, and it is my intention that they will get that examination and get it in a constructive spirit and get it urgently. Things require to be done that cannot be done in a day.</P>

      <P>Might I urge the Minister in that regard to pay particular attention to the provision of the higher text books for universities? Students come from the secondary schools where they do subjects through Irish to the universities and no text books are available for them.  I know that one or two have already been published and that there are some with the Gúm.  It is very important from the point of view of continued teaching through Irish that they should be provided as quickly as possible.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That takes us to the question of the Comhdháil.  Deputy Derrig had a certain amount of diffidence in discussing my difficulties with the Comhdháil. The fact is that £10,000 was expected by the Comhdháil last year after the printing of the Estimates by the outgoing Government.  With regard to the economic question on the one hand, and on a review of the manner in which the money was being expended and the results of that work, I interviewed a representative deputation of the Comhdháil at the beginning of the summer and indicated to them that they could not expect more than £8,000 for the year ended March, 1949.  I indicated the line of thought I had regarding their work and the work I thought the associated group representing the voluntary bodies dealing with evangelising the cause of the Irish language could do. I feel that there is a certain amount of unity of thought in the matter but undoubtedly there is also a certain amount of difference of opinion.  At any rate, I was not in a position to offer them any more than £8,000 during the year.  As it so happens, they expended something like £8,700 or £8,800, so in addition to the £8,000 I was able to promise them, they got £500 or £700 more so that they would not be in debt as a result of their work for last year. But I had no desire, and I have no desire, to get into public conflict with the voluntary bodies dealing with the Irish language on questions of detail and I feel that if Deputy Derrig had consulted the members of the Comhdháil he might have hesitated to criticise me from a constructive point of <Col N="704" /> view for my approach to them in the matter.  I criticised the work of the Comhdháil particularly on the lack of return from the work of the organisers. They have quite a number of organisers scattered in various parts of the country, some of them working in groups.  I felt that the use of organisers that way was leading nowhere from the point of view of spreading the language in a way that it would be rooted and would develop.</P>
    <P>When I examined the various schemes they put forward last year and the year before that, I suggested that they were too varied and that it would be desirable that the Comhdháil Committee should halt for 12 months, maintain their head office, review their general experience and bring together the experience of the various bodies handling in a voluntary way the work for the Irish language and do 12 months' thinking.  With £3,000 available to the head office to help them in doing that and also for their organisers as far as they wanted to maintain the organising work and see how they could perfect and improve it, they could keep five of their best organisers and transfer their activities to the English-speaking parts of Donegal, Mayo, Galway, Kerry and Cork.  They could put them to work as organisers on the flank of the Irish-speaking districts where I had already arranged for a separate inspectorate, special inspectors over a certain number of schools in Donegal, Mayo and Galway, all in purely Irish-speaking districts and not including any in the Breac-Ghaeltacht. In Munster, on account of the small number of schools, we give the inspectors charge of schools in the purely Irish-speaking districts and in the partly Irish-speaking districts.  Their responsibility was not to be for a rigid area inside a line on the map but for particular schools, and they got the direction I read out last night arising out of certain criticisms that were given.  That was what I wanted the Comhdháil to do.  They would have £3,000 to sustain their headquarter office's work and £3,000 to do their work of organising on the flank of where I was trying to consolidate the work in the schools by a system of getting the general public of the area <Col N="705" /> interested in the work of the schools, linking the work of the schools with the vocational education committees and so on.  I wanted them to concentrate for 12 months.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I felt that if organising work was going to do anything any place it ought to be able to do it in these districts, to sound the atmosphere and to stir the imagination and interest of the people in Irish. I felt that it could best be done on the flank of the Irish-speaking districts where I had set up the machinery for inspection.  I only published my letter to the Comhdháil when, on behalf of the Comhdháil, a public statement was made criticising the Government's policy and indicating that the Government was not interested in the Irish language.  One of the criticisms that is made at the present time is that because the Government is not doing certain things the Government is showing a lack of interest in the Irish language.  I could not allow anybody to spread that or propagandise that. It is not so.  I was reluctantly compelled then to issue the letter I had written to the Comhdháil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that Deputy Derrig and others will appreciate it when I say that I do not propose to discuss publicly the nature of the subsequent correspondence that is passing or that will pass between myself and the Comhdháil. They do not think that these parts of Donegal, Mayo, Galway and Kerry on the border of the Irish-speaking districts which I speak of are the best places for their organisers to work.  I do not pretend to appreciate that, but at any rate I am very anxious to have maintained the organisation that is there of the representatives of the principal bodies working in a voluntary way to strengthen the position of the Irish language in this country and to propagandise the philosophy of the Irish language.  I am terribly anxious that the body formed by the coming together of the principal representatives of these organisations should remain <Col N="706" /> and find itself with a position and prestige in the country as representing the Irish language interests and what that means to the country.  If there is anything I can do to keep that body together, I will do it, but I do not think it would serve their purpose to provide Government money for activities that were ultimately not going to lead to successful work.  My attitude to the Comhdháil at the present time is: &ldquo;Do a year's thinking with your past experience and with all the advantages that your office will give you; you will have £3,000 to maintain yourself in that; use the other £3,000, preferably in the way I say.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>At any rate, I do not propose to interfere or direct in any detail any part of the work of the Comhdháil. It is a voluntary organisation that I hope will keep itself in being and will do its work well.  They will work in full consultation with me and I certainly will work in full consultation with them.  I will try to get them to appreciate my point of view, to appreciate what I am trying generally to do for the Irish language and I think it will not be difficult to get them to appreciate that.  I will try to get them to harmonise their work as much as possible with mine.  As far as directly interfering with them is concerned, I do not think that would be good for them or for me.  Everybody will understand that, if we are going to pay out State grants as subsidies to the carrying on of a voluntary organisation, it must be for the carrying on of a kind of work that we see results coming from and that we hope to see results coming from.  Anyone interested in the Irish language can have nothing but approval for a line of thought like that now.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Derrig is mistrustful of my wisdom, I think he ought to consult the representatives of the Comhdháil.  He indicated that he did not want to consult them beforehand, lest I should think it was the Comhdháil representatives who were getting after him.  I am not one to think that about anyone. I want to be able to accept anything that anyone says here, regarding the Irish language and organisation to help it to develop entirely at its <Col N="707" /> face value and judge it at its face value.  All I ask is that this also be accepted from myself or any speaker on these benches.  I think it is wrong, unjust and detrimental to the interests of the language to suggest that there is any assistance withheld by the Government from a really constructive movement in the country to maintain and support the language.  That is only undermining our work.</P>
    <P>Those in contact with the work of any such organisation at the present time realise how great the difficulties are.  The difficulties are great because we are in a period of transition.  There is a generation coming from the school that we do not know how to handle.  I do not know whether any generation that ever went before us knew how to handle the generation that was coming after it.  Nevertheless, they are there to be inspired and the principal way in which they may be inspired is by seeing others working in harmony and working seriously and accepting the <i>bona fides</i> of one another.  I have gone into large schools in Limerick and Cork, where it was possible to meet all the children assembled and to know that, in a fairly long address in Irish, they understood what was being said to them.  There is definitely a lag between the point at which a person will understand everything said to him in a language and will understand it thoroughly and appreciate every nuance of that language and the point at which he will speak it readily, naturally and spontaneously. Speaking it readily, naturally and spontaneously means that he has had the physical practice of doing that.  Do not let us feel that, because the product of the schools do not come out speaking the language as thoroughly and over as wide a range as they understand it, there is not very great strength in the movement to-day. There is.  There is one thing that can do it serious harm and that is that the older workers in the language movement should throw up their hands and say: &ldquo;Ah, look at all the work and see the poor result.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I fully subscribe to everything that has been said about <i>Indiu.</i>  I think <i>Indiu</i> is a very remarkable and most useful production in the Irish language at the present moment. I have had people coming to me and complaining about the cutting of the grants for these papers and I have said to them: &ldquo;Which of them do you read?&rdquo;  and I have not been satisfied with the answer I got.  I suggest that these papers are worth buying, even if you cannot read everything you buy.  I doubt if any book buyer reads everything he buys.  You look at the first chapter and say you are going to read that in a quiet evening&mdash;and it goes on your library shelf.  Those who are interested in seeing the language develop and spread ought to buy these papers and if they buy them often enough they may look at them often enough to be able to guide the producers of them as to what people reading Irish in a weekly, monthly or quarterly volume would like to be reading about.</P>

Those who are anxiously waiting for more books <Col N="709" /> should think of looking over the worthwhile books which are already there. At any rate, we will try and keep these papers going.  They can only be kept going really when those interested in seeing Irish brought back into full popular use go to the trouble of looking at them from time to time and reading them.  If they have any advice to give to the managers and producers of these papers they should give it to them because, from the point of view of getting writers, I think if you are going to get writers in the future they will naturally try to get some of their work published in some of the Irish language papers.</P>
      <P>The only other matter I want to deal with is the Vote for the School of Advanced Studies.  Deputy Vivion de Valera spoke rather well of me and my attitude to the Institute and my encouragement of it.  I do not know that I have particularly gone out of my way to do anything special for it, except that I am interested in seeing that the Institute will be a useful Institute.  I mention the matter only to safeguard myself in this way.  I do not think that scholarship, either on the Irish side or on the scientific side, will develop itself here in this country in isolation from the universities.</P>

I think it is rather generally charged that the standard of our scholarship in Ireland is not high.  It could be higher if it were in the proper atmosphere.  I do not think that we shall advance the standard of our scholarship unless the seat of the higher studies is closely associated with student life.</P>

      <P>There is, I understand, a very disturbing element in connection with the Institute at present, that is a sort of fear and uncertainty. We have specialists there of world renown.  It would be a disaster if any feeling of insecurity should get abroad and we should lose the services of some of these.  It is very important, therefore, that at the earliest possible moment any anxiety in that regard should be dispelled.  It would be a great disaster, in my opinion, if we were to lose some of these through any feeling of insecurity. My own feeling is that there ought to be no feeling of insecurity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>When progress was reported, I was dealing with the Budget as an indication of the social policy of the Government.  I made the point that this second Budget of the Minister consolidates the position and leaves the Minister and his Government in the position that they can branch out in the future from that consolidated position.  It is necessary to have stability.  The two Budgets introduced by the Minister have given a certain confidence to the general public.  They realise that the finances of this State are in the hands of a Minister who can be trusted to see that those finances are properly expended and that there is no waste or loss in regard to them.  It is important for a Government such as this, with a declared policy as this Government has in regard to unemployment, emigration, the cost of living and housing, to have that confidence of the general public.  Although I could criticise the Budget severely from my own particular point of view, I believe that it was necessary to go through this process of stabilisation and consolidation before any advance could be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have already said, the Minister for Agriculture has announced a policy of land reclamation and improvement that is going to give employment to thousands of people.  The Minister for Local Government, in a Bill which is before this House at the moment and which I hope will be passed into law at an early date, has given indications of another branch of development which will assist the land, provide employment and be generally beneficial to the country.  The Minister for Lands, in his policy for afforestation, has also indicated a policy of employment. The Minister for Local Government has proceeded with a policy of <Col N="715" /> building the houses that we need.  All these matters of the improvement of the land, the development of afforestation and so forth, are bound up with the Budget which makes provision whereby those Ministers will be enabled to put their policies into operation. Any sensible approach to the Budget must be one of satisfaction that the Minister and this Government have been able to inspire public confidence and to make the necessary preparations to enable millions of money to be spent in the provision of employment, not employment that will be useless but profitable and constructive employment that is going to enrich the land and improve the wealth of the nation.</P>
    <P>We must look at it from that point of view.  Last year the Minister was conservative in his approach.  This year he has adopted a conservative approach to the problems, and I think that in the long run it will be considered the wise and sensible approach. If he did not adopt that line, if there was any want of confidence in the Minister or in the Government by the public it would not be possible for these great schemes of development to take place, and if they cannot take place it will be disastrous for the nation.</P>
    <P>The reduction of 6d. in the £ in income-tax has a certain psychological effect on the public.  It shows that here is a careful controller of the public purse who has been able to reduce income-tax to the extent of 6d. in the £.  I personally would have preferred that the Minister had devoted the produce of that 6d. in the £ to increased allowances.  However, I realise that the reduction of 6d. in the £ in income-tax has a very valuable steadying and beneficial influence on the general public.  The Minister has taken a correct psychological line in doing that.</P>
    <P>The Leader of the Opposition told us last year at a public meeting that this Government would not survive its first Budget.  It has survived its first Budget and it has survived its second Budget. If the position is consolidated, as I believe it has been, it is going to survive many more Budgets.  I would have <Col N="716" /> liked to have seen an effort made by the Minister to redistribute the wealth of the community.  I realise that that is probably a revolutionary thing to do. At all events it is a revolutionary thing to advocate in these times.  However, if the Minister were to have proceeded to do that last year or if he were to proceed to do it now he would be storing up disaster for himself and for the Government.  I think it was necessary that the position of the Government should have been made certain.  The general public should have that confidence in the Government that I mentioned. Not only is the general public coming to realise that this Government is here to stay but the Opposition Party has realised that the Government is here to stay and that there is nothing in the foreseeable future that is going to terminate the life of this Government and put another one into office. That is clear from the speech made by Deputy Lemass last night.  Deputy Lemass came in here to listen to the Budget.  He was presented by the Minister in accordance with the custom of the House with a copy of the Budget speech.  But Deputy Lemass had his criticisms of the Budget ready in advance.  He had them typed out and brought them into this House, and it did not matter what Budget the Minister for Finance brought in Deputy Lemass's criticism was to be the same.</P>
    <P>Deputy Aiken spent one-and-a-half hours or one hour and 35 minutes to-day speaking on the Budget.  I was not able to be here for the whole of the speech, but I heard him for an hour and 15 minutes.  He said nothing at all, not one word, not one solid or constructive thing did he say during the hour-and-a-quarter that I was listening to him.  Why?  That is the sign that defeat and inevitable dissolution has been accepted by the Fianna Fáil Party and that in itself is an indication of the success of the financial policy which the Government have shown in the two Budgets that have been introduced by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>I have said already that not only are these great works to be set going but the Minister has been able to provide for an increase in pay this year <Col N="717" /> for the Army, for an increase in pay for the Gardaí, for an increase in pay for the teachers, and for an increase, as was announced last night by the Minister for Education, in teachers' pensions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass has got a bee in his bonnet in regard to the social welfare scheme.  He has been harping on it here in this House and in the columns of his own newspaper, the <i>Irish Press</i>, the newspaper which, by the way, does not recognise my existence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>However, as I say, I will deal with that again.  I know, of course, that is in accordance with the political tactics of the Fianna Fáil Party, absolutely in accord with their political tactics.  But Deputy Lemass, as I say, has a bee in his bonnet in regard to the scheme that Deputy Norton has promised.  Every Deputy in the House knows that, since Deputy Norton became Minister for Social Welfare, he has spent every minute of his time, and the time of his officials, until now, as he has announced, his Department has completed this scheme.  A scheme like that, which is going to revolutionise the whole social welfare of the country, cannot be dealt with in a week or in a month or in a couple of months.  Deputy Lemass knows that well.  In fact, he was a Minister for many years, and in all those years he just reached the stage of bringing in the Bill that enabled this Department to be set up.  That Party was in office for 16 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Norton, as Minister for Social Welfare, and his officials, have worked night and day and have completed their examination of this revolutionary proposal which is going to affect the lives of almost everybody in the country. Deputy Lemass knows that the next stage is the circulation of that scheme amongst Government Departments. Deputy Lemass knows that another step will be the examination of the matter by the Department of Finance.  There will be a consideration of the views of every Government Department in regard to it.  When all that is done, I take it that the next step will be the presentation of that paper to the Government.  Any person who was a Minister as long as Deputy Lemass was knows that if Deputy Norton had done nothing else in the period since he became a Minister he could not be any further advanced with that particular plan or scheme than he is at the moment, but, dishonestly, week after week in the columns of this unmentionable <Col N="719" /> paper, he refers to the failure of Deputy Norton to produce this scheme.  He had it here last night, typed and ready, no matter what sort of Budget the Minister had.</P>
    <P>He was followed to-day by one of the ablest Finance Ministers that the world has ever known, Deputy Aiken, on the same lines.  I think it is really unfair for any Deputy on this side of the House to criticise Deputy Aiken because Deputy Aiken has done more than any other Deputy to put Fianna Fáil out of office and to put this Government in.  Perhaps from that point of view it would be unfair to criticise him.  Deputy Aiken, although he knew, and must have known from his period as Minister for Finance, the procedure through which these things go, trotted out the same complaint, and he was followed by Deputy Burke, an appropriate combination.  In regard to this particular matter, Fianna Fáil should only realise the futility of that conduct. Right through the country the ordinary person knows that you cannot bring in a revolutionary scheme such as this without ample consideration and ample examination.  When Deputy Norton brings it in, as he will in the near future, what will all this criticism show? This criticism will show the insincerity and the dishonesty of the propaganda that has been used by Deputy Lemass, particularly against Deputy Norton.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The reference is the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Social Welfare.  He prepared this scheme and worked on it very hard. Those who know him know how hard he does work.  In that period, he introduced his measure to increase old age pensions to 17/6 per week and that measure is in operation at the moment. He brought in his measure to increase widows' pensions and that is in operation at the moment.  He brought in legislation, which is law at the moment, increasing workmen's compensation payments from 37/6 to £2 10/- per week.  If that Minister had done nothing but these three things in his 15 months in office, he would have done <Col N="720" /> a good job, but nevertheless we had this dishonest criticism of him and of the Government with regard to these matters.</P>
      <P>Deputy Aiken to-day talked about the Minister printing bank notes.  With every word Deputy McGilligan said as a member of the Opposition when the Central Bank Bill was going through and with what he said last year in his Budget statement in this House and in the Seanad, I thoroughly agree.  Deputy Aiken, when he talked to-day about printing bank notes for the purpose of balancing the Budget, was talking absolute rot.  That is how it appeared to a sensible, intelligent person who knows something about these matters&mdash;I do not know how it appears to Deputy Aiken.  He was talking absolute rot and nonsense.  Nobody would print bank notes for the purpose of balancing the Budget.  What Deputy McGilligan, as he then was, advocated was the printing of notes necessary to give employment in the building of houses or in productive work for the community, which is a different matter entirely.</P>
      <P>I have confidence in the Minister for Finance.  I know that there is no other Deputy who has the knowledge of finance that he has and no other Deputy who has the courage he has in regard to the adoption of what might appear to be a revolutionary method, and I think he is going the right way in stabilising and consolidating this position, in creating public confidence in his administration.  When he has succeeded in doing that, this Government will, I hope, be able to show to Deputy Aiken and many other antediluvians in the country how things can effectively be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to this tax on dance halls, I am not by any means a dancing man.  I go to a dance now and again, but when I was younger, I probably had a greater interest in them.  At the moment I take it that the youth of the country are just as they were in my time and that there are quite a number of them anxious to enjoy themselves at a dance.  This question of a tax on dancers has been in the air for a long time.  It was put into operation and was removed, and I think it was removed because of the difficulty of <Col N="721" /> collecting the tax and the cost of its collection.  I do not know what the cost of collecting this tax will be, but I know that there will be many people who will try to avoid payment of it.  I know that there will be a lot of difficulties in that way.</P>
    <P>I understand that dancing has changed a good deal since the time when dances were arranged by a few people for a social evening.  It has now become a business on which the livelihoods of quite a number of people depend. There are a very large number of musicians, in Dublin particularly, whose livelihoods depend entirely on the public dance halls in Dublin and everyone will agree that these dance halls are well run, well controlled and hygienic in every way, and if this tax should harm that business, should close down any of these halls and lead to unemployment amongst musicians, it would be a bad thing.  In addition to musicians, there are quite a number of other people&mdash;waitresses, attendants and so on&mdash;whose livelihoods depend on this dancing business.</P>
    <P>The amount involved is not very big and I urge the Minister to reconsider it from the aspect that it may lead to unemployment.  I understand that there is an organisation of the proprietors of these dance halls all over the country and I am quite sure they will be in touch with the Minister.  I ask him to consider their representations in the light of the possible unemployment of musicians and others which this tax may cause and to endeavour so far as he can to meet these representations.</P>
    <P>As I indicated earlier, I could, if I were not a realistic person, find many parts of this Budget statement to criticise, but I am looking at it in a broad, general way.  I am looking not to the present month or the present year but to the future, and I think it is a Budget which gives great confidence for the future.  I consider it a sound Budget and one which should meet in this House with the almost unanimous welcome which it has received from the public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MatthewOReilly" hpid="Mr. M. O'Reilly Mr. M. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel inclined to congratulate the Minister, not on the <Col N="722" /> excellence of the Budget he has introduced, but on the amount of deception which is inherent in that Budget.  The first big headline we had was the announcement of the reduction of 6d. in the £ in the income-tax rate, but, when we get down to the rural areas, we find the rates increased by even more than that amount.  Deputy Cowan is possibly paying rent for his house and he will find that his rent has increased. That system is not one which will produce the results Deputy Cowan hoped for.  It is a dangerous proceeding. The amount of indirect taxation &mdash;although local taxation is scarcely indirect taxation; it is merely another from of direct taxation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>The county councils are overloaded, the Minister having done his utmost to overload them, with the result that they refused in most cases to strike the full rate.  Therefore, to my mind, this is a Budget designed to deceive the people.  One would imagine from reading and listening to the statements made here that we were going to get a reduction in the cost of living.  Now, rates come into the cost of living.  I do not know what the modern method of calculating it may be.  It may be that rates, under the present system of calculation, do not come into the cost of living, but they are there for the people and the people have to face them.  Therefore, this Budget, so far as that aspect is concerned, is a complete deception.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, when he was reading his Budget statement, told us that agriculture has improved, and agricultural exports have increased.  I think that is the exact statement he made.  What is the use of talking like that?  How could agricultural exports increase?  What we have to export is beef; we may have bacon; we have eggs now.  We know the result as regards eggs.  It cannot be explained away by telling us we are feeding cheaper Indian corn to the hens.  Take beef.  The British are allowed to consume <Col N="723" /> 10d. worth in the week and 2d. worth has to be tinned meat.  Where could we get an increase against that? Is not that another deception?</P>
    <P>I ask Deputies to face this position honestly and say where can we increase production.  I do not know any farmer who would not increase production to-morrow morning if he got a market.  The Minister for Agriculture kicked off by definitely aiming at killing production&mdash;and so he did.  He left farmers with agricultural produce lying on their hands.  There are thousand of tons of oats rotting and the mills are filled with Indian corn. The same applies to potatoes.  What farmers will increase production in those circumstances?  You can see the returns for our cattle.  The beef market has faded out completely.</P>

We are now concerned with this American loan and the Minister for Agriculture is out to improve every farm and every field <Col N="724" /> and deal with the drains and other things.  When all that is done, what will we do?  The Minister for Social Welfare and the Minister for Industry and Commerce did their utmost to destroy the industries we established. That was the only market we could get, the only market we were sure of.  As soon as the British can get cheaper meat they will not take it from us.  We have had experience of what they can do; they have not very much compunction, either economically or politically, and every one of us knows that well. The only sure market we had was the market created by our industries; yet we had the Minister for Industry and Commerce saying that every industrialist here was a semi-rogue.  The Minister for Social Welfare complained about them driving around in luxurious motor-cars.</P>

      <P>Of course it is wrong.  Have they not a perfect right to drive around in cars?  Were they not giving good employment?  If you had not these people where would the workers get employment?  That is another snag of the Labour Party. You must induce people to invest in this country.  We have millions invested abroad and why would it not come here?  Does anyone suggest that people will come here after listening to the wild statements that have been made?  Those Ministers soon drew in their horns and I believe the reason was that the Taoiseach was sensible enough to see the dangers ahead and the damage that was being done.</P>
      <P>So far as I can see, we are not going to have the big market in Great Britain that so many people are talking about and that the Minister for Industry and Commerce is preparing for.  I believe that as soon as cheaper stuff comes in the British will take it in preference to ours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as this Budget is concerned there is not much use in trying to push down people's throats that it is an excellent Budget, that it is a production Budget.  Somebody laid particular emphasis on that&mdash;that it is a production Budget, that it will give a fillip to production.  How can you do that when <Col N="725" /> you are taxing production at the rate at which you have taxed it?  Does anybody believe that the enormous increase in local taxation is not a tax on agricultural production?  I believe it is.  Instead of doing that, the other thing should have been done and that is to help the farmers.</P>
    <P>What is the position of the farmer and the farm labourer?  I thought unemployment was more or less stabilised but the latest reports show that unemployment among agricultural labourers is on the increase.  As soon as farmers have completed their tillage the labourers go.  The Minister for Agriculture said he could prevent them doing that.  Then, why are they letting them go?  It is because they see no future and have no promise of a market for their produce.</P>
    <P>They will not be deceived by the nonsense talked about regenerating this country.  The only way to help the country is to create a consumption for our produce.  Farmers will not produce unless they know there are some means of disposing of that production.  If they see the market dwindling they will not produce.  I do not believe this Budget is a production Budget; on the contrary, I believe it is a makeshift and it certainly is a deception.</P>

      <P>I was very interested in the remarks of Deputy Cowan.  He began by poking fun at Deputy Burke. He associated Deputy Burke with funerals and he seemed to regard it as something of a good joke that Deputy Burke should say a few words over a grave at the final parting.  I am sure Deputy Burke does that, as everybody does who attends a funeral, whether he is heard doing it or not.  I suppose Deputy Cowan is too modest to admit the fact that he himself does it.  In any event, the reference to funerals is fairly apposite on this Budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and I will be listening for a repetition of the &ldquo;hear, hear&rdquo; when I have indicated what I mean.  I have two choices after listening to Deputy Cowan&mdash;to accept Deputy Cowan's word or to accept the word of the Minister for Finance.  Deputy Cowan's referred to the provision <Col N="726" /> of social security and employment. The significant fact about the Budget is that the Minister for Finance made no reference to either and in so far as social security schemes are concerned, pointed out that we cannot have any more of them, or, if we are to have more of them, that we must have more taxation.  I would like Deputy Cowan to read the Budget again and to read his own speech and to try to bridge the gap between them.</P>
      <P>I intend to refer to the Budget only in so far as it fails to make provision for the poorer areas.  A great deal of praise has been heaped on the Minister for his aid to the official classes.  I do not begrudge the official classes whatever help this Budget gives them but I remember a test having been put on the question as to whether or not these official classes were treated as generously some years ago as the then Opposition thought they should have been treated.  When the matter was referred to the people the Government's viewpoint was endorsed.  I commend the result of that general election to Deputy Cowan's consideration. The official classes are composed of Irish citizens who are entitled to a fair meed of justice.  In view of the praise that is heaped from time to time on the people who have preserved the most important national heritage, the Irish language, one would have thought that the Budget would not ignore them entirely.  The Budget goes further than that and worsens the position of the people of the Gaeltacht in relation to the benefits and services which they enjoyed when Fianna Fáil left office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Estimate for Gaeltacht Services, Deputy McFadden indicated that Donegal alone benefited to the extent of £100,000 per annum from one of the Gaeltacht industries, namely, tweed. Everybody in that business knows that the collapse of the industry is due solely and entirely to the trade agreement that was made last year in England.  The Minister tried to deny that and in his attempt made what in my opinion was a most unfortunate statement, that the superior quality of Harris tweeds is responsible for the collapse of the English market for Irish <Col N="727" /> tweeds.  Can he explain to us how it was that at the particular time that the trade agreement was made with Britain, the English people quite suddenly discovered the excellence of Harris tweeds?  It remained for the Minister for Lands, in charge of Gaeltacht Services to tell the world that Irish tweeds are inferior to Harris tweeds.  I think, in view of the statements he made several times in concluding the debate on Gaeltacht Services, that he was anxious to tell the truth, no matter how much it was against himself and his Department.</P>

      <P>If the Chair thinks that I am going into too much detail, I will cut it short but I am dealing with the failure of the Budget to remedy the hardships which have been inflicted on the poorer areas, the Gaeltacht, for the last year or so.  Whatever sections of the community have been aided, for the last year or so the people of the Gaeltacht have had their livelihoods in various directions filched from them. If I am not allowed to deal with them in detail, I think I should be permitted to give a litany of them.  The first thing that happened was the wiping out by one fell stroke of the turf industry. I am just as well aware as people living in towns and cities that the quality of the turf was not always of the best. It was very unfortunate for Fianna Fáil that the year before the general election took place was one of the worst turf years in living memory.  I do know that the people of Dublin and other places got a quality of turf that turned them against it.</P>

They might have eased the blow for these people by substituting something else for the turf industry.  What did we find?  Every <Col N="728" /> year there is a list of special employment schemes ready for implementation when the employment period ceases and when all the people who hold certificates under the Unemployment Assistance Acts become again entitled to receive benefit these schemes of employment are put into operation.  What did we find?  The summer turf industry was lost and we expected that in the winter the Government would make up for that by giving extra money for employment schemes.  In my area, the number of schemes was cut down to half.</P>

      <P>I do know.  Take the provision in the Estimates over the years 1947-48, 1948-49 and 1949-50.  The actual Exchequer issues for Central Fund and Supply Services was £65,000,000 odd in 1947-48.  For 1948-49 it was £71,000,000, and it is estimated for 1949-50 at £73,000,000.  If you go back you will find there is a gradual crescendo, as it were, reached in expenditure, taking the country as a whole.  We come to the Gaeltacht now and we find there is a diminuendo.  In the last financial year the actual expenditure for Gaeltacht Services was £97,000.  This year it is proposed to spend only one-third of that, £30,000, on these services.  In the year 1947-48 &mdash;the last year of the Fianna Fáil régime&mdash;the expenditure was £115,000. Along with that a gradual reverse is taking place in respect of the country as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How can Deputy Captain Cowan show that this increased expenditure is going into productive employment? He specifically mentions the official classes as being well treated.  He has not mentioned whether the Government has provided any money for the grandiose employment schemes about which we heard so much in the past. He was silent with regard to afforestation. He was even silent with regard to drainage.  He did not say a word about emigration, good, bad or indifferent. I do not know whether he is aware of the fact that the Government which he supports has cut down the grants which local authorities used to get for expenditure on roads and thereby cut down at the same time employment on road works.  This year <Col N="730" /> County Galway was somewhere in the region of £200,000.</P>
    <P>Deputy Captain Cowan made great play with the 17/6 per week old age pension.  Instead of all the promises that were made about making this a great country by making everybody healthy and happy and placing everybody in good circumstances, the emphasis is now on social services.  With all the savings that have been made in respect of turf, roads, special employment schemes, air services, broadcasting stations and the reduction in food subsidies and so on, why was it not possible to go a little further than a paltry increase of 2/6 in the maximum for old age pensions as against the maximum under Fianna Fáil?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I explain it in this way. Under Fianna Fáil the statutory pension was 10/- and there were two supplementary allowances of 2/6 each, making a total of 15/-.  The maximum now is 17/6.  Not all the old age pensioners get the full 17/6.</P>

      <P>I suppose a great many changes have taken place in Córas Iompair Eireann.  There has been a big change in personnel in recent times.  I am more than surprised at the remarks I have just heard in that regard.  In any event the Minister for Finance has not pretended that there is any intention of doing the things which the people who supported him expect to be done.  In my constituency we have always had a certain amount of emigration. When the present Government and its protagonists were in opposition they denounced Fianna Fáil because of that emigration.  Now we find that they are changing their tune.  They are now saying that emigration is innate in the Irish character.  Last week on the Gaeltacht Services Vote one Deputy, speaking in Irish, said that the Irishman was fond of travelling and that it would be unfair to stop him.  Whatever may be said for that type of emigration where young people want to see the world, I can tell the House that there is a new type of emigration in my constituency now.  The people there are beginning to sell their small holdings and emigrate to America.  The entire family emigrates.  That is a type of emigration we did not have heretofore.  It is taking place under the Coalition.  Not alone have my constituents lost many of the services which provided them in the past with a fairly reasonable standard of living <Col N="732" /> and not alone have hundreds of them emigrated, but they have also lost hope and that is the worst loss of all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The success of this Budget can best be judged by the ill-tempered reception it has received from the Opposition Benches.  Deputy Bartley had a number of comments to make and one complaint he made was in relation to the turf industry.  In the course of his remarks, it became quite apparent that Deputy Bartley had not listened to the Budget statement read by the Minister yesterday and in addition was, apparently, not sufficiently interested to read the statement for himself. One of the matters dealt with at some length by the Minister was the question of the turf industry.  In his statement, the Minister set out the amounts which were to be advanced to Bord na Móna in the coming year and the amounts which were advanced last year, showing an increase this year of approximately £200,000 as part of the turf development plan which is being operated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I merely mention that to show that even that supposed grievance against this Budget has, in fact, nothing in it but I am glad that Deputy Bartley brought our minds back to the question of turf and fuel generally, because one of the problems which the Minister had to take into account in dealing with the financial position in the course of the past financial year was the extraordinary muddle created as a result of the Fianna Fáil turf and fuel policy generally.  I think all Deputies will remember that on the first occasion this Dáil met Deputy Lemass was able to stand up in the Opposition Benches and tell the new Minister for Industry and Commerce that, at least, he could say going out of office that he had built up a sufficient supply of fuel in the Phoenix Park to last ten years.  He omitted to mention on that occasion that not only had he allowed stocks of fuel to reach sky-scraper heights in the Phoenix Park, but that fuel was still coming in at a cost of £40,000 a week to the Irish tax-payer.  It was that kind of planning indulged in by Fianna Fáil which created what I think can only be described as the turf muddle.  As a result of that, the new Government <Col N="733" /> were faced with the necessity of taking the decision, which should have been taken by their predecessors many months before, to stop the inflow of fuel to the Phoenix Park.  Deputy Bartley was kind enough to remind us of that and it is a fact which Deputies should be very slow to forget.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bartley also, I think involuntarily, referred to the position of Córas Iompair Eireann.  For some reason Deputy Little appeared to be quite aggrieved that Córas Iompair Eireann should come into this discussion at all.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I should amend my statement by saying that when Córas Iompair Eireann was referred to, while Deputy Bartley was speaking, Deputy Little was quite aggrieved that it should have been mentioned in the discussion.  The fact of the matter is that the Minister again had to take serious cognisance of the Córas Iompair Eireann position and that he found it necessary to deal with that in his Budget statement.  I think it might be no harm to remind Deputies of the fact that Córas Iompair Eireann was supposed to be the be-all and the end-all of Fianna Fáil public transport planning.  After the election in 1944, when the Transport Bill was reintroduced into a Dáil which had a Fianna Fáil over-all majority, the country was assured through the mouths <Col N="734" /> of Deputy Lemass and his colleagues that this measure was going to give the people more efficient transport and give them that much more cheaply than the previous system had provided.</P>
      <P>The then Taoiseach, Deputy de Valera, said on that occasion that his sincere belief was that the guarantees given by the Government and contained in that Bill would never have to be met, that he did not think there was any danger of such a contingency arising.  The Minister in his Budget statement had to examine the position created by the existence of Córas Iompair Eireann and the losses which it had incurred in the last couple of years bringing them to such a position that the Minister for Industry and Commerce, some little time ago in the Dáil had to speak of the company as existing under the shadow of the bailiff.  They had lost in the year 1947 something in the neighbourhood of £900,000 and in the year 1948 considerably over £1,000,000.  They had arrived at a stage where, although they had £500,000 worth of cheques actually written, they could not issue them because they had not the funds to meet them and the Government had, unexpectedly, to come in a very big way to their assistance financially in order to meet their bill for wages at the end of the week in which the Minister was speaking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer to the Adjournment Debate on Dublin bus fares which took place in this House on the 23rd March this year and to the Minister's reply to that discussion.  A number of Dublin Deputies, including myself, had approached the Minister during the day to see if anything could be done to retain the penny bus fare, at any rate for the poorer sections of the community. After having heard the Minister's case, that deputation, which consisted of Deputies of all Parties in this House, had to admit freely, one to another, that not one of them could argue against it, that no matter what our hopes or desires might be, we could not make any legitimate case to the Minister that the penny bus fare should be retained.  The fact that we were put in the position of having to make that confession was due to the Córas <Col N="735" /> Iompair Eireann situation which the Minister disclosed to that deputation and which he later disclosed to the Dáil that evening.  The Minister, first of all, mentioned the figures I have mentioned already, that in 1947 Córas Iompair Eireann lost £900,000 and that in 1948 they lost £1,400,000 and that, early in his first year of office, he had been approached by that concern with propositions to enable them to dismiss 3,500 men from their employment.  He went a lot further than that, though, and pointed out that the Government and the Minister for Finance had to provide from central funds a sum of £360,000 to meet the interest on debentures which had been guaranteed by the State and which Córas Iompair Eireann were not able to do themselves. That is one of the items which has now to be accounted for by the Minister in this Budget.</P>
    <P>I am not sure whether it was on that occasion or on another occasion that the Minister dealt with the question of payments to the chairman, which I do not propose to go into now.  They were dealt with only in order to show the extravagant mind and the extravagant mentality with which that concern was run; the fact that they had grandiose ideas that thousands or tens of thousands did not matter when they were paid out at top level; that the taking on of large schemes such as one the Minister mentioned on that occasion did not matter when the company were virtually bankrupt but that these things were guaranteed by the State in the form of debentures and, whether it was because of that encouragement or not, that the situation was created, in any event whereby all the debts incurred&mdash;totalling at the time the Minister was speaking, the 23rd March last, a sum of close on £500,000&mdash;would be met.  The Minister found it necessary to state that in the Dáil because, as he said, the concern was in such a position that different companies, some of them semi-State companies, were threatening to cut off their lights, telephones and so forth. At that stage, a sum of £360,000 had to be paid by the Minister for Finance in respect of those debentures.  I think it is very proper that, on the discussion <Col N="736" /> of the Budget, in which the Minister found it necessary to refer to that particular situation, we should remember that one of the headaches which the Minister has to deal with is Córas Iompair Eireann.  We can at least express the hope at this stage that the Government will find themselves, at a fairly early date, in a position to introduce the legislation they have foreshadowed to drastically alter the running of Córas Iompair Eireann.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bartley may or may not have been in the House earlier to-day when the Minister for Industry and Commerce was answering a supplementary question by Deputy Derrig in regard to tweeds.  I think I am correct when I say that the Minister made it quite clear in his reply that, so far from the Trade Agreement causing the collapse of the homespun tweed industry and of finishing the English market for it, there was no English market there in a legitimate way, at any rate, before the Trade Agreement.  The Trade Agreement was the key which opened the door to the British market.  It is not the fault of the Minister for Industry and Commerce nor of the Minister for Lands if the British buying public do not want to buy our tweeds.  I think the Minister for Lands was incorrectly quoted by Deputy Bartley when he was referring to the question of whether our tweeds were inferior to Harris tweeds or not.  My recollection is, and I am open to correction on this matter although I was in the House when he was speaking, that when the Minister for Lands was replying to the debate on Gaeltacht Services he stated that the Harris tweeds which were being bought in England were of a better quality than the tweeds now on hands here.  He did not say that the Irish craftsman would not be able to produce a better quality tweed than the Harris tweed but that, so far as the buying public in England was concerned, they considered Harris tweed better quality and they refused to take Irish tweeds.</P>
    <P>On that occasion the Minister for Lands dealt very fully with the efforts he and his colleagues made in order to find a market for the stock now on hands although they were unable to do <Col N="737" /> so.  I think it is most unfair of Deputy Bartley, if he heard the reply given by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in this House to-day, to stand up within a couple of hours of that reply and reiterate the falsehoods which have been disseminated by Fianna Fáil for the last nine or ten months to the effect that the trade agreement was responsible for the collapse of that industry.  I think they should have more sense than to say that kind of thing now in the face of the calm and deliberate statement made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce here to-day.</P>
    <P>The same Deputy had a lot to say about the hostility of this Government towards the poorer areas and all that kind of thing.  I believe he knows quite well that it is not true.  I am certain that other Deputies in his Party, at any rate, know it is not true, and I am equally certain that very few of them would like to be reminded of the difference in outlook which has clearly manifested itself in the working of this Government as compared with the working of a Fianna Fáil Government. When this Government was formed something over a year ago, and on his last Budget statement and several times in the course of the year intervening between that statement and the statement he read yesterday, the Minister for Finance has made it quite clear that, as far as he and the Government is concerned, their policy is one of retrenchment.  They did not adopt that policy for the sake of economising but for the sake of cutting out wasteful expenditure, for the sake of lopping off expenditure and waste which was not necessary, which was not productive and which was not for the good of the ordinary people.  However, where money was required for schemes, whether social welfare schemes or schemes of a similar nature or productive schemes generally, money would be forthcoming.  Time and again Deputies of this House and people outside it have heard the Taoiseach declare, for instance in regard to housing, that money would not stand in the way of putting up houses.  In pursuance of that policy which, I assert, was an eminently sensible and sound policy, the Government did go in for economy <Col N="738" /> in a certain direction.  They are to-day disposing of some of the luxury hotels bought by Fianna Fáil at very great expense to the tax-payer.  That is one type of luxury spending that has been or is being stopped.  I see Deputy Little taking notes and I do not want to be misrepresented on this matter. I am not in any way criticising the inflow of tourists to this country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but I believe that the tourist who comes to this country can be very well catered for by private enterprise and that he would much prefer to have it done in that way.  I have already mentioned Córas Iompair Eireann and the losses incurred by that company and the unexpected payments which the Government had to make during the course of the year in order to keep that company going.  I do not know whether I am in order or not but the next point which comes logically to my mind when I am dealing with Fianna Fáil expenditure is the purchase by Deputy Lemass of Argentine wheat which cost the State about £2,500,000 in subsidy. I think that the repercussions of that purchase were felt in the composition of this Budget and that they had to be taken into account in the composition of this Budget.  I think the Minister mentioned in the course of his Budget statement that the cost of subsidies&mdash; I am not sure whether it was the total cost or the cost in regard to flour only &mdash;was in the neighbourhood of £9,000,000.  At any rate, £2,000,000 of that sum represents the purchase of 750,000 tons of Argentine wheat two days before the Fianna Fáil Government went out of office at a cost per ton of something like £50.  I invite the Deputies of this House to think again, when they talk about economy and the different types of spending, of what that meant to the people of the country and to ask themselves once more could Deputy Lemass not have waited for two days to enable the decision to be taken by the incoming Government rather than by the outgoing Government.  I think that the <Col N="739" /> bald facts of the case are well known to the Deputies, that against the advice of everyone from whom he sought advice the ex-Minister for Industry and Commerce made that purchase, made it at a time when he knew that he was going out of office in two days' time.  Everyone else knew.</P>

      <P>It may have been touched upon on last year's Budget.  I merely want to make a confession between, as I said earlier, the mentality guiding the Government now and the mentality which guided the Fianna Fáil Government.  The best that can be said about that purchase is that it was an absolute waste and a most extravagant purchase and that the person responsible for making it was advised not to.  The worst that can be said about it I will not say but leave it to the imagination of the Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bartley seemed to be worried about the question of social services and social security schemes.  I think this Government has already given a very good earnest of what it proposes to do in that direction.  It is a fact, and a fact which Deputies opposite cannot escape from, that within a few years of their being turned out of office they refused a very moderate motion by the present Taoiseach and the present Minister for Defence asking them to make some modification in the means test as applicable to old age pensioners and other subsistence pensioners.  The estimated cost of that scheme which was recommended to them was in the neighbourhood of £500,000, and because it would <Col N="740" /> cost that amount of money Fianna Fáil rejected it.  This Government in a little more than a year of office has gone a long way towards alleviating the position as far as subsistence pensioners are concerned.</P>
    <P>This Budget makes provision also for pensions for teachers and for increased pay for the Army and the Guards.  In fact, I think I can sum up the position by saying, generally speaking, that everyone in the country, every section of the people, with the exception of the Fianna Fáil Party members inside this House, have welcomed the Budget and are extremely pleased that the Budget is such a good one.  The reason for the Fianna Fáil disappointment is that they never believed the Minister could do it.  They implicitly believed the word of their leader when he told them that the inter-Party Government would not survive its first Budget. When it did survive its first Budget, the sky not having fallen, they decided at any rate that a Coalition Government could never survive its second Budget and their half-identified &ldquo;Dáil Reporter&rdquo; came out yesterday with a famous heading &ldquo;This Is Crisis Day For The Coalition.&rdquo;  Deputies opposite discovered that it was not crisis day and that instead of having a crisis the Minister had introduced a Budget which was accepted as a good Budget by all sections of the people.</P>
    <P>There is one criticism which I propose making in respect of the Budget and that is the Minister's decision to rectify the flaw in relation to stamp duties on property.  Deputies are aware, of course, that the increase in the stamp duty to 5 per cent. for Irish nationals and 25 per cent. for others was brought about by the Fianna Fáil Supplementary Budget of 1947 and that for some time after the Supplementary Budget proposals becoming operative it was assumed that the 5 per cent. applied to all transfers and conveyances of property and also applied to property transferred by way of lease. Recently that interpretation was questioned and the High Court and Supreme Court decided that a flaw did exist and that it would not apply to dispositions of property by way of leases.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="741" /> The Minister has decided that he is going to stop the gap that was opened there and, without giving it retrospective effect, to provide in the various financial resolutions&mdash;I think about midway down&mdash;that that position will not be allowed to exist any longer and that 5 per cent. must be paid all round. I want to say at this stage that I do not make any criticism at all of the Minister's decision to end evasions of the 25 per cent. stamp duty, but I believe the Supplementary Budget provisions, in so far as they were intended to break a situation which then existed where there was speculation in house property and a definite inflation of property prices, did their work and did it well.  They succeeded in the course of time in breaking the high prices which were demanded for houses and put an end to a great deal of speculation in house property.  The time has arrived now when the Minister &mdash;instead of merely stopping the gap which the Supreme Court decision breached in the Finance Act and making certain that 5 per cent. would be payable on leases&mdash;should have reconsidered this whole question, with a view to lessening the amount of stamp duty payable on all transfers or dispositions of property.  The Minister has the machinery and the knowledge to enable him to decide whether this reimposition&mdash;I think we can term it a reimposition&mdash;may not defeat its ends, in so far as he wants now to collect money rather than break a situation which I believe has been broken already.  He might reconsider the position with a view to reducing the stamp duty, perhaps not down to 1 per cent., but to 2 or 3 per cent. and he might get better returns by doing that.  However, he has officials, machinery and knowledge which apparently have guided him in another direction.</P>
    <P>On page 8 of the Financial Resolutions, we find that Resolution No. 11, Section 8 provides:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where stamp duty was, on the 4th day of May, 1949, or a day thereafter and before the passing of the Act giving effect to this Resolution, chargeable under paragraph (3) of the heading `Lease or Tack' in the <Col N="742" /> First Schedule to the Stamp Act, 1891, as amended....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>the higher rate of duty shall be paid. My reading of it&mdash;and Deputy Moran probably will agree with me&mdash;taking into account the references the Minister made to it in the course of his statement, is that between the date of the original High Court decision and the 4th of May, but exclusive of the 4th of May itself, it was possible to effect the sale of property by means of a lease, and if you did that and if it was either executed or stamped prior to the 4th of May, you were entitled to have it done at 1 per cent. If, however, it came on the 4th of May or any day afterwards, you would have to pay the 5 per cent..  This is a practical matter which affects a number of people who bought property in Dublin during the last day or two.</P>
    <P>A number of leases were stamped in the Stamping Office of Dublin Castle on Wednesday morning.  They were stamped before anyone knew of the Budget provision.  It appears to me from the reading of that section that the Revenue Commissioners may now recover an additional 4 per cent. duty from these people.  Certainly, if it were a case where a lease was executed on the morning of the 4th of May and stamped later that morning, even though it was before the Minister's Budget statement here, that seems to be the position, just taking the section there as it stands and without the Minister having dealt with that particular section in his statement.  It would seem to be unfair that a person executing and stamping a deed on the morning of the 4th of May should be in any different position from a person who executed and stamped a deed on the 2nd or 3rd of May.  He has no more knowledge of the Budget proposals on the morning of the 4th than he had on the afternoon of the 3rd.  I would strongly suggest to the Minister to deal with this question, when replying, in a way which will be favourable to the Dublin solicitors and their clients who went to the trouble of stamping their deeds before the Minister stood up here at 3.30 yesterday.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="Mr. Breslin Mr. Breslin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Breslin</NameTxt>
      <P>This Budget was described here this evening by a Fine <Col N="743" /> Gael Deputy as a useful and realistic one, while later on a Clann na Poblachta spokesman said it was an &ldquo;as you were&rdquo; Budget.  So far as the Gaeltacht and the congested areas are concerned, this Budget is neither one nor the other.  The people of the Gaeltacht have been looking forward to an alleviation of their present position; they have had a ray of hope that, at long last, the Coalition Government was about to do something for them; but they will be sadly and sorely disappointed. It is amazing that, during his Budget speech yesterday, the Minister for Finance did not mention, even once, in passing, the twin evils of emigration and unemployment.  These are the two evils that starkly confront the people of the congested areas to-day as never before.  It is plain that, so far as the Coalition Government is concerned, nothing is being done and nothing will be done in this respect.</P>
      <P>In my opinion, the Gaeltacht deserves more from any native Government. After 25 years of native Government, it is a very poor thing for a father or mother in the Gaeltacht to think that he or she is bringing up children for export.  We have that one export increasing day by day in the Gaeltacht and congested areas.  In Donegal especially, along with having the greatest figures of unemployment, we have had, and are having, the biggest exodus of emigrants in the history of that county.  The Gaeltacht deserves more from the nation.  It is an area where the people have gone through terrible times and where, in spite of landlordism and the battering-ram, they have held on to their small uneconomic holdings in that congested part of Ireland and also have preserved the national language in all its purity. Nothing definite has been promised to them and, apparently, emigration and unemployment are to continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As some of the Gaeltacht Deputies pointed out to the Minister for Lands in the debate on the Land Commission Vote, the economy axe so far as the Gaeltacht is concerned should be dispensed with and money should be provided to help the people of those areas to have a better life and to keep as many of them at home as possible.  Our <Col N="744" /> native industries have been collapsing, as Deputies opposite who have mentioned the homespun industry know. That was an industry in Donegal which kept hundreds and hundreds of our people at home and in work year after year.  That industry is collapsing and the Government are doing nothing to help it out of its present difficulty.</P>
    <P>Then we had the turf industry in Donegal which employed thousands of men.  To-day we are in the unhappy position of exporting our men and importing British coal into the Gaeltacht areas.  If you travel around the different little harbours in the turf area of the Gaeltacht to-day you will see English ships unloading English coal. If one goes to the Port of Derry, he will find hundreds and hundreds of men and women going across to England and Scotland to find employment which should be provided for them at home. This is not a good Budget so far as the Gaeltacht is concerned.  It certainly gives no encouragement to the people of those areas.  The fact that income-tax is reduced by 6d. or that the glass of wine is made cheaper does not bring any consolation to the father of a family in the congested areas.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the great increase given by the Coalition Government to the old age pensioners&mdash;an increase of 2/6d.  So far as my area is concerned, they gave 2/6d. to the old age pensioners and, at the same time, one or two or perhaps three men in a family were thrown out of work as a result of the cessation of the turf industry and the cutting down of the road grants in the county.  It is very easy to give one or two old age pensioners in the townland a few half-crowns if, at the same time, you take away pounds upon pounds that had been paid out in wages to the young men of the area in the last three or four years.  As I said, we are exporting the young men and exporting our money to buy coal instead of keeping these young men employed at home.</P>
    <P>This Budget provides a subsidy on Empire-grown tobacco.  I suggest to the Minister that he should carefully consider the question of a subsidy on Gaeltacht products, on turf produced in the Gaeltacht, and on many other <Col N="745" /> things which would help to make life in the Gaeltacht easier, help to keep our people at home, and help to build up a healthy Gaeltacht.  Everybody will welcome the increase given to the ex-national teachers, but they are a very small percentage of the population. The Minister should have given some indication of what he was doing for the areas for which I have been speaking.  The Minister also mentioned that it was necessary to secure a substantial increase in exports.  Unfortunately, in the Gaeltacht we are giving him that substantial increase in an export which we would not like to see continued.  If the export of young men and women from the Gaeltacht continues at the rate at which it has gone on for the last 12 months, the Gaeltacht and all that it stands for, will shortly come to an end.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to Deputy Cowan to-night, one would not need to be told he was a lawyer.  He exemplified the old legal adage&mdash;when you have a bad case abuse your opponent. He spent five-sixths of his speech abusing Deputies on these benches. He told us several times about our blatant dishonesty and said we were antediluvian.  Apparently he is trying to preach a new creed in politics&mdash;that one is antediluvian if he does not change his coat and his opinions every other year.  The Deputy's coat is of such a kaleidoscopic hue now that nobody knows where he stands.  In my area during the general election he spoke of plans for the stoppage of emigration, for full employment, for a reduction in the cost of living of 30 per cent., and declared that the housing problem was not being dealt with. To-day he is quite satisfied with the progress made, although nothing whatever has been done about those matters.  He told us that we had to bring about the stabilisation necessary before spreading out.  But he forgot that part of the Minister for Finance's statement yesterday where he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is very obvious that no really big saving can be secured unless a limit is set to demands for the expansion of existing and the creation of new services.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="746" /> How are we going to spread out if the Minister wants to continue his saving programme?  How are we going to get anything done?  Listening to Deputy Cowan to-night, one must think how hypocritical he was in attempting to charge with dishonesty those of us who did not claim that any of these things could be done.  He is quite satisfied when the position is worsening every hour.</P>
    <P>This Budget is remarkable more for its omissions than for what it contains. To anybody with the real interest of the country at heart the big questions at the moment are unemployment and emigration and, after them, the cost of living.  We heard all about them from those who are now on the Government Benches some years ago when there was the war aftermath and a shortage of materials which we have not to-day. We know that the election was mainly fought by certain Parties on the questions of emigration and unemployment. We had the words &ldquo;full employment&rdquo; dinned into our ears, in Dublin at any rate, every minute of the day and from every angle.  To-day, to mention full employment to any Government supporter appears to raise up such ghosts that he runs away from you.  The last thing, apparently, the Government want to do is to foster employment, much less full employment.  We made an honest effort to deal with it and we know it is not by any means an easy task.  Consequently we never said that to get full employment was an easy task but the Government does not seem even to try and keep the position as it was.  The Minister for Finance thinks so little of it that he has not even mentioned those questions in his Budget statement.  He holds out no hope in the coming year that anything is going to be done about it.  Every Deputy in this House knows that unemployment is worse than it ever was. They know that people are flying from the country.  We have had examples given here to-night by some of the Deputies of whole families going.  It is a most grievous question.</P>
    <P>We have had references from the other side of the House to-night to the Act that was passed by the Minister for Social Services during the year <Col N="747" /> increasing old age pensions.  If he finances that in the same way in order to bring about what we were told at the election were the standards that should be set in these things, he will have another increase in the cost of living and he will have so few left that he will never be able to finance it properly. The workers of Dublin know who is paying for that.  They know that they are getting no increased benefits for paying an extra premium.  To the people of Dublin at any rate, that talk of what was done in the matter of social services does not appeal.  We have no word in this Budget about the social services plan.  Deputy Cowan tried to tell us, also, how that could not be done in a week or a month.  We all know that but we all know, too, that the present Tánaiste would not accept that kind of statement when he was in opposition.  He did not see why there should be any delay about it.  We know for a fact that when he went into office 15 months ago he had all the data prepared for him and it was only a question of taking his decisions.  Yet he has not even been able to produce the White Paper that he so often promised, and neither is there any word in the Budget about it so that nothing practical is going to be done this year, if ever.</P>
    <P>We had a few references here to-night to the statement that the Coalition Government would never survive is first Budget.  Neither could it have survived its first Budget if they had done what they preached to the people, but they went back on all the tenets on which they were first elected. That is a very important point, particularly at the present time, from the democratic point of view.  I am not going to forget that it could never have survived its first Budget.  We did believe then that our opponents meant what they said in their promises to the people.  We and the people know to-day whether they did or not.  If they had kept their promises the first Budget would never have seen the light of day.  If they are satisfied with that position I have nothing to say to them.  It is something for themselves and something that the people will let <Col N="748" /> them know about when they get the opportunity.</P>
    <P>We were told the cost of living was going to be brought down.  We were accused of having let it soar although it had been stabilised from 1943.  This Government has not even succeeded in doing that.  In this present Budget we are having to provide an extra £1,000,000 for civil servants as a result of the rise in the cost of living last year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HarryColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to the question of stamp duty.  I agree with Deputy O'Higgins, who has just spoken, to a very large extent.  The stamp duty was put on in a time of inflation in the price of houses and in a time of jobbery in houses, with the intention of stopping that artificial increase.  It succeeded perhaps too well.  It has practically stopped the sale of houses.  Country Deputies may not know that, in Dublin at any rate, not one person in a thousand who buys a house has the money to put down for it.  They can only make a deposit and borrow the rest of it for which they are paying throughout their life. This means for the average young middle class man, who is the type that buys a house, another £100 cash to be found before he can think of buying. In these terrible times that these young people are facing, both in the increased price and in the difficulty of getting a house at all, it is not fair that they should be further faced with an infliction of finding £100 or, in the case of people about to be married, of waiting that much longer before they can go about the purchase of a house. Anyone who knows Dublin conditions knows how hard it is to put up a deposit at all.  I think this stamp duty has served its purpose and that it should go back to the stage it was at, at 1 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="749" /> I disagree with Deputy O'Higgins about the 2 per cent. or the 3 per cent. The increase in the stamp duty in 1947 was plainly an effort to try and deal with an inflationary situation so far as the purchase of houses was concerned, and it served its purpose.  In my opinion the old charge of 1 per cent. should be restored, and the present charge should not be stabilised as the Minister is doing under the Budget.  I think that my suggestion should be acted on by the Minister since a way has been found, legally, by court proceedings in favour of the old duty. Therefore, I do not think the Minister should stabilise the 5 per cent. duty.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy O'Higgins as far as the 25 per cent. on non-nationals is concerned.  In my opinion, it is outrageous that we should continue the 5 per cent. duty and put such a tremendous tax on our own people, particularly on those who want houses to live in.  The Minister said that he was concerned about unemployment in the wine trade, and that there would be further unemployment if he did not take off some part of the existing duty on wine.  I know for a fact that in the auctioneering and land agency business in Dublin men are being, and have been, thrown out of work, due to the infliction of this stamp duty and the position that it has created.  I would appeal that something should be done about that. I want to ask if the reimposition of the tax on dances is going to apply to ceilidhthe.  The position is not clear from the Minister's statement, and I would like to have an answer to that question.</P>
    <P>I do not think that this Budget is at all popular.  So far as Dublin is concerned, it has not created any great enthusiasm.  It would be hard to think that it would when we consider that this Government got into office on the plea that they were going to reduce the enormous expenditure and cut out the extravagance of Fianna Fáil.  Yet, after being 16 months in office they are budgeting for £8,000,000 more than we asked for in our last Budget.  I do not think that, even amongst Government supporters, there can be any great enthusiasm for it.  The 6d. in the <Col N="750" /> income-tax that was put on last year is being taken off this year because there has been an increase in revenue over the year of something like £6,000,000 over and above what was budgeted for.  A windfall of something like £5,000,000 has come to the Minister by reason of a reduction in the subsidies that used to be provided for flour and fuel.  Yet all that the Minister is giving by way of a reduction is £433,500. I do not think there is anything to boast about in that, or that we can say we are getting a good deal from men who told us they could do so much.  I am satisfied that what I am saying represents the way that the ordinary man is thinking.</P>
    <P>I hope that, for the sake of the country, with things improving as they are, whatever Government may be in power we will soon be able to do something better for the people.  In my opinion, nothing better is going to be done as long as we ignore the major problems that confront us or as long as nothing is done to increase production.

      <P>The speeches by the people in opposition on this Budget have surprised me because, under the Supplementary Budget that was introduced by the ex-Minister for Finance there was nothing for the old people, while we had increases in the prices of tobacco, cigarettes and the pictures. The Deputies over there did not raise their voices against those increases that were imposed.  The increases were taken off when the change of Government took place.  I think this Budget is not as bad as the Deputies opposite try to make out.  According to the papers, more people are getting employment.</P>

      <P>What about all the schemes that had to be stopped?  As other Deputies have explained, if the Government which was in charge of this country for 16 years had left it in a sound state, the Minister for Finance could have given, not this year but last year, better reliefs than he has given.  But what do we find?  We find that timber which cost thousands of pounds a week to bring to the Phoenix Park is now going back, some of it to my constituency, at £1 a ton.  That shows a waste of money there.  The turf cutting could not go on because there was no room for it in the Phoenix Park or in the dumps in the country. There is a scarcity at the moment of skilled workers, and, if skilled workers could be got, the unemployment list would be reduced.

      <P>I must be annoying these people.  I was an ordinary worker before I came into this House and I know what the workers have to suffer better than any Deputy on the other side of the House.  I know that, if I were Minister for Finance, I would be able to find more money&mdash;there is another way of getting it&mdash;because I would not pay men £500 a year pension for nothing.  I would take it from them.</P>
      <P>Deputy Byrne, on the adjournment of the Dáil recently, drew attention to the position with regard to Córas Iompair Éireann and asked the Minister to tell the country the facts with regard to it.  What happened? They talk about the Minister for Finance being niggardly, but he had to go to the Government and ask for £250,000 to pay the employees of Córas Iompair Éireann.  These are the things we know and I am sure that the ex-Ministers are well aware of them, too.</P>
      <P>They talk about unemployment. Why is it that there is unemployment in the rural areas to-day?  Because machinery is taking the place of men and all these people who are supposed to be badly off are buying tractor ploughs, replacing the labourers with machinery, and doing not only their own farms but those of their neighbours. I suppose that will go on, because that is progress.  There is a Bill at present before the House with which we would be dealing now were it not for the tragic death of the Minister who was in charge of it.  To that Bill, Deputy Moran has tabled a number of amendments, although the Bill has for its purpose the provision of employment in rural areas.</P>

      <P>The Deputy knows well enough why it did not come before the House, but he is afraid it will come, because it is the first time such a Bill, a Bill for the reclamation of land throughout rural Ireland, was introduced, to provide employment for men who have been temporarily disemployed by reason of the suspension of other schemes.  Deputies know that that is its purpose, but they will not admit it.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil Deputies are now crying about the old age pensioners, but, as Deputy O'Higgins said, when a Bill was introduced during the term of office of Fianna Fáil as a Government to improve their position, they voted against it, on the ground that the country could not afford it, and they threw the burden of providing an extra 2/6 on the ratepayers.  They told the people that the old age pensioners could never get 17/6 per week.  The people who run small shows in rural Ireland and the people who attend them will have no objection to this Budget.  Deputy McCann last year appealed for the remission of the tax in this regard.  Are you dissatisfied now because it has been taken off?</P>

      <P>I cannot see what Deputies have to grouse about.  There is nothing wrong with the Budget. Indeed, there is relief in it&mdash;that is one thing that must be admitted. There is nothing put up against foodstuffs; there is no increase in that respect and, therefore, the country will welcome a Budget like that.  When I hear Deputies opposite asking why the Coalition Government are not doing this and that I would like them not to forget that they were 16 years sitting on the Government Benches and they never spoke up on behalf of the people; they were only yes-men.  On the Opposition Benches I can see ex-Ministers and teachers.  There was a time when we were on that side of the House and there was an appeal made to those teachers to do something for <Col N="755" /> their colleagues.  They will not find anything wrong with this Budget.  The Gardaí will also get something.</P>

      <P>He will get his chance to speak; we will give him plenty of time and he can say what he likes. He can contradict anything I say if he is able to do so.  The teachers&mdash; and there is a number of them in the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;know they are being well treated by this Government. They know how they were treated by Fianna Fáil.  We saw the youngsters of Dublin running around the streets of the city during the seven-months' strike and Fianna Fáil Deputies were largely responsible for keeping them there.  I am not ashamed to be a supporter of the Coalition Government. I went a long way to put Fianna Fáil over there and I am not sorry for it. I did whatever I could for the old age pensioners.  I was put out of the House by Deputy MacEntee, when he was a Minister, for doing what I could for the poor.</P>
      <P>The ten-point programme has been referred to.  It is being put into operation. We have increased old age pensions and we have modified the means test.  We have given something to the widows and orphans and the blind. Those promises have been fulfilled and we will make further concessions before this Government's time is up.  That is why the Opposition are getting so worried.  They realise we are all united on this side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A statement appeared recently in the papers from the ex-Taoiseach.  He wondered how the Coalition could agree on a Budget.  We have agreed on two Budgets and that is what hits Fianna Fáil.  An honest effort is being <Col N="756" /> made to do something for downtrodden people.  Some Deputies opposite are talking about the stopping of industries.

      <P>We hear a lot about the wild geese, but the only wild geese I ever saw were in <i>Dublin Opinion</i>&mdash; Deputy de Valera and Deputy Aiken with their arms stretched out going across the Atlantic Ocean.  So far as I am concerned, I have no growl to make about the Budget.  We know the conditions in the country at the moment.  If it were not for all the muddling in years gone by, we could relieve motor taxation.  We are doing what we can and we are satisfied that the Minister is making an honest effort.  Deputy Allen talked about wines.  He need not worry about them because he does not drink them at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost of living has been mentioned by Fianna Fáil Deputies.  They must agree that there are better prices for agricultural produce, better prices for milk, beef and beet.  Who will pay for that?  Will the consumer?  Deputy Corry is always advocating a higher price for milk.  Who will pay that?  The people in the City of Dublin and in the country.  The highest increases in wages for five or six years were given under this Government.  I would like to hear fair and honest criticism.  I would not be afraid to criticise if I thought there was anything wrong.  There is every hope that next year's Budget will be <Col N="757" /> more fair to the country and greater relief will be given to the taxpayer. That is what everyone wants.  The small man has to pay as much in taxation as the big man.</P>
    <P>We all want to see taxation coming down.  I would like to see heavier taxes on luxuries.  There could be more money got from the owners of high-powered cars&mdash;the speeding cars that are killing people on the highways. In my own county we have a big burden, the Oulart Hotel at Courttown. That involved something like £22,000.  There were some five hotels taken over and the cost was thrown on the taxpayers and ratepayers and these people who purchased them put their friends in charge.  That was bad business.  I do not suppose we would get £5,000 for the one which cost us £22,000.  Who will suffer for all that? The taxpayer will, not Fianna Fáil. The turf scheme has been commented on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I am suggesting that a man should get an allowance for his wife.  He gets children's allowances and why should he not get an allowance in respect of his wife?  That could be done.  I do not mean that it should be given to every individual in the <Col N="758" /> State.  It should be given to every man who is working for a wage.  It would be only right that a man who has to face periods of unemployment, a man engaged only on seasonal work, should get an allowance in respect of his wife. It would be a great help to him, no doubt.</P>
      <P>A great many tears have been shed in regard to unemployment.  No one regrets unemployment as much as I do.  I come from the unemployed.  I know what it is to sign on for the dole.  I know what it is to draw national health insurance.  There is no one who regrets the fact that we have to have employment exchanges as much as I, as a worker, regret it.  It is the duty of any Government, it was the duty of the last Government, to provide employment for every man who is willing and able to work.  That problem should be tackled.  There should be no opposition when it is being tackled and when schemes are introduced to help to solve that problem there should be general agreement by all Parties, instead of amendments being put down and obstacles being put in the way.  We should go ahead and consider how we can provide employment for all men who are fit and able to work.  Of course, there are men who will never work because they are disabled and unfit.  These men are struggling to live on national health insurance.  I would like to see national health insurance increased in the next Budget, if possible.  People are trying to live on 22/6 and 15/- a week.  Reference has been made to the cost of living.  We know that the cost of living is high for people who have no means but it is the people who have means who are grousing about it.  What about the people who have no means, who are living on small pensions, disabled men from the armies and navies, men disabled through their employment? Go down through rural Ireland or through the slums of Dublin and see what is the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the duty of any Government to see that there is no unemployment. We provided £7,000,000 for the Army during the emergency.  If there were an emergency to-morrow, more millions would be got.  Why not get it for employment? There is plenty of work to <Col N="759" /> be done in rural Ireland.  There is a great housing drive.  The only thing that is lacking is skilled labour.  If skilled labour could be encouraged to return, more money would be spent on employment.  Every encouragement should be given out through the radio and the Press to skilled men to return to this country.  They should be told that there is employment here in abundance for carpenters, masons and plasterers, and that there will be for the next ten to 20 years.  That would encourage trained, skilled men, who left this country during the emergency years, to return.  I would ask the Ministers of this Government, who are honest and sincere, to appeal to our fellow-Irishmen across the sea to return and to build up their own country and to build houses for the people. That would be work of the greatest national importance.  Now is the time. Deputy Cowan referred to the fact that supplies are more plentiful now.  That is agreed but the men to work the supplies are missing.  Deputies from the Gaeltacht spoke of unemployment in that area.  There is unemployment in all areas.  Some Deputies referred to glass-houses.  Some Deputies referred to the reduction made in the provision for glass-houses.  There is not a great deal of employment in the tomato industry here.  Deputy Burke spoke at some length about tomato-growing in County Dublin.  The numbers employed in that industry are very small. I would prefer to see able-bodied men employed in the building drive.  Very often I see reports in the Press of the shortage of labour in certain areas.</P>
    <P>I have heard Deputies speak about the shortage of labour.  I have heard Deputies speak about emigration and the flight from the land.  Emigration will go on to the end of time.  Why should a young girl be prevented from going to America, Canada or Australia?  The only people who are forced to emigrate are the men who cannot find employment at home. During the emergency we all of us had experience of visiting Upper Merrion Street, looking for permits for these men.  If they were agricultural labourers or turf workers permits were withheld from them.  These men would <Col N="760" /> not be allowed to leave the country under the Fianna Fáil régime.  It is hard to contain oneself when listening to the opposition speakers.  Deputy O'Higgins asked for honest criticism. We all want that.  Surely honour should be given where honour is due. Why try all the time to slander the present Government?  That only serves the purpose of providing big headlines for the <i>Irish Press</i> in the morning. The <i>Irish Press</i> propaganda is poisoning the people in the rural areas.  We all know the nonsense that is written by the &ldquo;Dáil Reporter&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>It is especially wrong because it is done by an ex-Minister and a member of this House.  We on this side of the House are not disappointed with the Budget.  The people have got certain reliefs.  If the former Government had continued in office the country would have become as bankrupt as the bankrupt Córas Iompair Éireann.  In 1944 the former Government told the people it was going to give them a transport system second to none.  What do we find now?</P>

      <P>We would have a magnificent Budget now only for the millions that were squandered.  Up to yesterday afternoon the people were being told that taxation would go sky high and that this Budget would be the downfall of the Coalition Government. Fianna Fáil supporters were told: <Col N="762" />&ldquo;Wait until the Budget comes in; Mr. McGilligan will put them all out.&rdquo; That is what they were hoping for but they are somewhat dismayed now. That is why they are not in the House to-night.  There are only four representatives out of an opposition of 77&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There are only two ex-Ministers&mdash;the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and the Minister for Education&mdash;and two Deputies.  That shows the interest they take in the country and in the welfare of the people.  If it had been a bad Budget they would have been here cheering.  This Budget shook them.  The people understand the circumstances of the country now. Most of the promises made to them have been fulfilled in the 14 months this Government has been in office.</P>

      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Tuesday, 10th May, 1949.</P>
