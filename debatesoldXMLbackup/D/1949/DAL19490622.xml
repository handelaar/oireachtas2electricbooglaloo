      <P>asked the Minister for Education if a number of State scholarships in the faculties of arts, science and commerce and value for £150 per annum and tenable at University College, Galway, were awarded on the results of the leaving certificate examination for students qualified to take all lectures and sit for all examinations through the medium of the Irish language, and if he can state whether any scholarships have been awarded in pursuance of the above in the faculty of engineering, and involving a departure from the conditions published in respect thereof.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (General Mulcahy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under a scheme introduced in 1947, a number of scholarships, each <Col N="1060" /> of the value stated, are awarded annually on the results of the leaving certificate examination to enable students to pursue university courses through the medium of Irish.  As it is an essential condition of the scheme that a student, to whom a scholarship is awarded, must pursue his entire university course through Irish, the scholarships are, at present, tenable only in the faculties of arts, commerce and science of University College, Galway, as facilities for full courses through Irish are not available there in any of the other university faculties nor in any other of the colleges.  A scholarship was not, accordingly, awarded to any student for the purpose of following a course in engineering.</P>
      <P>At the end of 1947-48 academic year, however, it came to the notice of the Department that a student who held one of these scholarships in the faculty of science and who had completed a full year's course through Irish in that faculty had also passed the first university examination in engineering.  A reasonable explanation as to the circumstances in which the student had taken the examination in engineering having been received from the university authorities, together with an undertaking that the student in question would, for the further potential duration of the scholarship, devote himself exclusively to his course in science through Irish, it was decided to renew his scholarship.  I may add that, in connection with this matter, the university authorities undertook to ensure that in future scholarship holders under the scheme would be registered only in faculties in which full courses, leading to degree, are available through Irish.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if it is the intention of his Department to set up a text book committee in order to ensure that text books and readers suitable for city children will be available in the Irish language, and if he is aware that in the opinion of many city teachers one of their main difficulties in making Irish the spoken language of all pupils is due to the fact that an Irish <Col N="1061" /> vocabulary is acquired by pupils completely divorced from the background of their own environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department does not compile or prepare text books for the teaching of Irish or of any other subject in national schools.  Such books are made available by commercial firms and the usual procedure is to present a proposed book in manuscript or typescript for official approval before printing.  There is a special committee of experienced inspectors to which scripts so presented are submitted for judgment.  Books officially sanctioned are placed on a list which is available to managers and teachers, and from which they are free to choose the books they desire to have used in their schools.</P>
      <P>The aim in the selection of reading books in Irish has been to secure texts which are composite rather than specific as regards matter and which can be used with advantage both in rural and urban areas.  It would not be in accordance with the best educational practice to confine the vocabulary of the texts used merely to the activities and objects which might be expected to come within the pupils' day-to-day experience.  The function of the reading book is not alone to supply such a vocabulary, but to extend and enlarge it by the inclusion of lessons conveying information regarding places, objects and activities ranging beyond their ordinary experience and environment.</P>
      <P>I am, however, in deference to the Deputy's suggestion, prepared to have the matter investigated with a view to ascertaining whether there is a genuine need for any alteration in the present mode of procedure.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence whether he is aware that an old age pensioner who was also in receipt of an Army service pension had the latter pension stoped as a result of the increase in old age pensions under the Social Welfare Act, 1948, with the result that her yearly income of £50 <Col N="1063" /> was reduced by over £5; and, if so, whether, in view of the fact that actual loss is being incurred as a result of the 1948 Act, he will take action, whether by the introduction of proposals for legislation or otherwise, to have the Army service pension restored in this and similar cases.</P>

      <P>I have been informed that the doctor in question was appointed surgeon and agent to the British Admiralty in 1914, the dispensary doctor whom he succeeded in that year having previously held the appointment.  The doctor has carried out no functions in connection with the appointment since 1921.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to avoid any misunderstanding in regard to the terms agent it should perhaps be explained that this <Col N="1065" /> term referred to the functions which might fall on the doctor of making arrangements for the supply of medicines, accommodation, hospitalisation, etc. for British naval personnel who could not be treated aboard ship and who might have had to come ashore for medical treatment.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This Bill, in effect, contains all that is in it in Section 1.  There is an ancillary purpose which I will explain in a moment, but the prime purpose of the Bill is to replenish the fund out of which compensation is paid to farmers for cattle that are slaughtered <Col N="1068" /> if they are suspected by the county veterinary officer to be suffering from tuberculosis.  The Diseases of Animals Fund also is charged with certain other expenses relating to the prevention of scab and other animal diseases for which provision is made, although most of the charges in respect of veterinary schemes relating to prevention are met by funds provided by the Government. So that the major purpose of the General Cattle Diseases Fund which, I think, is the technical name of this fund, is to pay the farmer for the beast slaughtered because it is suspected of having tuberculosis.  This fund had its origin in an Act of Parliament as early as 1878, called Contagious Diseases (Animals) Act.</P>
      <P>Provision for its replenishment was made in further Acts which were passed in 1894, 1914 and 1932 and the procedure always adopted was to authorise the local authority to strike a rate in any given year not in excess of a ½d. in the £, and in the Act to prescribe an overriding maximum which imposed the necessity on my Department to return to Parliament, if, all the ½d.s that were permitted having been struck, it was necessary further to replenish the fund.  All the ½d.s permitted under the 1932 Act have now been raised by the local authorities and paid into the fund and it is necessary to make provision for a further period of about four years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill then will authorise local authorities to strike not more than a ½d. in the £ in any year for four years with an overriding maximum of 2d. The reason why the period for which provision is made in this Bill is shorter than it was in any of its predecessors is that we are in the process of reorganising the whole veterinary service.  All the veterinary services which used to be in the Department of Health have now been transferred to the Department of Agriculture.  The Department of Agriculture is charged with the responsibility of reorganising them in consultation with the Department of Local Government and the local authorities so as to provide a comprehensive scheme for the whole country which will deal with all these several services which are now dealt with <Col N="1069" /> under a multiplicity of schemes and Acts of Parliament many of which have become obsolete.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any obligation on me, but I think it right to inform the House that, in connection with the expenses that fall upon this fund for the slaughter of suspected cattle, I have instructed the officers of my Department to make it known to the veterinary officers of local authorities that we would find no fault with a veterinary officer who erred on the side of caution in this matter.  I want to make it clear what I mean by that&mdash; that if a veterinary officer has reasonable grounds for suspicion that an animal is suffering from tuberculosis he should seek to secure the farmer's consent and have the animal slaughtered.  If it transpires, as a result of a post-mortem, that the beast was not suffering from tuberculosis but from some other conditions, it is far better that a few such beasts should be inadvertently destroyed, provided the farmer is fairly compensated, than that reluctance to face that risk should leave a tubercular animal giving milk which might be consumed by children with the disastrous consequences that habitually follow.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the consequential drain on the fund will be dramatic. I think the House will probably approve of its being said in public that, with the approbation of everyone in the House, we do not wish economies to be effected by forbearing from the slaughter of an animal which was reasonably suspected of being tubercular, and that we would rather see the fund charged with payment for a beast that was slaughtered in error than that a tubercular beast should be allowed to contaminate the children that drank its milk because the veterinary surgeon was reluctant to take the risk of imposing on the fund a charge arising from the slaughter of what superficially appeared to be a thriving animal but which, to the expert eye, revealed reasonable evidence on which to found at least a doubt that, despite its external appearance, it was, in fact, very probably tubercular and so a danger to the children who consumed its milk.</P>
    <P>The second section, in effect, confers <Col N="1070" /> on the Minister for Agriculture the right to add to the description of birds which are covered by the generic term &ldquo;poultry&rdquo;.  That arises from the recent disastrous experience which overtook the fowl-keepers in Great Britain.  If my information is correct it became necessary, owing to the special food difficulties that exist in Great Britain, to accept delivery of a consignment of dead fowl from countries whence such consignments were not usually admitted to Great Britain and, most unhappily, that which was foreseen and which gave rise to the original prohibition of imports from those quarters transpired.  I avail of this occasion to tell the story so that Deputies may sympathise with the Department of Agriculture if, sometimes, some regulations we make restricting the imports of live stock or fowl appear to be at first glance capricious.  The fowl pest, which was introduced into Great Britain with this consignment of poultry, on the Continent manifested itself as a very acute condition, with the result that it was very easy to circumscribe it.  The moment its symptoms appear the most untutored eye could discern them and veterinary precautions taken to isolate the district and destroy the fowl so as to prevent its spread.</P>
    <P>The disease, as it has manifested itself in Great Britain, is a low chronic condition and the most discerning eye would have very grave difficulty in detecting it at an early stage.  The untutored eye very often does not discern its presence at all.  In turkeys, it has manifested itself in Great Britain with a trembling of the bird's head. As a result of the form in which it showed itself in Great Britain, its control presented problems infinitely greater than those which continental countries had to contend with.</P>
    <P>Deputies will, therefore, understand that, if we refuse to permit presents of bacon from the United States and Canada to be delivered to their consignees in Ireland, it is not just because we like to deprive people of a piece of transatlantic bacon, but it is because we have discovered that every time we let in bacon from transatlantic sources, the admission of that bacon <Col N="1071" /> has been followed by sporadic outbreaks of swine fever.  Deputies may not have noticed, because I suppose it is human nature not to observe blessings while we lament misfortunes, that whereas up to 1934 swine fever was epidemic in this country&mdash;there was not a week in which an outbreak had not to be brought under control&mdash; not a single case of swine fever has appeared in this country since, I think, 1934, with one exception, when one consignment of transatlantic bacon was admitted to this country about 1939 and within a fortnight we had an outbreak of swine fever.  It was brought under control.  No further imports from that source have been permitted, and not a single further outbreak has taken place.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we are asking in Section 2 not only for the expansion of the definition set out, but for the further power from time to time by Order to enlarge the definition lest it became urgently necessary to do so and not be under the necessity of returning to Dáil Éireann for statutory authority to do so, when we might be prevented from taking the necessary steps to prevent such a catastrophe as that which, unfortunately, overtook the British in this particular matter.  It will cause them great inconvenience, but no doubt they will overcome that as they have overcome many other things.  In seeking these powers we protect not only ourselves, but we would hope to continue in the future as in the past to collaborate with the British Ministry of Agriculture in mutual protection because, as Deputies no doubt know and will be glad to know, constant consultation takes place between us and we find ourselves not infrequently indebted to their good offices, and we would like to think that they not infrequently find themselves indebted to ours.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Some information on two or three matters concerning the work being achieved under this legislation would be of value to the House.  Is the Minister in a position to let us know the number of animals slaughtered inside the past 12 months, or the number slaughtered over a period of <Col N="1072" /> years?  What would be the average price paid by way of compensation to farmers who own those animals?  What is the total amount expended in that way?</P>
      <P>I do not think, when the Minister talks of the injustice that would be done to the community by being, if it is the right term, over-sensitive about taking steps to destroy an animal suspected of suffering from one of the dangerous diseases, that these Acts can be taken in a serious way as serious machinery for the prevention of the spread of tuberculosis or some of the other dangerous diseases.</P>
      <P>The Minister has mentioned the intention of the Department to reorganise the veterinary services. That is a subject on which I would like more information.  When I was in the Department a decision was arrived at to bring all the veterinary services under the control of the Department of Agriculture.  The plans we had in mind are the plans we are now told of in the same sort of way that I would have spoken of them two years ago.  I admit that a year or two does not mean much to those who have to handle these problems, but, at the same time, some two years have elapsed and we are still in the position that apparently we do not know what is meant by the reorganisation of the veterinary services. We do not know to what extent progress has been made in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are points which would be of greater benefit to the House than the explanations given by the Minister. This legislation is all right, but in my own limited way I must confess I have not seen such results from it that one could describe as encouraging or hopeful. The number of cases in which reports are made by owners of live stock to the authorities of their suspicion that certain animals are suffering from contagious disease is very limited.  Of course, that would be influenced largely by the amount of money likely to be paid to the owner. No man will report when he suspects his cow or cows or some other animal is suffering from one of these diseases if he thinks the amount of compensation will be small.  Probably he might say: &ldquo;It is not worth my while making a <Col N="1073" /> report for the protection of the community; I will take a chance and the animal might live.  Therefore, I will exercise discretion.&rdquo;  It is because of that sort of approach on the part of owners that we do not find good results flowing from this.</P>
    <P>The reorganisation of the veterinary services is a very vital thing, but, even if you have that reorganisation to-morrow, I do not think you would expect it to devise some means of detecting cases where animals are suffering from tuberculosis and are likely to spread the disease among human beings.  Some other method would have to be employed. The most important is the amount you are prepared to pay to a farmer who would notify his suspicion to a veterinary officer that his stock was suffering from disease and in so notifying them he would know he was likely to get worthwhile compensation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlfredPByrne" hpid="Mr. A.P. Byrne Mr. A.P. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A.P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>It must be eight or ten years ago since it was represented to me that the amount payable for the slaughter of diseased animals was anything but adequate.  That was largely the reason why, as Deputy Smith pointed out, the number of animals slaughtered is not what it should be.  I do not know what is the basis of compensation.  Perhaps the Minister will inform the House how they compute it and the House would like an assurance that the rates of compensation will be of such a nature that farmers will be quite ready to allow their animals to be slaughtered, if that course is considered necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOGrady" hpid="Mr. O'Grady Mr. O'Grady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder is the Minister in a position to inform us what is the incidence of tuberculosis among our cattle herds?  It may be difficult to get that information, but if the Minister looks up the Departmental files regarding the numbers of cattle that were sent to the Continent for slaughter some years ago he will get accurate returns there which will give it to him. What was the number of cattle slaughtered each year under these Acts and what was the amount of compensation paid?  If my memory serves me rightly, I think it was 25 per cent. of the value of the animal.  That used to be the position many years ago when <Col N="1074" /> I was a member of the committee&mdash; 25 per cent. of the value of the animal &mdash;but perhaps later legislation has increased that.  It is, of course, a deterrent which prevents the ordinary farmer from reporting a suspected case if he finds that the compensation paid to him is inadequate.  On the other hand, if the compensation were to be increased to any large amount, there would be a danger of a racket starting. That has occurred in the past.  I do not want to go back over it now, but I have knowledge of where that happened in days gone by.</P>

      <P>I know where it did happen and drastic steps had to be taken by the local committee of agriculture to wipe it out immediately and a number of people who were concerned in it were dismissed.  There is one other matter to which I would like to refer.  Presupposing an error of judgment on the part of a veterinary surgeon, the subsequent slaughter of a particular animal and it is then found that the animal has not tuberculosis, or any other contagious disease, I think a special case could be made for compensation in such circumstances. After all, if a farmer reports an animal which he suspects is suffering from tuberculosis and it is found subsequently that the veterinary surgeon is wrong in his diagnosis, I think that the farmer should be entitled to full compensation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in his opening remarks informed the House that he had advised veterinary officers to be more liberal in their interpretation than they were in the past.  That is desirable, but unfortunately it may not work out on a uniform basis as between <Col N="1075" /> veterinary officer and veterinary officer. Each will interpret it in his own way. The Minister will find that.  There was urgent need of more liberty to veterinary officers.  In the past there was no compensation if there was no tuberculosis. Is that not so?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it was to a great extent.  I understood that up to a specific time that was so.  There was little or no compensation if there was no tuberculosis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so.  Perhaps I could assist Deputies in this matter. If the beast is suffering from emaciation the farmer is entitled to 25 per cent. of its market value if it is slaughtered.  If the beast shows no exterior sign by way of emaciation the farmer is entitled to 75 per cent. of its market value.  If the beast is mistakenly slaughtered and found on post-mortem not to be suffering from tuberculosis the farmer is entitled to 100 per cent. of its market value, plus £1.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole thing is a problem, no matter what way one faces it.  I can see abuse of any liberty that is given and I can see damage done by a too rigid adherence to regulations. Under all the circumstances, it is a difficult scheme to operate in the way one would wish to operate it.  There is no doubt about that.  I wonder has veterinary science reached a stage where X-ray could be availed of where animal diseases are concerned. I take it they have reached that stage in some countries.  It should not be necessary to slaughter an animal in this enlightened age in order to determine whether it is or is not tubercular. I put it to the Minister that he might set his veterinary department working in that direction.</P>
      <P>With regard to poultry diseases, the Minister has told us that a very serious disease has become prevalent in England. I think it has been found that where there is intensive production of poultry there is added danger, or grave danger&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Every single sentence I utter that the Minister does not like, he objects.  He is chawing the fat from morning to night like the small, petulant child that he is.  His golden silence would be an advantage in the Dáil very often.  It is no harm to make inquiries. <Col N="1077" /> I merely inquire.  Go in to any fair in County Wexford and the farmers will tell you of their losses through pig diseases.  That is true of other counties as well.  The Press carried it very fully.  The more people know about the danger and the steps they should take to prevent it from spreading the better it will be.  Whatever knowledge the Minister and his Department have should be disseminated.  There is no use in cloaking it.  It is better that the farmers who breed pigs should know what they should do.  It is a well-known fact that many of them cover it up.  They never report it.  Because the disease is kept hidden it spreads much more rapidly.</P>
      <P>I do not see anything in this Bill to which we can object, but I do hope the Minister will provide, as he told us he would in his Estimate, increased veterinary services in the very near future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I did.  If I did, I regret it.  Possibly Deputy Allen did not realise the implication that might be drawn from his words.  It could easily be read in the country that Deputy Allen, who is a member of a county committee of agriculture, expressed the opinion that the multiplication of the number of fowl in the county was in itself calculated to provoke the appearance of new diseases, such as Newcastle disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say any such thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>And that, therefore, country women should be circumspect not unduly to increase their flocks.  Of course, there is not a scintilla of ground for any such apprehension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Diseases like Newcastle disease or Fowl Pest, as it is called, are carried by specific infection.  The source of its arrival in Great Britain was definitely and explicitly traced to a consignment of turkeys which came from Hungary. There was never any mystery of how it came to Great Britain and it never <Col N="1078" /> would have come, had not this infected material entered the country.  The reason why we have been so providentially saved from these kinds of infections is that Great Britain, being an island and this country being an island, we have collaborated since the days when hydrophobia was brought under control, to operate general regulations to prevent the possibility of infection at our ports.  We want to prevent any infection arriving in our country from a foreign country and they want to prevent any infection arriving from such countries in their country.  Nothing but the stress of difficulty would have permitted the admission of this infected material but it had nothing to do with the multiplication of the number of birds affected.  It was just a misfortune that infected material from an infected source had to be admitted which, in the ordinary course, would never have been admitted.</P>
    <P>I think if Deputy Allen had reflected it would have occurred to him that for him to say at this stage that there was a mysterious pig disease raging in the country, would be calculated to alarm persons who contemplated keeping pigs, would deter them from doing so and would create the impression that there was some mystery about it.  I think if the Deputy had reflected for a moment he would have remembered that, when the Estimate for the Department was before the House, I told the House that ædema disease in pigs had manifested itself here.</P>
    <P>The Leader of the Opposition was sitting in his place when I said that to those who were interested in foreign politics, it is significant that it appears to have had its origin in Teschen, the area of Czechoslovakia that Poland sought to annex at the time of Munich or the opening of the war.  It is not clear that the ædema disease which we had in pigs is identical with Teschen disease.  Teschen disease, which was first discovered about 1930, spread to every country in Europe except, strangely enough, Denmark.  It was first detected here in Antrim and County Down.  It appears to have crossed the border into Donegal.  Then it manifested itself in Cavan and Monaghan, and then travelled down <Col N="1079" /> the west coast to Cork.  Frankly, 12 months ago, it was a source of grave anxiety to me, so grave an anxiety that I permitted the suspension of all other research activities at the veterinary research station at Thorndale, Dublin.  The entire resources of that station were turned to the problem of isolating the organism responsible for this condition and determining its nature.</P>
    <P>I believe our research station is the first research station in the world to establish that it is communicable.  It was by no means clear that that condition was not an allergy which was inherited.  It is established very probably now that it is a communicable disease but, fortunately, as our research work proceeded, we were relieved to learn the disease had lost its virulent character.  This time last year when it appeared in any sty of pigs, out of the pigs attacked 80 to 90 per cent. of the pigs would die.  It is not infrequently the case that where a new imported condition appears amongst live stock, at first it assumes a very virulent character because it is new, but then it turns milder and, though it occurs here and there, it is not as lethal as when it first appeared. That is apparently the trend which this disease has followed.  Nevertheless, lest it might recrudesce in a serious form, the research project has been promoted, will continue to be financed and is in correspondence with Washington, Norway, Great Britain and, I think, an institute in Paris. The work of all is being co-ordinated to determine what is the nature of the condition and what steps should be taken to control it.</P>
    <P>It is now thought to be due to a virus.  I venture the belief myself that it will transpire ultimately to have at least an allergy element in it, but it is satisfactory to know that the disease can now be discounted as one of minor significance, no longer lethal in its effect and, apparently while it may delay by a month or three weeks the finish of a pig which is fattening, it is the exception to lose a pig or to have it so reduced in condition as to make it incapable of being finished.  On that <Col N="1080" /> score I am happy to reassure the Deputy that there is no need for apprehension whatever.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Grady's inquiry about the incidence of tuberculosis amongst our herds is not so easy.  I think, of accurate estimation as he would appear to think, because I seem to recall that the quality of cattle used for canning were very largely cattle&mdash;that is, during the war years&mdash;of the cow quality.  It was frequently a dried-off cow that came to be known as a canner's cow. In such a class of cattle it was natural to expect that we would find an unduly high proportion of tubercular animals, because we insisted that although the quality of beef going into the cans might not be as high as prime beef, the veterinary inspection enforced in the canneries, should be every bit as strict as the veterinary inspection enforced in the abattoir or in the slaughter or preparation of meat for consumption by our own people.  Any beast showing a trace of disease, even though we believed that could be suppressed by the cooking process which canning involves, was rejected.  The quality of the cattle going into the canneries was notoriously second-grade, but the veterinary test was as strict as anything that was operated when prime cattle were being handled.  It was because of that that is transpired that the incidence of tuberculosis amongst these cattle was high, but I do not accept it as a criterion of the existence of tuberculosis in our cattle generally.</P>
    <P>Our second method of inquiry is based on the tuberculin test.  If we were to assume that all the reactors to the tuberculin test are to be deemed tubercular, the annual figures would be very alarming indeed.  But there is no sound basis for any such conclusion, because it has been repeatedly demonstrated that cattle which have been found to react and have, therefore, been withdrawn from a milking herd and slaughtered for veterinary examination revealed no trace of tuberculosis in any accessible organ despite the most careful search of the lymphatic system.  It is now pretty generally admitted that the tuberculin test is one of such delicacy that if <Col N="1081" /> there is a tubercular focus so small as to give rise to no reasonable apprehension of clinical disease, none the less the beast will react.</P>
    <P>It is common knowledge, I think, to most Deputies that few, if any, individuals in this House have not had at some time a tubercular lesion in some parts of their body.  Ninety-nine per cent. of persons who had that experience never contract tuberculosis. So I believe it to be in the case of cattle&mdash;that although the vast majority of cattle at one time or another have some tubercular lesion, however microscopic, 99 per cent. never develop the disease.  If, however, they are submitted to the tuberculin test, so long as that lesion is there they will react. A scrupulous dairyman will exclude from his dairy herd any reacting beast, but it is no reflection on his probity if he directs that beast to the abattoir for slaughter, because the meat of such a beast, having been submitted to veterinary inspection, may be perfectly healthy and fit for human consumption.</P>
    <P>The cattle scheme operating under the Cattle Diseases of Animals Acts is the real practical step that is at present being taken, and will continue to be taken, for the suppression of tuberculosis in cattle.  If a beast is suspected to be suffering from tuberculosis, the farmer should invariably notify the county veterinary surgeon. If the county veterinary surgeon examines the beast and mistakenly believes it is in the early stages of tuberculosis and slaughters the beast, the farmer is entitled to get from the local authority the same price as he would have got, in the judgment of a fair assessor, if he had brought the beast out to a fair and sold it and, in addition, £1 over and above.  Now what I have said to the county vets, is this: &ldquo;Do not be in the least apprehensive if, in the course of the next 12 months, a local authority complains to me that the county vet, operating under them has slaughtered seven cattle and that in every case they have had to pay 100 per cent. of the value of the beast, plus £1, that I think any less of the vet. so reported.  If he has done it in good faith, in special solicitude to ensure <Col N="1082" /> that no child will get tubercular milk, so far as I am concerned I will congratulate the vet. as being an invaluable public servant.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Although I am grateful to Deputy O'Grady for directing my attention to some occurrences which have taken place in the past, I am at a loss to see how that could give rise to any abuse.  Farmers have an instinctive reluctance to proclaim to neighbours that there is disease in their byre.  If they overcome that reluctance, what advantage will they get by having the beast slaughtered?  They will have to bury it.  Is it not much easier to take it out and sell it at a fair?  How then can there be any conspiracy or collaboration which would be fostered by allowing the vet. to pay the full value for the beast that was mistakenly diagnosed? Of course we have got to assume that the local authority will retain the services of a veterinary surgeon worthy of the profession to which he belongs. I can proceed on no other basis than that a person who is a veterinary surgeon and is recognised as such by his colleagues in the profession would not be a gangster.  I have no reason to believe that there is any history anywhere in the country of the veterinary profession falling below the standards which one would ordinarily expect of such a profession.  I want the veterinary surgeons, if they conscientiously suspect tuberculosis, to use their beast persuasive powers to get the consent of the farmer for the slaughter of the beast.  If it transpires that they made a mistake, they need not be one bit apprehensive that there will be any complaint against them.  On the contrary, such vigilance and solicitude for the prevention of tuberculosis commends them to me and they may blame their error upon me if blame can be attributed to them.</P>
    <P>If there is an extreme case where a cow is emaciated and is coughing, and if the farmer sends it to the vet. he will get 25 per cent. of the value.  If a farmer allows a beast to stand in his byre which is emaciated and coughing with tuberculosis, even if he is so reckless a fool in his own material interests, in the interests of his children's health and in the interests of his <Col N="1083" /> neighbours that he is deserving of nothing but censure, nevertheless, the approach to this question is not the approach of a court of morals.  It is one to get tuberculosis eliminated, and even the man who acts with the utter irresponsibility which such conduct would suggest as to allow a beast to reach such a state of emaciation and coughing will get 25 per cent. of the value if he sends for the veterinary surgeon before the cow dies.</P>
    <P>One of the great flaws in this whole scheme is this.  If a cow is coughing, the veterinary surgeon may slaughter it, but the veterinary surgeon under the existing regulations must discern a chronic cough or advanced emaciation. A cow suffering from tuberculosis which has reached the stage of having a chronic cough and emaciation has already wrought havoc.  But a person who summons a veterinary surgeon and whose cow has a chronic cough and is in the early stages of emaciation will get 75 per cent. of the value of the cow. I have tried to amend the regulation, but it is not possible in all the circumstances to discharge the vet. from the obligation of discerning a chronic cough if he wants to slaughter the beast under the Tuberculosis Order.</P>
    <P>I go so far as to say that if he conscientiously believes the beast to be suffering from tuberculosis and constituting a danger to the farmer or the farmer's family, if he punches the cow and makes her cough&mdash;and let him punch her as often as is necessary to make her cough&mdash;slaughter her and we will be glad and happy to see the farmer paid 100 per cent. of her commercial value rather than see her standing in the byre with chronic tuberculosis, when she will infect all the other cows in the byre and may very well infect the farmer's children and his neighbour's children to boot. I make that declaration in the well-founded belief that the members of the veterinary profession in this country are honourable men and feel about this, as most members of the House do, that they want to get rid of the tubercular cattle and do not want any jiggery-pokery of any kind. They are required, however, to certify <Col N="1084" /> they heard a chronic cough even though they believe tuberculosis is present.  My advice to them is, if they conscientiously believe tuberculosis to be present, let them take such steps as may be necessary to produce the cough, even if it involves giving the cow a pinch of snuff.  I say that with very full consideration, even though some of my more conservative colleagues may describe it hereafter as flamboyant.</P>
    <P>Deputy Smith, I think, inquired as to the number of beasts slaughtered. In 1948, the number was 742; in 1947, it was 814.  This grievous fact is true that in 1947 the average compensation paid was £4 5s. 0d. and in 1948 the average compensation was £5.  The meaning of that is that practically all those cattle slaughtered were allowed to go on until they were suffering from extreme emaciation and chronic cough and were, therefore, compensated for at the rate of 25 per cent. of their then market value.  If those farmers had only taken the conservative line and sent for the veterinary surgeon earlier, they could have got £40 apiece for those cows and we would have been proud to pay them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>How would they know? You have just told us that the tuberculin test is not really an accurate way of discovering when a beast is suffering from tuberculosis.  If that is not an accurate method of determining that question, how would the farmers know when this £40 beast was actually attacked by this disease?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy shares my solicitude in this matter.  We should make it known, as far as we can, that if a farmer discerns a cow to cough more than might reasonably be expected from a grain of food going against its breath; if when he is milking the cattle he hears one cow cough two or three times, that is quite sufficient ground on which to ask the county veterinary surgeon to come. There is no danger if the cow is a valuable one, say, worth £40 or £50. He puts her in no danger by calling the veterinary surgeon, because if he does so at that time when she is looking the picture of health, this is what will <Col N="1085" /> happen.  If the veterinary surgeon says: &ldquo;I suspect tuberculosis and I think you ought to let me slaughter her,&rdquo; the farmer consents.  If his suspicions and the veterinary surgeon's suspicious prove on post-mortem to be unfounded, he will get the full market value of the cow whether it is £40, £50, £60 or £80. We are talking of commercial cows.</P>
      <P>There are separate considerations for dealing with pedigree stock.  If, however, when the cow is slaughtered the suspicions of the veterinary surgeon and of the farmer are proved to be well-founded and the cow is in the early stages of tuberculosis, the farmer will get three-quarters of the value.  If the cow is worth £40, he will get £30. Remember the alternative is that if he does not send for the veterinary surgeon, some day he may get £4 for it and, in the meantime, he will have infected every other cow in the byre. So that there is never the slightest danger to the farmer in being vigilant. The worst that can happen is that the cow will be slaughtered in mistake, whereupon he is entitled to 100 per cent. of the market value, plus £1, and there is no limit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  When considering the very difficulty that Deputy Smith and other Deputies see in this matter, that occurred to me.  When the veterinary surgeons said to me: &ldquo;We are bound under our duty to have discerned chronic cough or emaciation before me may slaughter&rdquo;, I said to them: &ldquo;But it is notorious that many cows are known to have tuberculosis before any such symptom appears&rdquo;. They said: &ldquo;Yes, but the regulations require us to discern that symptom&rdquo;. I said: &ldquo;Why not apply the tuberculin test and slaughter them on that&rdquo;? The veterinary surgeons replied: &ldquo;That is the one test that you could not found a slaughter policy upon, because it is notorious that 75 per cent. would never develop the disease at all. But if we had the power to slaughter at the farmer's request where we conscientiously believed tuberculosis to be certain, then we would feel safe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1086" /> But we are constrained to wait for a chronic cough or emaciation&rdquo;.  To that reservation I have made my reply in public.  The county veterinary surgeon may conscientiously believe the beast to be suffering from clinical tuberculosis but it has not yet deteriorated to the point of showing the chronic cough or emaciation. If the vet. gives the cow two or three punches behind the ribs or a pinch of snuff to bring on the cough, slaughters the beast and pays compensation, I am quite prepared in any case to stand with him in his assertion that, whenceever the cough came that before it left the byre the cow was coughing chronically, that he slew her and found her suffering from tuberculosis and paid the farmer 75 per cent. of her full market value.  If, on occasion, he is obliged to say that &ldquo;I believed she suffered from tuberculosis and I slew her when she proved to have no tuberculosis and I gave the farmer 100 per cent. of her value plus a £1 bonus&rdquo; my reaction to that report will be that this veterinary officer is a conscientious and dutiful man in whom we all may have full confidence, that he is not afraid to do his duty whatever the danger of misrepresentation may be.</P>
    <P>I would be very glad to go into the extensions we hope for in regard to the veterinary services.  I think it would be more appropriate if, instead of expressing pious hopes, I postponed giving the details of that until I am in a position to come to the House, not with pious hopes but with a request for specific authority to do specific things.  I hope to be able to come before the House next year with a complete comprehensive scheme.</P>

      <P>I am simply working as hard as I blooming well can.  I cannot get around it any sooner, and if that is not £1,525 worth per annum it is the best that I can give.  I think I am giving blooming good value for the money that I get.  I am able to report this, and I think Deputy O'Grady will confirm it, that where in a circumscribed area a special problem presents itself, we are not reluctant to deploy our resources as best we may.  I think <Col N="1087" /> I do not exaggerate when I say that, in one area in County Clare where they had lost cattle to the value of £12,000 in the winter of 1947-48, by a concentrated drive of diagnosis and treatment last winter they lost only 19 beasts altogether.  We have been able in other defined areas to attempt the supply of similar services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We conducted a veterinary survey in the peninsula of Loop Head.  We discovered that 60 per cent. of the cattle were suffering from parasitic stomach worm, fluke and hoose. In regard to the two former, appropriate treatment was provided in each case by the veterinary staff of my Department.  In regard to hoose, the appropriate dietary procedure was recommended and supplies of bonemeal were made available.  To a certain degree, aphosphorosis was apparent and supplies of phosphatic manures were made available for farmers' lands, and lectures were given at suitable centres.  These were attended by nearly 100 per cent. of the farmers. When we returned to make a survey in February we got splendid co-operation from the people.  There were only two people in the whole peninsula who refused to accept the services which we had to offer.  We discovered, as I have said, that where they had lost £12,000 worth of cattle in the previous winter, only nineteen beasts died last winter.  We had a rather dramatic experience on the holding of one man who did not wish us to enter.  Of course, we withdrew at once, and said that we only offered our services and did not wish to enter against his wishes.  Two days later he brought us a beast that was bad with fluke.  We dosed the beast.  We sent a message to him to bring up the beast again and we gave a second dose.  When we returned in February we found that he had sold that beast and got a good price for it.  The other eight cattle on the holding were dying of fluke. I do not tell the story in any spirit of triumph.  We tried to cure the <Col N="1088" /> remaining eight beasts, but they were more advanced than the one that recovered.  You will find old-fashioned people like him in every county making a mistake of that sort.</P>
      <P>In a couple of other areas we have concentrated on a survey for the purpose of giving intensive treatment. That is always accompanied by a course of lectures designed to enable farmers to recognise the symptoms themselves and apply proprietary curse which are specific.  We now have a specific remedy for fluke and for parasitic stomach worm.  With regard to hoose, the treatment is to feed the calf.  If it is not in the last stages of the disease, bring it in and keep it in, give it milk and oats and it will throw off the parasite itself.  The calf should not be allowed in and out when it has the disease.  If it is housed and kept housed, and fed with milk and oats in suitable forms it will throw off the disease.</P>
      <P>We now have Strain 19, and we are prepared to inoculate every heifer in Ireland if the farmers will let us.  If we can get the farmers to co-operate with us we can inoculate every heifer in Ireland, and that confers complete immunity from contagious abortion. The members of the veterinary profession have agreed with us that they will do inoculation at 2/6 an injection where there are a number of beasts gathered in, and 3/- per injection where the inoculation involves a special trip.  We can make available for the first period appropriate vaccine free of charge, so as to induce people everywhere to get it done, and so encourage their neighbours by giving good example to overcome the natural reluctance that people have to undertake a new form of treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After the first three or six months' period&mdash;we have not yet determined that&mdash;we will have to ask the farmers to pay for the vaccine and that may add a shilling per beast to the cost. In the interim, if we eliminate contagious abortion, stomach worm, fluke and hoose it is not too bad a record for 15 months.  If, in another 12 months, we can put a complete veterinary service at the service of the farmers, it <Col N="1089" /> may compare unsatisfactorily with perfection, but in this imperfect world in which we live, and with the least perfect Deputy in the House in the role of Minister for Agriculture, it is not too bad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A.P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to put one question to the Minister since he did not deal with the point I raised earlier.  Granted that an occasional farmer will be so foolish as to allow a beast to get into an advanced stage of tuberculosis, is it not reasonable to assume that the same farmer will also be so foolish as to bring a beast suffering from the disease to the market and endeavour to get the full price for it rather than report the case to the vet. when he knows he will get only 50 per cent. of its value?  Will the Minister not take steps to ensure that, in order to defeat the racket to which Deputy O'Grady has referred, 100 per cent. of the value of every beast slaughtered will be paid in all cases?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I certainly will not.  There is such a thing in this world as a moral law.  It is not the function of this House to make blackguards into honest men.  A farmer who brings a tubercular cow, knowing it to be tubercular, and sells it in a fair, is lower and more contemptible than the man who commits murder.  I would like that to be recorded.  The farmer who sells a tubercular cow in the fair to his neighbour is a low, crawling thing, compared with a man who would go into his neighbour's kitchen and murder his neighbour's child in that kitchen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not now talking of the man who makes a mistake.  Deputy Byrne was talking of the man who, well knowing his cow to be a tubercular cow, rather than suffer the loss of a fraction of its value will bring it to the fair and sell it to his neighbour, hoping his neighbour will not discern what he has perceived. I want to say that the man who does that is a lower creature than the man who goes in and murders his <Col N="1090" /> neighbour's child.  That man will at least face a jury of his peers and take the consequences of his act, but the man who murders his neighbour's child by passing into his possession a tubercular cow, well knowing it to be tubercular, is a murderer and will answer to the God who made him some day for what he does.</P>
    <P>I would like every farmer in the country who desires me to be Minister for Agriculture to be fixed clearly with notice that, so long as I am Minister for Agriculture, that is my view and I would do nothing to help or relieve so contemptible a criminal as the man who will sell a tubercular cow to his neighbour for the purpose of lining his own pockets at the expense of killing his neighbour's children.  If there is any farmer in this country across whose mind a doubt passes as to whether his cow is tubercular, if there is any farmer who for a moment would hesitate to give the milk of a particular cow to his own child, I beg of him to send for the vet. now in the knowledge that if that animal is slaughtered he will be given the full market value and £1 in addition or, if the cow is infected, instead of murdering his neighbour's child to get the price at the fair he can get three-quarters of her full market value and the knowledge that no one has suffered as a result of his avarice.</P>

If I have erred in that respect I offer the Deputy my regrets. In these matters I am perfectly certain he did quite a lot.  I have no doubt his zeal, solicitude and energy in the prosecution of any such matters, in so far as it was available for him to prosecute, was done with all the earnestness that a model Minister would show.  If these schemes were operating before I entered the Department <Col N="1091" /> I should have made it clear that I did not recollect it.  Possibly more was done before I went into the Department than I have done since I went there.  I assure the Deputy he is entitled to the fullest possible credit for all that the Department has done and is now doing.  Doubtless it took its origin in the inspiration given by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>Vote 10, item 8&mdash; Improvement of Layout of Grounds of the Custom House.  The Parliamentary Secretary will no doubt be aware that the committee to set up a memorial in the grounds of the Custom House has been very active in fostering that project. I noticed recently that there is great activity in the Custom House grounds.  When I saw it first I presumed that it had some connection with that proposed memorial.  I know that the committee was in communication with the Department.  They sent a letter on the 8th July, 1948, and got a reply indicating that the matter was <Col N="1092" /> being considered.  They did not here anything further for a considerable period and they wrote again on 15th June last.  To that communication they received only an acknowledgment.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is fully aware of the historic incident which occurred in that building and in the grounds connected with the building. He is aware that on the orders of the Government of that particular period&mdash; Dáil Éireann&mdash;the army of the State took possession of the building because it was regarded as one of the most important centres of the administration of the occupying forces.  In the destruction of that building a number of lives were lost and a large number of men were made prisoners.  The committee which has been set up is composed entirely of Old I.R.A. men of the Dublin Brigade.  I believe it is fully representative of all sections of the community and of all Parties in this House, so that it cannot, in any sense, be described as a particular political Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Their main and only object is to commemorate the memory of the men who lost their lives in that particular episode and also the memory of those who took part in it.  I would be very glad if the Parliamentary Secretary would tell us exactly what the position is in regard to the situation there.  Is work on the improvement and lay-out of grounds going on at the moment?  Is the memorial included in that improvement and lay-out of the grounds?  If not, I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to interest himself in this particular matter and to ensure that this memorial to these men will be erected on the site on which it was originally proposed to erect it.  It was understood generally that there would not be any opposition to the proposal to erect such a memorial in these grounds.  An eminent architect, since deceased, designed the memorial.  He was himself a member of the Dublin Brigade.  He gave his services free and the design, which has been on public view, has been generally admired for its artistic value.  I cannot imagine, therefore, that there can be any objection to the design.  If there was any objection to the design and if there <Col N="1093" /> was any objection to the proposed site, I believe the memorial committee would be quite prepared to meet any points raised in that regard.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to give sympathetic consideration to this project and to ensure that, if possible, this memorial will be erected on the site on which it was originally intended to erect it.  The only alternative to that, if the Department decides that it will in any way interfere with the present lay-out of the grounds, is to seek some other site in that vicinity from the Dublin Corporation.  That might not, of course, be desirable.  I am sure that the corporation would give such a request their utmost sympathy, but it would be much more fitting that the memorial should be erected in the actual grounds of the institution in which this historic event took place.  I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to interest himself personally in this particular matter.</P>

With regard to inspection of works, we find there is great delay in having an inspector sent down.  The application may be in for a month or two, or even five or six months, before the works are inspected.  I do not know the reason for that delay.  The Parliamentary Secretary should know that there are times in the year when these works can be more suitably carried out, particularly in the case of farmers who have applied for grants to do roadways and laneways.</P>

      <P>I regret that the Government has apparently seen fit to virtually abandon the proposal to erect a Garden of Remembrance at Parnell Square.  There is only a token Vote of £10 provided in the Estimate. Last year £5,000 was provided, but it was not spent.  We have been publicly informed that it is now proposed to use this site for other purposes.  After the 30 odd years that have passed I think the time has come when some national memorial should be erected to <Col N="1094" /> these men.  The site at Parnell Square was deliberately chosen because of its association with the movement, pre-1916 and right through the Black and Tan war.  The site may not be very big, but it is admirably central.  We have been told that the Government have an alternative site in mind.  They will certainly find it very difficult to get a more suitable site.  They will certainly find nothing so central as Parnell Square.  I hope this does not mean the abandonment of the proposal for a long number of years.  We have no reason for thinking that there will be any immediate development in this respect.  I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to reconsider the position and to proceed with the original proposal. In the very next item there is a sum of £11,000 proposed for the cenotaph on Leinster lawn.  To my mind that provision does not show a real sense of values.  I think, if we are going to erect any memorial, this very historic one proposed at Parnell Square should get precedence.  It is extraordinary that that should be abandoned while the other is brought a step forward.</P>

      <P>I very much appreciate the level on which this debate has <Col N="1095" /> taken place.  Roughly 12 or 13 Deputies took part in it.  The tone of the debate has been very different from that of 12 months ago.  I sincerely thank every Deputy who spoke because no touch of politics was introduced into the debate right from the first speaker down to the last.  Helpful suggestions were made.  It is my duty now to reply as briefly as I can to some of the points raised.</P>
      <P>One matter to which specific attention was drawn was the alleged monstrosity in front of Leinster House. I think practically every speaker referred to it.  We propose to tarmacadam the courtyard in order to provide parking space for 64 cars.  We believe that roughly that amount of additional parking space is required. It is intended to have a display of flowers or flowering shrubs.  We also intend to improve the lighting.  Sometimes I hear the remark made: &ldquo;I wonder if the Parliamentary Secretary and the commissioners work like the workmen who are on the job out here.&rdquo;  I want to tell Deputies that these are not our workmen.  This work is being done on contract.  The contract is £7,800 and the job must be completed by August next.  There was a delay at one stage because of some trouble over contractors.  Deputies must understand that it cannot be rushed. Deputies must also understand that it will not be a terrible monstrosity, as they will discover for themselves when the job is finished.  The stonework is, of course, Irish granite.</P>
      <P>The Garden of Remembrance was mentioned.  That is deferred at the moment.  As regards the site, it is believed by the Government&mdash;and I agree with the Government in this&mdash; that there is more need at the present time for the proposed infant welfare courses scheduled for Parnell Square. The Garden of Remembrance is merely deferred.  I do not believe that there is even the remotest possibility of its being completely abandoned.</P>

    <P>Deputy Little referred to the shortwave broadcasting station.  As far as the Board of Works is concerned, our job is finished.  If there is any delay then the Department of Posts and <Col N="1096" /> Telegraphs must take responsibility for it.  Deputy O'Grady referred to the Bourne Vincent Memorial Park. The roads there were never designed for heavy traffic.  Hackney traffic is allowed.  We think that hackney traffic is sufficient for the visitors who wish to tour this park.  The roads would not stand up to any other kind of traffic except hackney traffic.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Reilly referred to barracks. I shall refer to both barracks and schools generally.  I want the House to realise that the Board of Works are contractors for every Department of State.  We cannot proceed with the carrying out of works until the responsible Department decides that the works are necessary.  We cannot build barracks unless the Minister for Justice asks us to do so.  With regard to schools, the initiative must be taken by the manager.  It then passes to the Department of Education, the Department of Finance and eventually to us. As far as schools and barracks are concerned, there is no delay of any kind at our end.  I am not subject to contradiction when I make that statement because I know it to be a fact.  Very often we have to take the blame when other Departments are guilty of delay. Sometimes, even in my own constituency, I have been asked by a manager why a certain school is not going ahead.  I look up the file in my Department and find that it is he himself who is the cause of any delay there is.</P>
    <P>The Clarecastle sluice gates were referred to by Deputy O'Grady.  The collection of data in connection with that matter is complete.  A decision will be issued in the very near future. Reference was made to the Dublin Castle scheme.  That has been deferred. Deputy Little referred to the fact that we are spending £7,000 on that scheme this year.  That £7,000 will go towards paying the engineers who prepared the plans.  No work is being carried out at the present time.  We believe that that scheme can wait.  It was remarked by Deputy Little that the inspector of national monuments had retired.  The inspector has actually consented to remain on until such time as we appoint someone in his place.  It is not true to say that he has retired.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1097" /> Limerick Castle was referred to by Deputy O'Grady.  We propose to take that over.  The necessary repairs will be carried out.  Deputy O'Reilly mentioned Bective Abbey and the growth of weeds there.  That is under consideration at the moment.</P>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan referred to an important matter when he said that the Board of Works engineers were not always right with reference to the sluice gates between Athlone and Meelick.  The keeper there has definite instructions to open the gates every time there is heavy rain.  As far as the ordinary people are concerned, the engineers have been proved to be wrong because they held that the opening of the sluice gates would not relieve flooding.  Actually that step has considerably relieved flooding in that area.  If the opening of the gates proves successful after heavy rain so much the better.</P>

      <P>I think it was Deputy Traynor who referred to the proposed improvements in the layout of the Custom House grounds.  He said that the proposals of the memorial committee should be considered in conjunction with the general scheme.  At present the scheme is in its very early stages.  The proposals of the memorial committee will be considered in connection with the next stage which includes a site considered suitable for whatever memorial it is ultimately decided to erect.  The matter is under consideration and the committee will be consulted in connection with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not.  The committee will be consulted in connection with it whenever consultation is necessary.  The principal matter raised <Col N="1098" /> by the various speakers was the question of arterial drainage.  I may as well tell the House that I felt 12 months ago that I could have at least live times as much work done as I have done to-day.  It is as well to be honest about it.  Progress in these matters is very slow.  I honestly thought 12 months ago that we would have three major schemes in operation at present. I want to announce now that in the month of August we shall make a start with the Glyde and Dee.  It may be pointed out that we have provided only £5,000 in the Estimate for this work but Deputies will realise that we cannot get excavators out there the first day. We have first got to go up and prepare the way along the banks.  We expect to make a start at these preparations early in the month of August.  If it should transpire that the sum of £5,000 provided will be expended before the end of the financial year, we hope to be able to get additional funds by some means.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kissane referred to a statement which I made in Kerry some time ago to the effect that the Brick and Cashen scheme would be done by June, 1949.  I did make that statement and I believed at the time it was possible to have it started.  If it has not been started, it is not any lack of desire on my part that is preventing it.  With the co-operation of the commissioners and the Board of Works generally, we expect it will be possible to have it started in the near future.  I shall not be so foolish as to name a definite date. That is a very foolish thing to do, as Deputies will realise, but we shall have it started very soon and we expect to have three other schemes going through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Deputy raised a point about the employment of engineers.  I had hoped that some Deputy might put forward some suggestion as to how we might loosen the red tape connected with Civil Service regulations in this country.  The task of employing engineers, as Deputy O'Grady, who has some experience of this Department, will know, is one calculated to give anybody a headache.  There is one regulation which will have to be complied with one day and some other <Col N="1099" /> regulation which has to be carried out the next day.  To give an idea of the difficulties encountered, I might mention that in one instance 45 engineers presented themselves for interview in connection with the filling of eight positions.  Before the Civil Service Commission had finished with the job, instead of having the men from Nos. 1 to 8, as they were placed by the commission, the first man available was No. 29.  That meant that 28 men had gone away before the calls could be sent out.  Without engineers, as Deputies know, you cannot make any progress.  I would honestly say to the House that that is the greatest cause of holding up work at the moment. Civil Service regulations are preventing us from getting engineers as quickly as we should get them.  I make that as an open, honest confession.  I am not going to say that Fianna Fáil was responsible for these regulations or that the present Government is responsible for them, but the fact is that the regulations are there.  I hope that the Dáil will some day find a method by which we can loosen all this red tape, and any suggestion in that connection that may be forthcoming from any side of the House will be welcomed.</P>
    <P>Even in the case of the 1945 Arterial Drainage Act there are certain regulations which do hold up the work.  At the moment the scheme for the Glyde and Dee is fully prepared, but the maps must go on exhibition for three or six months and provision must be made to receive objections if there are objections.  Of course, I do not anticipate there will be any objections, because we are doing work which the people want done.  There were no objections, for instance, in the case of the Brosna.  From the 1st August we shall be making the necessary plans as regards getting stores up there and preparing the ground for our excavators to go in.  By the time the six months are up we can go ahead with the scheme.  There are some provisions of the 1945 Drainage Act which, I think, I will have to ask the Dáil to delete on a future occasion, for the general good and in order to speed up drainage.  We all realise that drainage <Col N="1100" /> is a very necessary work, and I am hoping that certain things under the European Recovery Plan will happen in the near future whereby we may be able to speed up certain large schemes in this country.  Probably in that way we may be able to give temporary relief in certain areas until such time as the 1945 Act comes into operation in these areas.  I cannot make a definite announcement about it now, but I do hope that matters will pan out as I would wish.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies seem to have a confused idea as to the conditions under which drainage is carried out.  It was pointed out that the Minister for Agriculture is doing a certain amount of drainage while the Minister for Local Government is also carrying out drainage of a certain type under the Local Authorities (Works) Bill.  So far as we are concerned, our job is the administration of the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945.  Under that Act there must be a proper survey, proper maps, and the comprehensive work which we shall carry out under the Act is work that will be done, not on a temporary basis, but work of a permanent character which will have to be maintained. I want to make that clear, and my only regret is that we have not been able to work fast enough.  The commissioners may say to me that probably we are going too fast, but certainly I am not satisfied with the rate of progress of drainage, not a bit satisfied.  When it is considered that we have 40 major schemes, if we are to carry out only two or three schemes at the same time, some people may have to wait 100 years before their area is reached.  Deputy Davin and others referred to the Nore, which floods Kilkenny City.  These are very necessary works, but at the moment we can only look ahead and say that we shall go there some day.  I may as well be honest; at the present rate of going it will be much longer than I thought it would.  The best we can hope to do at the moment is to have three major schemes going.  We will certainly have two this day 12 months, and I hope we will have a third, the Kerry one.  The trouble is that the moment things get along all the people will be crying for drainage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1101" /> If I have left out any point I will look over the debate and reply personally to any Deputy concerned.  I am very grateful for the tone of the debate to the 12 or 13 Deputies who spoke.  Their suggestions were very helpful.  I would always ask them to come to meet me or I would go to meet them to discuss any suggestions they have to make.  I would be only too glad to accept them for this great national job of arterial drainage.</P>
    <P>Nearly all the Deputies spoke on the question of national schools.  We are spending £300,000 on them this year and I am glad that we are because we all realise what good health in the national schools means. I may as well be honest and say that at the rate we are going at the moment I think we will have to come in here to look for a Supplementary Estimate as we are spending more than £300,000. I am sure that if it is necessary to look for it for such a deserving object the Dáil will give it to us.</P>
    <P>Again I would like to thank the Deputies who spoke in the debate.  I would always be only too grateful to hear suggestions in this great national effort.</P>

      <P>I have one point, more of an æsthetic character than anything else.  On coming down the quays from the direction of the gasworks one is struck very forcibly by the small buildings that have been erected at the Custom House, and I think it does not require an expert to come to the conclusion that the beautiful aspect of the Custom House, which is one of the architectural glories of Dublin, has been rather spoiled.

      <P>It was my experience in respect of these young men who have secured their degrees and become fully qualified engineers that the salary offered by the State was inadequate in every case.  I am speaking from my own experience.  Naturally when these young men were offered more adequate terms on the other side they accepted them and I can say, also from my own experience, that the same thing happened in respect of Army engineers. I do not think it is a question of Civil Service red tape as much as a failure to offer proper remuneration to these young men who have come out from the colleges.</P>

    <P>The average number employed each week on all schemes, excluding the farm improvements scheme, during the period up to September was 4,419 and from October to March, 3,622.  The corresponding numbers for the farm improvements scheme were 3,717 and 3,840.</P>
    <P>A large number of applications was received for minor employment schemes during the year and about 5,000 proposals were investigated and reported on, including proposals already partially carried out.</P>
    <P>During the spring and summer, approximately 300 minor drainage schemes were carried out at a cost of about £20,000, principally for the development of bogs used by landholders for the supply of their domestic requirements of turf.</P>
    <P>The rural improvements scheme is complementary to the farm improvements scheme and enables groups of farmers to carry out various kinds of works for their joint benefit, principally small drainage works and the construction and repair of accommodation roads to houses, lands, and turbary. The usual rate of contribution by the landholders is 25 per cent., but this may be reduced in special cases where the work, in addition to being of benefit to the landholders immediately concerned, also serves members of the outside public.</P>
    <P>The number of effective applications received under the rural improvements scheme from its inception in 1943 up to 31st March, 1949, was 7,592, of which 6,467 had at that date been investigated on the ground by inspectors and reported on.  Of these, 818 were for various reasons found to be unsuitable, and offers of grants were issued in 6,022 cases.  The number of such offers accepted in the course of the year under review was 672, for which grants totalling £91,053 were sanctioned towards a total estimated expenditure of £118,210, the balance of <Col N="1106" /> £27,157 being contributed by the applicants.</P>
    <P>The total expenditure incurred on the rural improvements scheme (including the farmers' contributions) during the financial year was approximately £129,176.  By the end of the year, the number of individual works completed since the inception of the scheme in 1943-44 had reached 3,270, while a further 390 schemes were in progress.</P>
    <P>The total expenditure of £350,739 for the farm improvements scheme includes a sum of approximately £38,750 in respect of the special farm drainage scheme operated in the areas of Counties Galway and Mayo, where unemployment had resulted from the discontinuance of the production of hand-won turf by the local authorities and Bord na Móna.  Under the terms of the scheme, the farmers concerned contributed to the cost of the works at the rate of £4 per statute acre of the land drained.</P>
    <P>It will be observed that there was a net under-expenditure of approximately £22,500 on the Vote in the last financial year.  Having regard to the diversity of the types of schemes and to the large number of separate works &mdash;about 2,500&mdash;comprised in the annual programme, this is a relatively insignificant sum.</P>
    <P>Turning now to the programme for the financial year 1949-50, it will be observed that the provision in the Vote is £1,250,000.  In this regard I should mention that the allocation of those sub-heads of the Vote provided specifically for employment schemes amongst the various urban and rural units of area is broadly in proportion to the number of unemployment assistance recipients in each area, and the programme for the financial year is based on a special enumeration of unemployment assistance recipients made in the beginning of each year, usually in January, when unemployment is at the maximum.  The total number (including former unemployment assistance recipients engaged at the time on employment schemes) of men returned in this census in January, 1949, was approximately 56,300, as compared with 54,600 in January, 1948.  The corresponding <Col N="1107" /> figure for 1940, before there was any significant movement of workmen to Great Britain, was about 111,500, compared with which this year's figure shows a reduction of roughly 49.5 per cent.  In the meantime, the cost of the works has more than doubled, owing to increased rates of wages and the higher cost of materials.</P>
    <P>Of the sum of £1,250,000 proposed in the Estimate for the current year, £600,300 will be spent on the continuation of schemes sanctioned before the 31st March, 1949, leaving a balance of £649,700 available for expenditure on new schemes.  To the amount of the Vote must be added contributions from local authorities, and from beneficiaries under the rural improvements scheme, together estimated at £304,000.  This gives an aggregate of £1,554,000 available for expenditure within the financial year 1949/50.  To enable this expenditure to be achieved as far as possible within the time limit, it is proposed, in accordance with the usual practice, to authorise schemes to the extent of £599,300 (State grant) in excess of the amount of the Vote.  This sum, equivalent to the unexpended balances on works in progress before the 31st March, 1949, together with a proportionate amount for local contributions, will be carried forward to form part of the ensuing year's programme.</P>
    <P>In this regard it is desirable to remind the Dáil that a large proportion of each year's Vote is allocated for expenditure by local authorities.  The expenditure of the full amount of the provision depends largely on the acceptance by these authorities of the grants on the terms offered, and on the prompt submission of schemes.</P>
    <P>The bulk of the proposals for works on which the new sanctions in the year's programme of employment are based, are not lodged until after the beginning of the financial year, and for that reason, and because the incidence of unemployment both in regard to time and place is liable to fluctuations, it is not feasible to make a close estimate beforehand of the sum required for each sub-head of the Vote.  It has <Col N="1108" /> always been the practice, therefore, to allow a considerable degree of flexibility and interdependence between these sub-heads, the eventual savings in some being set against the excesses on others.  In addition, a certain proportion of the Vote is kept in reserve, in sub-head O&mdash;Miscellaneous Schemes &mdash;to meet contingencies, or to provide for classes of works which are not proper to the other sub-heads.</P>
    <P>Subject to the foregoing remarks, the programme of employment schemes for the present financial year will be broadly in accordance with the general practice in previous years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOGrady" hpid="Mr. O'Grady Mr. O'Grady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.</P>
      <P>The chief criticism I have to offer is in regard to sub-heads I and J.  Sub-head I deals with development works in bogs used by landholders and other private producers&mdash;grants for read, drainage and other works to facilitate the production of turf by landholders, voluntary organisations, business firms and others.  That grant is being reduced from £90,000 last year to £60,000 this year.  I think that is a serious mistake in policy on the part of the Parliamentary Secretary and the Government. Having regard to the present price at which coal of an inferior quality is offered to the consuming public here, and also having regard to the fact that the price is 25/- a ton in excess of the commercial price in Great Britain, it behoves us here to provide an alternative form of fuel.  Everything that could possibly be done by everybody having responsibility in this matter should be done, and I regard it as a serious mistake in policy to reduce the sum of money provided for this very necessary and essential work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could understand a movement of that kind on the part of the Government if it could be contended that this home fuel, which is calculated to give so much employment where it is so badly needed, as the Parliamentary Secretary knows, throughout rural Ireland, could not be produced at an economic price, but, having regard to the existing price of coal, I hold that, <Col N="1109" /> purely as a commercial transaction, it would pay to produce turf of good quality and sell it at a price which would be fair to the consumer and, at the same time, give a reasonable reward to the producer, and yet compare favourably with the present price of coal.  I wonder if it is too late for the Parliamentary Secretary to mend his hand and to reconsider the whole scheme with a view to making available a much larger sum which would help to provide much-needed employment all over the country, and particularly in the remote parts, where no other scheme could scarcely be thought of which would give employment of the same remunerative nature to the people concerned.</P>
    <P>Sub-head J deals with grants for the strengthening of public roads to enable them to bear the strain of heavy turf traffic or for the repair of public roads damaged by such traffic.  As the Parliamentary Secretary knows, a great many roads all over the country in areas where there was heavy turf traffic during the emergency period have been seriously damaged, due to the large number of lorries which careered over them.  These roads were never built to accommodate such traffic and in many cases these roads have not been brought back to a proper state of repair, and it is as yet too soon to economise in the provision of money so necessary to bring these roads into good condition.  Just as the production of turf would provide very much-needed employment, so money expended on these roads would provide necessary employment and give a good return for the capital expended.</P>
    <P>I notice that the amount provided under sub-head K&mdash;farm improvements scheme&mdash;is similar to the amount provided last year.  It will be agreed on all sides of the House that that is one of the best schemes we have had, and, in passing, I should like to pay a tribute to the staff connected with the working of that scheme.  Rarely has any public Department given such satisfaction as has been given under that scheme.  I wonder how it will fit in with the new scheme introduced by the Minister for Agriculture.  Will this farm improvements scheme, for which <Col N="1110" /> the Parliamentary Secretary is responsible, fade out now and be merged in the larger scheme?  If it is, I hope that the staff who have given such satisfaction to the community will be continued. I hope also that if that scheme is absorbed into the larger scheme, it will be by way of an extension and increase of the very essential works which have been carried out with such satisfaction throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The provision in regard to sub-head N&mdash;rural improvements scheme&mdash; is similar to that made available last year, but, in each of these sub-heads K and N, I notice reference to drains and drainage, so that the Parliamentary Secretary was scarcely correct in saying that his only function with regard to drainage was arterial drainage.  He has a few other drains to consider, apart altogether from arterial drainage, because, under these sub-heads, he is responsible for field drainage and for drains for the benefit of groups of farmers.  There are so many Departments now having a share of the responsibility in regard to drainage that I am afraid there will be considerable confusion through the country and Deputies will find it hard to know to which of the many Departments now handling drainage they should refer applications which they receive from their constituents.  Something ought to be done to clear the air and, if possible, to co-ordinate all these various drainage schemes.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary referred to a sum of £37,000 expended last year in Galway and Mayo on a type of trial scheme, which.  I take it, was the forerunner of the scheme introduced by the Minister for Agriculture.  The Parliamentary Secretary, however, did not give us any idea of the average cost per acre, beyond stating that the farmers concerned had paid a contribution of £4 per acre.  I should like to know what was the average cost per acre of this reclamation work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. T. Walsh Mr. T. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise a point in connection with the inspection of works submitted to the Department, particularly in relation to accommodation roads.  In many cases I know it has happened that, when applications <Col N="1111" /> have been sent in, three, four and six months have elapsed before the works were inspected.  I heard the Parliamentary Secretary say that it was largely due to lack of engineers, but whatever the cause it is not right. Deputy McQuillan urged that works of national importance&mdash;and these works I refer to are works of national importance&mdash;should not be held up by reason of a scarcity of engineers in the Department.  If the Department is to work properly, the first step to be taken is the provision of personnel, and whether it is because sufficient remuneration is not offered or the engineers are not available, the fact remains that works submitted to the Department have been held up for a very long time.  In the country when application is made for a grant for accommodation roads, it is made at a time when the grant would be forthcoming at the most suitable time for the people themselves.  There are periods of the year when the work could be carried out at a lesser rate than in other periods&mdash;when there is more unemployment and when the farmers are not busy with the crops and so forth&mdash;but, due to the fact of the works not being inspected, the grants are not being given at the proper time.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to look into that aspect of the problem, so that when a grant is applied for there will not be any delay in having the works inspected.</P>
      <P>On the question of link roads I would like to say that we have a great many of these roads which do not qualify to be taken over by the county council because of their width, even though they are open at both ends and do not qualify in that case for the grants under the accommodation scheme.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to take these roads into consideration and make the grants available.  If a grant is made available for widening these roads there is a possibility that the councils might take them over and maintain them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my constituency at Derrylackey bog in 1943-1944, a sum of £1,000 was granted by the Board of Works for the <Col N="1112" /> purpose of making an accommodation road into the bog.  That work was never completed, and last year a further application was made for a grant and was turned down.  I can tell the Parliamentary Secretary that in that particular area there is a great amount of turf being used by the local people and the fact that they have no roadway is causing a great amount of hardship. Even though Kilkenny may be a poor county, and we have plenty of coal in one end of it, yet there is another portion where turf is being used to a very great extent.  That grant was applied for, and I think £1,000 would complete the job, but it is being withheld.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter, and that is the question of the River Nore.  We have had this matter up time and again in this House regarding the drainage of the River Nore, and if not drainage at least the cleaning of it.  Apparently under the Local Works Bill we will not have any authority to go into that river.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have raised this matter before and I am going to repeat that the solution of this problem in connection with the administration of local relief schemes and rural improvement schemes is one of urgency.  The position in my constituency is that a large number of men do not register as unemployed for various reasons.  I mentioned the fact last year here, that a number of men do not register as unemployed for the simple reason that they do not like going to the labour exchange.  They believe that there was some tinge about it.  Whether they are right or wrong in that I do not know, but that is the belief and it amounts to the fact that very useful work cannot be done in a number of areas because of the fact that there are not enough registered unemployed.  In other areas where people have got into the habit of registering as unemployed they get the full grant to carry out schemes in those localities.  I think it is absolutely wrong.  I think the solution of the whole thing lies in doing away with this business of registered unemployed in the matter of full grant schemes.</P>
      <P>I do not think that is a very difficult matter.  I do not know what the Parliamentary Secretary himself thinks about it but the general feeling which I think exists in most rural areas is that this method of giving full grant schemes only in areas where there are a prescribed number of unemployed is wrong; that the extent of the money involved does not mean that the best work is being done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the sooner this system is ended the better.  In my constituency numerous applications for local relief schemes, repairs of roads and the clearing of drains have been made and we get back an acknowledgement from the Department of the application, <Col N="1114" /> to be informed afterwards that the special employment schemes have been considered and they regretted very much that they could not give the full grants for these particular schemes because there was not the prescribed number of registered unemployed in the area.  I could nearly see the satisfaction on the faces of the officials of that Department when they were in a position to give a reply like that.  I know it is not right to blame officials.  They have to carry out the regulations but surely the Parliamentary Secretary is there long enough now to know that type of answer is not in the interests of the public.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised a question on the debate on the Estimate for the Department of Local Government with regard to the repair of accommodation roads and cul-de-sac roads.  Last year, in my constituency, over 120 miles of cul-de-sac roads were knocked off the repair list because the county council had no authority to repair them.  For a number of years past the county <Col N="1115" /> council had repaired these roads but they had no authority to do so and, consequently, the county council were surcharged for that last year.  There is one way of getting over that difficulty, and I suggest it can be done under this particular Vote.  These cul-de-sac and accommodation roads can be repaired under minor relief schemes. The only way in which they could be done up to the present was under rural improvement schemes.  If a by-road leading into a village was repaired every three years for the last 20 years free of cost to the people of the locality, these people are entitled to have them repaired in future without there being an extra levy in respect of them.  The position at the moment is that the county council are no longer in a position to repair the roads, with the result that the people, if they want to repair the roads, must subscribe to a rural improvement scheme to have the work carried out.</P>

It is a disgrace that roads should be knocked off the list that had been repaired every three years since 1929, and that suddenly the heavy hand of the auditor should come down on the county council.  I am suggesting to the Parliamentary Secretary that there is a way out of that difficulty in this particular Estimate, that these roads could be repaired under minor relief schemes.  In other words, there could be full-grant schemes for these particular roads.  A list of these roads can be obtained from the county council.</P>

There is plenty of turf available there.  With regard to the registered unemployed list, I think it is absolutely disgraceful that, in a particular area where there is very urgent necessity to carry out work on a drain or small river or to repair a very <Col N="1117" /> important road, this work cannot be done under a full-grant scheme because there are not enough registered unemployed in the area.  It amounts to this, that full-grant schemes are only given for the purpose of absorbing the unemployed and that the question of the importance of the work does not seem to be taken into consideration.  I want to bring that forcibly to the Parliamentary Secretary's attention and I hope and trust that I shall not have to repeat my representations in the near future.</P>

      <P>I am very happy to be in a position to support my colleague, Deputy McQuillan, in regard to a number of points he has raised.  As chairman of the county council, I can state that what he has said is true, that a large number of minor roads which had been maintained by county council funds for a considerable time were, because of the auditor's action, knocked off the list.  Nothing has been done about them since.  In most cases &mdash;probably in all cases&mdash;applications have been made for minor relief grants. The result is as Deputy McQuillan has stated that they are turned down because there is not a sufficient number of men on the unemployed register. That is no satisfaction to the poor people concerned.  We are all very sympathetic with these people living in backward districts.  We say that they are the cream of the earth, that they are the real old Gael, the real stock, but when it comes to doing something practical for them we send them off to someone else.  The Local Government Department put them out.  We turn to the Board of Works and these poor people are put out again.  It is an extraordinary and intolerable state of affairs for these poor people who live in backward districts, particularly in the west of Ireland.</P>

    <P>When one considers the estimates for these items, is it any wonder that this work is not carried out?  Is not it quite obvious that the grants are entirely inadequate?  What can be done with £100,000?  For rural improvement schemes there is a provision of £180,000 for the whole country. Rural improvement schemes&mdash;£180,000 <Col N="1118" /> for the whole country.  Minor employment schemes&mdash;£95,000.  What could a sum of £95,000 do for minor employment schemes for the whole country? What could that money do &mdash;even with the rate of wages as low as it is, comparatively, to-day?  The same applies to the other branches.  Farm improvement schemes&mdash;£350,000.  I suppose that must be the drainage business.  I should like to know through what agency this seed distribution scheme is operated.</P>

      <P>If that is so, it is very strange that the Vote is under the Board of Works.  I do not know about the rural improvement scheme.  Perhaps that is regulated by the number of applications and the number of people prepared to contribute the 25 per cent.  However, the grants in this Estimate for minor employment schemes and for bog development schemes are absolutely inadequate.  I am sorry to say that I am terribly disappointed. It may not be the fault of the Parliamentary Secretary.  I suppose he is bound by financial considerations, but I am terribly disappointed with the work being done under the present Parliamentary Secretary.  I was looking for great things from Deputy Donnellan when he became Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance.  As I say, I am terribly disappointed.  I thought that we would have an enlargement of these schemes&mdash;especially at a time when most of them are required.  This is not politics, either.  In my county there was a terrible displacement of labour and a terrible lot of emigration. Even those who remained at home or had to stay at home have been placed in a bad position.  Last year, I, with others, went on a deputation to the late Minister for Local Government. He told us that he would have this matter of getting money for those byroads that were knocked off looked into but nothing was done about it, and nothing is being done about it, and nothing will be done about it under this Vote because there is not enough money there.  You cannot make <Col N="1119" /> £100,000 go round the whole country and get any reasonable work done.  I have no use at all for these Estimates as far as these jobs are concerned. They are an absolute disgrace.  We swagger and talk about spending a lot of money on main roads&mdash;and a lot of money is being spent on main roads, and a good deal on county roads, too. But there is no consideration for the people living on the by-roads.  It is not their fault that they are living on these by-roads.  In spite of adversity, poverty and so forth, they have lived along these roads for generations and now, when everything else is progressing, they are still being left in the lurch.  My feeling is one of disgust with this Vote.  If the Parliamentary Secretary does his duty, as I think he will, he will go to the Minister for Finance and get an adequate grant for these things.</P>
      <P>I thoroughly agree with Deputy McQuillan that, in connection with the doing of these by-roads or connecting links, the question of the number of unemployed on the register of the local labour exchange should not apply.  A lot of people forget that these poor people have bought little patches of bog&mdash;maybe of 30/-, £2 5s. 0d. or £2 10s. 0d. valuation.  How can these people contribute to the making of a road which may cost a considerable sum of money?  They simply are not able to do it.  There is not one particle of politics in anything I am saying&mdash;I do not care who the Parliamentary Secretary may be.  I appeal to him to get an increased grant, especially for these minor employment jobs&mdash;improvement of by-roads and, particularly, development schemes.  I do not know what the Parliamentary Secretary's Department may have done in other districts but, as far as I know, nothing has been done in my area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While Deputy O'Grady was in charge of the Office of Public Works a good deal was done, but nothing could be more useful than the making of those bog roads, the drainage of turf banks, and so forth.  It not merely makes possible the sale of turf but it gives to the poor people who want to provide their own fuel a reasonable <Col N="1120" /> chance of cutting their own turf and of getting it out of the bog.  I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to try and get an increased grant for these things.  There is no use in talking about making improvements when you have not the cash to carry them out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I would urge the Parliamentary Secretary on this Estimate, in the second year of his office, to indicate the Government policy behind this Vote and to state quite emphatically and explicitly to the House the primary consideration in connection with this Vote&mdash;whether it is to give a few weeks' work per year to a few thousand people or whether this Vote is intended to carry out and complete, wherever they commence, works of a nationally useful nature.  Locally, they are very valuable.  I confess that I do not understand the policy behind this Vote.  It is a hardy annual which serves no useful purpose.  It does not fit in, I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary, with the policy of the Government to provide full employment for all our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I strongly support the suggestion put forward by Deputy McQuillan, and supported by Deputy O'Rourke, that this whole business should not be looked at from the point of view of the available number of registered unemployed in a particular area whenever an essential work has got to be carried out.  Every one of us knows&mdash;and the majority of the Deputies who are listening to me know better than I do because I am not a member of a local authority&mdash;that year after year under the three Governments we have had since this State was established, county councillors come before their local authorities and put forward what they call councillors' proposals for the carrying out of local works of an essential nature.  These proposals are turned down because the rates cannot provide the money.  The county councils concerned say that the Government should carry out these works at the expense of the Central Fund.  I received a couple of threatening communications from portions of my constituency some time ago.  One gentleman&mdash;I sympathise with him; he is out of work and he is the leader of a local body of unemployed people&mdash;<Col N="1121" /> said that he was going to organise a hunger march.  Apparently his destination would be the Board of Works in St. Stephen's Green or the Minister for Finance in Government Buildings, for the purpose of finding out why the Department of Finance or the Board of Works or the Government as a whole cannot carry out useful and necessary schemes in the localities concerned where these works have been submitted year after year for a number of years. This situation appears to me to be a sort of national tragedy.  Young men are lining up day after day at the local labour exchanges and registering for permits to go to Great Britain while, all the time, essential works are waiting to be carried out in the areas in which they live.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is aware that the problem of unemployment generally comes under the Vote for the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that, in many areas from which these proposals are coming, there is actually a greater number of unemployed people living in these areas than is represented by the registration at the local labour exchange. I have often asked young men why they were not registered.  Sons of small farmers regard it as degrading to go into the local labour exchange and come before somebody later on and justify their claim for unemployment assistance.  The Parliamentary Secretary should take his courage in his hands&mdash;and I know that he is a courageous man, mentally and physically&mdash; and indicate that he has progressive ideas in regard to this whole business. He should take the House into his confidence and say that it is necessary to provide, not alone hundreds of pounds, but a couple of millions, and if he comes to the House and says that he has a carefully prepared plan for the carrying out of all these works over a period of years or over the best portion of the year when there is unemployment in the rural areas, he will certainly have the support of the Deputies sitting on this side of the House, and I venture to say that he will have the support of Deputy Burke <Col N="1122" /> and of his colleagues on the other side of the House.  Therefore, it is up to the Parliamentary Secretary to bring forward proposals of the kind that will enable these works to be carried out within a reasonable time.  I speak from personal knowledge over a long period of years.  I wonder if the Parliamentary Secretary would take the House into his confidence and say how many thousand schemes are in the pigeon-holes of the Board of Works&mdash;schemes that cannot be carried out but which are in themselves useful and essential&mdash;which cannot be carried out simply because the necessary number of registered unemployed are not registered at the local exchange. I think the answer would be illuminating.</P>
      <P>I know farmers living on cul-de-sac roads in my constituency who cannot carry out in a satisfactory or efficient way their ordinary agricultural activities. In some cases they cannot get a threshing machine into their holding and lorries cannot enter to take out the beet.  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary, who is a first-class working farmer, that if we are to increase agricultural production we must give farmers who are willing to help to increase production the machinery to enable them to do so. They must have access to their own holdings.  Not very long ago, in my constituency, a member of a family living on one of these roads died and the remains had to be carried across a field, the road leading to the house was so bad.  That is a terrible state of affairs in a Christian country.  Of course, it may be an exceptional case. There are unemployed in that area and repeated applications were made for the carrying out of minor relief works affecting farmers residing on that road.</P>
      <P>That kind of job will not be done at the expense of the local rates.  Therefore, if the Parliamentary Secretary regards these as essential works of a minor or national nature and there are unemployed people in the area, whether registered or otherwise, who are willing to carry out the work, the money should be provided and the work done as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1123" /> I am probably pushing an open door. The Parliamentary Secretary, however, may have been knocking at the door of the Department of Finance.  If he tells us that he has been knocking in vain on more than one occasion, speaking for the group on this side of the House, I can assure him that we shall give him all the support necessary to get the money out of the Central Funds to carry out these essential works and provide employment for people who are looking for work in another country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I want, first of all, to ask the Parliamentary Secretary whether he has received my complaints about small rivers which have been silted up owing to bog development schemes which took place during the emergency.  I have in mind one particular river in County Westmeath, the lower Wood River.  That river became completely silted up through an outflow from adjacent bogs.  I want to ask whether there is any special scheme for removing obstructions from such rivers.  So far as I know, work of that kind does not come under the public works scheme and it might not be necessarily scheduled for main drainage. Nevertheless, work of that kind has to be done.  According to my information, there are still a great many arrears to be carried out in connection with such schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to consider everything which has been said in the debate in regard to accommodation roads.  I can speak with a fairly clear conscience, because about two years ago there was a debate during Private Members' time in which the Government was asked to take over responsibility by means of grants and through a rates levy for the maintenance of cul-de-sac and accommodation roads. The then Opposition made it perfectly clear that they thought the system which still obtains of repairing accommodation roads of that character was inadequate; that it was stimulating emigration; that it resulted in lower values for farming properties not on main or county roads; that it was out of date and that something should <Col N="1124" /> be done about it.  If Deputies bother to look up what I said in the Official Reports they will find that, although I indicated that the Government could do nothing about it, I did not say that we were never going to do anything about it.  I said that so long as the main problem facing county councils and the Department of Local Government was that of restoring the main and county roads to their pre-war condition, it was quite impossible to envisage the provision of either technical staff or money to deal with the 20,000 miles of cul-de-sac roads which are in this country.</P>
    <P>Apparently, the present Government do not particularly favour the improvement of main roads.  They are starting on a scheme for improving county roads at a rate which will take about 40 years.  They have continued the grants which we gave for the first time for the maintenance and restoration of county roads.  Therefore, on their own admission, they should be, shall we say, cul-de-sac road-minded.  It seems to me that there is a very good case for the Parliamentary Secretary, in conjunction with the Department of Local Government, to examine that whole question.  Is it the Parliamentary Secretary's belief that, for the next 50 years, the best method of repairing these 20,000 miles of road is either by special employment schemes or else through the rural improvements scheme or, in the case of link roads, by the county council taking over such link roads when they can be taken over, if rates can be raised and the Minister for Local Government will sanction such acquisition?</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Parliamentary Secretary whether the time has not arrived for a review of that problem.  During the war crops had to be produced, turf had to be won and there was every excuse for any Government in office to postpone a decision on the problem. After the war, for the first few years there was the excuse that roads had to be put into proper shape.  Above all, the bituminous skin on the main roads, valued at about £25,000,000, had to be prevented from breaking causing enormous financial loss to the country. These factors no longer hold good.  The <Col N="1125" /> Parliamentary Secretary might consult with the Department of Local Government in respect of one county or even part of one county, estimate what the cost would be for the proper maintenance of cul-de-sac roads, where there were more than a certain number of houses on a road, and what type of administration would be required.  He might even undertake a small experiment in carrying out that work, if it amounted only to work on some 100 miles of cul-de-sac roads so that he could estimate the expense.</P>
    <P>From what I remember of the examination of the problem, I am perfectly certain that the ultimate expense will be double whatever is estimated either by the Employment Schemes Office or the Department of Local Government, because my own belief is that the people on these roads will demand a standard which will be higher than anyone can envisage at the time.  The Parliamentary Secretary now has the labour available.  There are people ready and willing to work.  They are no longer cutting hand-won turf on a great scale.  They are not engaged in compulsory tillage.  He even has the benefit of more technical assistance, because the assistant engineers are no longer engaged on county council hand-won turf schemes.  I should like to ask his view.  It is the custom for the members of the Government to give their personal views as well as the views of the Government.  I did not approve of the Minister for Agriculture telling the American people how to run their business in America.  I must say that if members of the Government or Parliamentary Secretaries are going to follow that precedent, a good way of doing it would be for the Parliamentary Secretary to tell us privately and personally what he thinks of the problem of the 20,000 miles of accommodation roads.  I do not believe that any member of the Opposition will say that he is showing a lack of responsibility for so doing.  I am quite sure that Deputy Davin would also like to hear his views on that matter.  Minutes will be found written in my name in the Custom House in which I made it clear to the officials there that the problem should <Col N="1126" /> not be postponed for ever.  In Great Britain, even with five times the national income per head of this country, there is hardly a single road left that is not tarred even up to the tops of the mountains.  If they can do that, we must adopt a lower standard if you like, but there must be some national scheme for universal road maintenance.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I should like again to avoid for a moment merely political controversy over this question of special employment schemes.  I could join with my colleagues if I wanted to and make a purely political speech and I would be justified in so doing.  In order to try and persuade the Parliamentary Secretary that the present yardstick used to estimate the need of winter work is inadequate, I should like to put it to him this way:&mdash;When we started these employment schemes the economic war was at its height, cattle were worth about £5 apiece and the people who registered in the month of January really desperately needed the work in a great many cases, in spite of all the other grants made available by the Government, the guaranteed price for wheat and all the other steps taken to offset as far as possible the serious effect of the economic war.  These people needed the work.  The yardstick was, in any event, far more adequate than it is to-day.</P>
    <P>The yardstick as a method of estimating the need for winter work began to break down during the emergency when a very large number of small farmers' sons and workers were able to get good work during the summer cutting turf or in tillage.  If the Minister studies the figures of the number of unemployed he will find that they decreased during the emergency.  Some of the people, quite frankly, went to Great Britain.  Others found they did not need to register in the winter months.  What has happened since the war, since the hand-won turf scheme ended?  I think unemployment was greater in rural districts last winter by about 5,000.  As the Minister knows, emigration very greatly increased but I am not going to make that particular point to-day.  I am going simply to talk about it as being a question which <Col N="1127" /> we would have had to settle, if there had been no war, about 1939 or 1940 and which the present Government will have to settle now that the hand-won turf scheme has ended and that compulsory tillage no longer operates.</P>
    <P>It is quite evident to me in County Longford that, as Deputy Davin said, people who need the work do not register, for personal reasons.  A great many of them are emigrating.  Whether the provision of this work without their registering would prevent their emigrating I do not know.  That is a matter we cannot go into to-day.  I am quite certain that there are intermediate areas, areas not like certain parts of Galway where there is a great tradition in registration which is not related to any of the normal factors but is simply a matter of people registering who live on very small plots on rocks and who need the work. There are intermediate areas such as North-West Longford, part of Westmeath and part of Roscommon where the people are not registering.  Again, is it not possible for the Parliamentary Secretary to reconsider this whole matter with the other Departments and see if he could not schedule certain areas where sums would be spent, irrespective of the number of unemployed registered, where persons who come from farms of a certain valuation and who comply with certain conditions can put their names down in the labour exchange for work or who can write in for work and get work?  Should he not, if the statements made by some of the Parties supporting the Government can be taken sincerely, provide an increase in the Vote, anyway? Should he not make the yardstick easier to be complied with?  If any of the statements in regard to the giving of employment are to be regarded as sincere he ought to do that.  I claim it is a problem we would have had to face.  We avoided having to face the problem because the war took place and with it the hand-won turf scheme came into operation.  At the end of the economic war considerably more people were registering and if we had complaints from the Opposition on exactly the same lines of Deputy Davin's speech that it was not a proper <Col N="1128" /> yardstick, surely the same conditions hold good now.  The fact that the war has brought higher agricultural prices and with it a greater measure of prosperity to rural areas does not mean that the people have not in turn demanded an increase in their own standards and the people in those poorer areas, even though they are making more out of cattle and so forth, feel that in proportion they need some help in the winter.  Their standard has gone up in common with workers all over Europe.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary will at least give me the credit that I am not trying to make things difficult for him. I am simply saying this problem has to be faced.  When you read the pronouncements of some of the smaller Parties you would think the unemployment problem in this country is one which has the same features all the year around, whereas the principal problem is in the winter.  The number of unemployed will go up from 60,000 or thereabouts to 84,000 this year.  In fact, in 1947 the number of unemployed, I think, was 40,000 because of the operation of the Employment Period Order.  It went up to something like 70,000.  There are certainly 24,000 or 25,000 more people unemployed in the winter months in the rural areas.  A great number of the schemes giving employment do not operate so well in the winter as in the summer.  There is no need to repeat all that, as the Parliamentary Secretary knows that even in afforestation for every 30 people employed in the summer you have ten in the winter.  Even reclamation work can only be done in reasonable weather in the months of October and November. Housing activity diminishes in very remote rural areas when the weather becomes extremely inclement. The Employment Schemes Vote is one which provides employment on the roads and can be operated even in pretty bad weather.  It is one of the very few schemes that gives employment in the winter.  It seems to me that it is time there was a change.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary whether he considers the amount of £60,000 allowed for development work in bogs, under subhead I, is really sufficient having <Col N="1129" /> regard to the circumstances that obtain in a great many areas.  The Parliamentary Secretary knows as well as I do there are areas where there appears to be an excessive amount of bog and where, in fact, farmers have to go miles to find their banks.  The distribution under the various Land Acts has been such that a man may be completely surrounded by bogs and may have to go six statute miles to his own bank.  The cutting of hand-won turf on a big scale during the war created further difficulties in that regard.  Those difficulties were mitigated by the emergency powers provision under which county councils could acquire bog temporarily for tenants requiring it.  That emergency power has lapsed and the bogs have gone back to their original owners.</P>
    <P>I know that in County Longford a great deal of bog development work is required.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary whether the present yardstick that obtains is the same as that during the war.  In order to qualify for a grant it had to be possible to repair a road so that I think the standard was that the expenditure of 6/- per ton of turf removed on the road would do a good job.  If not more than 6/- per ton of turf raised in the year was spent, the grant was worth while. Is that still the yardstick?  Now that the emergency is over, what is the yardstick that is applied to bog development schemes.  Does the Parliamentary Secretary think it is too severe, or does he think that it should be improved?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy tell me who regulated that yardstick?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a regulation made by the previous Government. There is nothing to prevent the Parliamentary Secretary changing it, because in those days the grant was given, among a number of other grants, for bog development, for people who were cutting turf on a big scale.  Wages have gone up since, the cost of raw material has gone up, the cost of everything in connection with roads has gone up since the time that yardstick was first applied.  I am asking the Parliamentary Secretary whether he has <Col N="1130" /> changed it, and whether he thinks it ought not to be changed again in favour of the people concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>Previous speakers have referred to the difficulty of carrying out minor relief schemes in electoral areas where there is not a sufficient number of registered unemployed.  That is a real difficulty.  I suggest that where there is a very necessary work to be done in a particular electoral area, such, for instance, as the repair of an accommodation or bog road, the regulations might be altered to allow surrounding electoral areas to be grouped since in that way there would be a sufficient number of registered unemployed to enable the work to be done.  We often find that a road at the end of an electoral area requires to be repaired.  The work cannot be done because there may be only five or six registered unemployed in the electoral area concerned, while in the adjoining electoral area there may be 24 or 30 registered unemployed even though there may not be any minor relief scheme to be carried out there. I think it would be a good thing if the regulations would allow a work to be done within, say, three or four miles of the particular area concerned.  I think these minor relief schemes should be operated under those conditions.</P>
      <P>In connection with rural improvement schemes we often find that a road leading into a townland or a village is required.  Some of the inhabitants there may be very poor and may not be able to make the contribution required for the work.  I suggest that those people should get employment to carry out the scheme, and that the amount of the grant they were supposed to get might be deducted from their wages.  For example, the amount of money that would be demanded from three or four inhabitants in a townland where a road had to be repaired would be too high.  Hence, I hope the suggestion that I have made will be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same thing applies to the erection of bridges over rivers.  It might cost £100 to erect a bridge but it might serve only five or six inhabitants. In cases of that sort there is great difficulty in supplying the <Col N="1131" /> local contribution.  In such extreme cases, I think the Parliamentary Secretary should have discretion, if at all possible, to reduce the amount of the local contribution in order that such very necessary work could be carried out.  Matters such as I have mentioned arise frequently in my constituency where you have remote townlands in among the mountains with large stretches of by-roads that need repair.  There is also a great need for the erection of bridges.  I fail to see why these bridges were not erected years and years ago.  It is hard to think that people should be prevented from being able to get out from their homes to attend Mass, the markets and fairs because of the flooding of rivers in their areas where there are no bridges.  The Parliamentary Secretary, of course, cannot be blamed for all these matters.  I hope, however, that the schemes which are being put up to his Department will receive careful attention.  I must say that any time that I have visited the Office of Public Works I have received the greatest courtesy not only from the Parliamentary Secretary but from the various officials there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFlynn" hpid="Mr. J. Flynn Mr. J. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with previous speakers that the amount of money made available for the Parliamentary Secretary is not sufficient.  Instead of being £95,000 it should, in my opinion, be £195,000.  Last year, in parts of South Kerry, we had one area in Valentia Island where the total amount allocated for five schemes was only £300 odd.  Sums of £40 and £60 were allocated for some of them.  The position at any rate was that there was not sufficient money to complete the work in the case of three of the five schemes. The Parliamentary Secretary does not appear to have enough money made available to his Department to cover the cost of the schemes submitted to it, or to carry out the schemes recommended by his engineers and by Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that, if necessary, he should approach the Minister for Finance with a view to getting sufficient money for carrying through these schemes.  In connection with the latter, it is stated <Col N="1132" /> in a circular that &ldquo;the expenditure is so high that the public utility of the work would not warrant the expenditure.&rdquo; In other words, it is not merely a question of turning down schemes but of turning them down because there is not a sufficient number of people in an area who are in a position to meet the high cost of the work proposed.  Therefore, such works are taken off the list.  We have a large number of these cases which are excluded on the grounds that the expenditure, for the limited nature of the work, is so high that the Department cannot see their way to sanction the carrying out of the work.  The net result is that, even though the carrying out of a work is urgent in some remote district but because the contribution required from the three, four or five local farmers would be too high for them, the Board of Works cannot see their way to sanction any expenditure for the work, but if there were ten farmers in the area the Board of Works would do the work.  That is my reading of the circular.  In my opinion that is not justice, and it is not a fair way of dealing with that type of case.</P>
    <P>I agree entirely with Deputy Palmer with regard to the grouping of these areas.  There are remote areas in South Kerry where the people do not register. They are ten or 15 miles away from the nearest Garda station or local exchange office.  Under the existing system they are deprived of getting relief work in their districts.  In those areas the number of men is limited&mdash;there might be four or five in an entire valley. Under the existing system there must be at least 16 or 20 or 25 men available. Our suggestion is that you group one small area with one or two other areas so as to make the total required for your scheme and that will enable you to give the required grant to these people.  What I do not like about this system is that you increased the number of men required to qualify.</P>

      <P>I understood it was increased from 16 to 25, but I withdraw that statement if I am wrong. I appreciate what the Parliamentary <Col N="1133" /> Secretary and his officials have done. They have treated all my proposals and representations with the greatest consideration.  I know it is not the will that is holding them back; it is the system they are working&mdash;this kind of restricted idea of so many dole men and so much work.  We shall have to change the whole thing.  We have reached the stage when we shall have to do something big.  Why not embark on a scheme something like the one the Minister for Agriculture has adopted?  Take your courage in your hands and come along to the Dáil and say: &ldquo;I want one or two million pounds to finish all these schemes.  I want to finish with them once and for all.&rdquo;  The Minister for Agriculture is applauded all over the country for having the courage to ask for so many millions to develop one of the greatest schemes in the history of this country.  Why should not the Parliamentary Secretary take the same line and finish with all this work?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">

      <P>I would like to learn from the Parliamentary Secretary if the arrears that accumulated during the period of interruption, when the county council engineering staff in County Galway was withdrawn from the supervision of rural improvement works, have been wiped out, and has he a sufficient staff to deal with that work now in Galway County?  So far as the rural improvements scheme was concerned, it was a good scheme.  I think there are few counties in the State that availed of it to the same extent as Galway County.  A considerable amount of arrears accumulated. Every Party in the House has approved the rural improvements scheme and certainly it is a very good one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We could have even a better scheme; we could have an improved scheme.  Contributions should be cut out altogether and the full grant should be given on condition that the people concerned were prepared to pay an annual sum to be put into a fund to keep the roads that were brought up to a high standard of repair in a proper condition.  Perhaps I will be told that that would mean extra machinery and a very big extra staff, <Col N="1134" /> but if it is possible to formulate a scheme of that kind in respect of the land reclamation scheme I do not see that there will be any great difficulty to be overcome if we adopt the same methods as were adopted with reference to the rural improvements scheme.  Fine work was carried out under that scheme.  I think it is apparent to everybody that many of the schemes undertaken in the first the schemes undertaken in the first and second year of operation now require a fresh grant in order to have the roads put into a proper state of repair.</P>
    <P>There is an important point as regards minor drainage schemes. Minor drainage schemes that come within an existing drainage district are precluded from getting grants under the rural improvements scheme or even under minor relief schemes.  I was told that applications were made for the drainage of small rivers that were tributaries of a larger river in a drainage district and that no grant could be given.  When the Works Bill was introduced county engineers were given instructions to make out a list of schemes, including rivers.  Our county engineer submitted a list to us and I find that he has not included in any of his proposed schemes rivers that are tributaries of an existing drainage district.  If that is the case I think it should be altered also.</P>
    <P>The second point I wish to make is in connection with the reduction in the amount estimated for bog development. I think that reduction is a very great mistake and that it is altogether a retrograde step.  Plenty of money was made available in the years of the emergency for drainage of bogs and the repair of roads&mdash;almost as much as, I think, could be utilised.  That was because of the fact that people had to depend on native fuel.  A number of bogs that were owned by tenants were taken over and operated by the county councils.  Development work was carried out there by the county councils and now all that has been dropped. Apparently in the Board of Works there is a rule whereby any bogs not used for the production of commercial turf will not get the bog development grant.  Application has been made in <Col N="1135" /> a number of instances, that I know of very well, and after some time a reply has come back from the Office of Public Works enclosing a rural improvements scheme form and stating that a bog development grant cannot be given.  It is often worded in a distorted way because mention is made that the number of unemployed in the area is not sufficient to warrant a grant.  The number on the unemployment list did not enter into the matter in the emergency years, so far as bog development was concerned.  Where the bog was a useful bog and where a number of people were producing turf, if they applied for the grant, they got it to do part of the work but, in many instances, portion of the work only was carried out.  The people hoped that as time went on they would get supplementary grants to complete the work.</P>
    <P>It is well known to the Parliamentary Secretary and to other Deputies that large tracts of bogs were taken over by the Irish Land Commission, the Estates Commissioners and the Congested Districts Board from the passing of the 1903 Act and that little or no development work of any useful kind was carried out by any of the bodies mentioned. As a result, the bogs are left there in a very bad state.  They are undrained and the roads into them are merely tracks.  Some improvement was carried out during the emergency years.  I think where a number of people are dependent on a particular bog for their domestic supply of fuel, they should be taken into consideration for bog development grants equally with those who produce turf for sale. I think that is most important and it would confer a very great benefit on the people.  If this has to be done by a rural improvements grant, it is very doubtful if it will be availed of in many instances.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to take that into consideration and to see that bog development grants are made available in the same manner and on the same system as during the emergency years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course I am sure that is the information the Parliamentary Secretary has at his disposal but I know a number of bogs where grants were given for partially carried out work.  The owners have applied for subsequent grants to finish the work under the bog development scheme and they have got back, as I have already stated, a rural improvements scheme form.  I can give the Parliamentary Secretary specific instances if he wishes.  I am almost sure it has been brought to his notice already.  It would be a very grave mistake on the part of the Parliamentary Secretary or the Government if at this stage they did not continue the very fine work of bog development, that was started by their predecessors, and matters such as I have mentioned should not come into it at all.</P>
      <P>I should like the Parliamentary Secretary, when he is replying, to give me some information on the point regarding drainage, which I have already mentioned.  The question of the number of unemployed on the unemployment register should not apply.  The rule that is at present in force is not an excellent idea, especially where works of public utility have to be carried out.  Unemployment can be relieved by carrying out works of public utility and I believe that works carried out in the past for the relief of unemployment were to a large extent works of public utility.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to consider again what I have suggested in regard to the rural improvements scheme and the alterations in it.  I think that alteration would serve a very useful purpose and that it would help to expedite the repair of these roads.  I also believe that people would find it much easier to pay 5/- or 10/- a year for a number of years and have a fund there to keep the road in repair than to put down anything from £3 to £15 or £20 each, as they have done in many instances.</P>

I have difficulty in fitting in some of the headings here in the <Col N="1137" /> Estimate under that general appellation.

The incidence of unemployment falls very heavily in certain areas.  You have other areas where you have distress that is not arising primarily from unemployment and it seems to me unsatisfactory, for the public generally and for Deputies particularly, that these schemes should be dealt with annually on a Vote that comes from the Office of Public Works showing that they are administered by other Departments, mainly by the Department of Agriculture.

The point is that the Minister used to growl about the unjust burden that taxation imposed upon the people of this country when the Vote for the Central Fund and Supply Services was around £65,000,000. In the last year of the Fianna Fáil Government, the year ending in April, 1948, the expenditure issued from the Exchequer for Central Fund and Supply Services was £65,000,000.  This year the Minister has budgeted for the Central Fund and Supply Services for the sum of £72,916,000, which is almost £8,000,000 more than was spent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to make a Budget speech but I ask the Minister <Col N="1139" /> to recognise that at one time he declared that the income-tax was an unjustifiable burden on the people and an extortion.  He calmly proposes this year to collect by way of income-tax the sum of £13,000,000, although if he had lived up to his promise, he could have reduced that income-tax to nil and have about £5,000,000 left for the reduction of other taxes.  The Taoiseach down in Bantry a fortnight ago said that there had been a reduction in taxation of £7,000,000.  If that were true, half the income-tax might have been avoided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is, and it seems that it must be evident even to the Deputy's mind, that before the Budget of 1948 this Government remitted to the people the taxation on beer and tobacco which had been collected by Fianna Fáil and that cost the Exchequer over £6,000,000.  This year I am giving back £750,000 and that is £7,000,000 to any simple mind.  If the Deputy lives long enough to attain the use of reason, he will recognise that that is an easy calculation.  In addition, there were increases in old age pensions and widows' and orphans' pensions and it becomes further evident that while reducing the burden of taxation by £7,000,000 a year, certain further additions were given.  I calculate that if they had not been given, the reduction in taxation could have been £11,000,000.  It is quite true that if I had not bothered to take the tax off beer and tobacco, there could have been heavy reductions as far as income-tax is concerned, but we decided to do it the other way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not denied the figure he gave in his Budget statement of £72,916,000.  That is more than £7,000,000, nearly £8,000,000 more than the sum spent by the Fianna Fáil Government in 1947-48 which was £65,165,000.  The Minister's leader in that year went around the country saying that he was going to reduce taxation by £10,000,000.  That would have meant that he would have reduced it to £55,000,000 instead of £73,000,000. There is no denying those figures as the Minister has published them in the Financial Statement 1949, which was <Col N="1140" /> circulated at the time of the Budget. In view of that fact of the additional £8,000,000 being collected from the people, the taxation has been increased by £8,000,000 instead of being reduced by £10,000,000.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach misinformed the people when he said that they would reduce taxation.  The rate of taxation has been reduced with regard to tobacco and certain other things, but the rate of taxation in regard to certain other matters has been increased and the Minister has not only increased the rate of certain existing taxes but has imposed totally new taxes.  He has collected money for Central Government expenditure by increasing the national health stamps.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation I have to make clear to the Deputy is that while the gallop of Fianna Fáil was stopped by the people, they left us a Book of Estimates which showed that they were going to budget for £70,500,000, plus Central Fund £7,000,000, that is £77,500,000.  I cut that down&mdash;it is cut down already.  The Deputy has insisted a lot on what Fianna Fáil spent.  That was the last time they got a chance to spend.  In the Supplementary Budget of 1947, they put on extra taxation because they had additional proposals to spend £10,000,000 or £11,000,000 more in the year.  That is a gallop which we stopped, and we made the savings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Deputy says that I have increased taxation, he must face up to this.  The beer and tobacco duties were remitted.  They were going to bring over £6,000,000.  On one single tax, the remission of 6d. in income-tax, <Col N="1141" /> there is £1,000,000 in a full year.  That is £7,000,000 in total in a full year. That is all taken off.  Would the Deputy say what has been put on? There was one major tax last year&mdash; on petrol&mdash;which was offset by an extra subvention to the people, an increased allowance of tea at the subsidised price, and a variety of other things.  If the Deputy says we are spending more than what Fianna Fáil did spend, he is forgetting that Fianna Fáil had contemplated spending £77,500,000 at least in the year 1948-49, only that the people thought better of it and decided they would not stand for that taxation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister speaks about &ldquo;the Fianna Fáil gallop&rdquo; when the actual expenditure in that year was £65,000,000.  If it was a gallop to spend that, it is a runaway to spend £73,000,000.  It is admitted, of course, that the rates of taxes on beer and tobacco were reduced.  They were increased to meet a very special occasion and it was found in the next year, when the budgetary position was being examined, that more money could be got even if the taxes on those particular things were reduced.  If the Minister had lived up to his promises to reduce taxation by £10,000,000, he would now be budgeting for £55,000,000.  Instead of that, he is budgeting for £73,000,000 for Central Fund and Supply Services. There is no getting around those figures, which have been published by the Minister.</P>

      <P>A certain decision was arrived at in the Supreme Court adverse to the Revenue Commissioners. Substantially, the matter is a question, where a parent and his children are in a partnership, of collecting tax.  Whatever about arguing the principle of that in general terms, the Minister does not say this does not affect the case. Clearly it does not affect the case up to the moment, but if&mdash;and probably it will happen&mdash;the particular set of circumstances which gave rise to this particular case continue as from the date of the passing of the Act, it seems to me that those particular persons will be subject to assessment under the terms of this section.  In other words, there is a peculiar retrospective effect here.  An arrangement was come to, in the particular circumstances of that case, before the passing of this Bill, and the rights under that arrangement, already subsisting at the passing of the Bill, have been determined and adjudicated on by the Supreme Court.  The effect of the Supreme Court decision was merely to determine the actual legal relationship of the Revenue Commissioners on the one hand and these persons on the other, in relation to a certain set of circumstances which existed before the Act.  This set of circumstances will continue for the future. It seems to me that, on the application of this section, whereas assessments for the past are not interfered with, on exactly the same set of circumstances these people are going to be assessed for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, I wonder if that is a fair thing. I hasten to tell the Minister that I know nothing of the particular circumstances of this case beyond what would be available in official reports.  I have had no personal dealings with the case, nor do I know anything about facts that <Col N="1144" /> have not come out in court.  It would seem that the Minister is creating under this section a precedent.  In 1937 and onwards, the law was in a particular form, and, if these people wanted to come to some arrangement at that time, we can credit them with having come to their arrangement in their knowledge of the law as it was at the time. For purposes of argument, we will assume that these people decided to do this in the light of legal advice.  Now we are changing this, having allowed the matter to be adjudicated on in court and having allowed it to run for some time.  The result is to deprive these people of the certainty of a particular statutory condition as existing at that time.  I wonder is that desirable. It takes away all certainty in the matter of people's rights in such contractual or quasi-contractual matters. Is it desirable from the point of view of certainty of rights?</P>
    <P>It simply means that you are establishing the precedent here that, no matter what a person does in the light of the law existing at a particular moment, and despite the fact that a decision upholding the rights of these people has been given, notwithstanding the fact that their rights are upheld on that basis, a Department of State for one reason or another comes along and, finding itself defeated in the court, is able to go to the Minister responsible and get a section like this passed.  It seems to me to be a type of legislation the principle of which, if admitted, would ultimately deprive the private citizen of almost all rights.  Having regard to the danger of that precedent and to the fact that, I should imagine, the revenue yield from such a provision would be relatively small, will the Minister not agree that the section had better be omitted?</P>

      <P>I must confess that I do not understand what the Deputy is driving at, except that he is trying to make the point that what the law is at one time it should remain for ever. Take income-tax&mdash;I could not therefore reduce the income-tax rate by 6d. People would have made arrangements on the basis of a 7/- income-tax rate, and it would be quite wrong for me to put them in the new position in which <Col N="1145" /> they would have to pay 6d.  less.  The Deputy forgets that the Act of 1922 was brought in for the purpose of defeating attempts made successfully to evade payment of income-tax.  That law was passed in 1922, but later, further loopholes were discovered through which people were able to make their escape, and, in 1937, the Party to which the Deputy belongs stopped some of these loopholes.  A new loophole has been found, which I am stopping.  I am not interfering with the rights of people who have contested a case in court&mdash; they are left alone.  I am dealing with the future as from the date to which the Budget relates.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that point on the Minister's part, but the point I am making is that you are affecting a decision of the court.  I would agree with the Minister if he were to say: &ldquo;I will stop this loophole from a future date&rdquo; and that all such arrangements entered into as from the date of this enactment would be affected in the way the Minister wants. The point I am making, however, is that an arrangement was come to, perfectly legally&mdash;whether it was evasion from the Minister's point of view or not&mdash;and was come to anterior to this Act, under which certain rights accrued to these people.</P>

      <P>That does not make the slightest difference to my argument. I am trying to deal objectively with this point, that, under an arrangement made anterior to this Act, certain people had certain rights.  These rights were determined by the court and these rights were attached to an arrangement made before this section can come into operation.  I think this amendment is the type of amendment which goes very far in an undesirable direction.  I would have no objection if the Minister were to say that it would apply to all such arrangements which have not been come to as from a certain date&mdash;let him go back to the 4th May or whatever reasonable date he wishes.  What I am objecting to is this <Col N="1146" /><i>ad hoc</i> legislation which specifically defeats for the future the rights of these people and people in similar circumstances whose rights have accrued and are actually vested by reason of an executed transaction prior to the passing of the section.  There is a distinction between that situation where rights are vested and the point the Minister has made about amending the income-tax rate.  It might be desirable to limit this section to prospective operation.  The amount that will be involved for the Exchequer will be negligible and, as I say, there is a fairly substantial principle involved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>We have the rather extraordinary situation arising whereby the Minister for Justice allows people belonging to an illegal organisation to carry arms openly, while the Minister for Finance proposes to quadruple the tax payable by a person who has a .22 rifle.  That is going a little too far. The farmer who has a shotgun for killing vermin, for killing crows and foxes which are running away with his fowl, will have to pay double what he paid last year.  I know that I cannot convince the Minister that the Fianna Fáil Government was not a rapacious Government which robbed the poor taxpayers, but we did not go to the length of doubling the tax on the farmer's <Col N="1147" /> shotgun or quadrupling the tax on a .22 rifle, while leaving people illegally to carry arms openly without any tax. They can have machine guns, but the person who paid 5/- on a .22 rifle is to be charged four times that amount hereafter, according to the Minister's proposal.  I cannot see that the Minister is so short of funds that he must behave in this fashion towards people who have admitted that they have arms and are prepared to pay a State tax for the right to hold them.</P>
      <P>In the matter of the details, the Minister is behaving in a rather extraordinary way.  He proposes to raise the £2 for a game licence by 5/-, that is, increasing it by one-eighth, while he proposes to double the farmer's licence&mdash;the farmer who pays 5/- for the right to carry a shotgun on his lands for the destruction of vermin.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>It is in fact a shotgun for the killing of vermin on farmers' land.  If the Minister thinks my interpretation of number three in the schedule is not right then he should seek advice.  All these words boil down to this: that the farmer who confines himself to killing vermin has to buy a shotgun certificate for 5/- and the Minister now proposes to double that, making it 10/-.  That is a 100 per cent. increase and at the same time he is only putting one-eighth increase on the others who want to kill game and who have hitherto paid £2 for the licence.  Why should there be that big difference?  The Minister talked about the difference in the value of money from the time this tax was first imposed but the shillings in the £2 licence have depreciated to the same extent as the shillings in the 5/-licence for the farmer's gun.  Why should the farmer's licence for a shotgun <Col N="1148" /> be doubled when the Minister is only increasing by 12 per cent. the £2 game licence?</P>
      <P>The other thing I want to say in regard to this is that it is completely wrong to quadruple the licence for a .22 rifle.  The Minister for Defence and others would like to see the young people who joined the defence services trained to be good marksmen.  The young man who gets a licence and has someone around to teach him can go into the Army as a marksman and save the State that amount in training. He can also join the Local Defence Services and when he does he enters as a marksman.</P>
      <P>I think we should encourage miniature rifle clubs and the young men of the country to shoot straight provided that they do it in a legal way. It is all wrong that we should discourage people from carrying arms in a legal way and encourage them to carry arms illegally and free.  The Minister made a very bad shot at increasing taxation when he increased one tax by 100 per cent. and only increased another by one-eighth.</P>

Indeed if the Minister had reduced taxation by £10,000,000 instead of increasing it by £8,000,000 he could not only have reduced these licences but could have given a machine-gun to every person in the country.  I hope Deputy O'Higgins is not going to support this particular distribution of taxation because he is one of those who went around the country complaining about the rapacious, grasping Fianna Fáil Government that had increased taxation.</P>

      <P>The Minister is again repeating a statement which is completely false.  He has not reduced taxation by £7,000,000.  He reduced the rate in the Emergency Budget on beer and tobacco.  He was complaining <Col N="1150" /> when taxation was only £65,000,000. It is now £73,000,000 and it is of course this £73,000,000 that the Minister is scrounging around to find, and it is to do this that he has to increase the tax on the .22 rifle and double the tax on the farmer's shotgun.  There is no other reason for this increase.  Would the Minister explain why he came to the decision to double the tax on the farmer's shotgun and only increase the game licence by one-eighth?  I object to it being increased at all.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 4 is for the purpose of substituting a new series of rates of duty for those previously announced.  This means, in fact, that I am reducing the imposition to what it was in 1946.  It costs me in revenue about £35,000 or £40,000 in the year.</P>

      <P>That was not the plea of a lot of the Deputies now forming the Coalition Government in the days when the dance duty was being collected and when Fianna Fáil was in office.  The particular Minister who is now proposing to collect this £75,000 on dances and céilidhes was the gentleman who not only objected to the extortionate bill, as he called it, which the Irish people had to pay to Fianna Fáil but who proposed to reduce it by £10,000,000.  Instead of that, he has increased it by £8,000,000 &mdash;and portion of that £18,000,000, which he was out, is this tax on dancing. He knows very well that this particular tax is going to hit a number of voluntary organisations in the country which depend for their revenue on the subscriptions of their members or on the profits, if any, of the social functions&mdash;céilidhes or dances&mdash;which they run from time to time.</P>
      <P>We all know that if there is to be any life, particularly in the country districts or small towns, a means must be provided whereby the young people can come together and enjoy themselves and, at the same time, raise some funds for their football club, Gaelic League, Red Cross branch or what not.  I think it is ridiculous that we should pay lip service to the idea of making rural life more enjoyable while at the same time we impose taxes that make it more difficult for the young people to enjoy themselves and make it very difficult for voluntary organisations of a cultural nature or sports clubs to collect the necessary funds or make profits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I was Minister for Finance I proposed to the Government that we <Col N="1154" /> should abolish this tax.  I pointed out in this House, when justifying my decision, that it was a rather expensive tax to collect.  There are certain existing taxes from which we could get additional yield without a penny extra expense, but there is no doubt about it that if the Revenue Commissioners' officials have to attend all dances or have to inspect all dances within three miles of every centre of 500 population in the country they will be inspecting practically the whole of the country except the tops of mountains.  If anybody likes to draw circles of three miles round every centre of 500 population I think he will find that he brings in practically the whole of the country Charitable organisations under this particular tax arrangement have to prove that their expenses are less than 50 per cent. in order to get exemption. We have all had the experience of charitable organisations running a dance or a céilidhe.  If they do well, their expenses are less than 50 per cent. If they do badly and lose money, they have in addition to pay a 50 per cent. tax on their intake.  I do not see how the Minister can justify this particular tax.  At one time he said that, if there was any good reason for spending money, we could print it.  He denied that in the general debate on the Budget and challenged me for the quotation.  I gave him the quotation. I should like to know from him now, seeing that he did not reply to that particular point in the general Budget debate, why, if he is short of money at present&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This £75,000 which the Minister is proposing to collect by this tax on dancing forms portion of the £73,000,000 total.  We take it that this £75,000 will be spent for some good purpose.  I want to know why the Minister proposes to collect it by a tax on dances.  He used to speak of the crushing burden of taxation when it was £8,000,000 less.  Now he is imposing this £75,000 extra on dancing, although the Fianna Fáil Government, even in the emergency Budget, when they wanted to collect money refused to collect it in this particular way.  We all know the temptation for charitable organisations when they have done badly in running a dance or a céilidhe to write down their expenses to a figure below their real expenses.  If they are subject to a tax when their expenses are over 50 per cent., there is a temptation to make a return of expenses below 50 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making it relevant to interruptions.  I want to ask the Minister to forego the collection of this tax.  It is a bad tax in every way.  It reduces the opportunity for young people throughout the country to enjoy themselves in a legitimate way.  They have as much right to dance as to drink beer or cheap wines, but the Minister believes in cheap wines and beer and dear dancing.  I hope he will withdraw this particular tax.  It is bad for the country; it is a brake on local initiative. Football clubs and charitable organisations of a parochial and other kinds are entitled to have a dance or a céilidhe to collect funds without having the revenue officials on their heels and putting the commissioners to the expense of sending round inspectors to attend those dances.  If a revenue official finds that there are 500 present at some céilidhe or dance and only 400 have paid the tax, the committee or the person in charge has to be hauled before the local court and all that requires a lot of money.  This is one of the most expensive taxes to collect.  It was found to be so in the past and will be found to be so in the future.  If the Minister wants to raise money by taxation, surely there are a large number of ways of getting it and more desirable ways than this.  A very slight addition to some of the existing taxes would bring in very much more revenue than this £75,000.  The Minister has reduced the price of beer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Aiken has informed the House that this tax was taken off in 1946 and that it was a very costly tax to collect.  It is regrettable that the Minister did not inform the House in reply to a question on the Order Paper of the amount that it cost to collect the tax in 1946.  It would possibly help us to come to a decision as to whether or not it was advisable to reimpose it.  The £75,000 which he hopes to collect by imposition of the tax will not be any great addition to the revenue.  Offset against that £75,000 will be the cost of the expense of collecting.  We will have to pay an office staff, the rent of at least two offices in Dublin City and, I understand, a number of other offices throughout the country.  We will have to pay the wages and expenses of inspectors going around the country to inspect those places of entertainment. So I honestly believe that when we offset the expenses in collecting this tax the Minister will find, as his predecessors did, that very little revenue will accrue from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is admitted that when the tax was in operation before it was only paid generally by what are known as commercial halls, and then it was only paid fully where the entertainments were held by the proprietors of those commercial halls.  The social clubs referred to by Deputy Aiken, the football clubs and the Red Cross functions and even the dances of political Parties, I do not think were an exception. From my own knowledge I know that the branches of all political Parties in this House from time to time have dances.  I would not take the liberty to accuse them but I do suspect that the members of those branches could not see why they should pay a revenue which they looked on as a type of income-tax before they were guaranteed their own expenses out of the functions they were running.  They did <Col N="1158" /> previously&mdash;before this tax was taken off&mdash;adopt various methods to avoid payment of the tax and protect themselves from losing money instead of making a little money at those functions.</P>
    <P>Where the dances were held for charity, first the promoters had to convince the revenue officer that the dance was for charity.  I believe they had then to purchase the tickets and after the function was over send a return back to the revenue officer.  If their expenses were under 30 per cent. they got a refund of tax.  Deputy Aiken told us that some of them adopted the subterfuge of reducing their expenses. For instance, where there were receipts for £30 and the expenses were £10 or £11 they generally made it a little less than £10.  That is only one way.  A much easier way was to increase the receipts.  There was no opportunity for the revenue officers to check the receipts.  They might have an opporttunity of checking the expenses but if the promoters were questioned on it they simply had to increase their receipts.</P>
    <P>I heard this personally from people who went round the country.  The revenue officers found it practically impossible to get the co-operation of the patrons of dances when they went into the ballrooms to inspect the tickets. The people there resented it.  They treated them as they would a bailiff. They gave no co-operation and they generally objected and refused to hand up the portion of the ticket to the inspectors.  I know that the law provided that if people who went into dances, when challenged by the inspectors, did not hand up their tickets they were liable to a fine.</P>
    <P>The poor inspector went into a ballroom and met some jovial fellow who is in the habit of attending dances.  He simply said, &ldquo;You want my tax ticket? Is that it?  No?&rdquo;  Then he would have a search through his pockets.  He would pull out six or seven tickets and would then say that he could not find his tax ticket.  The inspector had to ask for his name and address and he got a name and address.  This tax was practically impossible to collect and I definitely suggest to the Minister <Col N="1159" /> that it was never collected at all in the rural districts where the members were known to the committee and were told, &ldquo;It is all right, Paddy. Give him a tax ticket,&rdquo; and it was done.  It was then handed back and the one tax ticket was used several times.</P>
    <P>It was incidents like these that I believe induced the previous Minister for Finance to abolish this tax altogether.  Now the present Minister in his wisdom is reintroducing this tax.  He has taken into consideration the areas where it was difficult to collect the tax and he has made it legal for those law breakers to continue running dances as against the people who previously always paid.  I believe it is unfair, illegal and unconstitutional to make one person living on one side of the street pay a tax and not somebody else who happens to be a few yards away on the other side of the street and possibly outside the three miles limit of the population of 500. What Deputy Aiken says about this three mile limit is not altogether correct. If you take a range of four miles outside Malahide you will find several ballrooms outside the three mile and inside the four mile range.</P>
    <P>Whatever the Minister's intention, he has not treated the people who previously paid tax fairly.  He has actually put it up to them to try and find some way in the future of avoiding this tax.  I believe the people will adopt every possible legal method to avoid payment.  It is an extraordinary state of affairs to see ballrooms in the Malahide district and places like that that have been built up during the past years&mdash;a lot of money was expended on them in order to conform with the county council regulations&mdash; having to pay tax while a few miles further on you have a great holiday camp at Mosney, the general population of which is not more than 50.  Mosney will be free, but the ordinary people who run ballrooms and dances in the cities and towns will have to pay.  I think that is completely wrong and that the Minister should take cognisance of it.</P>
    <P>I know that clubs which organised dances previously always objected to <Col N="1160" /> paying this tax.  The people going into ballrooms object to being interfered with during the course of their enjoyment. The reimposition of this tax is going to create a great stir as well as an amount of resentment throughout the country.  I fear that people who will be compelled to pay, while they see others getting away with it are going to adopt every possible means that they can, without breaking the law, to protect themselves and their interests.  I am not a person possessed of a trained legal mind like some of the Deputies. I sometimes think that it is not the man who has a legally-trained mind that is always correct on matters of law.  As I understand it, the entertainment tax in the case of cinemas and theatres has not to be paid if 51 per cent. of the entertainment is a stage show.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards this tax, what are we imposing it on?  I suggest that, when a boy and a girl go into a ballroom, they entertain themselves and are not being entertained at all. They are the actual entertainers themselves and, therefore, why should they have to pay this tax?  I think that the only people who should be liable to pay tax are those on the balcony who come there to look on.  As I said at the outset, the amount of tax collected is going to be offset in several ways. First of all, there will be the cost of the collection.  In addition, we have to face the terrible position that will be created by the great number of people who are going to be thrown out of employment.  I can state with very definite knowledge that, if this tax is <Col N="1161" /> reimposed, those engaged in the ballroom business&mdash;the proprietors, promoters and people who run clubs&mdash;feel that in existing circumstances they will not be in a position to pay.  Consequently, it has been brought to my notice, in the case of all the ballrooms in the city and of a number in the country where clubs had made reservations to run dances during the summer and winter, that practically all the dances booked have been cancelled. Proprietors who had engaged bands and orchestras to play in their ballrooms have given them notice.  If this entertainment tax goes on they will be compelled to close their ballrooms on three or four days a week.  That will mean that the members of the bands and numbers of the staff will be out of employment.</P>
      <P>It may be generally thought that it is only the bands and staffs who are going to suffer if the ballrooms are closed.  That is not correct.  The position will be much worse.  As well as the members of the orchestra you have the night staffs, and it has to be remembered that taxi-drivers and caterers derive a good part of their livelihood from those who attend dances.  Generally, the position will be that people earning their livelihood in ballrooms and dance halls will be knocked out of employment and naturally they will go back on the dole.  They will be collecting back some of the revenue that is brought in.  It is to be remembered, too, that a number of the men engaged in orchestras on seven days a week pay a big amount in income-tax.  If they lose their employment and their income there will be no income-tax to get from them.  Instead, they will have to seek unemployment money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to hear from the Minister what prompted him to reimpose this tax.  I feel that he did not do so merely for the purpose of balancing the Budget.  One might assume that he felt that he was going to be short the sum of £110,000 and decided to get it by putting a tax on dances and by increasing the price of the pint.  I do not believe the Minister approached the matter in that way.  I should like to hear from him how he arrived originally <Col N="1162" /> at the figure of £110,000, or how, by going back to the old fees charged in 1946 he arrived at the figure of £75,000.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested in some of the morning papers that the Minister has surrendered to the opposition offered on this dance tax.  I would like to say, as one of those who led a deputation to the Minister in connection with it, that I do not accept that.  I feel that those who approached the Minister do not think that they gained any victory at all.  While we gave the Minister permission on the Second Reading of the Bill to reimpose the tax that was knocked off in 1946, my view is that we did not give him permission to increase it by one-third, which is the figure that he put before us to-day. Consequently, there can be no foundation for the suggestion that he has surrendered at all.  I regret exceedingly that the Chair found it necessary to rule out my amendment because I had gone into this matter carefully and, as a supporter of the inter-Party Government, I did not want to be in the position of opposing the Government.  I believe that the tax will not be collected and consequently I wanted to suggest a way out to the Minister by which he could collect the tax easily without any expense to the revenue.  I suggested to him that instead of making the boy and girl who go to a ballroom pay this tax at the door that the ballroom proprietors should pay.  If that had been done there would not be the general resentment that there is to this tax as far as ballroom proprietors are concerned.  What they would have to pay proportionately would not be very much.  The proprietor of a small ballroom would pay a small licence, but as the ballroom grew the price of admission would also go up and they agree that the annual licence would be greater.</P>
    <P>I regret that you did not find it possible to allow that amendment to stand and I am terribly disappointed that the Minister did not give it more careful consideration.  I state with all the knowledge that I have&mdash;not legal but practical knowledge&mdash;that the Minister would gain more money if he adopted the method I have suggested.  I would like to know how the Minister arrives <Col N="1163" /> at the figure of £75,000, which he said he expected to receive from this tax. I do not believe he will get that amount.  I am not going to guess how he figured it out.</P>
    <P>He is re-enforcing a tax that will be resented.  He will be held responsible, whether correctly or not, for closing down ballrooms all over the country two or three days a week and throwing out of employment numbers of men and women who are engaged in orchestras or on the staffs.  He will also put out of employment people in the catering business, taxi owners and others.  I appeal to the Minister, even at the eleventh hour, to reconsider his decision and withdraw this tax.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister has received all sorts of representations in this matter.  The fact that he is making a certain concession indicates that.  The pity is that he did not withdraw the tax and adopt some alternative. I am sure many Deputies on the Government Benches have also received very strong representations.  I have received them myself from various clubs and organisations which will be hit very severely by this tax, especially in big centres where you have well-equipped ballrooms and where people have gone to considerable expense setting up their establishments and have developed a kind of goodwill with people from all sorts of scattered areas belonging to rural clubs, beagle and sporting clubs of various kinds, as well as cultural clubs&mdash;clubs with a public interest, but which could hardly be regarded as charitable institutions, although they, too, will be hit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These clubs will be driven to hold their dances in small halls where they cannot possibly afford to have the bands they like.  There are certain bands which are very popular and <Col N="1164" /> which charge high fees.  It will be impossible in these circumstances for these organisations to employ them. The tax will definitely hit the particular halls which have been catering for these institutions.  The blow will be very severe and, as Deputy Fitzpatrick said, it will throw a great many people out of employment.</P>
    <P>It will not be easy to mend your hand in another Finance Bill, because once you do this you will possibly bankrupt some of these proprietors. You will certainly scatter the staffs and it will take some years again to build up that particular type of business once you allow it to be destroyed by this tax.  I ask the Minister to reconsider the matter very carefully.  In order to indicate our attitude, we ought to vote against the principle of the tax.  It has been pointed out that it is an expensive and onerous tax.</P>

      <P>I was interested to hear the views of Deputy Fitzpatrick in relation to this tax.  It was welcome to hear from Deputy Fitzpatrick some knowledgeable comment on a tax such as this; it was a welcome change from the speech which preceded it, the speech from Deputy Aiken.  Of course, no tax imposed by this or any other Government will find a ready welcome everywhere in the country.  No tax is popular and all a Minister can do is to try to balance things with remissions on the one hand and perhaps new taxes on the other, in the interests of the community.  In this particular instance, under the Budget statement which preceded this Bill the people did get important remissions in taxation, including a remission in income-tax, and that is one of the things which will add weight to the balance.</P>
      <P>One would imagine from what Deputy Aiken said to-night that some type of catastrophe had overtaken this country because the Minister for Finance proposes to tax dances.  I do not know whether Deputy Aiken dances outside this House, but he frequently dances very queer jigs inside the House.  It will be of interest to the country to know that Deputy Aiken is now a reformed character and that the Minister for Finance of an Administration which for 14 years maintained the tax on dances throughout the country now realises that not only was he wrong but that that particular tax is unjustified.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only say that the entertainment tax such as is contained in this measure was discovered by the Fianna Fáil Administration in 1932 and imposed by them as a new tax.  At that time Deputy Aiken was a member of that Government, but he had very little to say against the tax. For 14 years his Government maintained that tax.  For some eight years, I think, Deputy Aiken had the honour <Col N="1166" /> to be Minister for Finance.  He came into the Dáil each year making provision for this particular tax, not allowing his mind to dwell upon the injustice it might be doing to the dancers and the people generally in the country. Ultimately, he removed the tax.  He did not remove it because he suddenly discovered after 14 years that it was an unjust tax.  He removed it because he came to the conclusion that it was difficult to collect.  In my recollection, he himself stated that it was difficult to collect because, in the particular instances mentioned by Deputy Fitzpatrick, dances held in rural areas could not be properly supervised and the trouble of collecting the tax made it quite impracticable.  That particular difficulty is recognised by the present Minister and, therefore, the particular areas affected by it are excluded from the scope of this Bill.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Fitzpatrick that from the theoretical point of view there does appear to be an apparent argument against that exemption because those who did not pay this tax in the past are now excluded from liability under the law.  That may be because the Minister merely recognises facts, but I prefer to think that it is done in pursuance of the policy of this Administration to improve conditions for people in the rural areas and to attract them into remaining in the rural areas.  I am sure most Deputies here appreciate that Deputy Aiken's opposition to this particular tax is merely just another exhibition of Fianna Fáil's determination to play any little game that may find any little support for them anywhere in the country. I am quite certain that the people recognise that this is a fair tax balanced against the good that has been done by the remission of income-tax where the smaller income groups are concerned and by the provision of increased social services for the people generally.</P>

      <P>I am not concerned in this connection as to whether or not it is feasible or impracticable to collect this tax.  I am not concerned with Deputy O'Higgins' remarks as to whether or not we are playing a game. I am concerned with the fact that since <Col N="1167" /> this tax was remitted in 1946 quite a number of ballrooms and dance halls have started in this city.  The proprietors of them have put money into the business and ploughed the profits back into it.  Deputy Fitzpatrick, who is a ballroom proprietor himself, has made a very sensible and sound case in my opinion; I hope that the Minister, as Deputy Fitzpatrick said, will realise even at the last moment that he has done so.  Chiefly I am concerned with the fact that, though the Minister has met the dance hall proprietors, I do not think he has met the Irish Federation of Musicians. That body asked the Minister to meet them.</P>

      <P>The Minister says he has not seen the letter and, therefore, he does not know the facts.  Attached to that letter was a letter from the dance hall proprietors informing the federation that they would have, as Deputy Fitzpatrick said, to close their establishments on certain days during the week.  I met a deputation from the Irish Federation of Musicians and, therefore, I am speaking of facts. They informed me that this will mean the disemployment of some hundreds of musicians and other personnel.  The Minister has remitted another tax.  He has reduced the tax on wine.  He will create more lounge bars.  His <Col N="1168" /> reason for remitting that tax was that the imposition of the tax created unemployment. He will now, under this Bill, impose a new tax to collect a miserable £75,000.  That will not be the nett collection despite what he says about 2 per cent.  He is putting on this tax on dancing with the certainty of creating unemployment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCann</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman says &ldquo;nonsense&rdquo;.  To my mind every interjection of Deputy Sweetman's is either irrelevant or nonsensical.  Deputy Fitzpatrick has told us that it is not nonsense and he is qualified to know whether it is or not.  Last night I met three of the largest ballroom proprietors. One assured me that out of a staff of 20, he would have to let ten go; another said that he would have to let 12 go; and the third said that he would have to let 14 go.  The Irish Federation of Musicians assure me that the tax will affect some hundreds of their members, either full-time or part-time. I appeal to the Minister to listen to reason.  In my opinion, the only thing Deputy Fitzpatrick did not say about this tax was that it is an iniquitous tax.  I think it is a miserable tax.  The Minister would serve a <Col N="1169" /> better purpose if he reimposed the duty on wine and remitted the tax on dances.  It is all very well for his supporters who troop in here behind him and who shout &ldquo;nonsense&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what actuated the Minister into reimposing this tax.  Some years ago there was quite a lot of propaganda about dancing in the country and about the danger of the commercial dance hall.  We had a considerable amount of propaganda of that kind which resulted in the passing of legislation requiring the licensing of dance halls.  I am just wondering if there is any similar purpose behind the reimposition of the duty. The suggestion has been made&mdash;I have heard it myself&mdash;that dancing is evil, that it should be condemned, that it is bad for the community.  I have heard that said but in the part of the country from which I come, there was always dancing, and 35 years ago there was more dancing than there is now.  It did not seem to do the people any harm then and I do not subscribe to the views of those who say that there is any evil whatsoever in dancing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have already stated on the Budget debate, I am worried about the possibility of this tax resulting in unemployment. If the tax will result in <Col N="1170" /> musicians and staffs becoming disemployed, and in unemployment for other people connected with the dancing business, I think the collection of £75,000&mdash;even if that amount is collected&mdash;would not be justified at all.  I think that the proprietors of ballrooms have put a very reasonable proposition to the Minister as an alternative, that is, that he should tax ballrooms rather than the dancers who go there to dance.  Probably if the Minister were to give some consideration to that proposal, he would find that he would get the same amount of money as he proposes now to collect and he would collect it in a much easier way. If he were to impose a tax, say, on the basis of the legal capacity of the hall, a hall with a legal capacity of 500 would pay £500 a year&mdash;that is, a £1 per person.  It would bring in a considerable revenue.  From a dance hall in Dublin with the capacity of 500, it would mean £500 a year or, roughly, £10 a week.  That is a burden that can be carried, apparently, by these dance halls, but if the proposed tax is imposed it will be a more severe burden on the business.  If the Minister wants to consider that proposition, he might be able to make it very convenient for the proprietors of these halls to pay their tax by monthly instalments in advance.  There is a serious objection from many parts of the House to taxation on the prices of admission per head, and the other proposal seems the more reasonable one.</P>
    <P>Whatever the result of this discussion may be, and whether there is a vote on the matter or not, I should like strongly to support Deputy Fitzpatrick in recommending to the Minister that he might reconsider this matter in connection with the alternative proposals that have been put before him.  Dancing in the cities and towns has become a business, just like any commercial venture, and on that business quite a considerable number of people depend for a livelihood.  I think this is not the time for doing anything that may disturb people in their employment.  It is certainly not a time for creating conditions that may lead to unemployment. I like to see young people dancing and enjoying themselves.  I think they are much better occupied in dancing than <Col N="1171" /> in spending their spare time in some other ways.</P>
    <P>I cannot do very much more than to renew the appeal I made to the Minister when the Budget was under discussion to reconsider this whole matter. If his idea is to get £75,000 this year, I think he can get it in a very much easier and cheaper way than by the imposition of this tax.  The Minister has said that the cost of the collection of the dance tax is 2 per cent.  Two per cent. would mean that the cost of collecting £75,000 would be £1,500.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should have corrected that statement long ago.  It will bring in £65,000 only and there is a collection cost of £1,300 on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know. There are some of these calculations&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is one of these estimates that it is very hard to stand over because it means a couple of minutes of somebody's time and a couple of hours of somebody else's time.  Certain people will be occupied even in writing up the data for answering Parliamentary Questions arising out of the tax.  It is very hard to know what it will cost.  I do think myself it would cost more than 2 per cent. because, obviously, there must be inspectors if the tax is to be enforced.  Those inspectors must go round.  They have got to pay for their admission to dance halls and to pay for a car to take them there.  They will have certain incidental expenses with regard to the journey and, if all the items were totalled up, it would be surprising if the sum total of the cost of collection were not more than £100 a month. However, that is not the most important part of it.  If it is a good tax and if it costs only 2 per cent. to collect it, that is not bad but the most objectionable feature of the tax is that it will result, and apparently has resulted, in threats to cancel bookings.  For some reason or other I understand that the dancing business is not prospering at the moment.  I understand that dance <Col N="1172" /> halls, which used to have an average of 350 or 400 dancers are lucky now to have an average of 100, so that the business is not hitting the high spots at the moment.  If that is so, and if all the interests concerned believe that the imposition of this tax will further depress the business and will lead to unemployment, I think there is a strong case to be made to the Minister for reconsideration of the tax.</P>
      <P>I would like to say this in conclusion: we are endeavouring and I am endeavouring to put forward to the Minister reasonable suggestions with regard to this tax and I think we would be helped by contributions from all sides of the House that would have that for their objective.  I think that the contribution by Deputy Aiken here this evening did not help in any way and particularly when Deputy Aiken, as he has done on other occasions in this House, went back to the dead to make references to people who are dead in a slighting way to their relatives here in this House.  I think that does not help the case here at all.  I think it is a low form of political propaganda and I think Deputy Aiken should be ashamed of himself.  The references which Deputy Aiken made to the late Kevin O'Higgins were references he has no right to make.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that the Minister as well as every other member of this House who is anxious to discuss this matter on its merits will agree that Deputy Fitzpatrick presented his alternative proposal in a very fair and convincing manner.  I am not saying that <Col N="1175" /> he has done that because he has a knowledge of those associated with the ownership of ballrooms.  I think from my knowledge of the views of my constituents that Deputy Fitzpatrick has presented the viewpoint of the man in the street on this matter, and I hope for that reason that his alternative proposal will receive the careful consideration of the Minister which it deserves. Dancing is a popular pastime in my constituency and the overwhelming majority of dancehalls or ballrooms are in the possession of commercial dancehall or ballroom owners.  Some of the best of them are owned by local authorities and others are under the control of the parish priest or the Catholic Young Men's Society and bodies of that kind.  In every one of these cases, no matter how small the area may be whether it is a rural area parish hall or a commercial ballroom in an urban area or even a county courthouse or town hall owned by a local authority, the Minister will on inquiry be able to satisfy himself that a very high charge is always made to the promoters of dances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know of no dance hall in my constituency where the charge is lower than £3 3s.  It may be £5 5s. for a parish hall in a rural area and it goes as high as £10, £15 and in some cases £20 for a commercial ballroom in an urban area.  These people should be liable in the ordinary course of events to a higher rate of taxation than the nominal stamp duty which they have to pay whether the hall is situated in a rural or an urban area.  Deputy Fitzpatrick suggested as an alternative that a higher stamp duty tax&mdash;if that is the correct way to put it&mdash;should be imposed on the owner with a lower cost of collection and that would bring in the revenue the Minister and his advisers are looking for.  I doubt if the Minister personally is responsible for the introduction of this tax, but I have no doubt whatever&mdash;and I had better be quite frank about it, though if there is a division on this, I feel in honour bound to vote with the Government side&mdash;that this will be an extremely unpopular, irritating and annoying kind of tax.  It is going to be annoying, not to the ballroom <Col N="1176" /> owner, whether he be commercial or local authority, but to the dancers. That was the real reason, I believe, why the Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance, under the strong representations of every Fianna Fáil Cumann in the country, removed that tax in 1946. They knew it was a popular thing to do and I suppose they were responding in the ordinary democratic way to the almost unanimous demand of their own members throughout the country. This reimposition will cause irritation and annoyance, not to the ballroom owners but to the dancers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick has a very intimate knowledge of the conditions prevailing in the ballrooms in the cities and towns, and I have a little knowledge of what goes on in the country. The Minister surprised me when he stated the cost of collection does not amount to more than 2 per cent. of the total tax revenue.  It is a fact that the supervision of the dances carried out in rural and urban areas is done by the local customs and excise officer, who has other duties to perform, and I doubt if any part of his salary is taken into the 2 per cent. cost which is being given by the Minister as approximately the cost of collection. Is it not a fact that the majority of dances held in rural or urban areas are held on Sundays and, if that is so, is it not a fact that the customs officer must get extra pay for the Sunday duty, over and above the ordinary salary?  If he has to travel, as he must in every case, to dances held in his area, he has to hire&mdash;and I know he does&mdash;a local taxi.  He has other expenses to incur.  The amount he pays for admission to the dance hall is trivial, but I suspect he goes in and has a &ldquo;quick one&rdquo;, if it is inside the licensing hours, with friends of his before the dance.  There is a certain amount of that going on.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, the average dances are not confined to the boys and girls of the rising generation.  The middle-aged people go to the dances held in parish halls, and particularly to those organised by political clubs and other bodies for charitable purposes.  For instance, the trader in the town, whether he is a good dancer or not, <Col N="1177" /> feels himself under a moral obligation to go to the dance held for a political or charitable purpose.  He advertises his existence and his business when he goes there, and if one trader goes his next-door neighbour is expected to go. If there are two publicans in the village and one goes and the other does not, the person who does not go is better known to the people who organise the dance than the one who does.  I know, from my limited experience, that the visit of the customs officer to a dance hall when a dance is on, and his usual inquiries, which he is bound to make amongst the dancers, for the production of tax tickets, cause irritation and annoyance which has a reaction.</P>
    <P>I admit that my knowledge is very limited compared to that of Deputy Fitzpatrick, but I assure the Minister that the organisers or promoters of dances for every and any purpose, in cities and in urban and rural areas, would far prefer to pay a higher fee to the owner of the dance hall than go to the trouble, annoyance and expense caused by the reimposition of this tax. Is it fair, I ask the Minister, that the owners of these dance halls, whether they be in city, in town or in village, should get away with this nominal stamp duty fee of £1 or thereabouts? Is it fair that Butlin's, who have distinguished directors, some of them including members of this Oireachtas, should get away with the same licensing fee as is paid by the owner of a parish hall in my constituency, when the people who go into Butlin's Camp must pay a minimum of £9 9s. 0d. a week for their maintenance there?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do suggest seriously to the Minister that it has a very definite bearing on the case.  The people who own Butlin's Holiday Village&mdash;I am sorry I called it a camp; I was pulled up last week, not inside the House but outside, for calling it that&mdash;are a commercial concern and should be in a better position, by way of their huge income, to pay a higher licensing fee than the owner of a village hall which is used for dancing purposes.  I appeal to the Minister to reconsider, if possible, <Col N="1178" /> this whole business, for the very good and convincing reasons given by Deputy Fitzpatrick.  If he does so, he will meet the reasonable wishes of the dancers and of the ordinary people of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>One must be struck by the argument put forward by Deputies Fitzpatrick and McCann in this instance, as both of them have got more than hearsay or secondhand knowledge of what they are talking about.  Arising out of this, there is a counter suggestion, which has been supported by other Deputies, of a <i>pro rata</i> fee on the dance hall proprietor.  That would be preferable in many ways to the type of tax proposed here.  The only question I can see arising from that suggestion is that it would cover only established routine dance halls.  I am still somewhat in the dark as to how logically to follow such a proposal in respect of casual functions.  Some club or body whose activities do not normally include dances may want an occasional licence for an occasional dance during the year.  That would be a specific problem to be dealt with in this counter-proposal by the Deputies in question.</P>
      <P>Moving aside from that, on the whole question of this section, I think we had better get it into perspective in regard to the whole Bill.  We are on the section specifically, but it can be looked at only in relation to the whole Bill, which is a Bill to implement the Budget.  On the Financial Statement for 1949 and the explanatory tables connected with it, both officially published documents, the first thing is that the Minister budgeted for a surplus of £35,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy cannot deal with the whole Budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not.  This £35,000 is immediately related in this way.  On this section, the Minister has brought in an amendment which absorbs practically £35,000, if the calculation which he gave is correct; so that the effect of the amendment, plus the section before us now, is to absorb that surplus from the Budget.  That leaves the position that the Minister cannot forego this section and maintain his <Col N="1179" /> Budget figure, without making some other adjustment.  That should be kept in mind when discussing the section. He has to face a certain expenditure and he has to provide the revenue for it.  He has already foregone now, on the amendment to this, a sum equivalent to his nominal surplus.  I recognise that it is a nominal surplus and I realise the elasticity of that in the Statement, but nevertheless, formally it is gone.  He is in the position now that he cannot reject this section without making some complementary adjustment.</P>
      <P>From a purely financial point of view, what is the case for the section? The necessity for it is brought about by the fact that the Minister has undoubtedly given releases in certain respects in regard to taxation&mdash;a matter of about £7,000,000, he claims, in reliefs in certain directions.  But it is also indisputably true on these figures that he must seek to collect in the coming year nearly £8,000,000 more than any Minister for Finance who went before him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has gone wide of the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Chair will bear with me, it will see that my remarks are very definitely related to the section.  If I am trying to put a case logically, I must be allowed to put my premises before I put my conclusion. We are dealing with a shifting of the incidence of taxation, coupled with an all-round increase in taxation, and the question is fundamentally whether, in view of the fact that the Minister must find more than any of his predecessors had to find and in view of the fact that he has shifted the incidence of taxation otherwise, this particular shifting of the incidence is a good thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first objection is, as has been stated, that this is not an economic tax to collect.  The Minister has given a figure of 2 per cent.  Like other Deputies, without having any specific information, I should be inclined to question that.  Supposing the tax had to stand on its own, it would be a conservative estimate to say that ten <Col N="1180" /> revenue officers at least would be required and these ten officers would be paid at least £500 per year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Full time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>That would represent £5,000 &mdash; well over the 2 per cent. The Minister is quite correct in saying full time, but, as against the hypothetical ten I suggest, on the part-time basis, there would be very much more and an estimation of the time that a part-time officer devotes to any particular matter is largely a question of the manner in which you care to apportion it, and, as Deputy Davin pointed out, there are factors which would lead one to expect that this would be a fairly expensive tax for the State to collect and one which the Minister's predecessors thought was relatively expensive to collect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Why, then, go on with the mistake?  Originally what was said was that it was a dangerous and difficult tax to collect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>A difficult tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The emphasis was on the danger in the country areas and we are cutting that out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a difficult tax to collect and off-hand I should imagine it was relatively, compared with certain others, an expensive tax to collect.  I will give the Minister his 2 per cent., however, and simply make this comment, that, when the costs of administration are going up &mdash; and these costs are going up under the Minister's administration &mdash; there will be an extra 2 per cent. in respect of this tax on <Col N="1181" /> that cost.  This tax represents now a further increase in the cost of administration, whereas I think that, in the case of other taxes, it would be possible to achieve the revenue without a corresponding increase in that cost.  Therefore, the objection straightway is: is this a good tax to collect, admitting that the Minister would have to do it to maintain his Budget figures?  It is going to involve some administrative costs.  It is not a sufficiently general picture of the situation merely to relate that to a percentage of the tax collected &mdash; over all, it is an actual increase in the cost of administration.</P>
      <P>We could discuss this matter a little more tightly if the Minister could give us some figures with regard to other taxes and their collection, but if we take that and couple it with the argument of Deputy Fitzpatrick, namely, that it is a difficult tax to collect, a tax which, in its nature, lends itself to evasion, a tax which is a temptation to evasion, the Minister has either to organise a relatively tight system which will mean expense or take the risk of foregoing revenue by being content with a more or less average collection of the tax, with the abuses which will follow.  The worst feature of these matters is that some people get away with something and others do not, and any tax which brings about a situation like that is fundamentally objectionable.</P>
      <P>That is the second argument and it is advanced by Deputy Fitzpatrick, who is in a position to know.  The other argument is the argument mentioned by Deputy Davin and Deputy Fitzpatrick and particularly by Deputy McCann &mdash; its possible impact on employment. All these things considered, it seems to me that this is a tax which is really not worth the imposing from the State point of view, having regard to the drawbacks involved.  I am not quite sure that the counter-proposal put forward by other Deputies meets the situation.  It may, provided the trimmings, and one in particular which I have mentioned, are captured within the scheme.  The same money could be obtained otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take it that the figure which the Minister has finally decided on as his <Col N="1182" /> estimate of the yield is £65,000.  The original figure was £110,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the current year, £110,000.  I now have a new estimate of £65,000, as a result of my own amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister not say a reduction of £35,000?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was wrong&mdash; £65,000 and £110,000 are the two figures in the current year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>That does a little more than absorb the Minister's surplus on his Budget statement.  However, a surplus estimate is somewhat elastic and that would merely be a point on figures, without much substance. He estimates for £65,000.  Perhaps the Minister could tell us how that estimate is arrived at.  Is provision made in it for the possible consequences of evasion and so forth or is it based purely on the assumption that the returns will be the same as in the past two years?  I think it was Deputy Fitzpatrick who suggested that the Minister would not collect what he says he will collect from this tax.  Personally, I do not propose to express an opinion, because much would depend on the basis upon which the Minister made his estimate as to the sum that would come in, but perhaps he could tell us whether his estimate makes allowance for such unavoidable losses or extra expenses in ensuring that there is no evasion, or whether it is merely a figure based on the returns of the past two years, which must be adjusted in the way Deputy Fitzpatrick suggests.  By and large the section simply comes into the picture as one of the numerous ways that the Minister seeks to make up what he has given away in other directions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fundamentally my objection to it is that it is a bad way to get the money which, for the purpose of this argument anyway.  I will admit the Minister requires.  I am not quite clear as to how one is going to be affected in regard to location.  The Minister undoubtedly anticipated that there would be a great clamour in regard to the little dance halls and that he would hear again the arguments pressed on <Col N="1183" /> him with regard to the depopulation of the countryside.  I take it this three-mile limit which is apparently to be introduced now is the Minister's effort to meet this case, but the 500-centre of population is not a big one and the point is how is that 500 defined.</P>
    <P>I do not know if I am entitled to raise Section 13 and take it with this section.</P>

      <P>It is undesirable in general terms.  Simplicity in revenue law was as desirable as in anything else.  The tax provision of this section which takes up so much space is an indication that it is not as desirable a type of provision as others.  I put it that it is not the best type of revenue legislation that the Minister could adopt to get the money which, for the purpose of this argument, I admit he requires and for that reason, in addition to the cogent reasons submitted by other Deputies, I think that this section should not be accepted by the House.</P>

      <P>I certainly do not intend to follow the lines of Deputy Aiken in this debate.  I think it is only fair that if the Minister is to be criticised in relation to this section that Deputies opposing him must at least put up some constructive suggestions to him.  It was very noticeable in the course of this discussion so far that anything in the nature of constructive suggestion came from this side of the House and not from the Opposition. I listened to the criticisms of Deputy Aiken and Deputy Alderman McCann and it was only after Deputy Fitzpatrick <Col N="1184" /> spoke that other Deputies on that side of the House decided that perhaps there was some argument which could be put up to the Minister other than abuse and what can only be described as utter nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair ruled earlier that anybody who interrupts should be given a short reply and I propose to reply to the interruption of Deputy Butler by ignoring it.</P>
      <P>I think several Deputies have already pointed out that this tax was in existence for 14 years when the Deputies opposite were on this side of the House.  It took them 14 years to decide the tax was not worth collecting. Deputy Aiken had said that the tax was difficult and dangerous to collect.  People resented it and it would have to go.  Deputy Aiken at that time during that discussion said that he had not got an accurate estimate of the cost of collection.  I wonder if Deputy Alderman McCann was as concerned then as he seemed to be now about the question of unemployment that would result and the hardships that would ensue to proprietors of ballrooms because of the reimposition of this tax.  One thing that should interest him would be the views expressed by Deputy Aiken regarding ballroom proprietors during the discussion of the section in the 1946 Bill which removed the tax.  I think Deputy Fitzpatrick would also be interested in Volume 101, column 1690, Deputy Aiken who was then Minister for Finance and had undoubtedly been advised by Deputy McCann with regard to the position is reported as saying:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;As far as the commercial dance halls are concerned, I hope they will not benefit a single penny.  I hope, as a result of the taking off the expense of managing their halls in such a way as to comply with the Revenue requirements, that, when they are free, they may not only reduce the price of admission by the appropriate amount of tax taken off <Col N="1185" /> but by something over and above that which represents their cost in collecting for the Revenue Commissioners these particular duties.  If the people of the country who attend ordinary commercial dance halls have any wit they are not going to give, when the remission of this tax comes into operation, the price they have been giving heretofore.  I think it would be most unfair if these commercial dance halls were to charge such prices.  But let that be between the patrons of the commercial dance halls and the proprietors. The owners of commercial dance halls should reduce the price of admission by about 20 per cent in the lower ranges.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Aiken made it quite clear when he was removing the tax in 1946 that he had no interest at all in the proprietors of the commercial dance halls, that he was not giving any consideration at all to any extra employment that might be given by this step.  He went even further than that and said that, as far as he was concerned, he did not want to see an extra penny piece going into the pockets of any dance hall proprietor, that he wanted all of the amount remitted in taxation to be passed on to the patrons.</P>
    <P>I would recommend to Deputy Alderman McCann that he might study that speech of his leader in finance before he talks about resulting unemployment. I would like if some of the Deputies who know more about this than I do, or if the Minister, when replying, would state whether or not the advice given by Deputy Aiken on that occasion was taken.  I would be very interested to know, and I think the House is entitled to know, if in fact the remission of the tax on commercial dance halls was passed on to the patrons of those halls.  I would like to know if any Deputy can name four establishments in this city or elsewhere in the country that reduced their prices of admission when the tax was taken off.</P>

      <P>I do not care on whom it is hard.  At any rate, people <Col N="1186" /> on this side of the House are lucky enough to be free to talk their minds out openly and honestly.  We are not, as Deputy McCann complained, trooping in a regiment behind anyone when we are speaking on this matter. Deputy Fitzpatrick is entitled to express his views just as I am entitled to express mine.  But it would be of some interest to me and to other Deputies here to know what views Deputy Butler was expressing from 1932 to 1946 when this tax was in operation. I am willing to place a wager, big or small, with any Deputy, that the brave Deputy Butler bravely kept his mouth very tightly closed.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cowan advocated support for Deputy Fitzpatrick's proposition but, as I say, before a Deputy can make up his mind as to whether or not that suggestion would be adequate to replace the funds which the Minister hopes to get out of the present tax, it would be necessary to get some kind of concrete estimate as to what that particular type of tax &mdash;the tax on the licence or the tax on the ballroom &mdash; would bring in.  It would also be necessary to take into consideration the equitable distribution of that tax.  Might we not have an outcry from the people who would have to pay a far greater share in proportion to the number of dances they run than the people in the bigger ballrooms who run dances nightly during the season?</P>
      <P>Deputy Cowan also suggested that at the moment dance halls were doing badly, that there was some kind of depression in dancing.  I do not know. Deputies more closely connected with the dance hall business may be able to say whether or not that is so but, if that is so, it would seem to me that it is an argument against the suggestion put forward by Deputy Fitzpatrick and supported by Deputy Cowan.</P>

      <P>The argument put forward by both Deputies O'Higgins's <Col N="1189" /> was that Fianna Fáil kept this tax on for 14 years and that Deputy Aiken was Minister for Finance for eight of those years.  The fact that Deputy Aiken, after eight years' experience as Minister for Finance, found that it was a good thing to do away with the tax is an argument for the abolition of the tax.  He must have had tremendous experience as to the difficulty in collecting it.  I know, from a small bit of experience, that there is a temptation to deceive in relation to this tax.</P>
      <P>If a body runs a dance for charitable or benevolent purposes and applies for exemption they must first of all lodge a deposit with the Revenue Commissioners. They will get a notice to hang up in the hall in which the dance will be held.  There will be no visit by any inspector except that one may come to see that the notice is hung up.  There will be no check on the takings but the people who run that dance for charitable or benevolent purposes will have to fill in a form giving particulars of their expenses and their receipts.  If they are unable to prove that their expenses are less than 30 per cent.  Of the takings they will not be granted exemption.  All that involves a good deal of trouble on the part of those running the dance and on the part of the Revenue Commissioners.  The applicants must give details of their expenses &mdash; band, advertisements, and so forth &mdash; in their statement and the accounts must be examined carefully As Deputy Fitzpatrick has said, if people who run these charitable dances &mdash;and you meet a lot of people who do not think it is any crime&mdash;think they will not be granted exemption the obvious and the simplest thing to do is to increase in the statement the amount of the receipts so as to show that their expenses were less than 30 per cent. of the receipts.  I think that is, as Deputy Aiken pointed out, a temptation to deceive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been requested by numerous organisations in the City of Cork to protest strongly against this tax.  We have two principal dance halls in the City of Cork&mdash;one the property of the Cork Corporation and the other the property of a private individual.  In the City Hall in Cork we have one of the finest ballrooms in the country. <Col N="1190" /> Every Sunday night of the year that hall is used by one or other of the different charitable organisations, but no organisation, as far as I know, will get the hall from the city manager for two Sunday nights because, after all, it is only fair that everyone should get his turn.  Every hurling club and football club and coursing club&mdash;and political organisations as well&mdash;looks upon that hall as a source of revenue to enable them to balance their budgets for the year.  They can sometimes make up to £50 at a Sunday night céilidhe.  Religious bodies use the hall too.  The Legion of Mary and so forth, run céilidhes there on Sunday nights.  All these different people feel indignant about this tax and&mdash;I am not making any bones about it&mdash;they were indignant too when Fianna Fáil imposed it.  The hall run by the commercial individual is let also, to organisations who run dances.  By the way, the dances in the city hall generally last from 8 p.m. to 11 p.m. while the private individual lets his hall for later hours.</P>
    <P>I was asked last night by a committee in charge of the Cork City regatta to bring this matter to the attention of the Minister.  They look upon it as one of their strongest ways of getting funds to meet the expenses of the regatta, which are very heavy.</P>

Lehane knows some of them&mdash;feel that this tax would mean a terrible loss to them.  I would appeal to the Minister to reconsider this matter.  I do not think he will gain as much as he thinks he will.  He certainly will lose a lot of favour&mdash; whether that would be to our advantage or not is another matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to emphasise a few of the points made by Deputy Fitzpatrick and to ask the Minister to give favourable consideration to some of the suggestions he has made.  I, too, have been on committees which ran dances.  It is a terrible worry to some of the young people on committees that they may lose on the dance. Naturally they hope to be able to make a success of it and thereby earn £20 or £25 for whatever charitable institution they are running it.  The first question a dancer will ask is about the size of the hall and the number of people in the band.  If the band is a small band and the hall is fairly large the dancer will not patronise the dance.  Dancers want a band sufficiently good for the music to be heard from one end of the hall to the other.  It has been suggested that some of the dance hall proprietors will start to curtail their expenses and that some of them have done so already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a lot of exaggeration in this House about the size of bands. <Col N="1192" /> I was rather amazed when one Deputy spoke about 20 men in a band.  I do not know of any hall in Ireland that has a dance band of 20 members playing at any ordinary dance.  The average-sized band in Dublin City in the biggest and best halls we have comprises 12 or 14 members.  If that 12 or 14 is reduced by two or three it means that two or three young men or women will lose the fee which they get for attendance.  I implore the Minister to have regard to that possibility.  The proprietors of halls do not always run the band.  The band is engaged.  One of the members of the band does the organising, and the first thing he will consider is whether he should have a band of six or eight or ten.  If you want to make a success of a dance and hope to get £25 out of it for any particular organisation, a band of less than eight or ten is really not worth while because the people will not go to the dance.  The first thing a person has to ask himself is how much he will have to take in to clear expenses.  Before the hall is opened a calculation is made, and an organiser will tell you that he must have an attendance of at least 200 to pay expenses.  If they get an attendance of 220 they know that they will cover their expenses.  If they can get an attendance of 320, the extra 100 will mean a profit.  The expenses of the band, however, are always there.  If they reduce the number in the band for the purpose of bringing down the expenses, the dance will not be a success.  They are generally at their wits' end to know what to do.  A good organiser or speculator will have a full band of ten.  Dancers know which are the good bands.  No matter what happens, I ask the Minister to see that the money earned by the individuals in these dance bands will not be reduced.</P>
    <P>I wonder would it be possible not to impose any tax on the first 200 of the attendance at any dance.  In that way organisers would at least be guaranteed their expenses.  Some means could then be devised by which a reasonable tax would be paid on the remainder. That would satisfy organisers that they will not lose money.  I assure the House that 50 per cent. of the dances in the City of Dublin are run for <Col N="1193" /> charity purposes and a profit of £20 per night is calculated on.  They must have at least 200 people at an admission fee of 3/- or 3/6 before they can make one penny profit.  I put it to the Minister that he ought to consider Deputy Fitzpatrick's point and devise some means by which no tax will have to be paid on the first 200 and after that impose a tax which will bring in the revenue required.</P>

      <P>I have been associated with charitable organisations for over 30 years.  The charitable organisations will be very hard hit by this tax. Of course the Minister does not mind hitting these people hard and even under the belt.  When dances are being held for charitable organisations money will have to be lodged with the Revenue Commissioners or a certain number of tickets purchased.  If the dance is a failure, further representations have to be made to the commissioners. Then on the night of the dance an inspector is sent out.  The committee running the dance are not running it for themselves, but for the benefit of people who are not in a position to help themselves.  When they put a person on the door to collect the money, they will be afraid that he will fail to issue a ticket to some person entering the hall.  I have had experience of people, through some oversight, failing to do something like that. The result is that the inspector questions people in the hall.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is anxious to persecute the people of rural Ireland and the <Col N="1195" /> clubs I am speaking of.  Football clubs, tennis clubs, dramatic societies, welfare societies, Red Cross branches and the St. Vincent de Paul Society which organise functions of this kind will have this persecution reimposed on them which Deputy Aiken, in his wisdom, removed from them when he realised what he was doing.  He gave an air of freedom to all the clubs in the country.  That air of freedom is to be taken away from them again.  There is also another section dealing with another rural sport&mdash;the increased charge for a gun licence.</P>
    <P>All these things, as far as I can see, only reimpose persecution on the various clubs' committees that are running functions in this country.  The Minister, in stating that certain areas where the population is only 500 will not have to pay tax, is trying to hoodwink the people.  I am telling the Minister that in County Dublin I do not know of an area that will not come within that three mile limit.  Everybody associated with any club has a great regard for the previous Minister for Finance for a very sensible act.  I want to know what is prompting the present Minister to reimpose a tax that is going to persecute every club in the country.</P>
    <P>At the moment I can definitely tell the Minister that dances are not paying. The dance-hall proprietors have made their own case in their own way. As members of clubs, we have to pay our fee for the hiring of halls, pay high expenses for a band, pay performing rights and so on.  The result is that clubs to-day are working for a band and a hall and now, on top of that, the Minister says that you are not going to have any fun in rural Ireland except you pay through the nose for it.</P>

Now they are going to be back in the position where, if their expenses are over 30 per cent. of their takings on the door, they are going to have to surrender the whole thing; not to speak of carnivals being run for parochial purposes, to help the building of schools, the reconditioning of churches and the building of parish halls.  Every football club, debating society and so forth, that was responsible for brightening the life of rural Ireland is going to be persecuted.  I look upon it as sheer persecution.  If a person pays his fee into a dance hall he is persecuted by the inspector saying: &ldquo;Can you show me your ticket?&rdquo; Many a patron, a boy or girl, may possibly have dropped their ticket. Their name is taken and they are asked: &ldquo;Why did you not get the ticket at the door?&rdquo; We have been told many times in this House how anxious the Government are to brighten the lives of the people of rural Ireland and here is an example of it.  When Deputy Aiken, as Minister for Finance, in his wisdom tried to give them an air of freedom and encourage them to brighten their lives in the country and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I know.  Another point that Deputy McCann has made here and which I definitely support, is that the reimposition of this tax is going to cause unemployment.  I have no doubt it will, judging by the statement made by Deputy Fitzpatrick. That is another point that the Minister should consider.  If, as a result of the reimposition of this tax, dance musicians, people who are associated with the running of dance halls and employed by dance hall proprietors, are going to lose their employment and if the Minister is concerned about them he should seriously consider doing something to alleviate any further <Col N="1197" /> distress because we have enough unemployed already.</P>
      <P>Parochial halls have cost a lot of money and have possibly been built by clubs.  Perhaps the clubs have overdrawn at the bank in order to carry on.  The same applies to individuals who have put up a dance hall and as Deputy McCann says, there has been a good deal of building of dance halls since the tax was taken off by Deputy Aiken as Minister for Finance.  Now we are going to have the position again where that very much needed enjoyment in the urban towns and in rural Ireland is going to be killed. People are not going to build these halls because they will find after paying for everything that the clubs are not going to hire the halls.  If the clubs are not going to hire the halls, there is going to be unemployment. The Minister will go down in history as the Minister for Finance, better known as the kill-joy Minister.</P>

      <P>I realise, as everyone here does, that a tax is never a popular thing, no matter what it is or how necessary it is.  We all understand that something must be done in order to run the country.  We are all anxious to get everything as cheaply as we can; at the same time, I must say that I regret the Minister has found it necessary to think of this increase in taxation so far as dancing is concerned.  I realise, as many others do, that it is the one thing which is a very popular and good pastime within reason, in the country. It is all very well to talk about what is happening in bigger places.  In the country it is just the one thing that most people look forward to on Sunday nights, say.  In my opinion, it would be a splendid thing if the Minister could find some other method to collect this required amount of money.  I believe that there is consternation amongst the various proprietors of the various dance halls throughout the country.  No doubt, these people have to live just as any other person in business.  I had conversations with several of them during the week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a matter of fact I do not find myself quite in agreement with the <Col N="1198" /> Minister on this particular matter.  I am more in favour of the proposal that was made by Deputy Fitzpatrick that, instead of having a ticket tax the capacity of the dance halls should be taxed. If that were done a certain amount of money would be collected, perhaps not as much as by the ticket tax.  It might, say, come within £20,000 of the required amount.  Deputy Fitzpatrick, I understand, has gone into this matter very carefully.  Several other proprietors of dance halls have come to me and have explained to me that that would be a far better method than the ticket tax, apart altogether from the fact that it would cause less worry to the proprietors and to the general public. The capacity of the halls could be easily ascertained and so it is urged that that would be an easy method of collecting the money required.</P>
    <P>There is another point which is a serious one.  The amount that it will cost to collect the ticket tax if the scheme which the Minister has in mind is gone on with.  There has been so much said on that that there is no need for me to stress it further.  There will be quite a lot of money spent on the inspectors.  I, for one, do not like the idea of inspectors interrupting people when they have paid to engage in a legitimate pastime.  I think that the Minister's scheme could be got over by the method suggested by Deputy Fitzpatrick. The Minister, I know, is very considerate.  He does not want to stand between people enjoying themselves. On the contrary, since he became Minister he has given back quite a lot of things to the people.  He was faced with a terrible outlook at that time.  There was a tax on almost everything, yet he was able to give back many things to the people which were regarded as luxuries by the last Government.  The Minister is anxious that people should have things at a reasonable price, but, having given back so much, it is easy to understand how it is that he must find some way to make up for the reductions he has made.  In all sincerity I would ask him to consider some of the suggestions that have been made.  Perhaps he might consider setting up a body in this House composed of people intermil <Col N="1199" /> ested in this particular tax to find other ways and means of collecting the same amount of money without putting into effect this ticket tax.</P>
    <P>It has been said, too, that a lot of people will try to evade this tax.  It is a bad thing to have that sort of idea abroad, even before the scheme is put into operation.  I have been told that in the past that the payment of the tax was evaded.  One may be surprised to hear many people say now that they did evade the payment of the tax when it was in force.  For that reason I think it would be far better if, somehow, Deputy Fitzpatrick's suggestion could be considered.  It would be a far better method of collecting almost the same amount of money.  I ask the Minister to consider that point.  I think it would be a far better and a wiser scheme for the collection of the same amount of money.</P>

      <P>I am not going to take up the time of the House except to say that the real question seems to have shifted.  Is the incidence of the tax going to be changed, even when the tax has to come from this source?  Some Deputies will still object to the tax coming from this source for other reasons.  A number of Deputies have been arguing about the particular method of getting the tax from this source.  The Minister has indicated that he is not prepared to accept proposals made by other Deputies here.  I am just wondering, just as Deputy Mrs. Redmond has been wondering whether there is not another way of getting around it to get the £65,000, even from the same source, without the objections which have been already fully pleaded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardButler" hpid="Mr. Butler Mr. Butler">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite realise that taxes must be imposed so that the services of the country may be carried on. I have not risen to criticise this particular tax in any hostile spirit at all I am sorry that it will hit parochial committees, charitable organisations and athletic associations of various kinds.  There is good authority for saying that it will cause a great deal of unemployment.  That is a very regrettable thing.  I object to the tax on a number of grounds.  One is that it will not make the country attractive. The imposition of this tax will make the country less attractive than it has been up to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Deputies on the other side of the House tried to give the impression that this tax would not hit the country, that it would not hit rural areas.  I think it would be more true to say that it will hit very considerable expanses of the country outside the large towns and cities and anything <Col N="1201" /> that is possible to brighten up rural life should be done.  There is nothing that so brightens the life for young people in country areas as dancing.  I do not think any other form of recreation you could offer them would have the same attraction.  From that point of view, I am sorry this tax is being reimposed.</P>
    <P>There is this point also, that this tax may drive a large number of recognised dance halls out of existence.  It will certainly discourage the erection of additional ones and young people will find this form of recreation for themselves and the result will be that they will probably go into small and stuffy private houses, sometimes in great numbers, and they will find themselves in rooms where the air is vitiated and very unhealthy.  I think in that way we will not do much to help the anti-tuberculosis campaign.  I think it would be a serious thing to drive the young people in the rural areas from recognised dancing places, possibly into holes and corners.  In the recognised halls the parents know where the young people are and with whom they are associated.  If they are scattered here and there in order to find this form of recreation which they cannot get in the normal way, it will not be a good thing for them.  It is comparable to the closing of licensed premises where beer and spirits are sold and encouraging the spread of shebeens.  There is something comparable between these two things.</P>
    <P>The more serious objection in my mind is the discouragement to training in music, vocal and instrumental, that will result from the imposition of this tax.  There is no doubt that training in music, vocal and instrumental, is nothing like as widespead or as good as it was when I was a boy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardButler" hpid="Mr. Butler Mr. Butler">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying that the training in music, vocal and instrumental, has deteriorated very much from what it was 30 or 40 years ago and, with the imposition of this tax, if it reduces the number of musicians or the possibility of employment for them, it will tend to discourage people from training in music.  I think that would be a very undesirable thing.  In that small county town &mdash; this is my own experience&mdash;we had a very fine choral union and, in addition, we had a very good orchestra in which we, at least, attempted the works of the very best composers.  I had the pleasure of being the pianist to that orchestra for a number of years.  In the orchestra we had all classes of people, from the poorest upwards.  I might mention, incidentally, that the oboe player was a clergyman, the rector of a neighbouring parish.</P>
      <P>I am pointing out these things in order to show that a great deal can be done for the uplift, the amusement and the enjoyment of people in country places, given proper encouragement.  I am not blaming the present Government in any way for the state of affairs that exists now and that has existed for a long time.  The gramophone was very damaging, in the first instance, and then we had wireless later on.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardButler" hpid="Mr. Butler Mr. Butler">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>I do.  I maintain that if this tax is imposed it will still further damage the cause of musical training.  I am saying that already it has been damaged very much by the gramophone, the wireless and the tinned music that we have in the cinema.  I think it is a very great pity that the training of young people in music should be discouraged, as it certainly is discouraged by the imposition of this tax.  One Minister had a praiseworthy objective before him of keeping Government inspectors outside the gates.  Here we have a Minister apparently determined to bring them back inside the doors of the halls in which people enjoy themselves dancing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another serious objection to this tax is that any legislation that, as it were, encourages circumvention of the existing <Col N="1203" /> law is bad.  We have it on the authority of Deputy Fitzpatrick and other Deputies here to-night that people will go to extraordinary lengths to circumvent this law.  For that reason I think the Minister should try to think of some other means of bringing in revenue.  I do not altogether agree with Deputy Fitzpatrick's alternative of putting the tax on the proprietors of the dance halls.  If you take small villages and towns, you will find that one of the most desirable things is to have a local hall.</P>
    <P>If dance halls are liable to be heavily taxed there is very little likelihood of their being built at all.  Where dancing is promoted under proper supervision it encourages the building of halls more than does anything else in small towns and villages where such halls are so very desirable.  These halls can be used for other purposes apart from dancing. What are described here as dance halls are very often not strictly dance halls as such.  They are used for various purposes.  They are used for concerts and lectures and so on.  They help to maintain interest, particularly in the rural areas.  The suggestion offered by Deputy Fitzpatrick plays into the hands of the big man.  That suggestion would tend to discourage the erection of small halls in country villages and towns.  I consider a town with a population of 500 people very small.  I trust that the Minister will accept the general wish of the House that, if possible, this tax should be remitted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. B. Maguire Mr. B. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>To my mind the proposal to reimpose this entertainment tax is very wrong particularly when one considers the rural areas and the lack of entertainment facilities and the paucity of attractions in these places.  From the Minister's introductory speech it would appear as if he were actuated by a desire to assist rural entertainment and encourage facilities in rural districts.  His proposal, however, will have the effect, in my opinion, of retarding such a development. Cinemas and dance halls are the major attractions available in the majority of country districts.  They are really the only form of entertainment the people have.  Any Government <Col N="1204" /> action which might impede their development must further unpopularise rural life.  Any movement in that direction is ultimately bad policy and the Government should be very slow to adopt such a line of action.  The present proposal will have an injurious effect on small towns.  I take it the Minister had before him the experience of the previous Government when he eliminated areas three miles distant from a town with a population of over 500 people. A population of 500 does not really constitute a town.  At most it is a village.</P>
      <P>Since the introduction of this proposal a number of potential itinerant cinema producers have sought to book up all the towns and villages with a population of 500 or less.  They have travelled as far as County Leitrim. These shows will have the effect of making the position of the permanently established cinemas in towns with a population of 1,000 untenable.  That would be the maximum population of any town in my county.  Under this proposal every person in such a town will be subject to an entertainment tax.  I do not know what form of taxation could apply to these intinerant cinemas.  They are already in existence. These people book halls within three miles of a large town and naturally the townspeople will travel three miles to see these shows.  If that happens no business will be left for the permanently established cinemas in the town. It may have the effect, if it is imposed as a permanent tax, that some enterprising people will build reasonably substantial dance halls&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This will have the effect of bringing into existence conditions the Minister never intended when he introduced it.  I strongly urge upon him that he should consider the appeals made here.  He must know that this is a highly unpopular proposal.  I have no objection to dancing or any entertainment of that kind and I hold that entertainment generally should make a contribution to the State in the same <Col N="1205" /> way as do commodities like tobacco and whiskey.  From the experience of the previous Government I am satisfied that this tax is not worth the candle. It will be injurious in so far as social life in rural areas is concerned.  Conditions must be made attractive in the rural areas if we wish to keep our people there.  I suggest the Minister should pay heed to the considered arguments advanced against the application of this tax in its present form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has listened to a great deal of argument against this tax and he must now have reached the conclusion that it is difficult to impose a tax on anything that is popular.  I suggest that that is one of the reasons why he and his colleagues succumbed to the temptation last year to reduce taxation on a number of popular commodities. We are all agreed that the Minister has a perfect right to come forward with proposals for the imposition of taxation in any direction his Government thinks fit.  If it is absolutely necessary that this £65,000 should be obtained, and if there is no other means of obtaining it except on entertainments there can be no great objection to getting this money from entertainments in preference to imposing it on some of the necessaries of life.  I am sure that all Deputies agree that if dances could be made completely free of restriction and free of taxation that would be very desirable.  The major objection advanced against this tax on dances is the fact that there are so many problems to solve in the way of getting stamps and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and his advisers are aware of the efforts to evade this tax. Everybody who has had anything to do with the organising of dances knows quite well of the efforts that were made all over the country, demoralising the whole community, to evade the tax and the fraud that was carried on against the laws of the country.  Suggestions have now been made that the Minister might raise the money by means of licensing dance halls, by imposing stamp duties on licences or otherwise. That would cut out all the need for inspection, all the red tape, and it would give the Minister this £65,000.  I believe he could raise more money by <Col N="1206" /> means of a licence duty than under this proposed arrangement.  He told us that it would cost something about 2½ per cent. for administration.  That is roughly, I suppose, about £2,000 out of £65,000.</P>

      <P>We are not concerned about getting popularity.  I was one of those who brought to the notice of the Minister and his Department, the fraud that was going on when the tax was in operation and the nuisance the collection of the tax was to all organisations in this country.  I am sure the dance promoters in this country are well able to stand this £65,000.  The people attending dances pay far more for motor cars and in the consumption of drink at these dances than £65,000. I do not think that £65,000 is going to break dancing organisations in this country but there is the nuisance that the collection means for organisations who organise dances for charitable purposes and indeed for every possible purpose.  That is what they object to. They would willingly pay £3 or £5 on a straight licence duty to carry on the dance rather than be compelled to stamp the tickets and to make returns for the Revenue Commissioners.  That is the nuisance objected to by organisers <Col N="1207" /> of dances.  I would suggest to the Minister that he should reconsider this whole matter and see if he could get his revenue in some other way rather than by the system that was in operation and that was found to be such a nuisance over many years.</P>

      <P>I should like to point out that 1946 and 1947 were boom years, and when it was not found a reasonable tax to collect in the boom years, now that the boom is over I do not see how the Minister can possibly hope to get anything like the amount that he is budgeting for.  Speaking from practical knowledge, I can tell the Minister and the House that the boom in dancing at the end of the war and in the years immediately following the war, was caused by the number of American soldiers that came here on leave from Europe.  Every American soldier who came here wanted to go to a dance hall to enjoy himself.  They were followed in the summer time by visitors from England who came across here in search of enjoyment and good food.  Dancing is more popular in England than it is in Ireland.  The young people especially flocked to the <Col N="1208" /> ballrooms and dance halls of the city here.  That is now all practically over. We have no American soldiers coming from Europe.  Many people may be greatly pleased, but I would not say that anyone here is pleased that the English visitors, especially young people, have ceased to come to this country.  They were welcome here, and while they felt that sometimes they were fairly well fleeced, they were allowed to enjoy themselves and they went away with pleasant recollections of the city here.  That influx was responsible for the boom in dancing during the years on which the Minister has based his estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest to him, and I defy contradiction by his officials, that the attendance in the ballrooms in Dublin has fallen by two-thirds and that where he hopes to get £65,000, he will not get more than £22,000 because if the people are not attending dances they will not be paying taxes on the price of admission.  It was with that knowledge that I considered it my duty to my constituents to advise the Minister and the Government as to the true facts of the situation when I spoke against this tax and when I endeavoured to submit an amendment. I feel now, in view of the statements made here, that the Minister might even still consider the suggestions I made in my amendment and to use them as a basis for the collection of this tax, so as not to interfere with people who go into the dance hall to enjoy themselves.  The fact of being followed into the ballroom and of being interfered with perhaps in the middle of a dance is something they always resented and always will resent.  I feel I am not letting myself down or that I can be accused of putting my personal interests before the interests of the community in general or of failing in my duty as a Deputy of this House when I suggest that it is not the people who go in that should be taxed but the people who own the ballroom. They pay a nominal fee for a licence at the present time and I think it would be a much better system for the Minister to adopt than the one in force at the present time.  I think none of us objects to his getting the money, but we suggested to him how <Col N="1209" /> he would get it cheaper and easier and in a way which would not cause resentful sentiments outside.  I would ask him even at this eleventh hour to reconsider the matter.  He said that he would only get £25,000, but I thought it would go to between £40,000 and £50,000 or even higher.  If the scale which I set up was not enough and the Minister adopted the manner in which I suggested the tax could be collected without any resentment, he is at liberty to take the figure I put before him and increase it by a third or a half or double it.  He can do that without interfering with the people who have the right to enjoy themselves and I respectfully submit that even now he should consider it.</P>
    <P>As a supporter of the Government, if there is a division, I am not going to vote against the Government.  My amendment is there and I could oppose the Government and vote for it but on the other hand I am not going to vote against the Government for the purpose of advertising myself.  But as every second speaker who has spoken on this controversial matter against the system by which this tax is collected was a Government supporter, if a free vote were taken that system would be turned down.  I put that before the Minister and appeal to him to consider it.</P>

      <P>I hope you will not mind, Sir, if I refer to a few facts to which I should have referred before.  It was pointed out to me the number of clubs that would be affected.  Hurling clubs, football clubs, tennis clubs, beagling clubs, hunting clubs, political clubs, benefits for printers' organisations, etc., and agricultural societies and farmers' societies would be very gravely hit by this tax and, in fact, quite a number of them my correspondent anticipates, will cancel their bookings and some have already cancelled them. That is not imagination, because one association gave figures showing that by the time they paid the tax it just would not be worth their while to run the dance.  These are concrete facts, and I am glad that Deputy Mrs. Redmond supported that claim.  She must have received the same letters as I did.</P>

He is slapping on an inconsiderate tax which will mean the closing down of halls so that the result will be that he will not get the tax he anticipates.  It is a pathetic commentary on the promises of the Government that there would be freedom for the various sections in the Government and that they would not be asked to vote against their settled definite opinions and convictions.

      <P>To be candid and honest about the whole thing, I would much prefer if the Minister did not impose this tax, but while saying that, I do not subscribe to the gloomy forebodings that a terrible catastrophe is going to happen to this country as a result of this tax.  I have experience of halls built by my associates out of their own little savings.  They run dances now and then and are going to be affected. But the only thing I hope is that when the tax is in operation there will be no such thing as the evasion which was practised at the time it was in operation before and of which I could give examples if I wished to cause a little trouble in the House but I am not going to do that now.  Do not the Deputies know very well, and Deputy Aiken when he was Minister for Finance stressed the point, that when the tax was in operation the price of admission was fixed in view of the tax and when the tax was taken off the price of admission was not reduced pro rata?  Is not that a fact?  Yet no one Deputy on the far side adverted to that very pertinent fact which is the foundation of the whole argument as far as the imposition of this tax is concerned.  We were very glad at home when the tax was taken off but when it was in operation we paid the tax and when it is in operation now we will pay the tax and we will not increase the prices but will do with less. There again, is it not a well known fact that young people get into a motor car and go to a dance 50 miles away? Yet we are told that, if they have to pay 3d. and 4d. more, the county is doomed.  We have had it advocated here that it will do away even with our culture and drive out the love of music from our people.  We used to be very renowned for that, but surely no one on the opposite side will attempt to argue that there is music in dance bands.  The more canned music they get in a dance band, the more they like it nowadays.</P>

      <P>I happen to know a wee bit of music and have a good ear, and I know good music when I hear it. As regards this question of destroying the joy and pleasure, as suggested by Deputy Burke, in the rural population, I do not think his statement is correct at all.  The vast majority of the rural people will have that three-mile limit, which will mean that they will not have to pay any tax on the hall which they use for recreation, dancing, cinema or otherwise.  I believe that exemption is a very good one.  I make these remarks, although personally I would prefer that the Minister did not reimpose the tax.  At the same time, I do not subscribe to the views put forward by many Deputies on all sides of the House that, if this tax is imposed, the sky will fall and something awful will happen.  Some Deputies seem to think that dancing is the be-all and end-all of the prosperity of this country. That is a view to which I do not subscribe. So far as the physical and cultural welfare of the people is concerned, it would be bad that they should have that opinion.  I believe that the sensible Deputies&mdash;and I refer particularly to the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy de Valera&mdash;will find it very difficult to go in and vote against the Minister's imposition of this tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Céilidhe dancing is dancing and is not exempt.  Deputy Little, on his second intervention, spoke of the correspondence he had from his own area.  I received, I think, the same correspondence.  The letters, in the main, were protests against the increase in the tax not the reimposition. One letter sent to me personally said that:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Press reports following the Budget speech lead me to believe that the Budget tax was merely a reimposition of the old tax.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1213" /> That note runs through all the letters &mdash;100 per cent. increase on the tax in 1946.  It is clear from these letters that the proprietor of one of the halls naturally set about canvassing all his patrons and wrote to them urging them to write to him protesting against the tax, so that he could pass on the letters to Deputy Little.  That is quite clear. One says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am in receipt of your letter and am amazed to learn that the tax would be 100 per cent. above the tax applied some years ago.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the protest I got, in the main. That was also the greater part of the burthen or song of complaints which two or three deputations I took on this matter had.  I understood I had met by far the greater amount of the complaint about this tax by the reduction I brought in, at a cost of £45,000 to the revenue.</P>
    <P>However, in the background of all this tax, there is one mistaken point of view which I do not suppose I will succeed in having removed&mdash;that this is a costly tax to collect.  That is not so.  There is no good in people working into a frenzy of calculation, in an amateurish way like Deputy de Valera, as to what might happen.  The people on whom the State relies for the estimate of revenue to be got from all the various methods must be regarded as having some talent in estimation, in knowing what taxes would be fruitful and what the yield is likely to be and in associating, at least by way of estimate, the cost against that.  Their view as expressed to me was that, in the days in which this tax had to be collected in a difficult way over remote rural areas, the cost of collection was 2 per cent. of what we got.  I do not suppose that, if I say that a dozen times, I will get any credence from the Deputies opposite.  They have taken a certain view, and will try to make the same calculations as Deputy de Valera indulged in, to prove that it must be costing more.  There is the situation presented to me by people of experience, as against this amateurish action.</P>

      <P>I do not know.  If there is any good the Deputy thinks may be got from the information, I will get it for him.  That was the estimate which he would have been given yesterday, if he requested it, on the question he put to the Parliamentary Secretary, but as the answer was circulated with the Official Report there was no chance of having any supplementary question.  I know that every Deputy says that Deputy Aiken, when he took the tax off, said it took £80,000 to collect £85,000.  He never said anything of the sort.  He was not advised to say anything like that and, even on his own, he never said anything remotely like that.  But that error persists and everybody talking on this uses that mistaken information, that this is a costly thing.  I know that is the background of the Deputy's amendment.</P>
      <P>He suggests, as an amendment, putting the tax on licences, calculating on so much money being received. Deputy Fitzpatrick, I think, was not attempting to collect in his tax the whole thing, but some portion of the tax and he was trying to give me the sum which he said represented the sum, less the expense, he thought, of collecting it.  Deputies who have been talking about following me into the Division Lobby tramped resolutely through the Lobbies for 14 years to keep this tax on.  All this imagination that was displayed in the Dáil to-night, that apparently was breaking their hearts, did not break out into speech for 14 years in the Deputies opposite. Apparently this tax was always a killjoy, always likely to cause unemployment, to lead to disposals of dance halls and prevention of others being built.  According to Deputy Butler, it is even a help towards tuberculosis in the country.  That is the way the tax is characterised.  Deputy Butler gave me an impression of himself 40 years ago, if he was asked out to a social evening, bringing his violin &mdash; and he is lamenting that the dance hall tax has killed that sort of stuff.  That was the position for 14 years.  Deputies opposite walked the gangways every time.</P>

It crossed the £100,000 mark in 1943; it was £132,000 and a bit in 1944-45; and was just short of the £150,000 mark in 1945-46.  If the promise of the first four months had been borne out, it would have gone fairly close to £250,000 in 1946-47.  That was a good deal to extract from the bright countryside.

      <P>The situation, as I see it, is entirely different under which I am looking for this amount of £65,000.  Last year, as a result of the remission of the taxation given and by reason of people having more money to spend on themselves, certain of the taxes which were retained showed an increase in revenue yield beyond any expectation.  They were mainly what I would call types of entertainment <Col N="1218" /> tax, though I do not mean the types which come strictly under the heading of entertainments tax.  It was picture-houses last year, and the revenue derived from racing and betting and the yield from taxes on whiskey and tobacco &mdash; all these, taking them all together, went far beyond the estimates made.  All the taxes which go to indicate that people had money to spend on themselves and on their amusements&mdash;and were spending it that way&mdash;yielded very well.  I cannot understand why dancing is to be segregated and how people can come to the conclusion that all other forms of entertainment on which money is being spent, and spent partly for the good of the State, are going to continue to yield revenue, but that dancing is going to fall off.  That is why I discount to a great extent all these lamentations about loss of employment.  If there was to be loss of employment, it should have been seen over a 14 years' test, but Deputies opposite ran the tax for all that period, and if there was any evidence to be derived from the past, Deputies could have brought that evidence here and could have said: &ldquo;Look at the results of this tax over 14 years.  Look at the unemployment caused and look at all the dance halls lying derelict&rdquo;; but not one particle of evidence of that sort can be brought forward.</P>
      <P>When Deputy Aiken withdrew the tax some years ago, he did not do it on the ground that it was defeating itself, or on the ground that it was causing unemployment, or on the ground that it was hurting the rural areas, because the rural areas were not particularly in his viewpoint at the time.  His attitude was: &ldquo;We have recognised the truth of part of this statement that it is a dangerous tax to collect.&rdquo;  That had application to the remote areas of the country and it was difficult&mdash;the word was used in the same context&mdash;from the angle of inspection.  We are cutting out the dangerous and difficult areas, and, even then, in the easier areas, I will still abide by the estimate of 2 per cent. expense ratio in relation to the revenue to be derived.  It cannot be called a costly tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Burke has put himself on <Col N="1219" /> record as saying that dancing is on the wane and, in fact, he says that dances now, before the tax is put on, are not paying.  I am glad to have that recorded, and, when we come to have an inquest on this tax next year, we will see whether the situation is as bad as the Deputy believes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That was one of the suggestions made, I think, by Deputy Butler, but I did not think that Deputy McGrath associated himself with that particular piece of folly. Last year we got more revenue by reducing the tax on wine, and it seems to me the height of folly to increase a tax when the increase will result in a lesser yield.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that there will be more wine drunk because there will be a greater yield, but the greater yield comes from the reduction in tax. I cannot get any more money out of an increase in the tax on wine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the other side that ought to be considered in the context of this tax.  People who go to dances do not merely dance.  There is a good deal of smoking that goes on at dances and there is some drink actually consumed at dances.  Both tobacco and drink are cheaper since February, 1948.  There is about £6,000,000 that was being extracted from the people of the <Col N="1220" /> country in connection with these two taxes and that £6,000,000 is in the hands of those people to spend.  I am asking here for £65,000.  It is about £1,300,000 shillings.  Deputies may come to their own conclusion.  What proportion of the community dances?  Do £500,000 of the £3,000,000 population dance?</P>

      <P>And what dances do they attend?  What can I get off them? If I get 2/3 from £500,000 people divided out of whatever number of dances they go to, the tax is saved. Mind you, this is in circumstances in which people are not made to dance the tune that Deputy O'Rourke's Leader made them dance for 14 whole years.</P>

      <P>This is Section 12 of the Finance Bill of this year.  In the first seven sections I have lost £886,000 by way of remitted tax in this year&mdash; £1,220,000 for a full year.  In Section 12 I am asking for £65,000 in return. Surely it is a fair bargain the people are getting when I remit £886,000 in seven sections of the piece of legislation and ask for £65,000 back.  I suggest it is a good tax and that I will get the money and will get it at less cost than is imagined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says he has given back something to the people and that he is now asking only for £65,000 in this particular section. Actually, that £65,000 is portion of a bill which amounts to £24 7s. 0d. per head on the people.  They have to pay that to the Minister for Central Fund and Supplies Services in one form or another, entirely apart from any capital that is raised for capital purposes, Electricity Supply Board and so on.  He is taking £24 7s. 0d. per head off whatever he is giving back and that stands as against the £21 14s. 0d. per head that Fianna Fáil took off them. The £21 14s. 0d. has gone up to £24 7s. 0d. per head.  The Minister can calculate that whatever way he likes, in the number of smokes or the number of dances.</P>
      <P>The Minister did not deal at all in his reply to this long debate with the real, serious aspect of this tax on dancing.  He made no effort at all to deal with the appalling case that was made by Deputy Fitzpatrick here as to the evasion that was going on to Deputy Fitzpatrick's knowledge, and he is in a position to know.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not eight years in Finance.  I was two and a half years, and I abolished the tax because I got some little inkling of the facts that were announced here in this House by Deputy Fitzpatrick to-night.  It is no secret.  I mean, Deputy Fitzpatrick did not make any secret of it and he himself is a dance hall proprietor.  I want to know what good is it to this community to have that sort of game going on for the sake of collecting £65,000? There are other taxes in connection with which you cannot have this evasion&mdash;and we will not put it any stronger than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had hoped that the Minister would remit the tax when he heard Deputy Fitzpatrick and a number of other people say here in this House what I have heard myself&mdash;I could not speak from my own personal knowledge&mdash;that charitable organisations, having to keep their expenses within 50 per cent. of the total takings, are tempted and, according to some of the Deputies here who have spoken to-night, fall for the temptation of keeping their expenses very much lower than they actually are.  Surely, a number of people in this country, whether they are in a political club or a football club or the Gaelic League or some other organisation that is doing something to give the people in the various localities a little bit of amusement and at the same time make a bit of profit for local organisations, are entitled to carry on without all these pip-squeak inspectors.  That is not my phrase.  It is the Minister for Finance's phrase and the Minister for Industry and Commerce's phrase.  Are we going to have, unnecessarily, not only the pip-squeak inspectors into farmers' land and so on, but into the dance halls and into the dances and ceilidhes run for charitable organisations or for the local football club? Surely we are not that badly stuck. There was experience of this thing in the past and, even though we had postwar experience to meet and sudden emergencies, the cost of food and so on, even in view of that, the Fianna <Col N="1223" /> Fáil Government took the decision that they would abolish this particular tax and I believe still we were right in doing it and I believe the Minister is very wrong, from a social point of view, in reimposing it.  There is not much in it.  According to Deputy Fitzpatrick and others, he will not even collect half of what he should collect.</P>
    <P>It is a very bad thing for the country that tax evasion on that scale should take place.  I want the Minister to remember that after to-night's performance in this House the people of the county are not going to have to rely on my word as to whether a tax is a bad tax, leaving itself open to evasion and all sorts of flaws.  They have the evidence of members of this Dáil, who spoke from personal knowledge, that it did lead to evasion and to fraud.  I do not know how the Minister, or anybody, could calculate, to the fine point of 2 per cent., what this tax is going to cost to collect.  I am sure that the Minister's official advisers did their best in making a rough shot at what they think it will cost.  I do not know whether, in that particular item of cost, they took into consideration the travelling expenses, attendance at court and all the other incidental expenses that attach to the collection of this tax.  I am certain that whether it is an easy and a cheap tax to collect from the official point of view of merely pounds, shillings and pence, it is a very dear tax to collect from a social point of view.  I think, myself, that we should leave some part of the local pleasures alone, without having inspectors going in upon them, and that people should be able to come together and have a céilidhe or a dance and make a few pounds for the organisation in which they are interested without being subject to all this inspection.  The matter of inspection has one other aspect.  I do not know whether the Minister adverted to it or whether his officials brought it to his attention&mdash;as, indeed, they brought it to mine&mdash;that this particular type of collection makes the Revenue Commissioners' officials unpopular in the district.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1224" /> If we are going to have the goodwill of the people behind the Government&mdash; behind all Governments, because no matter what Government is in power it has to collect a lot of money&mdash;in regard to the collection of revenue for the State we should do our utmost not to impose on the Revenue Commissioners' officials more unpopular jobs than we can avoid.  Their job is unpopular no matter how we do it, but why on earth give them a job for a petty sum like this which is going to antagonise a very much bigger section of our people than would come into contact with them in the ordinary way? I feel that the Minister was very ill-advised. I could almost name the member in the present Cabinet who suggested this tax at the Cabinet table when the Minister wanted £100,000 to round off.  All anybody has to do is to go back and read&mdash;&mdash;</P>
