    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether, in view of the continued alarming growth of the City of Dublin with its consequent ill-effects on the social and economic structure of the country, and of the fact that this growth is contributing to the depopulation of rural areas, he will consider setting up a Cabinet committee to ascertain what steps can be taken to decentralise industry and the administration of government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government fully appreciate the ill effects on the social and economic structure of the country that would follow the excessive growth of the City of Dublin, and this is a consideration that is constantly borne in mind in the framing of the Government's social and economic measures.</P>
      <P>The question of the decentralisation of industry is always given prominence by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in connection with proposals for the establishment of new industries. His powers in this regard are, however, very limited, and the Deputy will appreciate that persons desiring to establish an industry cannot, in practice, be obliged to do so in a locality which they consider unsuitable.  This whole matter will, however, engage the attention of the Industrial Development Authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decentralisation of Government administration is also a matter in regard to which serious practical difficulties arise.  At this stage, I can only say that the object which the Deputy <Col N="1350" /> has in mind is one in which the Government are in sympathy, and that, as the occasion occurs, the question of taking practical steps will be considered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach say whether any consideration has been given to the suggestion previously made here, namely, that certain sections of the Department of Agriculture, for instance, could be centred in Athlone?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There has not been any reference to that particular question of putting a particular section of a Department into Athlone.  It is not quite as simple as the Deputy says by merely making a statement which sounds very nice as a matter of theory. In practice, it is very difficult.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach if he is aware that the transfer of industries and of Government offices from Dublin would lead to grave hardship and unemployment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one of the matters I had in mind when I said that, as a matter of practice, it would be very difficult.  There are also numerous others, which will occur to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare whether he will introduce proposals for legislation to extend to all workmen entitled to receive workmen's compensation in this State, and who, through the operation of Section 34 of the Workmen's Compensation Act, 1934, are disqualified from receiving such compensation on taking up residence in Great Britain, the right to receive such compensation.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the residence <Col N="1351" /> disqualification contained in Section 32 of the Workmen's Compensation Act, 1934, which is, no doubt, what the Deputy has in mind.  My Department is at present considering the possibility of having this disqualification modified by means of further reciprocal arrangements with Great Britain.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he will state whether it is proposed to erect a new school at Kiltale, in the parish of Moynaloy, County Meath; and, if so, what is the present position.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>A suitable site for a new school has been offered by the manager.  Before a grant can be sanctioned by the Department towards the cost of erecting a new school, it is necessary that satisfactory evidence of title to the site be furnished by the manager in order to enable an official lease of the site to trustees to be prepared.</P>
      <P>The manager of Crossbridge National School has furnished evidence of title in respect of one portion of the proposed site, but difficulties have arisen in regard to title to the remaining portion. I am having investigations made as a matter of urgency, as to whether it might not be feasible to erect the new school on that portion of the site for which title is available; but I am unable to say at this stage whether such an arrangement would be possible.</P>
      <P>Failing a solution on these lines, I fear that further progress could not be made towards the erection of a school on the site offered, until satisfactory evidence of title to the whole plot is available.  The alternative would be for the manager to endeavour to procure another site to which satisfactory evidence of title could be obtained.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether he is aware that rent allowances payable to national teachers on the 1st April and 1st November in each year are usually still unpaid after two months have elapsed from these dates; and, if so, whether, in view of the fact that these grants are unchanging in almost every case, he will arrange to have them paid more expeditiously in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether he is aware that residual grants payable to principals and vice-principals of national schools on the 1st April and 1st November in each year are usually withheld for over a month; and, if so, whether, in view of the fact that these grants are unchanging in almost every case, he will arrange to have them paid more expeditiously in future.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with your permission, to take Questions Nos. 6 and 7 together.</P>
      <P>The Department's regulations providé for the payment on certain conditions of annual allowances to principal and vice-principal teachers of national schools and of annual allowances in aid of rent to married men teachers and to women teachers who are widows.  These annual allowances are paid. as a matter of convenience, in two instalments each year, the first in respect of the six months ending the 31st March and the second in respect of the six months ending the 30th September.</P>
      <P>Arrangements are made to ensure that these allowances issue at the earliest possible date, but prior consideration has necessarily to be given to the regular and prompt issue of the usual payments of salaries to the general body of teachers.  In each of the months of April and October, two main payments of salaries are made, namely, (a) balancing payment for the immediately preceding quarter and (b) mid-monthly payment to those teachers who have elected to be paid their salaries in twice-monthly instalments.</P>
      <P>The number of teachers entitled to principals' allowances is considerably in excess of the number who receive rent allowances; and, following the issues of ordinary salary, referred to, priority is therefore given to payment of the former allowances, which accordingly are, as a rule, issued towards the end of April and October, respectively. These allowances were so paid in the present calendar year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the general issue of rent allowances, payment cannot be made, because of the circumstances mentioned, until after payment of principals' allowances has been dealt with. Every effort is made, however, to ensure that the teachers concerned receive rent allowances at the earliest possible date and in the great majority of cases payment is made by the middle of the months of May and November, respectively.  This represents the position in regard to the payment of rent allowances during the calendar year.  There are always, however, some cases in which further <Col N="1354" /> inquiry as to the circumstances of the applications is necessary before payment can be authorised, and in these it is not possible to issue the allowances until a later date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether he is aware that the meal interval during school hours, introduced during the emergency on account of scarcity of fuel and of gas rationing, is a hardship on children through causing them to make a double journey daily, and a burden on parents who have to provide bus fares for the extra journeys; and, if so, whether he will now consider a reversion to the former hours of attendance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The arrangement of time-tables in national schools is a matter for the local managers, subject to the requirements of the rules and regulations.  It is open to the manager of a school to arrange the time-table so that the school day shall consist of one meeting with an interval for recreation of half an hour or longer, but not as a rule exceeding one hour: or he may arrange to have a school day of two meetings with an interval of more than an hour between the meetings.</P>
      <P>I have heard that many parents prefer the dual-day arrangement as it affords the children an opportunity of having a hot mid-day meal at home. Others favour the one-meeting school day with a short interval for recreation. In these circumstances it would obviously not be possible to devise any arrangement which would be acceptable to all concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">

      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is yes.

Their rates of pay have been adjusted from time to time in relation to the cost-of-living index figure.</P>

Following upon the agreement imports of fresh or frozen fish were regulated by means of the Fish (Regulation of Import) (No. 2) Order, 1938, and, in addition, import duties as follows were imposed under the Finance (Agreement with United Kingdom) Act, 1938, on fish of United Kingdom or Canadian origin in substitution for the duties previously payable under the Finance Act, 1934:&mdash; Fish, filleted, and parts thereof, 1d. per lb.; fish, kippered and smoked, 1/- per stone.

      <P>I have made inquiries from Córas Iompair Éireann and I am informed that to extend the Nos. 9 and 10 bus services to Parkgate Street would add eight minutes to each round trip.  To provide the extension and to maintain the existing frequency the company would have to provide two additional buses at the peak hours.

      <P>As the reply contains a number of statistical tables, I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to have it circulated in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>The following are the particulars:</P>
      <P>(i)  Thirty-six houses have been completed in Tullamore in the present year and 46 more are in course of erection. The number of houses in course of erection in the other towns are as follows: Birr, 20 houses; Portlaoighise, 52 houses; Edenderry, 60 houses.  I cannot at present indicate how many of these houses will be completed by the end of the year.</P>
      <P>(ii)  The all-in cost per house including cost of land, development, building, etc., in each area is estimated as follows: Tullamore, £1,042; Birr, £1,600; Portlaoighise, £1,760; Edenderry, £1,800.</P>
      <P>(iii)  The estimated cost of clearance and development of the sites is as follows: Tullamore, £5,039; Edenderry, £12,676 10s. 0d.</P>
      <P>Similar particulars for Birr and Portlaoighise are being obtained and will be forwarded to the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(iv)  I understand that the rates of <Col N="1367" /> wages for builders' labourers obtaining in three of these towns are as follows:&mdash;Tullamore and Edenderry, 1/10½d. per hour for a 48-hour week; Portlaoighise, 1/11½d. per hour for a 48-hour week.  I am not aware of a standard rate of wages for Birr.  The rate paid on the Birr scheme is being ascertained and will be notified to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>(v)  The full economic rent of the houses to cover all outgoings including estimated maintenance and administration expenses would be as follows:&mdash; Tullamore, 18/- per week exclusive of rates; Birr, £1 6s. 2d. per week exclusive of rates; Portlaoighise, £1 8s. 4d. per week exclusive of rates; Edenderry, £1 8s. 10d. per week exclusive of rates.</P>
    <P>(vi)  No proposals to carry out any of these schemes by direct labour were submitted to my Department.</P>

      <P>I have had this matter under consideration and am examining the extent to which the position can be helped by further legislation.  The Deputy will understand that where there is reasonable relationship between the price of the house and current market values existing legislation does not prevent persons of limited means from availing themselves of financial assistance by way of the grants and loans.  In regard to the second part of the question, I would point out that, in making advances under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts, housing authorities are obliged to take all necessary steps to safeguard the funds which they have to provide for the purpose and must base the amount of any advance not on the price charged by the builder, but on the amount which the house, if sold in the open market, might reasonably be expected to realise.  We must look to a reduction in building prices as the surest solution of the present difficulties.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is correct in stating that special public sessions at the Dublin Corporation mass radiography centre at Lord Edward Street are held at irregular and infrequent intervals.  I am not satisfied that this valuable diagnostic service is being used to its fullest capacity, and I have already requested the Dublin Corporation to arrange for more frequent sessions.  In fact, I see no reason why arrangements could not be made to <Col N="1374" /> hold a public session for men on a particular evening each week, another on a particular afternoon each week, and similarly for women.  I would regard this as the minimum service which should be provided for the public generally, to be increased later if the demand justified it.</P>
      <P>I should, perhaps, explain that, in between, sessions could and should be arranged on a much more extensive scale than at present for special groups, e.g., employees of particular firms, members of trade unions or of clubs, senior school-children and persons attending clinics at the maternity hospitals and maternity and child welfare centres.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That it is expedient to authorise such payments out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas as are necessary to give effect to any Act of the present Session to amend the Military Service Pensions Acts, 1924 to 1945.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of the debate on the Second Reading, appeals were made to the Minister in regard to making some change in the operative date.  In the Minister's closing statement he did not, as far as I can remember, make any pronouncement as to whether he was prepared to consider the requests made from the various Deputies.  Because of that, I am going to mention the matter again and to suggest that, in view of the expressed opinion of all sections of the House, the Minister should reconsider the question of changing the operative date and accede to the request made by all Deputies that the date should be the 1st October, 1934.  I think that was the operative date in the 1934 Act.  We do not want to delay in any way the passage of this Bill, but on the question of the operative date, if the matter of pensions is to be reinvestigated and decisions arrived at in respect of these investigations, we feel that in justice to those who are likely to succeed in their claims, they are entitled to the same remuneration as those who succeeded originally under the 1934 Act.  Failing the concession that we ask for, it will be necessary for those of us on this side of the House anyhow to oppose that section.  As I say, we are not anxious to impede the passage of the Bill and, with the exception of our objection to that particular phase of the Bill, we do not intend to divide further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of the Minister's opening statement he referred to the 1924 Act.  He left me under the impression that persons who applied under the 1924 Act and who had actually decisions taken in their cases were entitled to apply under the 1934 Act.  In the <Col N="1377" /> course of his statement, the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Under the 1934 Act, we did give a right to 1924 Act people to appeal against the previous decision or verdict, so that when the 1934 Act was passed people who had been rejected under the 1924 Act and at that moment were entitled to no pension were given the right to appeal, but they were given the right to pick up their pension only from the date of the passing into law of the 1934 Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I still feel that that is not an accurate statement.  It suggests that almost any person was entitled to apply under the 1924 Act who had service in the forces.  But that was not correct, of course, because you could not apply under the 1924 Act unless you actually had been in the National Army and I have no doubt that, while numbers of persons applied for a pension under the 1924 Act, they had not the necessary qualifying service in the National Army and, as a result, without any further investigation, they were turned down automatically and, probably, rightly so in accordance with the Act. But, if any persons applied under the 1924 Act and had their cases investigated and their claims examined and, after that investigation and examination, it was found they were not persons to whom the Act applied, these persons were not entitled to appeal, as the Minister suggested, under the 1934 Act.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (3) of Section 3 of the 1934 Act states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Act of 1924, shall, for the purposes of this section, be deemed not to apply to a person to whom that Act in fact applies but in respect of whom the Minister is satisfied either that because of such person having served in the forces he did not apply for a certificate of military service under the said Act or that such person was refused such certificate because of his having been sentenced to imprisonment or penal servitude in respect of an act done by him in the execution of his duty as a member of the forces.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that that sub-section clarifies <Col N="1378" /> the position in respect to those who could or who could not apply for a pension under the 1934 Act.  My reading of it anyhow is that, if you had not service in the National Army, you were not entitled to apply under the 1924 Act, and that, if you had that service and had applied and had your case investigated and a decision given against you, you could not apply under the 1934 Act.</P>
    <P>But there were quite a number of persons to whom the Act of 1924 applied who were entitled to apply under the 1934 Act by reason of the fact that they had not applied under the 1924 Act or that they were dismissed or removed from the National Army because of some action on their part.  These people could apply under the 1934 Act, and many of them did and many of them succeeded. It might be well to have that position clarified, because the Minister's statement, if it is not correct, is rather unfair, as it is making a suggestion which is not correct.  It suggests that numbers of persons who could have applied under the 1924 Act could also have applied under the 1934 Act and that when the 1934 Act came into force they were deprived of the ten years which those who succeeded under the 1924 Act were entitled to.</P>
    <P>Before the 1934 Act was brought into this House it was discussed by the then Minister with the senior officers of the Old I.R.A. throughout the country, and it was generally agreed that the monetary portion of it should only apply as from October, 1934, and at that time there was no suggestion whatever that it should go back retrospectively to 1924.  To suggest that we were not doing justice because we did not go back to 1924 is far from being correct, because it was generally agreed by all those who were likely to succeed under the Act that it would be acceptable from the date suggested. There is no use in Deputies shouting across the House at me, as they did in the course of the debate on the last day, that we did not do justice either. We did that type of justice which was agreed upon and, when something is agreed to by those who are likely to <Col N="1379" /> benefit surely it cannot be described as an injustice to those persons.</P>

      <P>If I am not correct, then I will sit down.  All that I want <Col N="1380" /> to do is to clarify the situation which was created here by reason of certain statements which were made in the House.  For instance, I quoted a statement of Deputy MacBride's, and in spite of the quotation and in spite of the fact that I gave the volume, the number and the column, the Minister for External Affairs, in reply to Deputy Donnchadh Ó Briain, suggested in as many words that he had not made such a statement.  In column 795&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>There is the Second Reading of a Bill on which Deputies discuss the principle of it.  On the Money Resolution they discuss the money required for that Bill and reasons, relevant to the resolution, as to why it should not be granted. Obviously, it is not possible on a Money Resolution to answer all the points raised on the Second Stage by other Deputies of an opposite way of thinking on that Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Money Resolution is for the purpose of authorising the payment of the moneys necessary to give effect to this Bill when it becomes law.  On that, I would like to put this point.  A strong plea was made to the Minister on the Second Stage of the Bill that the operative dates in the Bill should be the 1st October, 1924, in respect of applications that might have been successful under the 1924 Act, and the 1st October, 1934, I think, in respect of applications that might have been successful under the 1934 Act. That plea was made from all sides of the House, but the Minister opposed this retrospective clause on the grounds that the money necessary to give effect to it would amount to so much that the Government could not possibly make it available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say that the decision of the Minister not to introduce amendments to this Bill to meet the wishes of the <Col N="1381" /> Dáil as a whole has disappointed a very large number of people right through the country.  I think that the sum which is now being asked for in this Resolution will not be sufficient to give justice to the many people who undoubtedly, on a reinvestigation of their claims, will be granted pensions either under the 1924 Act or the 1934 Act.  I have had telegrams, letters and interviews, and I may say honestly to the Minister that the general suggestion in them is that it would be better if the Bill were not introduced at all.</P>

      <P>The Chair is not concerned with my views at all.  What I want to put to the Minister is that, in the investigation of claims under this Bill when it becomes law, a number of people who have already applied for pensions will be entitled to pensions. In other words, it will be discovered that, in the investigations under this measure, an injustice was done to those people either under the 1924 Act or under the 1934 Act.  If that is so, justice, in my view, demands that this Dáil should make available to the Minister such moneys as will enable him, by making this Bill retrospective, to do justice to those persons.

      <P>I think it is a constitutional provision that a Deputy must not put down an amendment that will involve a charge on public funds. That being so, the only person who could put an amendment down to give effect to this general view&mdash;and it is the view of people who will never get pensions as well as of those who will that the pension should date from the operative date under the 1924 or 1934 Acts&mdash;is a Minister.  I am quite sure the Minister is aware that that is the view of the organisations who represent many of the people who will be applicants under this measure.

He has advanced from the position in which some of our men found themselves disqualified and were turned down under the 1934 Act.  These men were left in the wilderness.  Even though the provisions of this measure <Col N="1385" /> are not retrospective, we find they will assist, perhaps in a great measure, some of those men who otherwise might get nothing.  I ask the Minister not to drop this Bill.</P>

      <P>If I am allowed, I suggest that the operative date should be reconsidered.  Perhaps at a later date the Minister might find some way out of the difficulty.  Our old comrades all over the country realise that if there is a liberal interpretation put on their period of service, in that way it might be possible to bridge the gap that we now have in mind when we talk of retrospective payment.  It will all finally depend on the Minister's attitude.  If the rigid interpretation that was put on active service is adhered to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

All I can say is that I appreciate what the Minister has done.  This certainly has come as a disappointment to me and I was not informed of all those warnings at the outset.  I was not present when these men were informed that under no circumstances could the Bill be made retrospective.  The Bill, to my mind, holds some hope for the future. I think we can look forward to an improvement of the position.  I know that the Minister is anxious to assist the Old I.R.A.  I appreciate what he has done for us in the circumstances.</P>

      <P>It is with considerable trepidation that I set out to tread along the narrow path that has been laid down for us in dealing with this Money Resolution, particularly when I think of the difficulties other Deputies have experienced.  The position would appear to be something like this.  The Minister is asking the House to adopt a Money Resolution and there are only <Col N="1386" /> two logical courses open to any Deputy.  He can say &ldquo;no&rdquo;, that he thinks the House should not adopt this Resolution and that he will vote against it or, alternatively, he can say that the Resolution should be adopted.</P>
      <P>I may be dull, but it does not appear to me possible to suggest, on the one hand, that the Bill is desirable in any form and, on the other hand, to say that the Money Resolution should be rejected.  I may be obtuse in not seeing the point of the comments made by other Deputies, but that appears to me to be the position as far as this Money Resolution is concerned.  Viewing it against its background, we as a Party have always felt that the entire body of pension legislation is something that we could not embrace with any real enthusiasm.  It is something which does not accomplish what was sought to be accomplished.  We feel that pensions, as such, are not the proper solution.</P>

The granting or withholding of a pension by an Administration is a matter of grave import and consequence.  In so far as this Resolution is related to a Bill which seeks to rectify mistakes made by a previous Administration, then I <Col N="1387" /> think the Resolution must be supported. In connection with a previous Administration, the courts found that the legislation enacted was in fact not administered in accordance with the law and was in fact maladministered.</P>

I hold the view that the men of Easter Week, 1916, should be given a special place in the legislation enacted by the Parliament, which became possible because of what they did on that memorable occasion.

Practically every Deputy who has had any connection with the Old I.R.A. knows very well that it is not a question of 2,000 cases, it is a question of 12,000 or 14,000 cases.  When this Bill has finished operating and when this bit of money is expended, you will have Deputies in this House who will be in the very same position as we now are.  There will be dissatisfaction on the part of those who get it. They will say: &ldquo;I am getting 5/- a week now, but what about my back money from 1924&rdquo;&mdash;or 1934 as the case may be.  &ldquo;When are you going to bring in a Bill to give us that?&rdquo;  The poor devil who again goes through the mill and is again turned down will again be pressing and looking for justice&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am long enough in this House to remember a statement made by the late Mr. Fitzgerald, when he was Minister for Defence, to the effect that the maximum number of persons who, in his opinion, would be entitled to service pensions, on the grounds that they had rendered active service, would not exceed 3,000. I do not know what Deputy Traynor would think of that figure, but it has been indicated that this Bill, which got the unanimous consent of the House on its Second Reading, proposes to go further than Deputy Traynor, when he was Minister for Defence, intended to go.  I remember listening in this House to Deputy Traynor, when he was Minister for Defence, indicating quite clearly that the inquiries in connection with all the cases then outstanding would be completed by the end of the year 1948.</P>

      <P>The Minister is not going to look for enough money.  I doubt if there is in the country any fair-minded man with any conception of the services rendered to the country by the I.R.A. who would object to more money for them.  Money will never repay or compensate many of them.  Comparatively very few are left and as the weeks go on I am afraid that the numbers will be reduced.  I would at this stage specially plead with the Minister to take his courage in his hands and look for more money and accept the amendments and then perhaps we will satisfy many of the old soldiers who are left.</P>

      <P>I feel there is a difficulty in closing the debate on the Money Resolution because, if I am to follow the substance of the debate that has taken place, it will be a Second Reading debate I must wind up, but some of the points and speeches which have been made have got to be replied to, and replied to straight away, because we are dealing with people to whom every one of us owes an immense debt of gratitude.  There should be no trickery and no political dodgery about facing up to a Bill of this kind. I can listen with patience and toleration to the word &ldquo;justice&rdquo; being used either from the left or from behind me, but when I hear opposite in connection with a Bill of this kind the words &ldquo;justice&rdquo; and &ldquo;injustice&rdquo; bandied about, then I am entitled to say to Deputy Traynor and all his cohorts that I assume that their conception of justice to the men of the Old I.R.A. was contained in their Act of 1945.  If they did not believe that the Act of 1945 was a just Act, then it was criminal ever to introduce it. What did the Act of 1945, introduced by Deputy Traynor, contain?  It contained Section 5, which slammed and bolted the door on any further hearing of any appeal.</P>

      <P>It did not matter whether it was after 14 or 34.  Your <Col N="1396" /> conception of justice was that in 1945 all justice had been done and that no further case should have the right of appeal either retrospectively or otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true.  That was your idea of justice.  If it was not in your mind justice at that date it was scandalous to pass such a Bill and apply it to the Old I.R.A.  Your idea of justice was that no further I.R.A. claimant should ever get a pension either for the rest of his life or retrospectively.  That was the situation which confronted me as the Deputy's successor and I was satisfied from representations made from all over the country that there were cases which were deserving of a rehearing and that there were cases for which I should establish a board of appeal and that if it were at all possible to do full justice to them and give them their pensions not only for the rest of their lives but retrospectively, I would be anxious to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I went into the whole situation and had to take into account the condition of public finance and the capacity of the people to bear the further demands of a very great, numerous and onerous amount that were being made on the public taxpayer.  I was confronted with the task of deciding whether I could introduce a Bill of this kind, reopening a door and giving not only pensions to Old I.R.A. men for the rest of their lives, but giving them to them for the rest of their lives and in addition giving them a lump sum by way of retrospective payment.  I calculated, or had estimated for me as well as could be done, what would be the cost of one or both; and the decision of the Government&mdash;and the decision I was forced to agree with&mdash;was that the financial commitments of trying to do the two together were too great, that half a loaf was better than no bread and that it would be better to give a pension to those men, successful applicants, for the rest of their lives without retrospective pension application, than to leave them the way Deputy Traynor <Col N="1397" /> left them, without either a pension or any retrospective lump sum.</P>
    <P>I was conscious of the fact that I was not doing as much as I would like to do, but I was doing as much as I could and that is as much as anybody could be expected to do.  If any other Government, in the course of time, is prepared to go the rest of the road, then at all events I was blazing the trail, steam-rolling the road and making it easy for them to go the rest of the way.  I would have the tribunal established, I would have the claims adjudicated on, and there would be nothing to do but for Deputy Traynor, now that he is dressed in sack-cloth and ashes, if he ever sits here again, to issue cheques for the amounts.  I would have established a board, reviewed the assessments of the past and done justice to the appeal.  This is not going the whole road, but I am going a considerable distance along the road, in the direction that most Deputies would like me to go.  The rest of the road I cannot go at the moment, no matter how much I would like to do it.</P>
    <P>I do not want any Deputy to support the Money Resolution, or any further Stages of the Bill, in blinkers.  All I am doing in this Bill is re-establishing a board to rehear cases on appeal, cases that were turned down in the past or cases that never applied in the past.  In so far as I am giving these people another chance for financial recognition for their services in the past, I am wiping out Section 5 of Deputy Traynor's Act and I am reopening at least a little prospect of some recognition with regard to the future.  Now, with regard to the justice or otherwise of whether retrospective payment should be made, I am not going to enter into an argument with any Deputy as to whether these people's claim would not equate with other people's claim with regard to the right to retrospective payment.  I am merely going to say that that bill would be so formidable that we would not be prepared to meet it at the present moment.  In the meantime, we are reassessing their claims, we will issue certificates of service, we will grade those who are successful for pension, and that will clear up much of the road <Col N="1398" /> for any future Government, or for the present Government if financial conditions are easier in the future.</P>
    <P>There is another point I would like to make.  Let us look at one another squarely in the eye and have no squints in our eyes when we are doing it. Deputy Kissane stands up and says: &ldquo;We are not against the Bill, we are for the Bill, but we are going to vote against the section that lays down the operative date.&rdquo;  Deputy Kissane is no chicken in politics or in any other sense of the word.  He knows very well that, if he votes against a section of a Bill that lays down the operative date and carries that section, he leaves the Bill without any operative date and he might as well have the courage to stand up and vote against the Bill, because, in fact, that is what he is doing.  Anybody who supports the evasive stand of Deputy Kissane is voting dead against the measure, killing the Bill and depriving the Old I.R.A. of even the little bit they are to get under the Bill.  I sat over there as well as here and if ever I opposed a measure, I never opposed it in that oblique manner.  I opposed it straight out and took the consequences of my vote.  It is nonsense for the Deputy to say he is supporting the Bill but opposing the operative section of the Bill.</P>
    <P>There is one other point which is of some academic interest to Deputy Traynor and myself.  The Deputy referred to the Act of 1934 and said it did not rob the 1924 Act people of their retrospective rights.  The Deputy read one section of his Act of 1934 and not another.  If he reads Section 16 of the 1934 Act, he will see that, up to the passing of that section, every 1924 Act case had a right to retrospective payment; but from the passing of that section onwards there was no retrospective payment to any 1924 Act case.  I do not necessarily regard precedents laid down by the Deputy or his colleagues in Government as being sacred or anything to be revered, honoured or followed, but I would expect that from the Deputy himself.</P>
    <P>I am moving this Money Resolution in a blunt and straightforward manner, to implement this Bill.  The Bill is <Col N="1399" /> reconstituting the court of appeal to hear cases of people suffering or believed to suffer under an injustice through the Act of 1945 and through previous boards.  I am giving them a right to be reheard, I am reconstituting the board, and any applicant who is successful in the rehearing will get a pension for the rest of his life. Under this Bill, I am unable to give him retrospective payment, but following on this Bill I will have cleared the road, I will have assessed the pension, I will have re-established the board; and if anybody else has the money to go better, I have brought them so far along the road.</P>

There is no use in the Minister telling the House that if this section is defeated the Bill is defeated. He knows that that is mere twaddle. It does not follow at all.

      <P>Deputy Kissane has pointed out here that this is an appeal Bill.  The Minister himself referred to the fact that it is an appeal Bill.  It is merely an appeal of the 1934 Act. Surely whatever is contained in that Act ought to come into operation and the payment of the moneys which will be due to those who succeed under this Bill should be made as from 1st October, 1934.  That is all we are asking the House to do.  We are not worried whether it is passed or not.  I want to assure the House and the Minister&mdash;because he seems to be fearful of it&mdash;that we are not even regarding the defeat of the Government on this as a major issue.  We are prepared, if the House decides to vote against this, to accept it merely as an amendment of something which we object to and not to take it as a major defeat of the Government or anything else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is better to be honest with the House from both sides.  It is all very well for a Deputy opposite to say that a vote on this particular thing will not be regarded as of any importance.  That kind of thing might be convincing if it came from an inexperienced Deputy.  But that kind of superficial, plausible argument coming from a man who sat over here for the best part of a dozen years as a Minister, and when it is in reference to the operative clause of an important Bill, does not carry conviction to my mind and I doubt if it carries conviction to the Deputy's mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a type of argument calculated to deceive and to mislead the inexperienced Deputies who may be present in the House. <Col N="1402" /> Does not Deputy Traynor know that if you leave a Bill of this kind without an operative date, you leave it in a state of suspended animation, neither operative nor inoperative, but floating some feet over the carpet between the two of us?  That is the effect of this particular vote which the Deputy claims will be of no importance.  It is far more honest to tell the House definitely that the vote is of immense importance, that it means the life or death of the particular Bill that is before us.</P>
      <P>The Bill may not be all that any one or every one of us desires, but it is a Bill, stripped naked by me, and laid before the Dáil in all its crude ugliness, and I am saying: &ldquo;There it is for what it is worth.  It is worth something and accept it for what it is worth.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept clearly the position as stated by the Minister as to the effect the rejection of this section would have on the Bill.  I am not what is known as an experienced Deputy; I am an inexperienced Deputy; but I do realise that if this section is taken out of the Bill, the heart is cut out of the Bill and it is useless.  Difficulty, of course, arises form the restrictions imposed on the Dáil.  I have serious objections to the definition of the expression &ldquo;the operative date&rdquo;.  I endeavoured by amendments to meet them.  Those amendments have been ruled out of order.  Consequently, no one in this House, with the exception of the Minister, has any right to put down an amendment that can change the operative date, and if there is no operative date for the Act to take effect, then there is no Act at all.</P>
      <P>That does not mean that I am in favour of the operative date as set out in the section.  I am not in favour of it. I believe that as this is, as the Minister states, an Act having for its purpose the establishment of an appeal tribunal to investigate cases of persons who have grievances, many of them justified, where the appeal is successful, the appellants should be placed in the same position as if they had succeeded in their application in the first instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to take the line of <Col N="1403" /> saying: &ldquo;If we had no change of Government, we would have no Bill&rdquo;. I know that that is so.  I know that the 1945 Act, which has been mentioned here, put an end, as far as the last Government was concerned, to appeals and, whether there were justices or injustices to be done, the door was closed and that was the end of it.  I do not accept the line of saying: &ldquo;That is what you would have done.  If you had been here, you would have done nothing at all.  We propose to go half the way.&rdquo;  I do not agree with that at all.  If a certain number of people succeed in their appeals, it will be clear evidence that they were unjustly deprived of pensions to which they are entitled, and, if they were unjustly deprived of pensions to which they are entitled, it is my view that, as a matter of justice, their pensions should be dated back to the date on which they should have got their pensions under the legislation under which their claims were investigated.  That is my view, but, as I said on the Money Resolution, I am certainly not going to vote against this Bill.  Even with its imperfections, it will bring about a position in which quite a number of people who should be in receipt of certificates of service or military service certificates will get them and will be entitled, as a result, to pensions under the Acts.</P>
    <P>I want to make it perfectly clear that I do not agree with the operative date set out in the section, but I could not bring myself into the position of voting against the section, because, if I did, it would mean that I helped to destroy the Bill as it stands.  I do not know who mentioned the word &ldquo;twisting&rdquo; just now.</P>

It would have been <Col N="1404" /> a good stroke, apart entirely from the question of the justice of the claims, to say: &ldquo;We are going to finish, once and for all, this question of claims to military pensions.  We are setting up this board and giving them full authority to investigate the claims and, in those cases in which they grant the applications, we will let the awards be effective as from the date they should have been effective.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The result of making the operative date the passing of the Act has been to cause a good deal of disappointment, to invite a good deal of criticism and to postpone to another day the final determination of this problem, because the Minister knows very well that if, under this Bill, 1,000 people receive certificates of military service or service certificates under both Acts and are paid their pensions with effect from the operative date set out in the section, they will, by organised effort, bring pressure to bear on Deputies, on the Minister and on the Government to have these pensions paid retrospectively, and that problem will be coming up by means of parliamentary question, by means of deputations to the Minister and by means of political influence and otherwise.  I should like to see the matter settled once and for all, and I think&mdash;and it ought to be acknowledged&mdash;that in introducing this Bill, in making provision for the establishment of this appeal tribunal and in undoing the harm contained in the 1945 Act, the Minister has done very valuable work, but that work has been nullified to a large extent by making the operative date the passing of this Act, instead of making it the effective date under the Acts it purports to amend.</P>

The only person who can do so is the Minister, and if a majority of this House were to decide in favour of having retrospective legislation enacted here to cover claims that will be made under this Bill and to give the claimants payment back to 1st October, 1934, the Minister could meet the position.

      <P>The 1945 Act, piloted through this House by Deputy Traynor, then Minister for Defence, sealed for all time, as far as the Fianna Fáil Government were concerned, the fate <Col N="1407" /> of the Old I.R.A. and left whatever residue of grievances, or alleged grievances that were there, to fester for all time.  I am saying now that there is something dishonest, something more than a breath of suspicion about the action challenging this section.  Why? Because the present Minister, even though he has not given us a perfect Bill, has at least opened up an avenue of hope to Old I.R.A. men, whom you deliberately excluded from all hope.  I say to the country and to the Old I.R.A. men, that I am voting for this Bill and all it contains, because I look upon it as an instalment of the final measure that, like Deputy Cowan, I hope some day is going to settle for all time the just claims of these people and to give justice to those who made it possible for us to argue either for or against their case in this House to-day.</P>

That was, of course, 20 months ago.  On the Second Reading of this Bill I think every Deputy who spoke, on all sides of the House, pleaded that the payments of these pensions should be dated back to the operative date of the 1934 Act.  We found ourselves in the position that we could not get amendments to that effect accepted by the Chair.  The Minister was the only person who could move such an amendment.

      <P>In 1945 an Act was passed by the Fianna Fáil Government after 11 years, after the time for applications had been extended 20 times. Everybody who thought he had a case under that Act got an opportunity of applying even then and amongst those who made all this row were people who have not been able to convince the Referee that they had a case.  This Government has taken the opposite view but we have yet to see how many of these men are going to get through the same machinery as they failed to get through before.  It is the same machinery.  The only difference is that they are getting a further opportunity and if that further opportunity shows that some men were dealt with unjustly before, why are not they getting what they would have got, if their applications had gone through in the first instance?</P>

      <P>If Deputy Traynor in 1945 had done what the Minister proposes to do now with the men who will qualify under this Bill, would the Minister then have urged that it would be sufficient to pay these pensions from the date of the passing of the Bill?  He <Col N="1409" /> certainly would not.  He would have said that they were entitled to draw their pensions from the same date as their comrades, from the 1st October, 1934.  He has now an opportunity of providing for that but he will not avail of that opportunity.  Instead he is threatening his supporters that if they attempt to follow out the opinions they expressed before, it will mean an end of the Bill.  Would he have accepted from Deputy Traynor in 1945 what he said here to-day himself, that it was not all he wished to do but it was all that he could do?  He would not; he would have demanded justice.</P>
      <P>The Minister and Deputy Collins have talked in such a dictatorial manner here to-day that it would seem as if nobody else had a right to express an opinion.  We are here to express our opinions but apparently an attempt is being made to suppress Deputies on this side who expressed their honest views on this matter.  There is nothing inconsistent in our attitude on this Bill, in our saying that if there were any injustices done in the past, we wish to see full justice done now.  I want to stress that no man is going to get anything under this Bill unless he can establish that an injustice was done to him previously.  He is working under the same law and the same machinery as was operated under the previous Acts.  There is no reason whatever, though it may not be the Minister's idea, why any man who qualifies under this Bill should not have his pension dated back to 1934 as were the pensions of his colleagues who qualified under the previous Acts.</P>

It dealt with new classes of people altogether and there is no analogy whatever between this Bill and the 1934 Act in reference to the 1924 Act.  This is definitely an amendment of the 1934 Act.  We have had a lot of hard words thrown across here.  We have never stood for injustice to anyone.  Everybody knows that, if there has been any case of injustice, it was done, not by this Party, but by the Referee and, inadvertently, at that, as will happen.  We have instances of it every other week in the courts.  It is due to human frailty.  That is the reason we are insisting on this, because we do not want injustice done to anybody. I thought that Deputies on the other side, who expressed their views so strongly on the Second Reading, would give us an opportunity of seeing whether they are really the Deputies they were made out to be 20 months ago, or whether they are the yes-men they used to taunt us with being.</P>

    <P>What is this Bill?  This Bill, and the Deputy knows it perfectly well, is brought in for the purpose of giving justice to applicants for military service pensions who were treated in an unfair way both by the Fianna Fáil Administration and, if you like, the Administration that went before it. Deputy Traynor got up in this House before he went out of office and made <Col N="1411" /> a final announcement that the machinery that he had at his disposal for dealing with applications for military service pensions was to come to an end at the end of 1948 and the people who were administering that machinery were being paid off or transferred to other positions.

Deputy Colley has stated&mdash;I hope he is wrong and that the Minister for Defence will correct him and put him right&mdash;that the machinery that is going to operate under this Bill is the same kind of political machinery that operated under the Fianna Fáil Administration.</P>
      <P>We were told repeatedly during the Fianna Fáil Administration that if fresh evidence was put forward on appeal the case would go back to the Referee and be dealt with and the individual concerned I assumed&mdash;I may be wrong in this&mdash;would get an opportunity of making an appearance with the witnesses that he wanted to bring forward to prove that there was new evidence available as justification for the payment of a pension which was not produced at the original hearing.

If any one of these applications was being turned down, the brigade committee was warned of that and given 28 days in which they could bring to the notice of the Referee any evidence which would support the applicant's claim and, perhaps, secure its success.  At the end of 28 days, if the brigade committee had taken no action, then the applicant was given 21 days during which he could appeal himself and produce whatever evidence he thought desirable to prove his claim.</P>

      <P>It may not be relevant to the section.  I admit it is not, but I want to reply to the statement that the 1945 Act prevented men from making their claims.  It has been pointed out by Deputy Colley that for 11 years the system operated under which an applicant who failed to convince the Referee that he had a case was entitled to have his case examined for 28 days by a brigade committee and he was given 21 days after that to make a personal appeal.</P>

      <P>Might I put a question to the Deputy?  The Deputy said that people had an opportunity of making their case to the Referee.  There was a great number of cases that never got before the Referee, and the courts held that the Department was acting illegally in not allowing them to go <Col N="1414" /> before the Referee.  Certain orders had been made absolute.  Before the other 100 odd cases could be made absolute, the Act of 1945 was introduced. It banged the door in the face of all those who had never even got before the Referee.</P>

At the end of that period they were entitled to 21 days' notice, and if, in these 21 days, they could produce further evidence, the Referee was prepared to hear them again.  At the end of that period there was a still further period.  They were allowed to appeal again to the Referee, and to reappeal and reappeal.</P>

      <P>Deputy Davin and other Deputies in this House insisted, over a long period of years, that we <Col N="1415" /> should speed up the hearing of these cases.  It was in order to meet the demand from this House to speed up the hearing of these cases that the action which the Referee then took was taken.  Surely, at the end of 11 years everyone would believe that every possible case that could be heard and that could be appealed was heard and was appealed.  In addition to all that, from the passing of the 1945 Act, 11 months' notice was given to every individual who wished to make an appeal.  It was made very clear that the appeals would be heard within these 11 months. Quite a number of appeals came in and they were heard and dealt with.  Why people should say that we shut, banged and closed the door I cannot understand.</P>
      <P>This Bill purports to be an appeal Bill.  If it purports to be an appeal Bill, all we ask is that, whatever rights an appellant would have under the 1934 Act, he would have them under this amendment of the 1934 Act.  That is all we are asking.</P>

      <P>I want to say a further word in regard to this.  The statement has been made that the Minister has threatened people on this side of the House that they must vote for this section as it stands.  Now, there are only two alternatives.  One is to vote for the section as it stands, and the other is to vote against it.  If the section is negatived by the House, then that is the end of the Bill.  I have made my position clear in so far as I can do so, as to the date from which this measure should operate.  I want to see this Bill passed.  I do not want to see it destroyed at this stage, and it is for that reason I have stated that I must vote for the section and keep the Bill alive rather than vote against it <Col N="1416" /> and kill it.  Opportunities will arise, unfortunately, of pressing the Minister and the Government to change the operative date.  I think that even at this stage, before the Bill finally becomes law, that either here or in the Seanad the Minister should agree to the appeals that have been made to him to change the operative date.</P>
      <P>The 1945 Act has been mentioned. I am glad that that aspect of the 1945 Act has been mentioned, the aspect which said &ldquo;the courts in particular cases have decided that an injustice was done to particular individuals; we will not allow any other person to go to the courts and get a declaration from them that their applications were improperly dealt with by the Referee.&rdquo; That, at the time, was in my view very objectionable legislation.  It can be said that this Bill is undoing that objectionable legislation.  I want to press this point home to the Minister, that if the 1945 Act had not been passed and if those people whose claims were not heard in accordance with the provisions of the 1934 Act, had been unable to go to court to get the declaration that they were entitled to&mdash;not the cases that had already been decided&mdash; they would have had their cases reopened and if they were successful their pensions would have been paid as from the operative date in the 1934 Act.  As far as these particular individuals are concerned, this Bill does not place them in the position they would have been in had the 1945 Act not been passed to deprive them of their rights.  Now, I feel strongly in regard to the operative date in so far as these people are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within the Bill, there is another section of people.  They are the people who never applied either under the 1924 Act or the 1934 Act.  I say that in their cases, where they did not apply under either Act, the same case cannot or ought not to be made for retrospective payments.  The payments in their cases should undoubtedly take effect as from the passing of this Bill or, as I have tried to cover by amendment, from the date they make their applications.  They are in a separate category from the people who have already applied under <Col N="1417" /> the 1924 Act or the 1934 Act and who have been turned down.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated that the cost of this Bill will be approximately £50,000.  Now, I take it that is only what might be termed a reasonable shot in the dark and that such an estimate may be out a considerable sum.  The Minister cannot help that. I think he hit on the figure of £50,000 as, possibly, one which would indicate that there would be a charge of £1,000,000 on public funds in a lump sum if the Act were retrospective.  If more than £50,000 was estimated, naturally the lump sum to be paid as arrears would be larger than that.  I feel, also, that while the interpretation as to active service remains as it is, the number of people who will be successful in having their claims granted will be very small.</P>

I am just putting it from that point of view.  That is why I will press the Minister at this and at subsequent stages and I know he will be so pressed by other Deputies and individuals and organisations both here and in the Seanad, to make the operative date retrospective.</P>

      <P>I think the country would be grateful to the Minister if we got the measure of justice we are pressing for in regard to the Old I.R.A. I press it on the Minister that, if the passing of the 1945 Act deprived individuals of their just rights to a pension, he should, by this measure, restore them to the position they would have been in in 1945 if that Act had not been passed.  It is clear from what <Col N="1418" /> the Minister has said that at this stage he will not make this section retrospective, but I press on him that at some stage before the Bill is made law, he should make it retrospective so that we will not in a year or two have the trouble of a long debate with reference to the amendment of this measure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it hard to understand the basis of Deputy Traynor's objection to the section. His objection is, in effect, an attempt to negative the Bill.  I could understand the arguments advanced by Deputy Traynor if they were advanced from this side of the House, or even by back-bench colleagues of Deputy Traynor's Party, but I cannot understand how Deputy Traynor, who was the author of the 1945 Act, can adopt the self-righteous attitude that he now adopts.  It is inconceivable to me that Deputy Traynor can expect the House to accept seriously his concern that there should be retrospection in so far as these pension payments are concerned, when he was the author of the Act that made it impossible for many of the people whose cases will be governed by this measure to draw one penny pension at all.</P>
      <P>As I said on the Money Resolution, we, in Clann na Poblachta, are not enthusiastic about this particular method of requiting those who gave service to the country in the past, or of dealing with cases of hardship occasioned by service rendered in the past.  We feel and have felt that a preferable way would be to deal with cases of that nature by some generous type of grant where circumstances of hardship exist.  However, the whole body of pension legislation is there and we must accept it as we find it. I, in common with other Deputies, urge on the Minister that if he is to do full justice, the operative date should be the 30th October, 1934, but at any rate, it is preferable that this modicum of justice should be done rather than that no attempt would be made to remedy the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to refer to one matter mentioned by Deputy Cowan and that was the distinction which he sought to draw&mdash;I do not know what were the <Col N="1419" /> motives that prompted him&mdash;between those who applied for pensions prior to the passage of this Act and those who never made any application for a pension.  I do not know what groups of individuals Deputy Cowan has in mind.  If he has in mind those who never made any application for a pension, not on grounds of expediency but on grounds of principle, then it was wrong and incorrect and improper of him to suggest to the Minister that a distinction should be made adverse to their position.  I think it was a pity he did that, not that I think it is a matter of great practical importance, but it is regrettable that Deputy Cowan should single out people who never applied for pensions and never will apply for pensions.</P>

      <P>I am surprised to observe some Deputies trying to blow hot and cold in this matter.  If the passing of the 1945 Act, as is alleged, was an injustice, are we going to have a further injustice perpetrated on the members of the I.R.A. by having the operative date fixed in 1950 or 1951, whereas the pensions payable under the 1924 Act were payable from 1924 and under the 1934 Act from 1934?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>You will now have the unfortunate position of one Old I.R.A. man going to the bank to get his cheque cashed, although he will be paid only from 1950, whereas some of his former comrades have been paid since 1924.  That is a further injustice and it is something that will not be good in the interests of the country. This debate is not what it should be. Payment of pensions or gratuities to Old I.R.A. men should not be treated in this light-hearted political way.  It is a national matter and it should be treated as a national matter and it should not be accompanied by the type of sneers we have been observing here. <Col N="1420" /> I have a definite objection to any of my former comrades being subjected to sneers of any kind.  I want to nail on the head a statement made by Deputy Davin that some of the claims were sent back by the Referee to political organisations supporting the Fianna Fáil Government.  That is untrue.  I challenge anyone to prove otherwise. That statement is, in effect, a reflection on the brigade committees composed, as they were, of former brigade officers of divergent political views.  As a member of one of those advisory boards, I say that the political affiliations of no applicant were taken into consideration.  I can assure the House, on the contrary, that we were doubly careful when we knew a claimant differed from us politically.</P>

      <P>The Minister has told us that this Bill will cost the country about £50,000 a year.  I think that sum is a clear indication that only a few people will qualify.

      <P>Before the Minister replies I would like to make an explanation in regard to an observation of Deputy C. Lehane.  I was trying to draw a distinction between a person who applied for a pension and had his claim turned down and in whose case it will now be found under this Act that that turning down was unjust.  I say that in that case the pension should be paid as from the date it would have been paid had he got justice in the first instance.  In the case of persons who did not apply for pensions at any stage, I think it is reasonable that the operative date in their case should be the passing of this Act.  I have in my mind no particular groups of people at all.  I am quite sure that those who refused pensions under both the 1924 and the 1934 Acts will not apply under this Act.  Their principles will not let them.</P>

      <P>One or two points have come to light in this debate in <Col N="1421" /> which I am interested.  The first is that this Bill is not going to solve our problem.  That is definitely admitted. In fact, it will only go a short distance towards solving it.  With regard to retrospection, a man is either entitled to his pension or he is not.  If he is entitled to his pension, he is entitled to his full pension and he should be paid his pension from the year 1934. If he does not get retrospective payment discontent and dissatisfaction will be created.  Reference was made to political use in relation to this Bill. Political use was made of this Bill during the general election.  Some people get very sore now when reference is made to that.  I say there is no Party that did not make political use of this.</P>

      <P>Reference was made <Col N="1422" /> to legal proceedings and decisions given therein adverse to the Government. The fact that a verdict was given against the Government did not bestow a pension on the applicants.  It is no good implying the Act was faulty when the verdict did not in fact succeed in getting pensions for these people.  I appeal to the Minister to make the payment of these pensions retrospective.  I think all of us try to keep Party politics out of a matter like this.  Our main object is to do justice to these men.  There may be some legal quibbles.  I am not a lawyer, but legal quibbles do not give much satisfaction to people who have expectations.  I appeal to the Minister to make the payment of these pensions retrospective, if not for the whole period for at least some portion of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am giving notice that I intend to oppose this section. This section extends the powers of the Minister in regard to deduction from pensions.  It extends the powers that are in the 1924 and the 1934 Acts and it makes provision that I think will be unworkable in practice.  In the rules and regulations in other pension Acts this new clause has been introduced, enabling the Minister to withhold pensions until the amount of a deduction has been ascertained.  Sub-section (3) says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;for the purposes of this section each of the following shall be a State authority:&mdash;A Minister of State, the Commissioners of Public Works or the Irish Land Commission&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As I see and understand it, quite a number of people who are in receipt of pensions under the 1924 and 1934 Acts are farmers who owe and pay money as annuities to the Irish Land Commission, and I think it will create a lot of confusion if the Irish Land Commission has to keep records of pensions, and whenever a person who pays annuities is in arrears, notify the Department of Defence to have that man's pension withheld.  It can create a lot of confusion and trouble, but the Minister will be able to tell us how it works out in practice.  I think that where a pension is payable by the Minister it should be payable and payable on the date it falls due for payment and if the Minister, the Commissioners of Public Works, the Irish Land Commission or any other public authority has a claim against an individual they have all the rights in law to follow that claim to the extent of obtaining a decree in the ordinary way.</P>

      <P>I am not saying that the right to set off is there but even <Col N="1425" /> if it were provided I would go a long way to accept it.  The administration will be somewhat involved because a State Department must have a record and if a man who falls into arrears is in receipt of a pension the Department of Defence will be notified to hold it up in order to meet a possible claim until the amount to be withheld is ascertained.  It will be withheld while the claim against the man is being formulated and that may be quite a long period.  There is a novel extension of powers in the section and for that reason I oppose it.</P>

      <P>Heretofore the phraseology was &ldquo;State Department&rdquo;. The only difference between the phraseology of previous Bills and this one is that &ldquo;State Department&rdquo; has been clarified more in this Bill than in the previous Bills.  The administrative or machinery difficulties which have been pointed out have been there all the time and surmounted.  I think that most Deputies will agree that it is reasonable if the State is making issues of money to an individual or credit corporation and there are moneys due on the other hand to the State, that those moneys should be subtracted before the issues are made.  The point I want to make to Captain Cowan is that there is nothing original in this section.  It is really a copy of sections that have appeared in all Army and Defence Forces Bills since 1923 up to the present moment.  They have never given rise to any particular difficulty in the way of machinery nor to any particular grievances on the part of the recipients or potential recipients.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply to Deputy Cowan's opposition to the section, I wonder would the Minister indicate to the House whether he would consider introducing a Ministerial amendment <Col N="1426" /> or addition to the section limiting the period during which payment might be withheld by inserting into sub-section (2) some words of limitation as to time?  I have had experience of collecting pensions from a section of the Department of Defence, particuarly in cases where an amount was due to a deceased pensioner.  I cannot recall any case where there was what could be described as gross or undue delay, but I think that the Minister's point would be met and Deputy Cowan's fears allayed if the Minister were to put in some reasonable words of limitation as to period in sub-section (2) or if the Minister had an additional sub-section to the section.  I would recommend that course to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I remember the section that was in the 1924 and 1934 Acts, although I have not the section before me at the moment.  I think this sub-section (2), which authorises the Minister to withhold the amount until the deduction is ascertained, is comparatively new and has been introduced only in recent Army legislation. Under the 1924 and 1934 Acts&mdash;and the Minister will correct me if I am wrong, as I am speaking from recollection&mdash;the Minister had power to withhold to meet a claim; but now, where there is what may be termed a contingent or possible claim and the Minister is notified of that, although the claim may not be clearly formulated and may not exist at all, the Minister gets power under sub-section (2) to withhold the pension until the deduction is ascertained. I think that was not in the 1924 or 1934 Acts and that it has been introduced only recently in Army legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have argued this on another Bill and was not able to carry the House with me against the Minister; and I cannot do more now than express my objection to this wide power of withholding the pension until the amount of a claim is ascertained. Where a man has a pension and is depending on it, say, to pay his land annuity, it would be entirely wrong that the pension should be held up because he owes the land annuity.  In such a case, it would be much better <Col N="1427" /> to pay him and let the Land Commission use whatever powers they have to recover the annuity in the ordinary way.  I do not know whether the Land Commission, in actual fact, have up to the present been endeavouring to obtain land annuities through the machinery of the Department of Defence, but when this section is passed I am quite sure they would endeavour to avail of it.  Where a man's annuity is in arrear for a few weeks and would be paid if he got the pension, it is wrong to withhold it because the annuity was not paid on the due date.  The Land Commission may not avail of this section at all, where a man happens to be a few weeks in arrear, but I think this extensive provision, to withhold a pension until a possible claim is definitely ascertained, is giving too much power to the Minister for Defence and to his Department in administering the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Those powers have been there previously.  They may be used with regard to a debt due to the Department of Defence before they issue money out; but no case has ever come under my attention so far of any grievance arising out of the power to withhold the pension pending a possible claim by any other State Department. The particular section here is not a mandatory one: it is a permissive section, and the same permissive section is in the previous Acts.  It would be entirely unreasonable for the Land Commission, say, to make an application to the Minister for Defence saying: &ldquo;This man is three months in arrears with his land annuity; until we see how this shapes out, we will hold up his pension.&rdquo;  Certainly my instruction, and the instruction of any reasonable Minister for Defence under such circumstances, is that there would be no justification for such a step.  I put it to Deputies that this is one of those powers that may be given to a Minister and that would be bad if they were abused, but until there is sufficient evidence that they are being or have been abused by a Minister, I think they are reasonable powers to give to him.  However, such powers, in the <Col N="1428" /> main, whether as detailed as this or not, have been vested in the Minister for Defence away back from 1923 and I have never heard of a case where they were abused.</P>

      <P>I would ask the Minister to add to Section 7 at this stage a clause giving him the necessary authority, in the case of any person in respect of whom the board of assessors report that he had rendered military service in Oglaigh na hÉireann, to award to that person a gratuity for each year of service.  I believe that would not cost a terrible lot and that it would be a good thing.  I know hundreds of former members of Oglaigh na hÉireann who would be satisfied with an extension of that kind.</P>
      <P>There will be border-line cases, of men who gave good service for many years to the State and who helped in no small way to establish its independence. I am sure that no person in receipt of a pension would dare to claim that it was he, or all the pensioners taken together, who secured the independence of the country.  Were it not for the help of many of these men who have not qualified, I feel sure that our fight with Britain would have been prolonged and might not have been so successful.  Therefore, I would appeal to the Minister to accept my suggestion. I believe I speak with good knowledge of many of my former comrades who have been disappointed in the matter of pensions, when I say that acceptance would end the suffering and that we would hear no more about pensions.</P>

      <P>With regard to the suggestion that has been made by Deputy Davern, that would introduce a completely new principle that is not running through either the Act of 1924 or the Act of 1934.

      <P>In spite of the Minister's opinion in respect of my attitude on this Bill, I want to congratulate him on bringing in this particular section. The Bill is divided into parts and Parts II and III are duplications so that what we say in respect to one part practically applies to the other.  I am glad to be in a position to congratulate the Minister on this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned this matter to the Minister on the occasion of the Estimate. I quoted a case which was only one of a number of similar cases.  I do not want again to quote the case.  It was a case of a very minor assault.  It was merely a domestic squabble.  The unfortunate pair who squabbled lost a pension of some value, I think it was about £30.  The result was that, in addition to the sentence of imprisonment imposed upon the husband, there was a fine of a colossal amount.  The only criticism I have to make is that it is a pity that the Minister is limited to the date on which he can restore that pension.  The fine was an abnormal fine and the judge who passed the sentence did not for a moment believe that, in addition to the sentence, he was inflicting that fine.  This section limits the Minister to the operative date again and I think that is a pity. I hope the Minister will look into the matter rather quickly because in some cases it would be urgent.  I am sure that when he is operating this particular section he will take into consideration the type of case with which he is dealing.  There will be certain <Col N="1431" /> cases where he and the Minister for Finance may not desire to restore the pension at all but there will be others where, if it were possible to go back and to pay the pension over a period of some years, it would be doing only the smallest possible amount of justice. However, limited as it is, I want to congratulate the Minister on introducing this particular section into the Bill.</P>

I would ask the Minister to consider that point because there are cases that I have in mind which deserve sympathetic consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to mention for the Minister's consideration cases which are undoubtedly cases of hardship. Nothing could be done in relation to amending this Bill on Committee Stage by any Deputy, but there is no doubt at all that it will be necessary for the Minister to review all these cases of pensions, because the increase granted does not meet the case of quite a number of people who are receiving pensions under the Army Pensions Acts.  While the increases granted are welcomed, there are many cases of grave hardship.</P>
      <P>I came across a case the other day of a man who had lost a leg as a result, I think, of a wound and whose pension was about £1 1s. 0d. per week. It has been increased by some 8/- and he now has roughly £1 8s. 0d. per week. Obviously, that pension for such a man is entirely inadequate.  Just to-day, I got by post particulars of an individual to whom a pension of 18/1 per week was granted.  He has never taken up his pension because he considered it entirely inadequate.  He was a soldier, and his case is one about which quite a number of Deputies, according to the file I got, were in touch with the Department.  He lost the use of his hand while working as a baker in the bakery at the Curragh. He is completely unable to use one hand and he received an original pension of 18/1 per week.  He would be entitled to a certain increase under this Bill, but that increase is not adequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are entirely in the hands of the Minister and of the Department of Finance as regards the amounts paid as pensions, but I urge that something <Col N="1434" /> might be done to increase the basic pensions of men who are absolutely unable to earn a livelihood.  This Bill increasing pensions is undoubtedly welcome, but the Minister himself knows that there are cases of hardship. I have been approached in regard to three or four of these cases in the past few days, and I avail of this opportunity to ask the Minister to take power at the earliest possible date to review cases such as those I have mentioned, so that any person who has lost the ability to earn a livelihood, because of service in the Defence Forces, may be awarded a pension which will enable him to live, not in luxury, but in reasonable comfort.</P>

      <P>I should like to support Deputy Cowan's plea.  It has come to my knowledge that there are quite a few very deserving cases of general disability and of inability to earn a livelihood by reason of an infirmity.  An increase has been granted, but it is not adequate to meet the needs of these people and to enable them to carry on, and, in dealing with this matter, the Minister should consider such cases of general disability, cases of men who, during the past year or so, have become totally incapacitated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The case made by Deputy Cowan and supported by Deputy Burke is a genuine case.  The unfortunate thing about all these wounds and disability pensions Acts is that different rates of pensions are set out in the different Acts and what was reasonable and generous in 1923, in the conditions that existed in 1923, is only a pittance in 1949.  You have cases where the disability is the same but where very different rates of pension are fixed.  It is all very involved and complicated, and I think it was worked out very successfully, with the money available, by the people dealing with it.  We tried so far as possible to equate similar pensions with similar disabilities. The case made by the Deputies will certainly be looked into and considered with a view to future action.</P>

    <P>There is one case to which I want specially to draw the attention of the Minister, namely, the case of these men for whom we made strong appeal to the Minister in this House over a long period.  These are the soldiers who were encouraged to take their discharge before the increased pension became payable.  The Minister has availed of this opportunity to make their increases effective as on the 1st April, 1949.  I hope I am correct in that but those particular soldiers feel that there is due to them, as a measure of justice, approximately two years' increases in pension.  I think it has been stressed to the Minister by the representatives of the soldiers and it has been put to the Minister very frequently in this House that the pensions should be increased as from the date which should have applied to <Col N="1436" /> them, that is from the date of the all-round increases.  I would ask the Minister to consider that again so that these people will have that source of grievance and injustice removed.</P>
    <P>There is one other section which deals with the payment of married pensions. Under the regulations, a soldier is married, for the purpose of the Act, and the regulations, if he is in receipt of a marriage allowance at the date of his discharge.  That has operated harshly in some cases.  There is one particular case to which I have already drawn the Minister's attention.  I asked him a question about it the other day.  The Minister was not available and it was answered for him by a Parliamentary Secretary.  I had in mind raising the question on the Adjournment, with the consent of the Ceann Comhairle, and perhaps I might take the opportunity of raising it now.</P>
    <P>This particular soldier was married during his service, and his wife, not being able to find married quarters in the Curragh or in the vicinity of the Curragh, where her husband was stationed, had to leave.  She went over to live with relatives in England.  She received in the ordinary way her pay cheque, and, being a very honest woman, instead of doing, perhaps, what a number of people might have done, namely, endorsing it and sending it home to her husband to cash, she wrote to the Minister and asked him to make it payable to her in England. Of course, the Department of Defence investigated it and, under a section of the Defence Forces regulations, it was held that she was living apart from her husband &ldquo;not in accordance with the exigencies of the service&rdquo;.  In other words, if she had lived anywhere this side of the Irish Sea she would have been separated from her husband &ldquo;in accordance with the exigencies of the service&rdquo;, but by going further afield it was held that she was not and she was refused her marriage allowance. So far so good.</P>
    <P>When this soldier, after many years of very satisfactory service in the military police, retired he applied in the ordinary way for a married pension, but the Department of Defence <Col N="1437" /> said: &ldquo;Well, under the regulations you were not in receipt of a marriage allowance at the date of discharge and, therefore, for our purposes you are not a married soldier at all and we shall not give you a married pension&rdquo;.  I think that is inequitable and unfair and I do not think it would stand up to any consideration at all on any moral grounds.  I do not think the number of people affected in that way are many, but a man who has rendered very fine service as this particular N.C.O. did in the military police, particularly seeing that the State was saved the payment of any marriage allowance to his wife during his whole service for the reasons I have stated, is at least entitled to a pension as a married man.  Such a pension could have been paid under these regulations. I would press the Minister to consider the case of that individual and others similarly circumstanced so that justice&mdash;we have been talking about justice all day&mdash;may be done to the parties concerned.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Committee Stage of the Bill there was an amendment by Deputy <Col N="1438" /> Lemass which I accepted, subject to the addition of some words making it mandatory to come to the Dáil for its approval by resolution before any member of either House of the Oireachtas could be appointed a director of the agency.  I take it that the amendment will be accepted.</P>

      <P>I would have preferred the amendment, without the exception in it which contemplates the possibility of a member of the Oireachtas being a director of the agency with the approval of Dáil Éireann.  In so far as the amendment is a step towards the provision I wished to have in the Bill, it is acceptable to me.  I think the Minister will have some difficulty in the Seanad because, unless the Seanad has changed considerably since my time in office, they will not agree to this power of approval being confined to members of the Dáil.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2 in the name of Deputy McCann:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 3, before Section 9, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The rates of pay and other conditions of service of journalists employed by the agency shall be regulated in accordance with agreements to be from time to time made between the trade unions representative of such journalists of the one part and the agency of the other part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the course of the discussion in Committee a suggestion was made by some Deputies that the anxiety which journalists have expressed relative to the employment to be given by the agency could be met by inserting a provision in this Bill that the journalists to be employed should be members of trade unions.  The Minister thought that that would be an unprecedented step and, in fact, instanced the railways in the course of his argument. This amendment is an adaptation of a provision of the Railways Act, 1933, which requires that the rates of pay and conditions of service of railway employees must be settled in accordance with the agreements made <Col N="1439" /> between railway companies and the trade unions representative of railway workers.  The whole of that particular section of the Railway Act would not be suitable to this Bill, but, in so far as it was possible to do it, I have attempted to secure the adaptation of that section to this Bill.  If the amendment were carried it would have, I think, indirectly the effect desired by some Deputies of ensuring that journalists employed would be members of recognised trade unions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to accept the intention behind the amendment. I think the intention is quite a good and proper one.  There are some difficulties, however, in incorporating it in the Bill, because immediately I visualise that the news agency will have an office in America and England. At some later stage, if we are successful, it may branch off further afield.  I think any amendment of the nature proposed would create difficulties in that eventuality.  I do not know enough about journalists' trade unions in different parts of the world to know whether it would be feasible, but it would be difficult to be placed in a position to have to conclude agreements with trades unions in other countries.  While accepting the intention behind the amendment, so far as I am concerned I am quite prepared to assure the House that I will do everything I can to ensure that trade union journalists will be employed.  I do not think I can accept the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make it clear that our opposition to this Bill has not been abated by anything which happened during the course of its discussion in Committee.  In fact, if anything, that opposition has been strengthened because we were unable to extract from the Minister the detailed information as to the function or method of working of the agency which we think the House should have. The Minister assumed that opposition to this Bill was prompted mainly by antagonism to himself, but he was wrong in that.  The anxieties and suspicions which we entertain are, I think, natural to the members of a democratic Parliament when they find the Government proposing to engage in news agency activities involving the expenditure of public money on a substantial scale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has spoken here about other European countries and news agencies that exist in them and has advanced as one argument in favour of the Bill that most other European countries have a news agency of some sort.  He is possibly aware of the fact that in France, one of the countries he mentions, the Havas Agency, one of the agencies he mentioned, was recently the subject of considerable controversy arising out of a proposal of the French Government to subsidise it, to turn it into the type of agency which, I think, the Minister intends to establish under this Bill.  That opposition which developed there, and which was, in fact, expressed in newspapers circulating outside France, was also due to the feeling which people have that the operation of Government news agencies has been, up to the present, mainly a function of dictatorial Governments and that the extension of <Col N="1441" /> that function to democratic Governments is an unhealthy sign.</P>
    <P>It is not true that this country is being seriously prejudiced by the fact that there is not a commercial news agency here.  So far as I know, the existing news agencies that serve newspapers here and abroad are mainly commercial undertakings.  There is a number of them working in competition, and it is not unusual for a newspaper to discontinue the service of a particular agency if it believes that it is not getting from it proper news coverage, and it would almost certainly happen if there was any suspicion that the news supplied was being coloured for propaganda reasons.  These commercial agencies securing business in competition with one another are not free to become propagandist organisations or to colour the news which they supply, because any suspicion that they were acting in that way would lead immediately to a loss of business. The fact that there is no commercial news agency here is, as I stated during the Second Reading debate, due largely to the fact that the newspaper organisations in this country are not numerous enough or wealthy enough to support it.  The principal news agency supplying news here, the &ldquo;Press Association&rdquo;, was established by a number of American newspapers on a co-operative basis to cover their own needs in international news, and if we had here newspapers, nearly as numerous or half as wealthy as the newspapers of the United States, a news agency service established on a commercial basis to serve a similar purpose for Irish newspapers would have existed long ago.  It is only in relation to international news that papers require the services of a Press agency. All the Irish newspapers, as Deputies know, cover events happening within Ireland by their own permanent staffs, or local correspondents, and they could not possibly maintain, and, in fact, would have little reason to maintain, a world-wide news agency to give them news coverage from all corners of the globe.  The news coverage which they get through the existing agencies is ample.  Every newspaper takes the service of more than one agency, and there is ample opportunity to ensure <Col N="1442" /> that news does not reach their readers in any tendentious form, because the competitive element between the agencies ensures that they will have full stories relating to every event from independent sources.</P>
    <P>I think the same is true of news about this country going abroad.  It is not true to say that there are only British representatives here.  Most of the international agencies have their correspondents here, including the Havas Agency, as the Minister knows.  Newspapers abroad are in precisely the same position as newspapers here in that they have independent supplies of news from competitive sources on which they can rely.</P>
    <P>I doubt very much if this agency can establish itself anywhere as a commercial news agency.  It cannot possibly hope to give a service that will compete with the commercial agencies. Because it is established under Government auspices and because it will not be dealing with the ordinary day to day news which news editors desire to obtain, it will be suspect from the start as a propagandist agency, and, like all the material that comes to every newspaper from propagandist agencies, it will be put mainly on the editor's spike.  The effective work which this agency can do is very limited.  Its cost, apparently, is going to be quite high, and I doubt if we are going to get value for the money we have voted.  Its doubtful value and its high cost, associated with the general objection there is to Governments dabbling in news, even when they profess their desire to do it for patriotic or other beneficial purposes, justify our opposition to the Bill.  That opposition, as I say, has not been abated in the slightest.  I think we must indicate that fact by a vote on the Final Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been opposed to this measure on all stages.  I was opposed to it, in the first instance, because I thought that the problem had not been worked out as it should have been and that, to a large extent, this Bill and the agency it proposes to set up are in the nature of a shot in the dark.  Now, on an early stage of the Bill the problem of Partition was mentioned&mdash;and <Col N="1443" /> that the agency created by the Bill would be an effective instrument in drawing the attention of the world to the evils of Partition.  I felt that there had been what I may term a letting down by the Bill of the enthusiasm that had been created not so long ago in regard to Partition.  I felt that that enthusiasm in regard to Partition had been created on a nationwide scale, and that the young people particularly had been given the idea that some leadership should be given to them in regard to this problem of Partition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that the Bill, as it is now before the House, will have the effect of damping whatever enthusiasm had been created, and to that extent it is objectionable.  I do not like the sort of company that is visualised in the Bill&mdash;the setting up of a news agency which, as has been pointed out, is not a news agency at all, and the formation of a company which is really not a company.  I felt, and I still feel, that the sum of money mentioned by the Minister&mdash;£25,000 a year&mdash;will be largely thrown down the drain, because I am informed by experienced journalists that most of the material emanating from news agencies of this type finds its way into the wastepaper basket.  If that is so, we will be paying a very large sum of money for something which will be no effective instrument from the national point of view.  The Bill proposes, as one of its objects, to put our case in regard to Partition before the world.  I feel the world knows all that there is to be known in regard to the evil of Partition &mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that it is not by writing more or talking more about that evil that it will be ended in our time.  Twenty-five thousand pounds may be an accurate estimate or it may be inaccurate; it may be much above the mark or it may be below the mark, <Col N="1444" /> but it is a round figure, anyway, of the approximate cost of this agency for a year.  That works out roughly at £300 a week.  I think that £500 a week could be better spent than in the way this Bill proposes to spend it.  A hundred men now unemployed receiving £5 a week would contribute more to the benefit of the country than £25,000 spent in this way.  I may be wrong, and I hope I am.  When we have as a Parliament adopted a measure of this kind, every one of us must wish that it will have some success.  How can we find out what the success of this measure will be?  Will it be possible for the news agency itself to let us know how many words produced by it find publicity in the journals of foreign nations?  If we could have that, it would be of some help to us.</P>
      <P>At all stages of the Bill I expressed my doubts as to its utility and its ultimate success, but if, notwithstanding what I have said, the venture is a success, there will be no one more ready than I to acknowledge my mistake in regard to it.  I hope my view is mistaken. Twenty-five thousand pounds may seem a small sum so far as the country is concerned, but nevertheless, it is a substantial sum and if it is to be expended it ought to be expended on the achievement of something worth while.  I know the Minister will have difficulties in finding his board of directors, his staff and his advisory board, and it is quite possible some of the matters arising out of the exercise of those powers may come before the House from time to time, particularly on the Estimates.</P>
      <P>Having opposed the Bill at every stage, I feel, now that it is about to pass through the House, it should, in its infancy, get a reasonable chance; in other words, if there is criticism to be levelled at the agency in its operation, that criticism should be withheld for such time as will give the agency an opportunity of finding its feet.</P>

      <P>This Bill, now in its Fifth Stage, is reasonably certain of becoming law, not particularly on its merits, but largely by reason of the machined majority of the Government. I feel, and in fact I am convinced, that there are many Deputies on the <Col N="1445" /> Government Benches who are less keen on the passage of this Bill than some of us on the Opposition Benches. However, we have now reached the stage when almost of a certainty some £25,000 will be voted out of public funds for a certain service.  I think the time is opportune to examine what means we have of providing this service before this measure sees the light of day.  When this Government came into power they had the best means of providing the service this Bill proposes to provide and that was a short-wave station.</P>

If the tactics of the Opposition were obstructionist, I think they were justified by virtue of the contents of the Bill.  It might be useful to examine to what extent the obstructionist charge is justified.  So far as I can assess, the Second Stage took six and a half hours.  The Committee Stage lasted about eight hours, so up to this we devoted some 15 hours to the consideration of the Bill.  I think that answers any charge of obstruction on our part.  I think I might be allowed to refer to a statement issued by the Government Information Bureau when the Bill was under consideration before the Summer Recess.</P>

      <P>I think the public know very well what this Bill seeks to enact. It is seeking to put before the world at large views of value and interest concerning this country that the Minister and the Government feel should be put before the world.  Before ever the Bill was introduced, we had sufficient means adequately to put before the world the Irish viewpoint on every topic of interest to the country.  I suggest that this Bill cannot do much more than could be done with the services that existed when the Government came into power.  Those services were quite capable of providing all that this measure seeks to provide.</P>

The amount involved is not very great and after a year or two it would be quite easy to close it down if the service did not pay.  Deputy Cowan said that the world knows all about Partition.  I am satisfied the world does not know and if this Bill merely serves to make known to the world the injustice of Partition, it will be doing a really good day's work.  I have been in America for four years in succession.  I have visited numerous Irish clubs throughout the length and breadth of the United States of America and, as a result of my experience, I say without fear of contradiction that there are hundreds of thousands of our people abroad who do not know the true story of Partition.  At least the Bill will serve the useful purpose of informing those people and all others who are interested as to what the real story is. At least in that respect this Bill will do a good day's work.  The amount involved is very small.  I appeal to both sides to support the Bill and to give it a fair trial.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>The agency operated in Sweden is State operated and is controlled by the Swedish Parliament. At every stage of this measure objections were advanced.  We had objection to the type of company; we had objection to the share capital; we even had objection to the minutiae, such as the question as to whether or not it should be a State solicitor or a solicitor in private practice who would draft the articles of association.  No measure that has gone through this House since I came into it some 20 months ago, with the possible exception of the Local Authorities (Works) Act, has received the raking criticism from the Opposition that this Bill has received.  I must confess that the high hopes I had for this news agency have greatly diminished as a result of the attitude adopted by the Opposition and, indeed, by Deputies on the Government Benches too, who were critical of the measure.  The argument was advanced by Deputy Lemass that a Government news agency such as this was bound to be received with suspicion by newspaper people all the world over.  I think I am entitled at least to challenge contradiction on this: I think that the attitude adopted by both Deputy Lemass and Deputy Captain Cowan, who were the two main critics of this measure, was an attitude calculated to engender that very suspicion which, they suggested, was one <Col N="1448" /> of the reasons why they would withhold their support from the Bill.  I believe that, if there had been a cooperative approach from both sides of the House, we would have been able to set up a news agency competent to put Ireland's case before the world in the way it should be put and in the way it has not been put up to this.</P>

Even at this late hour I believe it should be possible, with the co-operation of the Opposition, to give a fair trial to this vehicle which the Bill proposes to set up.

      <P>The Bill, as it now appears before us, has gone through the amending stage and the Opposition has failed to carry any amendments which might to some extent have satisfied their misgivings in connection with the provisions of the Bill.  Our approach to the Bill was a serious and a conscientious one.  We felt that £25,000 a year was involved in it.  We are responsible for the taxpayers' money and it is our duty to examine closely any proposal that comes before us which involves the expenditure of their money.  Once we had made up our minds that the money involved in this would be money wasted, it was our duty in those circumstances to oppose the Bill as vigorously as we could.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am afraid that the Minister and some members of the Government do not fully appreciate the fundamentals of our parliamentary system.  There is a great difference between obstruction and conscientious opposition.  I do not think we could be accused of deliberately obstructing this measure from a purely parliamentary point of view, <Col N="1449" /> appreciating the traditions of a democratic parliamentary system.  The fact that we are accused of obstruction is not used so much for the purpose of argument here as for outside advertisement, particularly in election campaigns where we are subjected to all manner of distorted and exaggerated criticism accusing us of obstruction towards every measure brought forward by the Government.  We have adopted a consistent policy of supporting the Government where the measures proposed by them were for the general good of the country.  Where we felt public money was being wasted, we have opposed the Government as vigorously as we could oppose them.  Perhaps on some occasions we have not opposed them sufficiently vigorously.</P>
    <P>Deputy Captain Cowan was, I think, the most severe critic of this measure. Possibly he has taken more time in the House to criticise this Bill than has any other Deputy.  To-night we are faced with a <i>volte face.</i>  He makes us giddy by telling us at the last moment that we should accept the Bill.  Once an individual makes up his mind to oppose something, it is difficult to understand how he can at the last minute turn round, accept it and support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that. What I did say was that when it becomes law, give it a reasonable time before we start to criticise it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the amendment on the part of the Deputy.  The case of Sweden has been instanced.  We are all very interested in the bulletin which is issued from the Swedish Legation.  Surely a bulletin similar to that could be issued through the ordinary channels of the legation.  Further, we do not see anything quoted from these bulletins in the daily papers.  They are very valuable from the point of view of giving information to people in influential positions.  All propaganda, from the Irish point of view, should aim at influencing influential people.  If we could bring such influence to bear upon the great British newspapers and the big American newspapers or upon people who really can swing decisions in the Government, we feel that it would be <Col N="1450" /> infinitely better than spending money on a news agency which, everybody knows, however well-intentioned, represents a point of view and not just factual news without a tendency one way or the other.  Therefore, our attitude in regard to the matter is that we think that if money is to be spent on propaganda it should be spent in a different way.  I am as keen as anybody to have proper propaganda carried out and I have had some little experience in that respect.  I think there are ways in which it could be done infinitely better than this way.  We honestly feel that this money is going to be wasted and that, after a few years, we shall find that the project will probably be brought to a conclusion because it has ceased to serve a useful purpose.</P>

I differ from a number <Col N="1451" /> of speakers when they say that damage has been done by the criticism that has been made.  I think a lot of good has come out of the criticism.  We got certain guarantees from the Minister. We are told that he has satisfied the journalists and those interested in trade union matters.  I was one of the first to encourage the Minister, and I compliment him on bringing in the Bill.</P>
      <P>I have been going round a little bit and, in other countries, I have heard and read in the newspapers attacks on our country.  If, through this Bill, the agency can take up the defence of this country and not allow these lying attacks and misrepresentation of our country go without contradiction, and if they are able to contradict those who slander our country and misrepresent it, I think it will be the best £25,000 ever spent by any Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>The alternative to the creation of the news agency proposed by this Bill would be that we <Col N="1452" /> should voluntarily debar ourselves from ensuring that news of Ireland&mdash; economic news, cultural news, political news and general news&mdash;should be presented to the world through Irish spectacles.  I want to make it clear that I do not say that all news emanating from Ireland is deliberately distorted. Sometimes I think it is.  Some portion of the news sent out from this country is deliberately distorted, not here but elsewhere.  But what happens in the bulk of cases is that news is sent out from here, sifted and sub-edited&mdash; usually in London&mdash;by journalists who are, maybe, very good journalists but who are not familiar with Irish politics or Irish events, who have preconceived views about Ireland and who like to look upon Irish events as matters of amusement, usually.  Accordingly, we inevitably get a slant and a slant which is usually unfavourable to this country. Apart from that, we very often suffer from non-publication of news which is favourable to this country.  I say that that very often happens because the news is dealt with by people who are not interested in Ireland.  Take, for instance, the journalist or the subeditor who has to choose between an item of news which is an English item and an item of news which is an Irish item to send out to the world.  If he is an Englishman he will, naturally, be more interested in the English item of news and he will, accordingly, send it out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>References have been made by speakers to the obstruction in the course of the passage of the Bill.  I think that if Deputy Lemass is candid with himself he will realise that there has been obstruction.  It may be due to irritation.  I do not know what it is due to, but now the Bill is about to pass and I would appeal to Deputy Lemass and to the Opposition to accept it wholeheartedly as a useful instrument of publicity for this country and to co-operate with the Government in the working of the news agency.  Deputy Lemass based his argument to-day on the Fifth Stage on the ground that there was no necessity for such a news agency, that there was no need to put out news about Ireland, that another agency is doing it and doing it very <Col N="1453" /> efficiently and that there was no distortion. That is not the view which Deputy de Valera expressed when he spoke on this Bill on the Second Stage. I quote from the Official Reports of the 13th July of this year where Deputy de Valera said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The need of putting Ireland's case before the world and of having Irish news objectively reported is very real.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That seems to be in complete conflict with the attitude Deputy Lemass took up to-day.  Earlier, on the 20th July of this year, Deputy de Valera, speaking in this House, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is only those who have been away from this country for any length of time can realise the importance of that contact.  Newspapers in other countries, if they carry any information at all about this country, it will be, you may be sure, information in the main that is to our detriment. It is about something sensational that has happened in this country and the unfortunate thing is that those who get only the sensational are inclined to think that the sensational is the normal, as it is the only information that they get. They get some wrong impressions of this country just as we might, for instance, get a wrong impression of a city like Chicago from the way in which certain happenings in that city were depicted here.</P>
    <P>Apart from the accidental circumstance, due to the nature of news, that it is only sensational things as a rule that are sent abroad, there is the fact that in the past there has been deliberate propaganda against our country.  It was one of the means by which the Power that held this country in the past tried to justify its hold on it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I could not agree more with every word Deputy de Valera said in these passages and they emphasise the importance and necessity of ensuring that Irish news will be presented to the world from an Irish viewpoint and through Irish spectacles and not left to be presented through the spectacles of another nation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course.  There was never any suggestion to put any bar or restrictions on any news agency.  In the Bill it was never suggested that anything of that kind was sought or contemplated.  We are merely doing by this Bill what every other country in Europe has done years ago.  Deputy Lemass referred to the Havas agency. I had the honour of being on the staff of the Havas News Agency for a number of years.  The Havas News Agency has been subsidised by the French Government for years back.</P>

      <P>No, it is this side of the Iron Curtain I am talking about at the moment.  Inside, of course, they are completely controlled, there is no alternative.  I am talking about democratic countries in Western Europe. There is no democratic country in Western Europe that has not got its own news agency.  In some cases they have two Government sponsored and subsidised agencies.</P>
      <P>I need not talk in the abstract of the need for such an agency.  We had one case here not very long ago during the elections in the Six Counties.  A message was sent out by a reputable and very well known news agency from Belfast giving an account of some disturbances that took place at some election meetings.  The House may remember that there were some disturbances in the course of some Labour Party election meetings in Belfast held by Mr. Beattie.  The House may remember the descriptions in our newspapers here of oranges containing razor blades being thrown at the meetings and speakers being injured.  I can show to this House reports published in the Press of the world saying that these were Loyalist meetings broken up by republican desperadoes who used razor blades and that Mr. Beattie was in effect a Partitionist candidate.  They went all over the world.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give the Deputy further details.  That story was properly reported, as far as I could place it, from Belfast.  The distortion occurred in London and travelled all over the world.  I have stacks of copies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I know it left Belfast correctly and reached New York, Melbourne and all over the world distorted and was published by <Col N="1456" /> the newspapers distorted.  I got the most fulsome apology from the news agency concerned and they corrected it two days after, but I did not see one single correction published.  Naturally enough, no newspaper likes to print a correction showing that its report was wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">

      <P>My agency would have been on the wire on the spot and given the right story.  I knew it on the spot, immediately it was sent out, but it took me two days before I could get a correction and an apology from the agency.</P>
      <P>That is one instance.  There is another instance.  The House may remember that at the time that members of the Government went for some discussion with the British Ministers at Chequers the Press of the world for about 24 hours was flooded with propaganda that was hostile to the Government in relation to the repeal of the External Relations Act.  A completely false picture was given of the whole situation and we had no means of dealing with it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I will answer that by saying that far more news editors in newspaper offices listen to foreign broadcasts than read what is sent out by foreign news agencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not accept that. I have been through many newspaper offices and I very seldom found newspaper sub-editors or reporters listening to wireless stations.  They usually have too much work to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can give endless instances, of a more minor character, of news distortion of which I have had experience in the last year in the Department of <Col N="1457" /> External Affairs.  We get reports from our missions abroad, reports published about the country, and hardly a week passes when there is not some minor, if not gross, distortion.  That being so &mdash;and the Opposition know that it is so, and Deputy Lemass has set out the position clearly himself&mdash;I would appeal to the Opposition, at this stage, to co-operate with the Government in ensuring that this news agency will be a success.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowan suggested that the House should refrain from criticising it too soon.  I do not know what Deputy Cowan considers too soon, but I think <Col N="1458" /> it is a very good suggestion.  There is nothing that can be more damaging to a news agency than constant criticism from within its own country.  Therefore, I would ask the Opposition to co-operate fully in building this news agency into an instrument which will be of value to the country, not merely from the political point of view, but also, I hope from the economical, cultural and tourist point of view.  I think it can do a lot in those spheres of activity, and I would ask the House to co-operate fully with it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct. This section provides for what I might term a substantial alternation in the law, in other words, that offences which by law are now indictable will by this section be capable of being dealt with summarily.  The Schedule sets out quite a large number of offences, now indictable, which may be dealt with summarily by the District Court under the provisions of this Act.  The Minister and his advisers and the Department generally, in the preparation of this Schedule, have endeavoured in so far as they possibly could, to bring in all those indictable offences that they think should be dealt with summarily and that a district justice should have power to deal with.  I take no exception to that part of the section.  I think it is wise to make that change.  I think it is wise to extend the jurisdiction of the District Court, and I am satisfied that it will help in speeding up the machinery and administration of justice and that to all accused persons, in the long run, it will mean that law will not be just as expensive as it was.  For all these reasons, sub-section (a) (1) is to be commended and accepted by the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is A.1.  The Minister in sub-section (b) is given power to declare by Order that any specified indictable offence shall be a scheduled offence and there is then another paragraph which sets out that an order by the Minister shall not come into force unless approved by resolution of each House of the Oireachtas, but upon being so approved, shall come into force forthwith.  That is what I consider to be a dangerous extension of power.  The Minister may say: &ldquo;Any Order I make will not come into operation until approved by each House by resolution&rdquo;, but, if we were to agree to that, we would be depriving ourselves of certain powers which, as a Parliament, we ought not so to deprive ourselves.  If in the future the Minister, or some successor of his, wanted to suggest an alteration in the law by which additional indictable offences might be dealt with summarily, he would, if this sub-section to which I take exception were not in the Bill, have to come before the House and get authority to introduce an amending <Col N="1461" /> Bill and would have to produce that Bill to the House and have its general principle discussed on Second Reading. The House would then have the right to put down amendments to delete certain things which the Minister might have inserted and generally the House would have power and control over what I consider to be a substantial amendment of the law.  If we give the Minister the powers he is asking for now, he can come before the House with an Order and ask the House for its approval.</P>

The bringing in of a motion dealing with such an Order would generally be regarded as a Party matter and if the Minister had a sufficient majority behind him, the Order would be approved by the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept what Deputy O'Higgins says.  A Bill has to go through all its stages, and, on Committee Stage, a Deputy may have a very useful amendment, an amendment which may commend itself to quite a number of Deputies supporting the Minister or may commend itself to the Minister.  If the procedure by way of Order is accepted by the House, the House will have given up a very substantial portion of its legisative powers.  I see no reason for this at all.  Having got, as he must have got, the advice and suggestions of the Chief State Solicitor, of the State solicitors, of the various judges who deal with criminal matters, of the District Courts and District Court clerks, and having had before him all the information which these responsible people could put before him, the Minister has prepared this very long section which <Col N="1462" /> refers to 21 different Acts and at least 21 different offences&mdash;probably more if we were to examine them in great detail&mdash;and if he is satisfied now that he has covered every offence that ought to be covered in this way, he ought not to ask for the additional power which enables him, or some successor of his, to come in here and amend the law by Order.</P>
      <P>In an ordinary administrative matter, there may be a good case for giving the Minister such power, and it has been done frequently by the House, but over the years the House has generally tried to keep some control by requiring that the Orders be placed before the House for approval.  This, however, is a fundamental matter.  It is an alteration of the law, an alteration of the law which has been set out in statutes for 100 years or more and which has been operated by the courts and in regard to which the Legislature said: &ldquo;These offences are indictable offences and can only be dealt with by a jury.&rdquo;  The Minister, if we give him this power, can say: &ldquo;It does not matter to me what the Legislature may have said at any particular time.  I have the power now to change that indictable offence which can only be dealt with by a jury into a summary offence which may be dealt with, in certain circumstances, by the District Court, within the framework of the protection set out in the Bill.</P>
      <P>I think it is too serious a responsibility to give to the Minister&mdash;the responsibility of changing something which should be the subject of an Act of Parliament into something which can be changed by Order of the Minister approved of by both Houses.  I am quite certain that, if acknowledged authorities on law were consulted, they would agree that what is proposed here is something which is not only objectionable but dangerous from the point of view of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I have said enough to show the Minister that there is a grave objection in principle to the power the Minister proposes to take here, and I feel sure that if that aspect is studied by Deputies who feel that they have a responsibility in the matter of constitutional government and all that it entails, they will be very slow to give this <Col N="1463" /> power to the Minister for Justice.  It may be all very well to say that General MacEoin, the Minister for Justice, is a reasonable man who will not do this, but it is not a question of giving powers to General MacEoin.  It is a question of giving powers to the Minister for Justice, whoever he may be for the time being.  There is some protection, if it must go through Parliament as a Bill goes in the ordinary way, but there is not much protection if such an important matter can be dealt with just as an administrative matter can be dealt with under the legislation at the moment.  I would press the Minister to accept my amendment and to agree to the deletion of this sub-section.</P>

      <P>The whole basis of the Bill, and the reason that it has won approval, certainly from most Deputies who are lawyers, is the very long list of scheduled offences which may be tried summarily.  It seems to me that most Deputies should take the point of view if that has been the approach to the Bill in general, that the more scheduled offences the Minister can create and the speedier he can arrange for the trial of them, the greater the approval that should be given to that proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself at first sight largely in agreement with most of the sentiments expressed by Deputy Cowan but from the point of view of making this a practical section, I think Deputy Cowan's suggestions would be <Col N="1464" /> rather cumbersome from the point of view of dealing with the offences with which this Bill purports to deal.  Like Deputy Cowan, I am fundamentally opposed to legislation by Order or regulation but if the Minister wants to schedule any type of offence, which heretofore would have been indictable, I think it would be really asking too much to expect the Minister to come in here with a fully fledged Bill and to go through the full gamut of Parliamentary procedure to secure a simple addition to the scheduled offences.  I take it that the object of the section is to catch up with a certain form of crime, which, though indictable, might become so common that the Government would consider it would be best dealt with summarily and best stamped out if brought within the jurisdiction of the District Courts.  I think that there is a certain safeguard in paragraph (c) of the sub-section to meet a large part of the objection of Deputy Cowan.  I certainly agree with him that it will be only a matter of agreeing or disagreeing with the Minister's proposal, but at least we have the guarantee that whatever Order is made by the Minister must have the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  If I saw a more practical way of overcoming the objection I have to legislation by Order, I certainly would oppose the enactment of these two paragraphs in this sub-section but, failing to find an alternative, I am afraid I could not go so far as Deputy Cowan's amendment would suggest.  I am afraid we are bound by the terms of the Bill as it stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point of view that I should like to put to Deputy Cowan.  I think most Deputies do agree with the general principle that any extension of the power of legislation by Order is an extension which is open to very grave objection. I should like however to make the point that the scheduling of offences under this Bill, prepares for a mode of trial in case of persons accused of crimes.  As Deputy Cowan has said it saves expense, it saves time and it saves a lot of trouble for persons who desire or intend to plead guilty to offences with which they are charged <Col N="1465" /> and provides an easier and more acceptable way to them of having their particular offences purged through the courts.  That being so, it does seem to me that if we remove from the Minister the powers proposed in this section, in the interests of the accused person, of adding at some future time to the type of offences that can be so easily tried and put on the Minister the obligation of having to come to this House with a Bill to effect what he is now proposing to effect by Order, the result would be, I am certain, that no Bill would be introduced into this House and certainly, if it were introduced, it would be introduced years after the necessity for its introduction became manifest.  Therefore it does seem to me that we would possibly be depriving accused persons of benefits which they can derive from the section as it at present stands.  I just want to make that point clear because the power we are giving to the Minister in this section is a power by Order to benefit accused persons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>A power by Order to benefit accused persons by enabling them if they so desire to have their cases tried by a district justice. We are not giving the Minister any power to impose any restriction, any sanction or added penalties on accused persons.  If that were the case, it would require considerably more advocacy by the Minister than I think it deserves now.  Of course that addition to the power of the Minister does not in any way prevent or interfere with, the mode of trial at present in operation in relation to these offences.  It merely provides an additional and possibly a more acceptable way in which the trial can be held.  For that reason I do not think that we should be concerned in matters of this kind with abstract notions of theoretical jurisprudence as to the effects of the Order. Discussions like that might be of interest in relation to a matter involving consequences a great deal more serious than are involved in this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am approaching this Bill with a soft heart and I am <Col N="1466" /> not looking for any power, nor do I intend that any power should be transferred to my successors, that would be to the disadvantage of an accused person.  I should like Deputies to read sub-section (b):&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister for Justice may by Order declare that any specified offence shall be a scheduled offence.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Of course, if a Minister brings in four or five offences at the same time I admit that there could be then a bit of a difficulty.  But, so far as I can read it and so far as I have been advised, every time that he adds one offence to the Schedule, and it is only one offence at a time, he adds that by Order.  Then the Order is not applicable until both Houses have approved of it.  Surely that is a very great guarantee against any whim of a Minister.  If the Minister for Justice proposes to add two, three, four or five offences to the Schedule, then, of course, Parliament would have to take a very serious view of it.  But, reading the section as it stands, it means that the Minister may add to the Schedule an offence.  I think that that is reasonable and that the House would be very badly advised if they resist that section.  I appeal to the good judgment of Deputy Cowan and everybody else to accept the section as it stands.  I feel that it is a reasonable section and that there is no danger inherent in it.  I hope that there will never be in this country a Minister for Justice who will not be a reasonable Minister.</P>

      <P>Having listened to the sentiments expressed in the House, I must say that I am beginning to think that there is no hope for parliamentary government in this country and that it is finished.  I think that the fundamental principles of the Constitution and of democracy are being completely and absolutely forgotten.  I think this is a matter of the most serious import and no &ldquo;smart Alec&rdquo; interjection or criticism is going to prevent me from doing what I consider to be my duty to protect the principles of parliamentary government and of democracy.  The Press in this country over a long period have taken very grave exception to Government by Order, and rightly so. <Col N="1467" /> But, in no case has there been such an invasion of the law as is proposed here. I am not worried so much about the attempted invasion of the principles of law in this section as I am by the sentiments expressed by Deputies who have attempted to justify that invasion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Why has this never been done in 27 years of Irish government? I am sure that if Deputy Boland were sitting in the Minister's place and introduced this, Deputy O'Higgins, if he were in the House, would be just as critical as I am of this provision.  I want to deal with it as a fundamental issue, not as a Party, political issue. What this Bill proposes to do is to make an amendment of the law that has never been attempted or suggested in a period of 27 years of parliamentary government in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When an Act of Parliament proceeds to declare that certain offences are indictable offences that only can be dealt with by a jury, the Parliament that enacted that law did it for good reasons.  We have here a Schedule brought in by the Minister after great examination.  As I said at an earlier stage, I was consulted about some of the provisions of this Bill ten years ago and asked to advise, in so far as I could advise, whether Section 3 might be introduced <Col N="1468" /> into the Bill.  Therefore, I know that this Bill has been under consideration in the Department of Justice or by officials of the Department for ten years.  After ten years combing, the Bill comes in here containing the First Schedule which provides that 21 offences which are now indictable offences may be dealt with summarily. On top of that, we are asked to go further and say that the Minister has the right to declare that any other indictable offence is an offence that may be dealt with summarily if he can get the support of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Let us consider whether or not this is a serious matter.  The making of laws to govern the community is a serious matter and that power is contained in the Constitution which sets up two Houses of Parliament.  There have been encroachments on the responsibilities of Parliament in the past, but there has been no encroachment that I know of so far as the criminal law is concerned. Are we to allow this encroachment now?  Are we going to avail of this opportunity to deprive Parliament of the right of saying, through the ordinary machinery of a Bill, whether a particular offence is to be an indictable offence or whether it can be dealt with summarily?  According to Deputy O'Higgins, this is an abstract notion of jurisprudence.  I cannot accept that. Deputy Lynch and Deputy O'Higgins have both stated that it is right as a general principle to oppose this process of legislation by Order.  But, in what circumstances should it be opposed other than in the matter of altering the criminal law?</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins thinks that it is favourable to the accused.  What has that got to do with it?  That is of some importance.  There are two people involved in every criminal offence: the accused person and the State, the people.  I am not talking for the accused person now.  I am talking for the State&mdash;for the people.  The State, the people, by our laws say that there are certain offences which can only be dealt with by a judge and a jury.  I say that if that is to be changed it can only be changed by the Dáil and the Seanad in accordance with the ordinary methods of dealing with legislation.  I <Col N="1469" /> am not a Curran or an Isaac Butt, or one of the other great Parliamentarians who have defended rights, but if I had the power and the ability of those persons, I would talk until this day week on this amendment, in opposition to it, and the amendment would only be carried when I had fallen down exhausted in my place in the House.</P>
    <P>I am seriously worried that the Minister for Justice should bring in such a section.  I am more than worried that Deputies could find cause for acceptance of it.  I want to say to Deputy Lynch, when he asks me where is the alternative, that there was a less objectionable way of dealing with it. This Bill, which proposes to schedule at least 21 offences, has to be brought in; it has to go through the ordinary procedure of Parliament, and rightly so, because no previous Minister for Justice took it upon himself to introduce a power that would enable something like this to be done by Order with the approval of Parliament. The alternative to what the Minister proposes is simply to delete the sub-section.  I would ask Deputy Lynch to consider that aspect of it seriously.  If we had in this country&mdash;I regret that we have not&mdash;what I may term constitutional watchdogs, even outside the House, that would deal with this proposal in the critical way that it ought to be dealt with, I feel that every Deputy would be ashamed of its passing.  I can do no more than express my views in regard to it.  I think there is no necessity for the section.  The Department of Justice will get, when this Bill is passed, a very substantial alteration of the law.  It ought to be satisfied with that substantial alteration of the law, but to go further and provide for something that may happen in the future is an unwise precedent.  It is one to which I must again, and as strongly as I can, express my objection.</P>

      <P>Well, we saw the result of it.  I want to say that I believe Deputy Cowan is taking an altogether wrong view of this provision. I believe that he is making a mountain of trouble where, in fact, none exists at all.  I do not know whether, strictly speaking, I would be in order, in dealing with this amendment, in calling the attention of Deputies, and in particular Deputy Cowan's, to the provisions of sub-section (2) of Section 2 of the Bill. One who had not read this Bill might, in listening to Deputy Cowan, be deceived into thinking that there is an invasion of the rights of Deputies and of the rights of democratic government, or an invasion of the law, taking place.  In fact, no such thing is happening. All that is proposed in Section 2 of the Bill is to find machinery for making this Bill, that we and most Deputies have welcomed, an even better Bill than it is now should the occasion arise.</P>
      <P>Sub-section (2) of Section 2 provides that, in the case of scheduled offences, a person may be tried summarily, provided two conditions exist: (1) that the court is satisfied that the offence with which the accused is charged is a minor matter; and (2) that the accused himself is asked if he has any objection to being so tried and says that he has no objection.  Now, if we put aside all the oratory of Deputy Cowan, I think that the ordinary Deputy, and certainly the ordinary person outside, will see that there is nothing more in this provision than to find a commonsense method to simplify matters in the District Court from time to time, should the occasion arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cowan objected to some interjections which were made to him. I want to have placed on record my objection to the manner in which Deputy Cowan has approached the discussion of this amendment.  I object to being lectured by Deputy Cowan as to what my duty is in this particular matter, as to how I will be led by my <Col N="1471" /> own conscience in this particular matter.  I object, particularly, to Deputy Cowan's suggestion that Deputies on this side of the House are insincere in backing this section of the Bill, and that if we were on the other side of the House we would oppose it. That may be Deputy Cowan's form; it is not mine.  Deputy Cowan did claim, and in this, of course, he is right, that the only body which is entitled to change or alter the law is the Oireachtas.  That is correct, and that is precisely what the Oireachtas is doing at the moment.  Does Deputy Cowan challenge the right of this Dáil and of the Seanad and of the President to amend the law in the way in which we are doing it now?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cowan thinks that he represents this Parliament and that he is entitled to do the schoolmaster to Deputies in this Dáil, to tell them what they ought to do and what they ought not to do.  Apparently, he also abrogates to himself the right to say what was in the mind of Parliaments in bygone days.  However, as far as I see, this is quite a simple thing, with none of the big issues which Deputy Cowan says are, in fact, involved.  There is nothing outrageous being done at all.  Simple machinery is being set up which is to be made subject to the authority of this House and of the other House of the Oireachtas.  Provided an Order made by the Minister is approved by the two Houses of the Oireachtas, then an indictable offence may be added to the scheduled offences under this measure.  If it is added, what has happened?  We have not done anything extraordinary at all.  We have not precluded the trial of a person charged with that offence; we have not precluded his trial before a judge and jury.  All we have done, provided two other conditions are fulfilled, is that we have permitted his trial to take place summarily in the District Court &mdash;that is, provided the district justice <Col N="1472" /> is satisfied it is a minor offence fit to be tried summarily, and provided the accused has no objection to that form of trial.</P>
      <P>The thing cannot be put any simpler than that, and, if Deputy Cowan still feels some big issue is involved, he is entitled to his views.  Let me finish up by reminding Deputy Cowan that I and other Deputies on these benches and on the Opposition Benches are also entitled to our views and we will express them.</P>

      <P>I do not think Deputy Cowan need be uneasy about watchdogs for the Constitution being here. It is one of the main functions of an Opposition to do that and, when the necessity arises, he can rest perfectly assured if any vital principle is involved that it will be done.  In this case the control of the House does not pass.  After all, from the practical point of view, if the Minister had to bring in a Bill he would bring in a three-line Bill.  It would go through the Second Reading and then, perhaps, no amendment would be possible; if there were an amendment it would be of such a nature that there would be merely a brief discussion.</P>
      <P>There would not be really any very great difference between dealing with a resolution in both Houses of the Oireachtas and dealing with a Bill of that nature.  From the ordinary practical point of view, however, we might cherish the principle of the control of the Oireachtas over all legislation and as far as possible, though it is very difficult to avoid from time to time giving powers to a Minister to make Orders, provided these Orders have to come before the House they secure the authority of the House.  I suggest to Deputy Cowan that it is not a good thing, so far as a big principle is concerned, to press it so as to reduce it to an absurdity.</P>

      <P>The House should be grateful to Deputy Cowan for putting down these amendments, thereby reminding us that at all times we must be very slow to give power of legislation by Order.  At the same time, I agree with the other speakers, for the reasons they have set out, that this is <Col N="1473" /> one occasion where, while we may be slow, we yet may do it with safety, principally for the reason that we have a safeguard in the sub-section that states that the Order must be approved by resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Little has very correctly pointed out, in a matter of this sort there would not be a very great difference between a Bill to add a scheduled offence and an Order to add a scheduled offence.  The only difference would be that the Bill would have to go through five stages, whereas the resolution would go through only one stage.  Deputy Cowan must remember there are other safeguards. As Deputy O'Higgins very properly put it, he has to remember that even if there is a new offence, or rather, if an offence becomes a newly scheduled offence, it still has to go to the district justice to decide whether it is an offence fit to be tried summarily and it will have to be put to the accused whether he will be satisfied with that form of trial.</P>
      <P>Another point is that no member of the Dáil, on the Second Stage, by way of suggestion, or on this Stage by way of notice or amendment, has made any reference to what should be in the Schedule or what should not be in it. No member of the Dáil, with legal knowledge or otherwise, has said that No. 8 should not be there, or that some other particular offence should be there.  That shows that this is a bor-der-line question, whether a particular offence should or should not be a scheduled offence.  It is a matter on which there would be many different opinions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the long run, the Minister for Justice, on the advice of the Attorney-General and other experts, is probably the best person to decide whether or not an offence should be scheduled. We may have a list of 21 offences proposed to be scheduled offences and any member of the Dáil may say: &ldquo;I object to such an offence being scheduled,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I suggest such an offence should be a scheduled offence.&rdquo;  We cannot visualise, when the Minister may come along with one particular offence, whether there may be very great objection <Col N="1474" /> in the Dáil or the Seanad to the scheduling of that offence.</P>

      <P>Speaking a second time to this amendment, I do not want to adopt the rôle of defending the Minister or attacking Deputy Cowan.  Deputy Cowan rightly pointed out that the interests of the public must be taken into account as well as the interests of the accused.  That is only following the example of a famous legal luminary, Lord Justice Goddard, who said that the interests of justice are not simply the interests of the accused.  Deputy Cowan is forgetting that we still have a body, in the person of the District Court bench, prepared to protect the interests of the public just as well as are the members of the Circuit Court bench.</P>
      <P>On the Second Reading Deputy Cowan went to great pains eulogising the District Court for the way in which it has performed its functions.  He stated, in column 537, Volume 118, of the Parliamentary Debates:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is because it has been such a great success and because I am satisfied that the increased powers that are to be given to district justices in this Bill will not be abused, that I am in favour of giving those additional powers to a court to which every citizen in the country can look with absolute confidence that the justices will do their work efficiently, well, honestly and impartially.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If the Minister deems it wise to schedule another type of offence that is not in the Schedule at present, apart from the fact that he must come before the House, Deputy Cowan can always have the consolation that at least in the district justice, in whom he appears to have so much confidence, he will have men exercising a judicial function in no less a capable and efficient and impartial manner as the Circuit Court judge can exercise it at present.  I think that at least answers that part of the argument and he need have no fears that the interests of the public will be prejudiced to any extent at the hands of the district justices.</P>

      <P>I think it is a well established fact, appreciated not <Col N="1475" /> only by members of the legal profession but also by the public, that the citizens of this State are at times involved in criminal prosecutions in which they appear as the principal figure&mdash;namely, the defendant.  They are involved in considerable expense. Criminal litigation is not the same as civil litigation where the successful party recovers its costs from the other side.  Having read this section very carefully, it seems to me that there is in it a very considerable relief of the costs and expenses incident upon a person who has to defend himself, or herself, when proceedings occur against him on the criminal side.  I am one of those Deputies who on all occasions when an attempt has been made to legislate by decree have always taken the view that that is inherently bad. But I cannot spell into this particular section the usual disadvantages attaching to legislation by decree.  Neither can I spell into this section the real effect usually produced by legislation by decree.</P>
      <P>Undoubtedly there are two parties involved&mdash;the State and the individual. It seems to me that these two parties are not evenly balanced where legislation is concerned.  The individual as an individual is the person of prime importance.  The State is a collection of individuals and the State is the mouthpiece of a collection of individuals. The person, or party, whom we have a duty to protect under the Constitution and under the functions delegated to us by our constituents is the person whose rights and liberty must be safeguarded so long as those rights and liberty do not run counter to the rights, privileges and existence of the State.  You have here a situation in which in the final analysis the particular person involved has complete control of what will happen because, scheduled or non-scheduled offences, even if he does not avail of this he does not lose his right to trial by jury. He has the definite advantage of going out from court without a stain upon his character secure in the knowledge that he can defend himself at much less expense than if the section were not there.</P>

      <P>I think, as has been pointed out by Deputy Little, that it is a fact that, if we did bring in a Bill, it would probably get as quick a passage through both Houses as would a resolution.  There is, however, a point that has so far been missed in this debate and I think it is an even greater safeguard than would be the passing of a Bill.  If Deputy Captain Cowan will think it over he will probably remember that the Seanad can only hold up a Bill for a certain specified period and it is quite possible for this House to pass a Bill, in spite of the Seanad, after a due period of time has elapsed; whereas what is proposed here by the Minister is that there must be a positive resolution passed by both Houses to permit him to add another offence to the schedule.  I think from that point of view there is a greater safeguard for the accused person, apart altogether from the other safeguards contained in the remaining portion of sub-section (2) of this section.  I put it to Deputy Captain Cowan that the fact that there must be a positive resolution of approval by both Houses is a greater safeguard in view of the fact that this House can carry a Bill in spite of the Seanad.  I think it well to make that point.</P>

      <P>Deputy Captain Cowan's remarks here this evening are very much akin to Chesterton's &ldquo;Last and lingering troubadour&rdquo;.  The Deputy has taken down from the wall a certain amount of shining armour and comes into the House all ready for combat to find himself, like Don Quixote, tilting at windmills.  I suggest to the Deputy that, if he wants to fight for a principle or expatiate on the rights and privileges of the people, he should at least have something concrete to put before us.  The particular measure that he criticises here is a measure designed to safeguard people accused of certain offences from the unfair consequences of charges brought against them&mdash;unfair consequences in the way of delay and expense.  This measure is designed to give them the benefit of a practical procedure which most Deputies think they ought to have.  If Deputy Captain Cowan wants to criticise legislation by Order, or anything <Col N="1477" /> of that nature, he should at least put before us some concrete examples of interference with the rights of ordinary people or with the privileges we ordinarily enjoy.  There is no such interference here with such rights or privileges.  The rights of an accused person are in no way diminished.  They are, if anything, increased.  It baffles me why we should have been subjected to this particular diatribe this evening. I do not know what the alternative may be.  It is very easy to talk about abstract principles while forgetting the ordinary concrete facts of a particular case.</P>
      <P>As both Deputy Little and Deputy Lynch have pointed out, there is no difference good, bad or indifferent, irrespective of whether we are considering a Bill as opposed to a resolution under this section to schedule a particular offence, in the manner in which that will be done.  In addition, Deputy Boland has pointed out very clearly that the actual procedure laid down in this section of making the exercise of this power conditional upon a resolution passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas is a protection greater than would be provided if that were done by ordinary legislation.  So far as I can see, there is no release under this Bill of any of the powers of this Parliament. The Bill merely designates a particular type of machinery under Section 2 by means of which the law may be changed.  We give the Minister no power to do anything except what he is empowered to do under this Bill and under this section.  At any time this Parliament can revoke that power&mdash;it can change, alter or amend it at any time and in any way it wishes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cowan has considerable experience of practice in the courts.  He has considerable experience of practice in both the civil and the criminal courts.  I wonder if he does not realise the terrible threats to the rights of the individual that are created every day if the road traffic authority or some other authority in the country, by bye-laws, creates offences&mdash;offences for which persons can be brought before the courts and punished.  The authority and power to create those offences is contained in various statutes passed <Col N="1478" /> over many years back by this and other Parliaments.  I do not think anybody could suggest that there has been any grave interference with the rights of the people.</P>
    <P>The people know at all times that in this Parliament there is the power which will be exercised to redress any wrong or any harm that might be done to them by any undue exercise of these powers.  The power proposed to be given to the Minister under this section can only be exercised in accordance with the Act, if it becomes an Act.  It may be revoked, altered, amended or changed at any time by this House.  Therefore, I cannot see why there should be all this talk about interference.</P>

It is either good or bad on its merits and not because of some personal observations that may be made about myself.  That is of no interest to anybody.  However, it is of interest to the people and it is of interest to this House how we deal with this matter, which I consider fundamental. When we have a procedure laid down by which Acts of Parliament must go through that procedure is, in other words, a kind of wall that is built and you can endanger that wall <Col N="1479" /> by allowing a small trickle to get through.  It is like a dyke.  You can endanger the structure by allowing the smallest trickle to get through.  I say that this is the trickle&mdash;the first hole that has been made in this particular dyke.  I challenge any Deputy in the House to point out, in any Act of Parliament passed here in 27 years, where the Minister has got power by Order to change the quality, if I may say so, of an offence.  The offence is laid down&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with the law, certain offences are indictable and may be dealt with only by a judge sitting with a jury.  To those offences are attached, on conviction, substantial sentences of two years' imprisonment or three years' penal servitude or more.  The law says that this is a serious offence which merits a serious punishment and that a court of trial may impose a sentence up to two years' imprisonment, or one of penal servitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment proposes to give the Minister power to make an Order, which may have the approval of a simple majority in each House, to change the quality of that offence from being punishable by penal servitude to being triable under certain circumstances by the District Court and punished with the maximum penalty of 12 months imprisonment.  That is what I consider to be a fundamental point in regard to the matter.  If we can change the law in regard to that, by giving the Minister power to make the Order and to have it dealt with here by simple resolution, we are opening a very serious hole in the protective dyke and, gradually, Ministers will be tempted to come in here and, on the same reasoning, to get the hole enlarged, so that the parliamentary procedure that exists at the moment will disappear altogether.  That is the principle that I think is dangerous. I think it is worth defending the position as it is and that a person who decides to defend that position should not be the subject of the personal <Col N="1480" /> attacks we had here this evening.  I do not know what advantage comes from those personal attacks.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lynch and, to some extent, Deputy Byrne, referred to the protection that was there when the case came before the district justice.  Deputy Sir John Esmonde was concerned about the heavy expenses involved in trials at the moment.  This Bill has for one of its objects the speeding up of the machinery of the administration of justice and the cheapening of it.  To that extent, it was welcome on the Second Reading.  For that purpose we set out here 21 offences which may be dealt with summarily in certain circumstances. Deputy Byrne has said that we have accepted the Minister's list. I can assure Deputy Byrne that that list has not been accepted without examination&mdash;at least, as far as I am concerned.  After close examination I consider that these offences could properly, in the circumstances set out in the Bill, be dealt with summarily and to that extent I was prepared to give my approval to that schedule and to the section that creates it.  That is a very different story from the addition of another one and that is the point that is at issue.  I am perfectly certain that the Minister appreciates the view I am expressing and the attitude I am adopting in regard to this.  It is no protection, as far as general principle is concerned, to say that you have great faith in the district justices and that they will exercise their judicial functions correctly.  That is not the issue that is involved.</P>
    <P>The issue involved is whether or not a particular offence which the law now says should be dealt with by a judge who has power to impose a sentence of imprisonment or penal servitude up to two years should be taken away in certain circumstances from that judge and dealt with summarily and a sentence of imprisonment not exceeding 12 months passed.  This can be of benefit to the accused person.  The Minister brings in an Order which gets approval and generally a Minister will not bring in an Order if he is not going to get approval.  That is the strangest thing about it.  No Minister will make an Order unless he knows that his <Col N="1481" /> whips are strong enough to ensure that that Order will be passed both by the Dáil and the Seanad.  If he thinks he is going to be defeated he will not introduce it, so if the Minister has a majority he will simply say: &ldquo;I propose to schedule a particular offence.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think Deputy O'Higgins interjected at one stage that probably the same thing could be done under an Act.  Probably it could, but it has all stages to go through.  It is capable of being discussed in its general principle on the Second Stage and the Minister may find that he himself is not so favourable to it as he was when he introduced it.  We have examples of Bills to which after their discussion on the Second Stage amendments have been put down by Ministers.  In the case of one Bill which is before the Dáil at the moment it is with difficulty one can recognise it as the Bill which was discussed on its Second Stage, because of the Ministerial amendments that have been put down to it and there are more to come.  I think that as a Dáil we should insist on retaining the power to change the laws only in accordance with an Act of Parliament introduced and passed in the ordinary way.</P>
    <P>There is no analogy between what is proposed here and an offence created under the Road Traffic Act or any other Act.  Under the Road Traffic Act power is given to make certain regulations and the Act provides that any breach of these regulations is an offence that can be dealt with summarily and that certain penalties can be imposed.  That is something passed by Parliament and there is no analogy at all between what is done there and what is proposed in this section which I ask the Dáil to delete.</P>
    <P>This Bill was before the Seanad and was discussed there.  I am not altogether sure if they adverted to this section or discussed it or whether any amendment was moved to it, but I did hear some criticism here of the Seanad with regard to this Bill as finally passed by them and I did expect that the critic would have given us the benefit of his assistance by suggesting by amendment where the Seanad went wrong.  Perhaps this is the section he had in mind.  I would <Col N="1482" /> press the Minister strongly to agree to the deletion of the paragraph which I have proposed to delete.  He said, speaking earlier, that every offence has been examined by his Department and that as far as he, his Department and his advisors can see, there is no likelihood of any offence being scheduled by Ministerial Order in the foreseeable future.  That being so, to put in this power now is unnecessary and once there is an objection to its insertion I think the Minister should withdraw it. If this were a power that might be used frequently one could understand this request to the Dáil to prevent Bills coming in week after week and year after year, but as far as anybody can see in the foreseeable future it is unlikely that any offence will be scheduled under Order.  In those circumstances I think it unwise of the Minister to insist on it and I think it would be unwise and very foolish of the House to agree to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>The First Schedule sets out exactly what we think at the moment are the offences that might be dealt with summarily and all this section gives is authority, with the full approval of the Oireachtas, to add one more to it or perhaps two.  Deputy Cowan admits that the reason he is letting the 21 offences in the Schedule pass is that he has examined them very carefully and he thinks that they are something that should be treated summarily.  Deputy Cowan has put very great effort into a very bad cause and I think the effort was deserving of a better one.  He has applied himself, apparently diligently, to the section but I can assure him that if he reads sub-section (3) (c) in the section he will see that there is ample protection, that no Minister dare come in here with something unorthodox. Even though the Minister brought in a Bill, as the Deputy wants me to do, the Bill could pass.  As Deputy Boland has properly pointed out, the greatest safeguard you have is that both Houses of the Oireachtas must approve of this.  If one of the Houses refuses, the Order falls to the ground. I felt that Deputy Boland was giving away too much, when he reminded the House and Deputy Cowan of that fact.</P>

      <P>This is a very simple method of getting over a difficulty. If a Minister came in with four or five additions to the Schedule, it would be a very serious matter and I do not see how he could get it through.  After 25 years' experience of government, 21 offences are now put into the Schedule.  It may take 60 years more to get another one into it. At the same time, if some situation develops which could be regarded as serious&mdash;and I am not making little of these offences; they are all very serious and indictable&mdash;whoever will be Minister for Justice will apply himself as diligently to that problem as I have done now.  Therefore, I think Deputy Cowan should not press the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to express complete agreement with what Deputy Boland has said.  Since we are legislating for a new procedure in relation to the trial of criminal offences, we should be extremely careful that the legislative provisions contain all the rights which an accused person is entitled to expect.  The provision which Deputy Boland objects to in the Bill is contained in subparagraph (ii).  It is provided there that the District Court may try summarily a person charged with the scheduled offence if it is a minor offence and if the accused, on being asked by the court, does not object to being so tried.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Boland that, in a great number of cases, the accused person may not be professionally represented, may not be aware of his rights under the Constitution and under the general criminal code, and may not know that, if he does not like to be tried by a district justice, he is entitled to go before a jury of his fellows and test his guilt or innocence there.  He may not know anything about his rights.  I am quite certain that, as a matter of practice, no district justice would merely ask an accused person whether he objected to being tried summarily or not&mdash;I am sure that most district justices would inform him as to what his rights are&mdash;but that should not prevent us from putting that particular obligation as a statutory duty on district justices in exercising this entirely new jurisdiction.  I think that <Col N="1486" /> the sub-section, as it stands at present in the Bill, is a sloppy sub-section.  It was probably intended to provide that an accused person should be informed of his rights and should, with full knowledge, make the choice.  After all, no proper choice can be made unless the accused has a full knowledge of his rights and of what he is entitled to expect.  The section as it stands does not provide for that.  It merely provides for the question being asked of a poor, possibly trembling, accused who is brought into the dock and asked the question by a justice, with no associated obligation on the justice or the court to explain his rights.</P>
    <P>I, therefore, urge the Minister to accept the amendment proposed by Deputy Boland or, indeed, the amendment proposed by Deputy Cowan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment in my name and the amendment in Deputy Boland's name are, in fact, the same amendment.  There is no difference. Both of them contain the point expressed by Deputy O'Higgins.  In actual practice, district justices tell the accused person of his rights.  That is my experience.</P>

      <P>They must do it and, in fact, they do it.  The clause &ldquo;does not object to be so tried&rdquo; left the onus of making the objection on the defendant.  A person is very often brought before the District Court shortly after arrest.  He may be in custody for a period.  He may be terrified. If the district justice explains to him that he has a right to be tried by a judge and jury but that, if he does not want that, he can consent to be tried there, it would be some help. In view of what has been said by Deputy Boland and Deputy O'Higgins &mdash;and their view, I am quite sure, will be generally supported&mdash;I would ask the Minister to accept either of the amendments.</P>

      <P>I hope the Minister will accept the amendment, as indicated more or less by him on the Second Reading, when both Deputy Boland and myself raised this point.  I feel that if you enshrine it in a statute, <Col N="1487" /> whether you accept Deputy Cowan's or Deputy Boland's amendment, you are putting it, as I tried to indicate, more or less on a par with the caution that the policeman is compelled to give to a person before he takes his statement. I do not think any of us would want to be taken as impeaching the perfect procedure at present adopted by the District Court, but we feel that a concrete positive direction in a statute is a safeguard to which the accused person is entitled.  Accordingly, I would urge on the Minister, as I did in connection with Deputy Boland's contention on the Second Reading, that there should be a positive section in the Bill directing that the courts should convey to the accused person in a positive way what his rights are rather than leave it as it stands at present.  Even though the District Court Rules may cover it, it would be better that it should be crystallised in a positive section in a statute of this kind in the manner suggested by Deputy Boland or Deputy Cowan in the amendments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnLymbrickEsmonde" hpid="Sir John Esmonde Sir John Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that this or something similar should appear in the section for some of the various reasons that have been already advanced and for other reasons.  I quite appreciate the fact that the district justice, in acting according to the rules, must inform the prisoner of his rights.  One of the pieces of information which he must give to the prisoner is that he is entitled to be tried by jury.  What I have to say now goes back somewhat to some of the arguments that were advanced on the amendment which we have just discussed.  It arises in this way.  I hold the view, and urge that view here, that the putting into the Schedule of certain offences, at present unspecified, does not come under the category of legislation by Order or by decree because, as I understand, legislation by Order or by decree involves some property or other right being taken away from the individual otherwise than by Act of Parliament and the control of that property or right being vested in the Executive.  That does not happen under this section as it stands at the moment, for the simple reason <Col N="1488" /> that the final court of appeal in respect of anything that can be done under this section of a novel character lies with the accused and with the accused alone.  If he says &ldquo;no,&rdquo; the section does not apply to him.  Therefore, in so far as this section legislates in any way for the doing away of any right, property or otherwise which any citizen of this State possesses at the moment, the right to veto that resides in the accused at the appropriate moment when he is brought up for trial.  But, I do say that it should be subject to this qualification, that if we leave this sub-section in an ambiguous form it could be urged by way of argument&mdash;I do not suggest that it could happen&mdash;that at some future time, under the laws that prevail, the District Court Rules might be amended and, therefore, you would not have enshrined as part of our permanent legislation the veto which now resides in the accused under this section and which, in my opinion, takes the section entirely out of that type of legislation that is referred to as legislation by Order of decree.</P>

      <P>This section is designed to give the accused very great protection.  There is always somebody else involved in the case besides the accused, namely, the injured party, whom the State is representing. Under the District Court Rules, section 59, it is clear that the justice must inform the accused, in a case that the justice may decide is a case that he could deal with summarily, that he has the right to have the case decided by a judge and jury.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am surprised at Deputy Cowan's approach to this matter.  He had some experience in the Army and he knows very well that there was never a fellow yet returned before the commanding officer who would not take the commanding officer's judgement rather than a courtmartial, because he thought he would get a fairer deal. The reason for that was that when he went to courtmartial there was huge expense and a whole lot of things he had to do and summary jurisdiction had some merit in it.  It is possible that an accused person if he had not a lawyer to advise <Col N="1489" /> him might not know about his right to trial by judge and jury, but if the justice sees that he is a person of poor intelligence or has not been advised, I am sure that he must inform him that he has that right.  I do not propose to resist this amendment if it is pressed.</P>

    <P>This is a simple amendment.  The procedure set out in the Bill is that, in the case of an accused person in respect of whom depositions may have been taken by the District Court, if <Col N="1490" /> the District Court is informed at any stage of the proceedings that the accused desires to plead guilty, that accused person can there and then be sent forward for trial without completing the taking of depositions. That, as was said generally on Second Stage, is very welcome and an improvement on present procedure.  When the case comes for trial in the Circuit Court, however, the accused person may change his mind and may decide not to plead guilty, whereupon the Circuit Court can do either of two things&mdash;remit the case to the District Court or enter a plea of not guilty and fix a date for trial.  My amendment proposes to delete the first of these.</P>

      <P>There is the further procedure, that if at his trial it is proposed to call witnesses who have not made depositions, a statement of the evidence to be given can be furnished. I do not see any useful purpose in granting the Circuit Court power to remit the case to the District Court, because what we are trying to do here is to speed up and to cheapen the machinery, and the Circuit Court will have available a summary of the evidence. Perhaps copies of the statements or relevant portions of the statements will be made available and the accused can be served with these. If we give the circuit judge the power, <Col N="1491" /> where the accused changes his plea and pleads not guilty, to return the case to the District Court, there will be the additional trouble of taking depositions and returning for trial again, with all the hold-up involved, and the very type of thing we are trying to avoid by this Bill will continue.  That is why I suggest that the power to remit to the District Court might go on and that, where an accused person indicates that he intends to plead guilty and then changes his plea in the Circuit Court, the circuit judge should enter a plea of not guilty and fix a date for trial in the ordinary way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The objection I have to the amendment and it is a very fundamental objection, is that there is a very great difference between the defence in a criminal charge being given a set of depositions, that is, evidence taken on oath before the district justice, the sworn testimony of the witnesses, and being served with a statement of the evidence proposed to be given.  I think Deputy Cowan will agree that it would be his experience that depositions, being records of the evidence and statements made on oath are very much more reliable and accurate as a synopsis of the evidence to be given against an accused than a mere statement not taken on oath.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a great deal of rather silly talk in this country about perjury, but, to the credit of our people be it said that, where you have a précis of evidence as in a deposition taken on oath, you very seldom find a witness departing from it, where you will find a witness departing from a statement not taken on oath.  Very often, the witness in making a statement not on oath gives a view which he thinks the person taking the statement would like him to give&mdash;something favourable to the particular cause in respect of which he is making the statement.  But where you have the preliminary evidence taken on oath, in 99 cases out of 100 it is faithfully reproduced in the verbal evidence given subsequently, and it is to the advantage of an accused person that he should have presented to him the evidence to be given against him and not merely a <Col N="1492" /> statement of that evidence&mdash;the evidence taken on oath before the district justice.</P>

When the accused person is arraigned before the Circuit Court he may withdraw his plea of guilty.  In other words he wants to have the best of both worlds.  Then the trial judge may do either of two things&mdash;remit the case back to the District Court to have depositions taken or else enter a plea of not guilty and fix another date for the trial.</P>

      <P>When I put down the amendment, I must say that I felt here was a case where the accused had signed a plea of guilty, the Attorney-General had objected to the case being dealt with in the District Court, and the man was sent forward to the Circuit Court.  The general intention was that when he got to the Circuit Court he could plead either guilty or not guilty.  If he did plead not guilty, there is a provision in the section whereby he could be tried by that court on getting a statement of the evidence of persons who had not already made depositions. Of course, Deputy Sir John Esmonde was quite correct as to the value of depositions on oath but, nevertheless, this section proposes in certain cases to do away with depositions and to serve the accused with a statement of the evidence which it is proposed to give.  It says: &ldquo;If at the trial it is proposed to call as witnesses for the prosecution persons who have not made depositions, the Attorney-General shall, not less than seven days before the trial, cause to be served on the accused a notice in writing specifying those persons and giving a statement of the evidence that is to be given by each of them.&rdquo; I understood that the real purpose of that was to deal with witnesses who may not have been available in the District Court proceedings. In case the accused person changes his plea of guilty when he comes to the Circuit Court, it is proposed to enable the trial judge to enter a plea of not guilty and to fix a date for the trial there.  In these circumstances paragraph <Col N="1494" /> (3) (b) would be put into operation and the Attorney-General would serve on the accused, if it were proposed to call as witnesses for the prosecution persons who had not made depositions, a notice specifying those persons and giving a statement of the evidence to be given by each of them. I think all that matter was discussed in the Seanad and the Minister met certain objections in the Seanad by agreeing to a provision that a full statement of such evidence was to be supplied to the accused person.  Previously it was only a summary that was to be given. What does strike me is that once he is returned for trial by the District Court on his signing a plea of guilty, there is no machinery set out anywhere whereby he can be sent back to the District Court to be dealt with summarily and to have depositions taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we are going to get ourselves into a terrible mess.  This section refers to indictable offences, except certain offences which are excluded.  As the particular sub-section we are discussing now stands, if the person pleads not guilty and, if his case is remitted to the District Court, the only function of the district justice would be to deal summarily with the case.  He does not appear to be given any power to take depositions. He has no power to deal summarily with any offence that is not either within the powers he has at present or one of the offences in the Schedule or contemplated to be in the Schedule.  The result will be that the accused will find himself back in the District Court on an indictable offence in respect to which the district justice has no jurisdiction.  If it is an indictable offence to which the Schedule does not apply, the district justice will not know what to do with him.  That seems to be the position at the moment under the section.  The only way in which the trial could go forward in the case of an indictable offence to which the Schedule does not apply would be, if the trial judge elected to keep the case in the particular court, either the Circuit Court or the Central Criminal Court, for the Attorney-General, within the seven days specified, to serve a statement of the evidence to be given upon him.  So far as remitting the case to the District Court is concerned, the district justice would have no jurisdiction to do anything if it were an indictable offence outside the Schedule.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 4 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Where an accused person is returned for trial by the District Court after the preliminary investigation of an indictable offence the Attorney-General shall, not less than seven days before the trial, cause to be served on the accused or on his solicitor, a copy each of the indictment, of the depositions taken on the preliminary investigation and of all documents and exhibits handed into the court at the preliminary investigation and referred to in the depositions.</P>
      <P>I indicated to the Minister that I had something like this in mind.  The Minister held the view, and was so advised, that what I propose to achieve by this amendment is in fact in operation. The amendment proposes to insert a new section to provide, when an accused person is returned for trial and depositions have been taken, that seven days before his trial a copy of the indictment and of the depositions will be served upon him.  I take it the Minister will accept the amendment. Under Section 3 it is provided that, where the accused person pleads guilty and is sent forward for trial and changes his plea and the circuit judge decides to try him, he will be served with a copy of the evidence to be given.  There is no such provision in regard to depositions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In some Circuit Court areas where an accused has been returned for trial there is a rule or custom that a copy of the depositions will be made available for him.  In Dublin there is no such custom but, through the kindness and co-operation of the Governor of Mountjoy and the county registrar in <Col N="1497" /> the case of a person who is in Mount-joy and who applies for a copy of the depositions, they will be lent to him for a period to examine.  But if he is on bail, he must pay for the depositions, and that is a payment which quite a number of accused persons have not been able to meet.  The result is that defending solicitors have on many occasions on the morning of the trial to rush and get what we shall call a pre-look at the depositions either from the country registrar or the State counsel.  Both the registrar and the State counsel are anxious to facilitate the representatives of the accused in these matters.  But the Minister was of opinion, and was so advised, that these depositions are readily and easily available.  I want to put the thing, however, beyond all doubt.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned courtmartial. In courtmartial cases the person is served with a summary of the evidence which is in fact a copy of the evidence taken on oath and signed by each witness. When we had the Military Court or the Special Criminal Court in Collins Barracks the same procedure applied.  The accused person was served with a copy of the evidence against him.  It is now provided in this Bill that, in the circumstances set out in Section 3, where he changes his plea, he will be served with a statement of the evidence in writing.  I propose to complete the matter by providing that, where a person has been returned for trial, he shall be served seven days before his trial with a copy of the indictment.  Undoubtedly, he is entitled to have a copy of the <Col N="1498" /> indictment, a copy of the depositions and copies of any documents that are exhibited.  I can see with regard to the word &ldquo;exhibits&rdquo; that that might be difficult and I would be quite prepared to meet the Minister on that.</P>

      <P>If the Minister thinks that the supplying of copies of exhibits may be too difficult, at least the accused should be served with a copy of the depositions.</P>

      <P>And a schedule of the exhibits.  I am prepared to accept that.  There are exhibits copies of which appear on the depositions, but there are other exhibits which cannot, by their nature, appear because they may be ledgers or very complicated or difficult exhibits.  But I think that, as a matter of justice, the accused ought to know seven days before his trial the charge against him, because the charge on which he will be tried in the Circuit Court may be a different one from that in which he is returned for trial for the District Court and it is right that we ought to make provision that he will be served with a copy of the indictment and a copy of the summary.</P>
