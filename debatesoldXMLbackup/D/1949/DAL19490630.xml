      <NameTxt>Mr. Timoney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands (a) whether he is aware that farmers in and near Thomastown, Golden, County Tipperary, have suffered and are likely to suffer still further serious losses due to the fact <Col N="1478" /> that the Ballyricane stream, which flows through their lands, has not received attention for a considerable time; (b) whether £500 was retained by the Land Commission out of the purchase money of the Daly estate (Record No. 5.134) to form the nucleus of a fund from which the expenses of the upkeep of the stream could be met, and, if so, (i) whether there are, or were, trustees of the fund; (ii) how is the fund being applied, and (iii) what is its present position; and (c) whether he will state the extent of the Land Commission's responsibility for the proper upkeep of the stream and whether they are discharging their duty in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The stream in question is an artificial watercourse which was constructed a considerable time ago by a former owner of the adjoining lands. On the acquisition by the Land Commission of the Daly estate, £500 of the purchase money thereof was transferred to the public trustee to form a fund for the maintenance of the watercourse. Interest on this money has been applied in discharging the wages of the caretaker of the watercourse.</P>
      <P>While the Land Commission have spent almost £2,000 on the repair of this watercourse, they have no responsibility for ensuring an adequate supply of water for the adjoining landholders. They have endeavoured for years, without success, to find local people who would act as trustees and administer the fund, to which the Land Commission are prepared to contribute £1,000.  Until such time as the benefiting landholders come to appreciate that their interests would be best served by administering the fund themselves, there is little the Land Commission can do to improve the position.</P>

      <P>It is a function of the Land Commission to carry out improvements such as fencing, housing, etc., but when lands are to be re-arranged it would be impracticable for the Land Commission to deal with such works until such time as the re-arrangement has been carried out.  As regards the townland of Tallagh, this is but one of the many congested districts which the Land Commission are anxious to re-arrange and which has been noted for re-arrangement as soon as circumstances permit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFlynn" hpid="Mr. J. Flynn Mr. J. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he will state the date from which the system of travelling creameries commenced to operate in South and West Kerry; the circumstances which gave rise to its introduction; and, further, the success or otherwise of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Travelling creameries were put into commission for the first time in this country in the year 1934, the area of operation being the Dingle peninsula.  In 1937 the travelling creamery system was extended to the Rathmore area; in 1938 to the Cahirciveen, Kenmare and Castletownbere districts and in 1939 to the Castlemaine creamery district.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the seasons 1933 and 1934 the price of non-creamery butter fell to an abnormally low level in the Dingle peninsula and this, in combination with the low value of store cattle then prevailing, made dairying an uneconomic proposition.  The question of introducing the creamery system of butter-making to the peninsula had been under consideration for some time, and with this object, the Dairy Disposal Company in 1934 purchased premises at Dingle and Stradbally where non-creamery butter had previously been manufactured.  The Dingle premises were converted into a central creamery.  In the first instance, however, it was decided not to build separating stations, but to test the milk supplies available and to gain information as to the most suitable location of cream-separating stations by the operation of motor vehicles suitably equipped for the collection and separation of milk, which <Col N="1484" /> have since become known as &ldquo;travelling creameries&rdquo;.  It was eventually found possible to erect seven new separating stations at suitable points and the travelling creameries were in course of time withdrawn.  In the other areas, travelling creameries were provided in order to test the extent of the milk supplies available for the manufacture of creamery butter, and to make creamery facilities available in widely scattered areas in which there was not a sufficient concentration of milk to justify the erection of the usual cream-separating stations.</P>
    <P>The travelling creamery system has been a complete success and has played an important part in the organisation of the creamery industry in County Kerry and elsewhere by serving to demonstrate the areas in which the erection of cream-separating stations would be practicable, and by bringing creamery facilities to areas which would not otherwise have been served by creameries.</P>

      <P>It is clear from the Official Report that the statement mentioned in the question had reference to difficulties experienced in the recruitment of engineering staff.  As the Deputy is, perhaps, aware, the Civil Service Regulation Acts require that established posts in the Civil Service which are not filled by promotion must normally be offered for competition.  To meet exceptional circumstances, however, the Acts contain a provision empowering the Civil Service Commissioners, on the motion of the Minister in charge of a Department with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to authorise appointment without competition to a temporary post.  This provision is utilised in urgent cases to secure temporary professional staff while arrangements for the holding of a competition are being made, and it can be used for the temporary filling of any additional engineering posts which may be needed for arterial drainage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the reply given to a similar question on the 23rd January, 1947, by the Minister for Finance.  As was indicated in that reply, the question of changing the financial year to correspond with the calendar year was examined some years ago.  Departments, local authorities and commercial, insurance, accounting and banking interests were consulted as to whether a change would be desirable, but the weight of opinion, private as well as official, was, for substantial reasons, against a change and in favour of retaining the present financial year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>(i) The aggregate capital expenditure out of State funds up to the 31st March, 1949, in acquiring land and in constructing and furnishing the airports was: Shannon Airport (including the flying boat base at Foynes) £2,135,000; Dublin Airport £980,000.  In addition, expenditure amounting to £240,000 was incurred to the 31st March, 1949, in providing equipment <Col N="1493" /> for the radio and meteorological services at both airports.</P>
      <P>(ii)  Shannon Airport is managed by officers of my Department and expenditure is met out of the Vote for Aviation and Meteorological Services.  The aggregate expenditure to the 31st March, 1949, on management and on air traffic control, meteorological and radio services was approximately £1,110,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The management of the Dublin Airport is entrusted to Aer Rianta, as agents on my behalf.  Any loss incurred is met out of the Vote for Aviation and Meteorological Services and any profit made is surrendered to the Exchequer.  The total amount paid to the company to make good net losses on the management account up to the 31st March, 1947, was £62,205. In the year to the 31st March, 1948, there was a profit on the management account of £10,788.  The accounts for the year to the 31st March, 1949, are not yet available.  The expenses of the management of Aer Rianta at the Dublin Airport do not include expenditure on the air traffic control, meteorological and radio services, as these services are operated by officers of my Department.  The expenditure for the first few years on air traffic control, meteorological and radio services at <Col N="1494" /> Dublin Airport is not readily ascertainable. In the three years to the 31st March, 1948, the expenditure amounted to approximately £70,900.</P>
    <P>(iii)  There is no net revenue from Shannon and Dublin Airports.  The aggregate revenue from all sources at Shannon Airport to the 31st March, 1949, was approximately £425,000, and the aggregate revenue from all sources at Dublin Airport to the same date was approximately £139,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government whether he is aware that there are many tenants of corporation houses in Cork City anxious to purchase their houses on a tenant-purchase basis; and, if so, whether he is prepared to examine the position with a view to introducing proposals for legislation to enable them to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>No representations on this subject have been made to me by the tenants or by the Cork Corporation. It has been ascertained from the Cork City manager that no applications for purchase have been received within recent months from corporation <Col N="1495" /> tenants, and the city council have not so far discussed the desirability of initiating a scheme.  New legislation would not be required to authorise a tenant-purchase scheme.</P>

      <P>Might I ask if the Minister has any record of a deputation of the tenants' representatives to his predecessor, the late Mr. Murphy, at which that particular matter was discussed? I might inform the Minister further that I myself was a member of that deputation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">

      <P>I have no knowledge of that deputation.  Tenant purchase is covered by Section 11 of the Housing Act, 1919, and all that has to be done is to initiate a scheme.  The city council, as I told the Deputy, have not so far discussed the desirability of initiating such a scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that there has been any general undue delay in the issue of loans by county councils under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts because of delays by their legal advisers in issuing certificates as to title.  Representations were made by a small number of local authorities regarding delays experienced in having mortgages registered in connection with advances under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts.  An approach was then made to the Land Registry on the subject and an undertaking was received from the registrar in February last that such applications would, in future, be treated as specially urgent and would be given special priority in the Land Registry and have so been given.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that numerous representations are being <Col N="1496" /> made by tenant purchasers whose lands are not revested?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is understood that the solicitor at present employed on a taxed cost basis by Clare County Council has been responsible for delays in disposing of some cases under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts. Since 18th November, 1948, 40 applications were submitted to the county solicitor to have title investigated.  No reply was received from the solicitor in 30 cases.  This is attributed by the solicitor to failure on the part of applicants to submit necessary documents or to reply to his queries.  In four other cases prior charges on the land were discovered and the question whether advances could be made has to be considered by the manager.  Two other applicants withdrew before a mortgage was executed and one application was disallowed.  The remaining cases have been cleared.  The solicitor has been requested to submit immediately a detailed report on the 30 cases still on his hands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised that this is not confined to Clare alone.  I want to make that perfectly clear.  It extends over the whole country and many people have experienced considerable inconvenience because of the fact that they incur liabilities with builders' providers and construct houses; when they subsequently make application for loans to the councils the legal advisers to the local authorities, because the lands are not revested, do not consider their title good title.  When one remembers that there are over 2,000,000 acres of land still unvested one appreciates the magnitude of the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government (Mr. Corish)</NameTxt>
      <P>In September, 1948, a circular letter was addressed to local authorities calling attention to the provisions of the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act, 1948, empowering local authorities to take certain precautions for the safety of bathers.  The circular letter expressed the Minister's deep concern at the number of bathing fatalities which occur annually at seaside resorts.  The replies furnished indicate that local authorities are aware of their powers to make bathing safer and that generally they are using these powers.  I am continuing, where necessary, to urge particular authorities to give this question the attention it deserves.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The engineering difficulculties referred to are set out in a letter from the Dublin Corporation to the Department which reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;This question was considered at length by the sub-committee on traffic conditions set up by the corporation and having heard the views of the city engineer on the difficulties which the provision of such subways would involve, the committee agreed that they were not warranted.</P>
      <P>The ideal subways should be just below street level and approached by gentle slopes of maximum grades of 1:15 so as to be convenient for the use of elderly and infirm people, children and women with perambulators. When steps are used it is primarily important that the subways be just below street level so that the number of steps is kept to the very minimum, otherwise the public will not avail of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The committee considered various suggested sites for subways.  One of these was at College Green at Cook's corner.  At this point, the main sewer runs down Grafton Street, in front of Trinity College and down College Street, and other services in the street include 24&rdquo; and 8&rdquo; gas mains, 7½&rdquo; water mains and electricity and post office cables.  This would mean that the subway would have to go down fairly deep so as to miss these services, and if an approach of the required grade were to be provided, the exit would be somewhere in the vicinity of Trinity Street or, alternatively, the front basement of one of the buildings near the corner would have to be taken over.  The cost of providing such a subway was estimated at £30,000.  Another suggested site was at Westmoreland Street at the Ballast Office to Purcell's corner, but it was found that an exit for a subway <Col N="1502" /> here would necessitate using the area at the Ballast Office enclosed by railings and the cellars underneath that office.  This would cost approximately £9,000.</P>
    <P>The same difficulties apply to all the other sites suggested and, as a result, the committee decided not to proceed.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>When this Estimate was under discussion before, I was questioning the propriety of including certain items in this particular Vote.  I referred particularly to the seed distribution scheme and the lime scheme, and the Parliamentary Secretary interjected to say that these schemes operated in the distressed areas and because of that they were very properly included in this Estimate.  I do not think that these particular subheads, which are really aids to agriculture, are any more properly placed in this Estimate than any other type of subsidy for agriculture.  If it is the purpose of the Parliamentary Secretary to inflate the amount available for these areas by the inclusion of these peculiarly agricultural items, I do not think that that is a justification for his action.  I know that he is not the person responsible for it, that they had been there before he took over.  It does not matter, however, when it began, I think my objection is a good one.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary gave us some comparative figures in relation to an explanation of the allocation of grants for the relief of unemployment. He indicated that last year there were 56,000 people in receipt of unemployment assistance and, very wrongly in my opinion, he compared that number with the number of 111,000 for as far back as 1940.  These two figures are not comparable for this reason: that the 111,000 is the number for registered unemployed and the 56,000 which he gave is the number for unemployment assistance recipients.  Anybody who looks at the numbers given quarter after quarter in the <i>Irish Trade Journal</i> will notice that the number of unemployed is always greater than the number of those in receipt of unemployment assistance.  Why the Parliamentary Secretary chose to take the number for 1940 of people actually registered as unemployed and compared that with the number of unemployment assistance recipients I do not know, unless it was to make the comparison as favourable as possible to his own case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1507" /> I should like to give the Parliamentary Secretary a few figures.  I do not propose to go back as far as 1940.  I do not think that is a proper comparison at all, because we all know that in 1940 things were practically at a standstill.  The emergency had not yet developed to such an extent that all our emergency employment schemes had got under way.  For that reason and because emigration had ceased entirely, the figure would be most unfavourable in respect of that time.  Why did the Parliamentary Secretary ignore the period between 1940-41 and the present year?  The number steadily dropped from that period until the year 1948.  In January, 1948, the registered unemployed numbered practically 78,000 and the number of unemployment assistance recipients was only 47,000.  In January of this year the number was 82,000, an increase of over 4,000 and the number of unemployment assistance recipients was 51,000.  In February of this year the number had still further increased to 84,472 and the number of recipients of unemployment assistance to 53,000.</P>
    <P>In connection with that, I might also point out that for the four years 1944, 1945, 1946 and 1947 the net emigration&mdash; that is taking the number who left the country as compared with those who came in&mdash;was 17,000.  That is for four years, but the Parliamentary Secretary will take note that for one single year, the year 1948, the number was 27,000; in other words, it was greater by 10,000 in 1948 than it was in the previous four years and these years are in sequence. I give those figures because of the reference to unemployment figures in the Parliamentary Secretary's statement. This question of unemployment and of emigration is one that is of the first importance in areas such as the one I represent.  We had there practically full employment all during the war years.  I admit that a good deal of that employment was of an emergency character.  My quarrel with the present Government on the matter is that they should not have terminated that emergency employment by one stroke.  They should have terminated it by easy stages and, if it was necessary <Col N="1508" /> to rationalise the turf industry, it should have been done very gradually. In one half of my constituency it was cut off entirely and in other parts of the constituency some turf machines were employed to lessen the effect of the blow somewhat.</P>
    <P>I have calculated from figures supplied by the Government and by the Galway County Council that the earnings in my constituency were about £30,000 annually.  Last year that was cut down to £13,000.  Anybody can realise the terrific difference that has made.  There was also a figure of £3,000 for field drainage and an additional £2,000 in respect of unemployment assistance.  Unemployment assistance does not come within the ken of the Parliamentary Secretary, but I am giving these figures, because I want to appeal very strongly to the Parliamentary Secretary to see to it, in so far as he can&mdash;and he has a very ready means to hand in the minor employment schemes&mdash;that the effect of this very bad situation will be eased in the winter time by increasing the number of employment schemes.  I think he knows that the opposite to that took place last winter.  I do not know exactly what the statistics show, but I know from observation that there was a very big falling off.  A comparison of the list of schemes for this year and the list of schemes in the previous year shows that there was also a very marked difference between the numbers of works provided in the last year of Fianna Fáil and the first year of the present Government.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to a particular work, that is, the reconstruction and adaptation of a pier located at Innisturk, on the west coast of Galway.  There are not many power boats in the locality, but there are one or two and I am satisfied that there would be more if harbour facilities were available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>In any event, my reason for introducing the subject is that it is in an area in which the scheme could be operated as either an emergency or an employment scheme. <Col N="1509" /> I want the Parliamentary Secretary to take note of it, because there is a proposal in his office in respect of this work and his office promised me that they would have the necessary inspection carried out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the employment and emergency schemes operate in the area in which this pier is located and it is as an employment scheme that the proposal was submitted.  However, I shall not labour the point further. The Parliamentary Secretary's office has the necessary particulars and I have referred to it now because, if the summer is let pass, the works cannot be carried out.  I would appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to see to it that the depressed areas that have been affected so very adversely and to such a devastating extent by the policy of the present Government will be aided by means of these employment and emergency schemes to the greatest extent possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very interested in this Vote as a Deputy representing a rural constituency.  A great deal of very useful employment can be given by these schemes and the only complaint that I have at this stage is that there does not seem to be sufficient attention given to the many schemes that are submitted year after year by Deputies representing rural constituencies. Of course, for a long time past there has been that trouble.  Candidly, I expected that there was a possibility that things might improve during the last year, that rural areas would get more attention, that the works submitted would get more consideration and, in fact, that more money would be made available for the financing of the necessary schemes.  I am sorry to say that the amount of money made available is not at all adequate to meet the demand and that, because of that, there has to be a certain apportioning of the money in the Special Employment Schemes Office.  In the apportioning of the money each year, only the very necessary works get attention and works which are regarded as being <Col N="1510" /> not so urgent are left there year after year.  It is very unfair that the wants of people who are fortunate or unfortunate enough to live outside urban areas should be neglected in the manner that they have been neglected for a very long number of years.</P>
      <P>Everybody realises that a great deal of time has been spent in endeavouring to get roads leading into small villages and groups of houses brought into a proper state of repair so that the people who live there may be afforded a meagre concession to enable them to carry on their means of livelihood. Year after year, schemes have been submitted.  When the Special Employment Schemes Office was set up to deal with these matters directly we felt that something would accrue but there does not seem to be any improvement and some of us who have climbed the flight of stairs in that office thousands of times with bundles of minor employment scheme forms completed, find that our errand has been practically fruitless.  While certain works have been carried out, nothing like the amount that we would like to see or that is necessary has been carried out.</P>
      <P>My main objection to the administration of the scheme is the regulation in regard to the number of registered unemployed in the area.  It is time to scrap the regulation.  Work that is necessary in an area should be carried out irrespective of whether there is a number of unemployed in the area or not.  There may be an area where there is the necessary number of registered unemployed on one side while on the other side there is not a sufficient number of registered unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think there would be anything wrong in suggesting that it would be possible to bring the unemployed from one side to the other and to allow them to carry out whatever scheme of work would be most necessary in the area.  I have in mind, in particular, localities where the valuations are not very high but where they are reasonably high and where the farmers may have sufficient work on their holdings to give employment to their sons.  You have other areas where <Col N="1511" /> people may be living four or five miles from a labour exchange.  They are very slow to register.  They take no pride in marching, week after week, to a labour exchange to register as unemployed. I think cases of that sort should get consideration.  We have not yet reached the happy stage where it was known that a locality had to return money because there were not sufficient men there to earn it.  If money is provided for the doing of work in an area where there are not registered unemployed, I can assure the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;I have a thorough knowledge of the conditions in rural Ireland&mdash;that there will be a sufficient number of men found available to earn the money, and do work that is necessary.  I have always objected to the doing of work just for the sake of giving employment. Under a scheme of that sort, simply because you have in an area a continuous number of registered unemployed, you can have money spent on the same works every two or three years.  At the same time, areas in which there are not registered unemployed are neglected.  That has been going on for a number of years.  These areas will continue to be neglected until this whole system is changed.</P>
    <P>There has been a motion on the Order Paper dealing with this for the past 15 months.  We thought that it would have been up for discussion long since, and that a definite decision would be taken by the Government.  We are anxious to know what Government policy is in regard to it, and to be told definitely whether this system of grading certain areas will be abolished altogether.  In view, however, of the slowness with which democratic Governments move, I am sorry to think that, after a lapse of more than 15 months, there is not a sign of that motion coming before the House for debate.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to take notice of that, and, if possible, to make an announcement as to whether it is the intention to do away with this registered unemployed system and carry out works on a broader scale and in a broader manner.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, the whole <Col N="1512" /> thing boils down to the fact that sufficient money does not seem to be made available in any single year for the carrying out of works.  The fact is that we, Deputies, who are directly responsible to the people, when we go back to them find them living under the same conditions under which they have been living for the last 40 or 50 years.  Every Deputy who comes from the country must admit that at some time or other he has submitted to the Special Employment Schemes Office or to the Board of Works or to whatever Department was there before the Special Employment Schemes Office was set up, a work of some kind or other that has been left untouched for the last 50 years.  The oldest resident in a locality can tell one that.  It may be a road in one case.  The oldest resident will tell you that, as long as he can remember, he has not seen that road get as much as a shovel of gravel or seen £1 expended on it.  In another case it may be a drain which is doing immense damage because of the fact that it has not been cleaned up.  I think that is grossly unfair, especially in view of the fact that we see other problems not so urgent getting immediate attention. We find that large areas of the country are being left in a derelict condition. They are getting no attention, only, of course, at the time when the local authorities come along to collect rates and rents from the people.  The people living in those areas are carrying on under conditions that are most unfair. I think that greater financial aid should be given to the Special Employment Schemes Office to carry out a greater number of works in the areas that I speak of.</P>
    <P>I think we must admit that we have neglected our duty, and that we are directly responsible for the complete failure there has been in attending to the interests of people who live in parts of the country which are cut off from the main roads.  There has been a lot of talk about increased production and increased output, but the position that I speak of is very unfair, particularly to the members of the farming community. Many of them are in the position at the moment, due to the neglect of the areas in which they reside, that <Col N="1513" /> they cannot avail of any modern machinery to enable them to increase production on their land.  We have the position that a threshing machine, a reaper and binder or a large lorry for the haulage of turf cannot get into a locality or a village because of the condition of the local road.  In many cases these roads are impassable.  I have received complaints, and so I am sure have many other Deputies, with regard to children who have to spend the day in school with their feet wet because of the condition of the roads over which they have to travel.  We sit here making complaints and talk of the sympathy that we have for those people, but with our eyes shut to the conditions under which they have to live.  Now, if there is to be a teasing out in the case of the Special Employment Schemes Office, I hope it will be possible for that office to give more attention to these matters, and particularly to the roads that are under its control.</P>
    <P>There is the promise, of course, that the legislation which is before the Dáil at present&mdash;the Works Bill and the Land Reclamation Bill&mdash;will take a certain amount of work away from the Special Employment Schemes Office.  I want to direct attention to two types of schemes which could be of a very beneficial character, namely, the drainage of bogs where the people cut and obtain supplies of fuel for their own needs; and, secondly, the making of accommodation, village or bog roads.  I think that the Special Employment Schemes Office might give special attention to these types of schemes.  If it were to do so it would be meeting with the wishes of the average Deputy who comes from the country.  We all know &mdash;the Parliamentary Secretary himself must know it&mdash;that in those areas along the western seaboard, where the density of population is very great, the conditions there would, in any other country, be regarded as quite primitive. Until something is done along the lines that I have indicated how can we expect the people to increase production on their land?</P>
    <P>I should like to have some indication from the Parliamentary Secretary as to whether anything will be done on these lines by the Special Employment <Col N="1514" /> Schemes Office during the coming year.  The main schemes carried out by it are, of course, the rural improvement scheme and the minor employment schemes.  Both are schemes of a beneficial character.  The minor employment scheme, one might say, absolutely drops dead when there is not a sufficient number of registered unemployed in a locality.  The policy of paying unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance still seems to get favour rather than the provision of money to enable work to be done in a locality.  If we had reached the stage where there was no useful or beneficial work to be done inside an area where you had registered unemployed, we might say that the payment of unemployment benefit would be a wise thing, but in all those localities there is any amount of useful work to be done.  We have this position, that a man may be receiving £1 or 30/- a week in unemployment assistance. Would it not be better to give him another £1 or another 30/- a week and put him at some useful work?  One begins to scratch his head and wonder, in view of all this, even if we had a change of Government every other week, whether this old system of bungling is to continue for all time, a system which is stopping production and stopping progress, and which represents neglect of the people's interests.</P>
    <P>Rural improvement schemes are very beneficial.  I have quite a good knowledge of them and the way in which they are carried out.  When you get the people to contribute a certain amount to a scheme, they take an immediate interest in it and the output per man for the money expended is very much greater than what would be done under a minor employment scheme.  When the people are asked to give a certain subscription to work which they know will be beneficial to themselves, they will be out to make sure that as much work as possible will be done and there will be no lagging or taking things easy; everyone works with a will.  My experience of rural improvement schemes is that very useful work is done and everybody seems to be contented when the work is completed. The only thing I find fault <Col N="1515" /> with is the contribution of 25 per cent. I think the people will find it hard to pay so much.  The people will point across two or three townlands and say: &ldquo;In that locality a work was done with a 100 per cent. grant, but here, because we have not sufficient on the register of unemployed, we are forced to contribute 25 per cent. of the cost.&rdquo;  That is the hard path that has to be followed in some areas before they can carry out a rural improvement scheme.</P>
    <P>When proper attention is devoted to a scheme it is carried out very efficiently. I made the suggestion some time ago that the grants for rural improvement schemes should be increased from 75 per cent. to 90 per cent.  It would be much easier to collect 10 per cent. from the people and a contribution of that amount would give those concerned that little extra interest in a scheme which will make them work harder.  That is something which will help the people concerned and the Government.  I think that suggestion could be usefully adopted instead of having a minor employment scheme where the sole object in many cases is to earn a day's or a week's wages.  People may not be concerned, unless you have a very efficient ganger or overseer, as to when they will have the work completed or how much work will be done in the day.</P>
    <P>I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will give serious consideration to this point, whether it would be an advisable thing to abolish minor employment schemes or schemes entailing full cost grants and concentrate on a 90 per cent. contribution from the Government and a 10 per cent. contribution from the people on the other schemes.  In the poorer areas the people are entitled to such concessions as road and drainage schemes; as citizens they are justified in expecting these things from the Government.  It is part and parcel of their everyday life.  They are making every effort to increase the wealth of the nation and the Government should come to their assistance where-ever possible.  If that suggestion were adopted, I have the feeling that much more work will be done for any money <Col N="1516" /> that may be expended by the Government.</P>
    <P>I am very interested in the improvement works that are being carried out on bog roads, and in the bog drainage schemes.  During the emergency, when turf was the national fuel and we were forced to rely on the bogs to keep our fires a-going, we gave every attention to bog development; but when it was discovered that turf development was just an emergency issue and when we thought it possible to import coal of any description, the attention given to the bogs was not nearly so great.  There are large numbers of people who rely on turf as a fuel.  That has been the position for the past 200 years, and there are at least 50 years ahead before our people will be obliged to turn their attention to some other type of fuel.  Turf workers should not be obliged to have to watch the weather cautiously so that they can get a few fine days to remove the turf from the bog.  That is the position they are in now, because the bog roads have not been attended to properly for over half a century.  If the weather is not favourable they find it very difficult to remove their turf.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will try to get more money made available so that where people are cutting turf to meet their fuel requirements they will be in a position to use serviceable roads.  They should not have to wait years for an improvement of the bog roads.</P>
    <P>The same thing applies to the drainage of bogs.  We know the immense amount of valuable fuel that is lost every year because of the lack of suitable bog drainage.  Bog drainage should be carried out every six or seven years.  Our bog areas are declining and turf is becoming more valuable and our people should be facilitated so that they can get the maximum quantity out of each turf bank.  It is in this connection that a proper system of bog drainage is essential and the Parliamentary Secretary should direct his attention to this important aspect.</P>
    <P>The main cause of complaint in relation to special employment schemes is that there is not sufficient money made available.  In my county the amount made availeve <Col N="1517" /> able last year was approximately the same as what was made available in the preceding year and it was not even one-tenth sufficient to carry out the works that were submitted.  If we could only reach the stage when a road accommodating people into their lands, their homes or their bogs could be completed and repairs carried out every six or seven years, we would have achieved something worth while.  I think that would not be asking too much from any Government.  If we could reach that stage, these people would be satisfied.  At the moment we do not seem to get anywhere.  I think the chief cause is because sufficient financial assistance is not made available. I would like to see more decentralisation in the carrying out of these schemes.  I think that a special office should be set up in each country, the staff of which would have local knowledge of local surroundings. When a scheme is submitted, while everything concerning it may be taken into consideration in the Board of Works, I think special power should be given to local inspectors to make specific recommendations as to the most essential schemes.  That would give the man on the job an opportunity of voicing his opinion.  I do not know whether that suggestion can be adopted, but I make it in the hope that some attention will be given to it.</P>
    <P>With regard to inspection, it is easy enough to get a group of individuals to agree to the carrying out of certain works.  We have submitted schemes in the past 12 months.  In some cases no inspector has called so far in order to examine the layout and estimate the cost involved.  I do not know the reason for the delay.  Surely it would not require a genius to examine and estimate the possible cost of laying a quarter of a mile or a mile of road?  If there are not sufficient engineers available at present to do that work I suggest that the supervisors and the first-class gangers are fully competent to examine such a proposed work and estimate the cost of it.</P>
    <P>With regard to the actual carrying out of such works, I suggest they should be done between the months of <Col N="1518" /> October and March so that the people who contribute towards the cost of them will be in a position to benefit by the actual work itself.  At the moment these people do not know what they will be called upon to contribute.  They do not know the reason for the delay. Something must be done in this respect. The Government must realise that Ireland does not end when one passes out of the suburbs of Dublin. All over the country essential works of this kind are necessary and it is the duty of the Government to ensure that they are carried out with the least possible delay.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary must put life into his particular office.  He must cut out as much waste as possible and any overlapping that may occur. Every time an inspector travels out on one of these schemes it costs money. I have known where a particular scheme has been inspected 18 times in 18 years and yet nothing has been done about it.  One must realise that there is waste and overlapping.  That is not the fault of the official whose duty it is to examine these schemes.  I urge upon the Parliamentary Secretary to cut out some more of the red tape. Every Deputy will be very glad to assist him in speeding up that operation so that these essential works will be carried out for the benefit of the country as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The only problem I wish to raise is that of flooding and the consequences of flooding.  It is difficult nowadays to discover to which particular Minister one should address one's remarks on this particular problem because of the different drainage schemes initiated by different Ministers and by local authorities.  I understand that in this debate I am precluded from raising the question of compensation because that would entail legislation.  I think I am in order, however, in referring to the way in which the consequences of flooding might be obviated.  Most Deputies when speaking of flooding have in mind the rural areas.  One must always bear in mind the fact that flooding in the rural areas has effects upon the urban areas and that flooding may occur in <Col N="1519" /> urban areas even when it does not occur in the former.  I raise the matter chiefly in reference to the particular flooding in last Februray in the City of Cork.  Cork City suffered severely from flooding as a result of heavy rains in February and March.  There are two or three areas there which are more seriously affected than other&mdash;Blackpool, what is known as &ldquo;the flat of the city&rdquo;, and, ironically enough, the area in the immediate vicinity of the labour exchange.</P>
      <P>It must be disheartening to those drawing unemployment assistance to find themselves hampered by floods. These floods could be obviated if these self-same people were employed on useful work to prevent their occurrence. During the flooding last year many bridges were destroyed.  All these obsolete bridges should be examined and made reasonably safe.  One bridge was knocked down on the main road between Cork and Mallow.  By the ingenuity of the Army engineers it was put into commission again within a week.  That temporary bridge is still in existence.  Surely that scheme could be tackled.  Not only should these bridges be replaced, but those that are dangerous should be examined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole problem is bound up with the inadequate provision made to obviate the cause of flooding. At the moment there are two Bills going through the House designed to assist the rural community and relieve it from the dangers and consequences of flooding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is only natural that in the course of this work excess water will be diverted to the smaller streams which, <Col N="1520" /> in turn, will carry that water to the main arteries.  These main arteries run through the principal cities and towns before they reach the sea.  From that point of view Cork is particularly badly placed.  It is built in a saucer. As a possible consequence of the operation of these two measures floods will be caused in the City of Cork unless works are carried out immediately to prevent such an occurrence. There will be widespread flooding of low-lying districts in Cork City.  I have examined these places myself and I am sure that, with a certain amount of banking and building up of dykes, a lot of the flooding caused in recent years could have been obviated.  I do not intend to labour the question, but since these people are precluded from getting compensation when they suffer serious damage, I think the work should at least be undertaken with the utmost expedition and that the flooding should be obviated in every possible manner.  I would suggest that emergency schemes, unemployment schemes, or whatever one likes to call them, should be undertaken to provide useful employment for the people in these areas and to protect people who are subjected to this ceaseless flooding, particularly in low-lying areas in Cork City.  As I have said, Cork is shaped like a saucer with hills all around it, with one outlet towards the sea.  If there is any undue rainfall during the coming year, or if any great proportion of the works contemplated under the Bill as at present before the House is carried out, with conditions as they are at present and the inadequate safeguards against flooding in the immediate vicinity, I must say that I can see little likelihood of the unfortunate people who were subjected to flooding last year and who suffered such serious losses being able to escape during the coming year.</P>

      <P>I should like to point out, as other Deputies have already done, that the employment emergency scheme is not meeting the position in rural Ireland as it should. In the past it has served a very useful purpose as an emergency scheme, but it should be converted into a more constructive scheme that would be of <Col N="1521" /> national importance and would be useful to the people of the country as a whole.  In my constituency we have about 1,000 miles of laneways which are nobody's child.  I have grown weary of trying to focus attention on this matter.  I thought that the Parliamentary Secretary, remembering what he used to say when he was on this side of the House, would produce white blackbirds on coming into office, but he has made very little progress with that particular type of work.  It is sickening to be forced constantly to make representations on matters of national importance such as these.  We have, as I say, 1,000 miles of these laneways in County Dublin and the county council say it is not their job to look after them.  If one puts up an emergency employment scheme, one is told that there are not enough unemployed in the area.  If you try to get the work done by means of a rural improvement scheme, you generally find some crank who will not co-operate with other people, with the result that the work cannot be done in that manner.  I think all this work should be treated on a national basis irrespective of the amount of unemployment that is in any particular area.  I look upon this work as being just as necessary as arterial drainage or the various other schemes which are looked upon as of national importance.  One would need a boat at certain times to get into some of the houses along these laneways.  Dairy farmers and others are unable to get in coal or other commodities which they require for their households.  We have been bringing these matters to the attention of the Department since the Parliamentary Secretary was appointed, but all to no avail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With all due respect to the Parliamentary Secretary, I would say that he has become just as good at giving a parliamentary reply now as if he had been in office for a very long time.  We are sent here to do certain work for the people of our constituencies and to ventilate their grievances.  Candidly I am a bit fed up with making representations of this kind because one might as well be shouting from the top of Nelson Pillar as try to make constructive suggestions in matters of this kind. I have been getting a good deal of <Col N="1522" /> annoyance notwithstanding the fact that I have made representations from time to time.</P>

      <P>I am not losing all hope but I am putting these matters before the Parliamentary Secretary once more.  There was one organisation in this country in days gone by which did much useful work.  It was certainly an organisation of national importance and it was not bound up with so much red tape as the present Department is.  I say that, knowing the work which it carried out in the area in which I was born.  I refer to the old Congested Districts Board which was provided with a certain amount of money to carry out a particular job and it carried out that job. Now it is almost impossible to get certain work carried out under an emergency employment scheme.  I do not wish to delay the House unduly but I think it is about time that the 1,000 miles of laneways in County Dublin should be made somebody's child.  In County Dublin we shall gain nothing from the land reclamation scheme or the other schemes which are before the country at present and I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that he should pay immediate attention to the matters which I have brought to his attention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like in this debate to emphasise the importance of the Government's making available much more money for the roads and drains referred to by previous speakers.  There are certain types of roads all over the country which are in a deplorable condition.  It is a terrible thing to find in rural Ireland to-day that in certain townlands children cannot travel by certain roads to or from school and that they are forced to cross fences and go through fields. The Parliamentary Secretary must be aware of that quite as well as any other individual because these matters have been brought to his attention and he was one of the most critical Deputies in the House in regard to them when he was sitting on the Opposition Benches.  I and many other people expected that big things would <Col N="1523" /> be done in this Department when he came into it because he had indicated on many occasions the laxity that existed in regard to the provision of funds and the carelessness which he alleged was shown by previous Parliamentary Secretaries in not providing additional money for these purposes.  He deals with two different types of schemes.  He has, first of all, to deal with bog development schemes. I think it is a terrible thing, on taking up the Book of Estimates, to find that under sub-head I the sum of money made available this year, instead of showing an increase as one would expect from some of the statements made by the Parliamentary Secretary in former years, has been cut from £90,000 to £60,000, showing a reduction of £30,000.  I am quite satisfied that he is well aware of the necessity for an increase in this Estimate rather than a reduction.  I cannot understand why he made no effort to try and secure additional money, or at least to try to keep this Estimate as it was in the days when Fianna Fáil were in office.</P>
      <P>If Deputy Commons, when speaking at some of the meetings in my constituency on behalf of the Parliamentary Secretary, made a speech like the one he made from the benches opposite to-day I can guarantee that the Parliamentary Secretary would have seen that the amount in this Vote would be at least as high as it was when Fianna Fáil were in office.  There would not be any reduction in it, because he would have torn the Minister for Finance to pieces and told him of the destruction that was going to come upon Clann na Talmhan in his constituency as well as in the constituency which Deputy Commons represents.  We have an all-round reduction in the Estimate in connection with these important works, because in all cases salaries and travelling expenses have gone up and that means that less money will be spent on schemes throughout the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>As I pointed out, the condition of these roads is deplorable and some effort should be made by the Parliamentary Secretary to fulfil some of the promises he made in connection with this Department.  Then we have the unemployment position.  At present there is a large number of people registered in the labour exchanges throughout the country looking for work and there is practically no work available.  When the peat schemes were closed down a couple of years ago by the Government, we were promised that other schemes would be provided and that employment would be found for everybody.  Unfortunately, those promises have not been fulfilled.  As has been pointed out time and again on every Estimate, not merely on this one, the unemployment position is becoming more serious from day to day. This Department is expected to come to the assistance of those people who are out of work, but little or no effort is being made.  That is all due to the fact that sufficient money is not made available.  I never blame officials, because I have always found that they are prepared to work hard and to allocate all the money that is available to them for the carrying out of schemes.  The amount provided in this Estimate is entirely too small and neither an official nor anybody else can do anything when that is the case. Year in and year out this type of grievance is paraded in this House and it is time that serious notice was taken of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter I should like to refer to in connection with unemployment.  When the peat schemes were closed down some 18 months ago, promises were made by the Government not merely that there would not be any more unemployed than there were, but that all people who were displaced from the bogs would be given preference for other work.  For instance, we were promised that gangers who would be let off by county councils and by the Land Commission would get first preference and that employment would be given to them on public works.  Unfortunately those men who were displaced had to take to the high road because, owing to the policy <Col N="1525" /> of the Parliamentary Secretary, I say deliberately, they were ignored and many of them still find themselves unemployed because of the fact that the Parliamentary Secretary had to find employment for his political supporters. All over my constituency men who were displaced bog gangers and Land Commission workers who were laid off because of the reduction in the Land Commission Estimate are still idle while men were taken on for peat scheme and minor employment schemes who had no previous experience as gangers and a number of whom never had experience as workers on county council or similar schemes.</P>

      <P>Last January, when this was at peak point, I wrote to the Office of Public Works asking that office to supply me with the names of gangers that had been appointed since this office was established in Galway.  I got back a communication refusing to give me the names, so that I could have the matter thoroughly investigated. I do not believe that the office was responsible for refusing to give me the names.  I did not need to get the names from the office because I already had them and I have here, from all over the country, lists that I could read for the Parliamentary Secretary of men who never worked an hour for any <Col N="1526" /> public authority in their lives until they started off in this particular Department to carry out minor employment schemes, men who have no experience while, as I say, experienced gangers are left idle at home.  That is a great disgrace.  It is something that should not be tolerated.  The type of bluff that we have listened to for a long time in connection with this matter should be called here and now. Men who are experienced in this particular type of work should be given an opportunity of getting employment when employment of the particular type that they have been trained in is available.  I do not want to parade a list of names in this House.  It would not be a fit or proper thing to do, but if the Parliamentary Secretary challenges me or tells me that I am telling a barefaced lie, I can give him the list here and now.</P>

      <P>At his dictation and, if that is not so, I would like to know how any engineer went around and selected the people that were selected. It is a great disgrace for any man in charge of a Department to be doing such disgraceful work and to be wasting the people's money in such a disgraceful fashion.  We do not end there.  We go on further, fooling more people in other directions.  I had questions down &mdash;as a matter of fact I went into some of these things in detail in the Office of Public Works&mdash;in connection with certain schemes throughout the country where promises were made by the Parliamentary Secretary to people that certain work could be done that I knew could not possibly be done on the basis that was suggested.  I raised a question in the House in connection with Cloonagh-Rosmearling Road, where the Parliamentary Secretary got an unfortunate <Col N="1527" /> man to collect £30 to repair the road on the guarantee that the Board of Works would give £200.  The Board of Works had never mentioned £200, as I ascertained at a later stage, and that unfortunate man felt very shy going back to the people with this money in his pocket.  It could not be accepted because no provision had been made for any such sum.  That sort of thing should not be done and the office should not be used in this particular way.  Of course, there may be an excuse for that because it happened at the time of an election and in the Parliamentary Secretary's usual way he thought he could fool some of the people some of the time, at any rate. I have the same experience everywhere I go throughout the country of promises being made.  I could put down questions of that particular type day after day. I daresay the Office of Public Works would make me well aware that such schemes were never sanctioned and that such allocations as would be referred to in the various questions were never made on the basis that the Parliamentary Secretary had suggested. I suggest that we should have a little more honesty from this particular Department and from the people who are in charge of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again I suggest that efforts should be made to have these grants increased.  There is continual complaint throughout the country at the delay in putting these schemes into operation.  I do not believe that that delay is due to the Department.  It is probably due to a rush of applications and the fact that there is no money available.  There is no use in any Department rushing through applications and examining all the schemes when there would not be a ½d. available to carry out the work.  The Parliamentary Secretary should be a little more determined in striking the table before the Minister for Finance and telling him that more money must be made available for relief works under this Vote.  He should try to secure for us a little more money for the schemes that require to be carried out. These schemes have been put up from his own side of the House as well as <Col N="1528" /> from this side.  That shows their importance.  I know, of course, that there are certain regulations that have to be carried out but, so far as the employment position is concerned, we must take note of the fact that there are bog roads where schemes were in operation and where private producers operate where the condition of the road is so bad that the people are unable to get into their bogs.  A great deal more work could be carried out on these roads.  That would give very useful employment and the money would be all well spent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, I knew Deputy Killilea was interested in Galway, and certainly I have sympathy for him trying to fulfil all my broken promises.  I am afraid that he will never succeed.  My advice to the Deputy is that he should mind his own business and I shall try to mind mine. The statement has been made that county council gangers who had been laid off in Galway did not get work in our office.  Luckily enough, I had expected this.  I have here a report from my inspector in Galway which I shall read for the House.  It refers to work to <Col N="1529" /> date&mdash;that is, the month of April.  It says that 239 schemes have been carried out.  The inspector says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We employed over 50 county council gangers and 16 Land Commission gangers.  Where experienced gangers of above classes were not available, men with Bord na Móna and agricultural drainage supervisory experience were selected.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Not in any case in the past 12 months has an inexperienced ganger been appointed.  Still, there has been the reference to the Clann na Talmhan clubs in the County Galway.  Deputy Killilea ought to be the last man to make that reference about gangers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not 18 months in office yet.  The appointment of gangers is solely the work of the engineer in charge.  If any Deputy, or if I myself, were entitled to dictate to the engineer in charge and say: &ldquo;Put on Tom because he is Fianna Fáil&rdquo;, or &ldquo;John because he is Clann na Talmhan&rdquo;, the class of work that would be done would not suit our director.  I would be the last man to interfere, and I assure the House that I did not interfere.  Deputy Killilea knows that well.  Of course, he may be thinking of the old type of a gangers' meeting on the day or the night before an election and sending one out to the fellows who were working to tell them that, if they do not vote the following day in a certain way, the works would be closed down.  Deputy Killilea believes in that class of business, and he tries to bring me down to it, but he cannot.  I think it was foolish for him to make the statement that he did make.  I can tell him that it was incorrect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Grady referred to the reduction of £30,000 on bog development. We are spending £60,000.  I am sure the Deputy will agree that, for a good many years, works under this head have been brought to a fairly good standard.  A certain amount of work has been done.  Certain roads have been built and drainage done on the bogs.  I think that there <Col N="1530" /> is sufficient money for drainage work. I think the reduction of £30,000 will inflict no hardship on anybody.</P>

That was the only severe criticism of the Estimate.  We have been notified by the Department of Local Goverment that, for the future, they are not carrying out any hand-won turf production. Therefore, we had to cut out the provision under that head completely.</P>

      <P>There was a good deal of reference to the fact that we are spending money in areas where there are registered unemployed. There was a good deal said on both sides of the House&mdash;more from my own side than from the Opposition&mdash;that we should spend money in areas regardless of the number of registered unemployed.  If we were to do that, I ask Deputies to consider what the position would be.  Roughly, the areas in which this money is spent are Donegal, Mayo, Kerry, portion of Galway and portion of Clare, the poorest areas in the country.  If we were to spend the money that is voted here on every area regardless of the number of registered unemployed there and to spend it on the most necessary works, what is going to happen to the poorer areas?  If we were to spend money in Kildare, Meath, Westmeath, Longford, Wexford, every place where there is a necessary work to be done, what then would happen to the poorer areas?  It would be all right, I suppose, if somebody suggested that I should try and get the Government to make £20,000,000 available for the purpose. But no Government has ever accepted full responsibility for the maintenance of all roads in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A great case was made for cul-de-sac roads.  Deputy Childers said there <Col N="1531" /> were 20,000 miles of them.  I do not know where he got his figures.  My information is that there are 40,000 miles of such roads.  If, as Deputies have suggested, we were to accept full responsibility for all those roads then we would want at least £30,000,000 or £40,000,000.  But no Government has ever accepted full responsibility for them.  In view of the fact that so much has been said on this from all sides of the House I will try and hammer out some change in the system.  Even if a change can be made I shall still have to keep an eye on seeing that the money available will go into the areas where there is distress and where it will be used during certain months of the year for the relief of the unemployed.  Other Deputies suggested that we give a higher grant than 75 per cent. towards the cost of rural improvements schemes.  In cases where it has been proved necessary we have given 100 per cent., in other cases, 80 per cent., others again, 95 per cent., and, in exceptional cases, 100 per cent.  No later than last week in Deputy Killilea's area we gave the full cost.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It was an area where it resulted in connecting two public roads.  The execution of the work resulted in great convenience in getting to bogs, to churches and to markets.  It was an area that fully deserved the grant.  We seldom do that.  Why should we give the full grant in all cases?  Deputy Smith knows that in any area two farmers can qualify under the scheme.  Why should the State give 100 per cent. of the grant to accommodate two farmers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy P.J. Burke referred to the poor farmers in the County Dublin and said they could not contribute.  If the farmers in the County Dublin are <Col N="1532" /> not able to contribute their small quota to the cost of a work under a rural improvements scheme it would be hard to expect farmers down in the poor parts of the country to do it.  In the office they tell me that for the past 12 months there has been a great turn up from the people; the people are making their contributions fairly well and we have carried out more rural improvements schemes this year than for the past five or six years.  You can understand that because people are more or less better off than they were and probably money is more flush.</P>
    <P>This rural improvements scheme is a great scheme and I think when three-quarters of the cost is given in order that people may get a road constructed, it is a good contribution from the State.  Somebody listening to the debates here said: &ldquo;I think the Government should be the Opposition and the Opposition should be the Government, because if that were so, everybody in this country would get everything he wanted.&rdquo;  Probably that was the way under the last Government, too.  We must realise that the Government cannot do everything for the people.</P>
    <P>I have all the points that Deputies mentioned and I can assure the House that I will examine them carefully.  I take exception to the statement made by Deputy McQuillan.  He talked about going to see officials and he said that there is a smile on our faces when we can say &ldquo;No&rdquo; to some scheme that may be submitted.  That is not the case.  The regulations must be observed. I must pay this tribute to the director and every member of the staff, that they have been found most accommodating, and if a scheme is submitted to them I think it is usually found that they are only too willing to do all they can.  I am sure my predecessor, Deputy O'Grady, will agree with me there.  It is far from smiles being on their faces if they get an opportunity to refuse anybody.  On the contrary, they are only too anxious to assist.  As Deputy Commons mentioned, there is a motion to come before the House and, if the House decides on a change, we will be <Col N="1533" /> only too delighted to accept that decision. It is a matter for the House to make the change.</P>

I may be asked to spend £100, £200 or £500 in certain areas, but I am bound by the regulations.

I shall carefully examine the points they made.  I will look into any changes that it is possible for me to make.  I will do my best in that connection and if I see it is wise to do it I will make that recommendation to the Government.  But it is not so very simple as some Deputies may think.  I am referring especially to Deputy McQuillan's point.  It is not so easy to go to the country and spend this money regardless of certain considerations. You must have certain standards, especially in the poorer areas. This is a special employment schemes office for the relief of registered unemployed and we must observe existing regulations until such time as we can hammer out something that will be more suitable to the House.  I will do my best to see if I can make any changes.  I want this money to go to the people who require it most. Anything I can do for them I will do.</P>

      <P>I should like to know if a local authority has the right to select what is considered the most necessary employment scheme in its area without the Board of Works making its conditions.

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week I said that I was satisfied that everything that could be done to bring in a satisfactory comprehensive social welfare scheme would be done by the present Minister.  I was rather worried, however, by some of the remarks made in the debate last week by Deputy de Valera, the Leader of the Opposition. As I understood the position, this proposed comprehensive social welfare scheme has the approval of every Party.  In the ordinary way of Party politics each Party makes up its own mind as to the particular type of social welfare scheme that should be put into operation.  I was rather surprised, therefore, at some of the comments made by Deputy de Valera.  He said that we should deal with fundamental principles rather than with details.  He said we should examine this problem in order to find out whether or not old age pensions should be paid to everybody and whether or not benefits should be paid to those who are unable to work.  He said that, having decided that principle, we should work out a scheme under which we would decide what we could afford to pay and what it would be wise to pay. I would have thought that that fundamental principle had been decided. I thought the fundamental principle had been decided by the Fianna Fáil Party itself.  It has come as a surprise to me to hear the Leader of such a large Party declare that this fundamental principle should be decided now. In dealing with the question of old age pensions, Deputy de Valera said that he had not been able to satisfy himself completely as to how the proposal that everybody should receive and old age pension on reaching a certain age would work out.  As far as Deputy de Valera is concerned, it is still a matter for serious consideration <Col N="1537" /> whether every person reaching 65 or 70 years should receive an old age pension.  Now, I can understand that expression but, in view of the fact that other members of the Fianna Fáil Party have severely criticised the Minister for not bringing in a White Paper dealing with this comprehensive scheme, it is somewhat strange to find the Leader of that Party not in step with the members of the Party. Deputy de Valera says that the</P>
      <P>&ldquo;fundamental question is one of tremendous seriousness.  We ought, if possible, to have certain principles which we would first discuss and, having discussed these principles, try to arrive at the best judgment we can as to what the community, assuming our duty, could afford and what it would be wise for the community to give.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am quoting from Volume 116, No. 9, columns 1466 and 1467.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a very short time the Minister's White Paper will come before the House.  It is at present before the Government.  When the Government has completed its consideration the White Paper will be before the House and before the people.  It shocks me to think that, when that White Paper is produced, we shall have to go back&mdash; that is, if Deputy de Valera has his way&mdash;and discuss the whole fundamental principle as to whether or not there should be old age pensions or social welfare schemes.  I am sure that the contribution of Deputy de Valera must have come as a surprise even to members of his own Party.  I hope that the members of his Party will decide these fundamental principles before we come to debate this White Paper.  As far as the Government Parties are concerned, we have made up our minds, not only as to the fundamental principle involved, but also in relation to a number of details. As far as we are concerned, the fundamental principle is that this comprehensive social welfare scheme must be brought in.  We believe that every person who is unfit to earn a livelihood must be maintained by the State in reasonable comfort.  From our point <Col N="1538" /> of view there is no necessity to debate that principle.  That principle is established.</P>
    <P>In column 1464 of the same volume Deputy de Valera, referring to the worker, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Supposing he is an artisan or labourer, the ordinary wage he is able to get is generally only barely what is sufficient to enable him to live.  Therefore, if he is not able to get the work, there would seem to be an obligation on the State to give him, when unable to work, practically what he would get for working. But if you do, you deprive him, naturally, of the incentive.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The principle, in so far as there is a principle, of the mentality behind that expression is entirely out of date.  It is entirely antiquated.  In other words, what Deputy de Valera says is that the artisan or the labourer, by his work, will be entitled only to get barely sufficient to enable him to live. That was a deliberate utterance by Deputy de Valera, whereas the whole idea, on this side of the House anyway, and the whole idea in the minds of progressive people right through the country and right through the world, is that the artisan or the labourer&mdash; the two classes mentioned by Deputy de Valera&mdash;must get sufficient to live in reasonable comfort.  Not only that, but they must get suffcient to enable them to put something by for the rainy day and something to enable them to acquire the ownership of property.  Perhaps that is why we are now endeavouring, and why the Minister has been endeavouring for the past 14 or 15 months, to produce a scheme that should have been introduced years ago.  Perhaps the explanation of the delay in the introduction of that scheme was the mentality that was behind this contribution of Deputy de Valera, Leader of the Opposition.</P>
    <P>At the outset, Deputy de Valera expressed some doubts as to whether or not his contribution was within the rules of order of the debate.  I do think that from his own point of view and the Party point of view, it might have <Col N="1539" /> been better if the contribution had been ruled out of order by the Ceann Comhairle.  It was a reactionary pronouncement, an out-of-date pronouncement and I sincerely hope that this House will be able to have its new social welfare scheme well established within a short time, so that it can never be interfered with, should a person of that mentality ever get into power in this country again.</P>
    <P>Naturally I do not know what is in the White Paper but during the past year I have been approached by a number of people throughout the country who were disabled, some from birth.  They had some form of paralysis. They were unable to earn a livelihood and they were of different ages.  One case, of which I have particulars, was that of a girl of 48 years of age.</P>

      <P>During the past year, some of these matters have come to my notice and in view of the principles that have been mentioned during the course of the debate by several Deputies I think I would be right in suggesting to the Minister that this considerable body of people in the country who are unfit to work because of some form of paralysis should be covered.  Every Deputy meets some of these cases.  We approach the Minister for Health and we are sent to the Minister for Social Welfare and we are sent back from the Minister for Social Welfare to the Minister for Health.  It is an unfair handicap on the parents of these boys and girls, men and women, <Col N="1540" /> that they should have to be maintained by their parents when under a comprehensive social welfare scheme they would be looked after by the State.</P>

      <P>I have finished, Sir. I have made the point and I shall leave it there.  There has been some discussion in regard to the register of unemployed. I agree with Deputy Lemass that that register should be broken up into classifications.  I suggest, and I agree with those who have already suggested, that the register at the moment is not a fair reflex or a fair indication of the number of persons who are unemployed in the country and who are fit to work.  We have quite a number of people on the register who are over 65.  We have quite a number of people on it who, because of some disability, either mental or physical, are unfit to work.  I suggest to the Minister that that unemployment register should be examined and that all persons on it who are unemployable because of mental or physical disability or because of their age should be put into a part B of the register until such time as the social welfare scheme deals with them. It would be much better from every-body's point of view if we knew that we had so many hundreds of people or so many thousands of people registered as unemployed and fit and able to work, rather than the position we are in at the moment where we have thousands who are unemployable appearing on our register week after week and month after month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made to the Court of Referees and the chairman.  One case did come to my attention about a year ago in the City of Dublin in which a person with one leg was denied unemployment assistance because it was held that he was not genuinely seeking employment.  I know that the regulations laid down for the court give the court very wide discretion.  If those regulations are operated in a humane way by the court, I do not think anyone will have any objection.  But in the present position, when we have <Col N="1541" /> thousands of men who are absolutely physically fit unable to find employment, hundreds and perhaps thousands of them here in the City of Dublin, it is hard to believe that a chairman of the Court of Referees would say to a man with one leg: &ldquo;You will not get any more unemployment assistance because you are not genuinely seeking work.&rdquo;  It is cases of that kind that I think are responsible for the criticism of the Court of Referees in this debate.</P>
    <P>Over a long number of years, we have all been endeavouring to focus attention on this question of a social welfare scheme and every person like myself who has been engaged in that campaign over the last 15 or more years was delighted when the Minister took over the responsibility for this Department of Social Welfare.  I am satisfied that one second has not been wasted by himself or his Department in the preparation of this White Paper.  I look forward anxiously to seeing it.  I look forward anxiously to seeing in the White Paper protection for unfortunate people who, because of age or disability or otherwise, are unfit for work.  I look forward to seeing in that White Paper full and adequate provision for all those persons.  I hope the Minister will be able to adhere to his promise that, before the end of this year, each and every one of us will have that White Paper in our hands, that the legislation necessary to implement it will be before the House.  From the point of view of the general administration of the Department, the view is held right through the country by every right thinking person, by every person of responsibility, that the Department is being operated well and in a humane way by the Minister, who has made tremendous strides in the very short period of 15 or 16 months.  When we come to discuss this Estimate next year, I hope the Minister will be able to announce and record that this great scheme which he and so many of us have been anxiously looking forward to for years has by the vote of this House, been put into operation.</P>

      <P>I have been asking the Tánaiste to reconsider the question of publication of advertisements in English only and the question of the printing of the new card for insurance stamps which, I understand, is to be completely in English.  If that is the position, it is a step backward.</P>

      <P>Why not assume, unless we hear from them to the contrary, that they have no objection to having them in Irish?  That means that those who want Irish must ask for it.  The others will undoubtedly be in the majority and, if it is to be decided as a majority question, there is no doubt what the result will be.  I thought that the fact that there is a section in the unemployment assistance branch which is dealing with the Gaeltacht and is trying to do its work through Irish was an indication that the Tánaiste would <Col N="1543" /> go on the line of extending the policy of Gaelicisation in the Department as far as possible.  As the Department deals with the ordinary people of the country to a greater extent, perhaps, than any other Department, if the officers are in favour of Irish and display an anxiety to use Irish and to extend the use of Irish, the language will benefit accordingly.  On the other hand, if the feeling is that the Government decision and the Government policy is in the other direction and that no special attention need be given to Irish, not only will Irish suffer in the areas where it still is spoken but throughout the country.  Young people coming on the register and coming into the schemes, who, in the majority if cases, have sufficient knowledge of Irish to enable them to fill these forms and to transact their business in the national language, will feel that there is a certain bias against it.  In this matter, Departments ought not to take a neutral attitude.  They ought to show that they are definitely on the side of the language, unless there are very strong reasons for not doing so.</P>
      <P>I notice that the Vote contains a sub-head for health embarkation allowances.  Does that mean, may I ask the Tánaiste, that it is in connection with medical examination of persons leaving the country to take up employment elsewhere?  It is an indication that the precautions and measures which had to be taken in the past and about which one heard so much propaganda and misrepresentation have still to be carried on; that a large number of people have still to leave this country to find employment, and that the State has to participate in certain schemes guaranteeing that they will be physically and medically satisfactory on taking up such employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Department must be entrusted with the question of juvenile advisory committees which used to function.  I am afraid they have not been very active.  In connection with unemployment insurance, there is a difficult period between the time that the young person leaves school and the <Col N="1544" /> time he or she comes into unemployment insurance.  It had been the practice to have advisory committees representing the Department, business men and the trade unions.  Very valuable advice and assistance could be given to the young people seeking employment.</P>
    <P>There is a certain grain of truth in the mass of matter which we heard from Deputy Cowan, that is, that if we are to have social services, it is obviously better that they should be administered by sympathetic personnel who would try to deal with the problems that present themselves as human problems affecting the lives of young people, for example, rather than that they should be dealt with, as is generally charged against State schemes, in a cold, impersonal way without regard or, perhaps, without sufficient regard to the individual feelings or the individual case, simply dealt with as a reference number.</P>
    <P>We had a scheme of youth training under the supervision of the Army, called the Construction Corps.  When I see the controversy that is being raised by the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce with regard to unemployment assistance and the drawing of unemployment assistance by single men, I want to say that it is a well-known fact, as Deputy Cowan has said, that there are people who are unemployable. I do not agree with him that there may be thousands of such cases but there are a certain number who are unemployable.  Because of their physical condition, they would be quite incapable of doing ordinary constructional work and anything in the way of navvying would be entirely beyond them and it is very doubtful if they would give a reasonable economic return even in much lighter forms of employment.  The advantage of the Construction Corps was that these young men were given training under Army supervision.  It is perhaps the case that the scheme was lacking in one respect.  If it had been completely in charge of persons acquainted with industrial conditions and who were themselves expert in training people <Col N="1545" /> for industrial occupations and who were selected solely from that point of view, it would have been more successful but it had the advantage that these young people were properly fed and properly looked after and after about a month or so there was tremendous improvement in their condition.  It is a pity that we have not a scheme of that kind.  The juvenile advisory committees are too limited.  There is too much of the Civil Service characteristic about them but they might, perhaps, be extended so that centres could be set up, if that were considered advisable.</P>
    <P>I am not holding myself out as an expert in this matter.  But I say that there is a tremendous loss to the country if we have young people leaving school at an early age and if there is no organisation to take charge of them, to advise them, in the first place, with regard to the vocations they should follow; and, secondly, to try to prepare them physically by physical training, and so on, and industrially by giving them some technical education.  In the case of young men of about 18 years of age, some of the religious orders in Dublin, who have accomplished national work, found that it was rather beyond their resources and beyond what they felt they were able to achieve to take them on, but it should be possible to devise a system something like Comhairle le Leas Oige. We approached the problem there through the youth clubs, but from the trade union side it ought to be possible and I am sure trade union leaders would take a particular interest in that stratum who are not being looked after and who are not being helped along, in the way that we would all desire, to become good citizens and good workers, able to take their part in the national economy.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Cowan asks us to give our opinion in advance about this White Paper, he is putting us rather in the position of the scaltáin who, as is well known, has his eyes closed and his mouth open and is prepared to swallow anything that may be put into it.  I think we are entitled to wait until we see what the White Paper <Col N="1546" /> gives us before us come to conclusions as to its merits, as to its suitability to our circumstances and as to whether it is going to be worth the cost. Undoubtedly, whatever the proposals may be when they come to be considered by the Government, it is the amount of the bill in the last analysis that the taxpayers will have to pay that is going to decide very largely, I suppose, the Government's own decision, and also the general feeling of the public.</P>
    <P>I think that I might remind Deputy Cowan that Fianna Fáil has nothing whatever to be ashamed of in its record as regards social services.  The Deputy is not an old member of the House.  He is, perhaps, as old as I am, but he is not as long a member of the House.  He has forgotten that for many years Fianna Fáil were taunted with being profligate in the expenditure of money&mdash;that squandermania was one of our chief characteristics. Two years ago the present Taoiseach stated&mdash;the reference is column 73 of the Dáil Debates, 13th May, 1947&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...money is wanted for social services.  That is the justification for all the extravagances that have been perpetrated and inflicted upon this country by Government profligacy in the last six or seven years.  Spending on social services is the excuse for everything.  The existence of social services is an indication of ill-health in the body politic.  In any case, as has been said, they are nothing more than a row of medicine bottles showing disease in the household.  The sounder your economic fabric is, the less need there is for social services.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that, when Deputy Cowan anticipates general agreement from all sides of the House for these proposals, the nature of which we know nothing about so far&mdash;we know very little indeed because the Tánaiste has not given us very much of an indication of what he has in his mind&mdash;he is assuming a great deal when he thinks that the Tánaiste, in addition to all the other work he has to perform, has been able to bring about such a <Col N="1547" /> wonderful change in affairs as that he can convert the Taoiseach, who spoke in the terms I have quoted, to his own particular point of view.  But, of course, it is not only the Taoiseach but the Minister for Finance he has to convert.  He, presumably, has a say in the determination of what amount of money the national Exchequer, and through it, the taxpayer, should be asked to share or not share&mdash;the burden that he ought to be asked to carry on foot of social services.</P>
    <P>At column 537 of the Dáil Debates on the 28th March, 1947, the present Minister for Finance informed the House that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We should not pretend that any great measure of social services is any credit to this community.  The greater the necessity for social services the greater the condemnation of the economic system under which we live.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is not an isolated statement by the Minister for Finance.  He reminded us that he had been preaching this doctrine for years.  At a later stage he told us that &ldquo;he saw in the development of the social services nothing but progress towards the servile State&rdquo;. &ldquo;The situation,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;which the then Government would like to see develop more and more would simply mean that the stimulus to work would be withdrawn.&rdquo;  More stimulus, in fact, instead of less, according to the Minister, should be applied to people to get more effort out of them.  &ldquo;The more a man does in the way of greater effort the greater the return he gets.&rdquo; In fact, he ended his remarks on that occasion by reminding the then Minister that there was no reason for this Department of Social Welfare and that the Minister.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;should contemplate with equanimity the disappearance of his own Department and look forward to the time when it will be wiped out from the Estimates and all these subventions will disappear... Depending on the State means that people are depending on the efforts of their neighbours.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1548" />&ldquo;No healthy community,&rdquo; he said later on, &ldquo;can be reared on charity. The boosting of social services means a marked degradation of the whole countryside.  It diminishes real wages. Control the family allowances and old age pension money and what you will give by way of an increase, control employment insurance and unemployment assistance, control all these subventions and you control the votes that we are instituting in this country&mdash;what was called in the old days institutions of slavery.  You must recreate the institution of slavery.  We do it with what we call social services&mdash;what are called our social services or what I call grants-in-aid to the annuitants of a servile State.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, the Minister has changed his attitude and the Tánaiste has been able to persuade him that he was entirely wrong in these sentiments.  If his accession to the important post of Minister has brought about a conversion to the principles which Deputy Cowan tells us all members of this House, except apparently Deputy de Valera, hold, then we might not wonder, but we have some recent instances of utterances somewhat of the same character.  May I remind Deputy Cowan, and those who would like to know what the attitude of the Opposition is on the question of the extension of social services, that we first want to know what the attitude of the Government is?  In his Budget speech last year the Minister for Finance said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The substantial wage and salary increases already secured by all classes of workers, with such further advantages as shorter hours, paid holidays, children's allowances, and other increases in social services, have gone as far as is possible, in present circumstances, to meet the claims of social justice, and I would make a most earnest appeal to all employees not to seek further increases in monetary remuneration or improvements in working conditions, unless warranted by exceptional circumstances. Recent experience confirms that the benefit of an increase in money incomes is rapidly swallowed up by rising prices.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1549" /> Speaking recently at a meeting of the Dublin Branch of the Institute of Cost and Work Accountants, I think on the 18th March, the Minister for Finance said, according to the <i>Irish Press</i> report, that&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;he wished that we got the opinion expressed at meetings where social services were claimed to be something good that they were not anything of the sort.  Social services were necessary for those who had been unable in early life to save for their upkeep later, but for the bulk of the community they were not anything to be clamoured for.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>According to the <i>Irish Times</i> report of the 19th March he pointed to a danger in the social services:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There was a danger in the development of social services that the people would lose their sense of independence.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;social services were not something to be proud of; they should be used like medicine, kept in a locker until they were required to treat disease or illness.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It looks very much as if the same brief was in evidence in the statement of the Minister for Finance on that occasion and of the Taoiseach when he spoke two years ago.  As regards those bottles, in one place we are told they are a sign of disease in the body politic, but in the other case there is a slight amendment&mdash;they should be used only in case of necessity.  One is tempted to wonder whether it might not be possible to get these genii and increase social services and bring about the comprehensive social security to which the Coalition Government solemnly pledged itself upon taking office; one wonders whether these two Ministers are not trying to get these genii into the bottle and to keep them here, as happened in the well-known story.</P>
    <P>I do not know how we can reconcile these statements, that the extension of social services is symptomatic of disease, beggary and even serfdom, when we have not such conditions in <Col N="1550" /> other countries, which are prosperous. Apparently, the Minister for Finance has a very poor opinion of the system of social security that operates in Great Britain and of the efforts of the Labour Government there.  He has quite a different opinion, apparently, from the Tánaiste, who told us that his intention was to try to bring forward a comprehensive scheme comparable to the British.  More recently he announced that the object of the social security scheme which the Government has under consideration will be to improve and expand existing services on a scale which will keep Ireland abreast of enlightened social legislation throughout the world.  The toiling masses, in the rousing words of the Tánaiste, must be provided with full security against all the hazards of life.</P>
    <P>It would be accusing the Tánaiste of gross hypocrisy and an entire lack of responsibility if we were to suggest that he has in any way departed from the principles he so frequently laid before us when he was Leader of the Labour Opposition in the Dáil.  I think his general attitude might be fairly expressed when he explained before he took office, when he was seeking the suffrages of the Irish people, that to himself and his colleagues social security implied freedom from want, and he went on to say that our resources were quite sufficient to render this possible.  In fact, like Deputy Cowan, he had a financial specific which would get over this difficulty which always arises when comprehensive schemes have to be put into operation&mdash;that is, where the money is to be found.  According to the Tánaiste, that would have been quite a simple matter as he then saw the position, because by an orientation of credit and the monetary system of the State we would be able to solve all these financial problems without, presumably, imposing burdens upon anybody.</P>
    <P>I have not heard whether that particular kind of solution is being tried out in connection with the new White Paper, or whether the Tánaiste has succeeded in converting the Taoiseach and Minister for Finance to his point of view, that <Col N="1551" /> social services are vital for the maintenance of the standard of life in this country, and particularly necessary where the standards of remuneration are inadequate.  That is from Volume 112, columns 1835 and 1836.  How can that be reconciled with the feeling of the Minister for Finance so often expressed here, that social security simply means absolute, subservience to the State and a return to plantation conditions, as they were known in the Southern American States, or in some similar place?  Now the Tánaiste tells us we are to keep abreast of enlightened social legislation and produce a comprehensive scheme comparable to the British.</P>
    <P>There is a certain discrepancy between the statements of the Tánaiste and the statements of his colleagues. What the country would like to know is in which&mdash;the Taoiseach or the Minister for Finance on the one hand, or the Tánaiste on the other&mdash; is the doctrine of collective responsibility being personified, and which of them, at the time he is speaking, is giving voice to the opinions of the inter-Party or Coalition Government with regard to this comprehensive policy of social security.</P>
    <P>At any rate, we have reached the stage when the question has to be considered of financing the scheme.  I do not think we have heard anything about it, and we may assume it is being put aside, but, as is the case in most of these schemes, it is either the State or the local authority, either the taxes or the rates or, in the case of social insurance, there is the question of the contributors.  When national health insurance first made its appearance in Great Britain, the slogan was 9d. for 4d.  The people were to get 9d. worth of benefit for 4d. worth of contribution. I think it has worked out rather the other way round and, for a contribution of 9d., it has been more likely the case that the benefit represents only 4d.</P>
    <P>Recently, in the scheme which was introduced into Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the contributions have gone up enormously.  I think they are at least 7/- in some cases and if we <Col N="1552" /> are to believe the statements we hear from the North of Ireland, based on the experience of small employers and farmers who employ a few men, the amount of the additional contribution is enormous having regard to their way of living, the amount of their output and their circumstances as employers. Of course, the Tánaiste recently transferred almost £1,000,000 to the contributors by increasing the stamps that he had to pay when he claimed that in abolishing the cash settlement and putting the benefits on a statutory basis he was really conferring an advantage on the contributors.</P>
    <P>I hope the contributors saw that point of view, but I think they must have realised that, from the point of view of £ s. d., they were getting nothing whatever by way of additional return simultaneous with having to pay additional contributions up to as high as 50 per cent., contributions which had previously been borne by the taxpayer.  The Minister told us, of course, that the benefits under State schemes were really only fit for paupers.  Because they were so inadequate he could only describe them as pauperised rates.  The fact is that in this country we have about half our population, the rural population, living on the land.  A large number of these are self-employed.  It is recognised in the case of agricultural labourers that because of the conditions in the particular industry they cannot be brought within the scope of certain forms of social insurance policy, though they may be brought in under others. Generally speaking, it has to be admitted that the benefits, like the rates of contribution, are as a rule based upon a flat rate all through.  No exceptions are made for the special circumstances of the individual.  Very often no special allowance is made for dependents or to meet family circumstances. In order to bring about such variations as would make rates of benefit more equitable the administrative machine would have to become much more costly.  I do not know whether the Minister is prepared to give us any information on these matters.  When the time comes I think, we ought to be told what the costs of <Col N="1553" /> administration will be in respect of the different services for which he is at present responsible.  As far as I remember, it was computed some years ago that the cost of administering children's allowances was about 4 per cent.  National health insurance was very much higher.  I think it was in the neighbourhood of 18 or 20 per cent. I believe unemployment assistance was higher still.</P>
    <P>If we are to come to conclusions as to the merits of the scheme when it is eventually put before us it will be necessary for us to know what the administrative costs are in detail, and whether, with further centralisation of the services, it can be argued from past experience that they are likely to result in such a reduction as would mean automatically increased benefits and increased moneys in the national pool of that particular service.  I notice that in the City of Dublin the city council has been occupying itself with drawing up a scheme of differential rents.  It is apparently recognised that some people have good employment and can afford to pay more substantial rents than they are paying at the present time.  Others are not in the happy position and, presumably, reductions will be made in their case.  I must confess that I do not know whether the problem is being tackled on the basis of taking the present rents as a minimum and adding on to these where the income of the tenant shows that that can be done or whether, as is more likely, there will be variations both upwards and downwards.  It is quite evident, as experience has shown in all countries wherever investigations have been made into social insurance generally, that the poorer the occupation the lower the wages and, very often, the larger the families.  Recently a nutrition survey was carried out in the City of Dublin.  Although the nutrient intake reached the standard of nutrition internationally accepted, broadly speaking, even in the case of the poorest families from the slums, it was agreed that the larger the family, both in the slum and artisan classes, the higher the expenditure upon food where the family did not exceed two <Col N="1554" /> in the slum classes and five in the artisan class.  After that point it was agreed that the amount expended on the individual members of the family in relation to food decreased.</P>

      <P>In reply to Deputy Hickey, I am not one of those who-believe that through some revolutionary change in the monetary credit of the country one can have all these blessings to-morrow morning.  My attitude is&mdash; and I recommend Deputy Hickey to look at his colleagues on the other side of the water&mdash;to proceed by experience and in the light of knowledge acquired. If one tries to pile on things too suddenly the machinery will begin to creak.  I am afraid it is creaking rather ominously at the present time not so very far away from us.  I only hope that the machine will not come toppling down because that would affect us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister proclaimed himself as wedded to the insurance principle.  In dealing with the question of old age pensions, which cost the country £7,000,000 at the present time, he indicated that they would be substantially increased on an insurance basis above the &ldquo;then level&rdquo;.  I take it that that is above the level at which old age pensions are at the moment.  It seems to me that it is legitimate to point out as has been frequently pointed out in this House but may have escaped attention, that we have, like most western European countries, an ageing population.  We have a very large proportion of old people; we have also as the Minister knows, a very large proportion of widows.  I do not know whether or not he is satisfied that we have enough children.  I do not suggest that children's allowances, even if they were made more attractive than they are, would result in any great increase in population.  I think the statisticians are generally agreed that our population will remain static for a considerable time to come unless some extraordinary change takes place in the outlook of the people generally.  The tendency over a considerable period of <Col N="1555" /> time has been in one direction.  Unless something unusual occurs we must take it that the population will remain more or less as it is at present for some further period of time.</P>
    <P>Last year the Minister threw cold water on the children's allowances scheme and he suggested that the money could have been better spent. As far as I could follow him, he suggested it could have been used in increasing wages and in augmenting the incomes of the fathers of large families, and so on.  I think that point no longer holds water because the Minister for Finance seems to think, having regard to the present rate of wages and remuneration levels generally, that there is scarcely any need for social insurance.  At column 1046 of Volume 115, No. 7, the Minister for Finance, in reference to Deputy McGrath, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;He, with others of the Fianna Fáil ranks, was concerned about a measure for social security.  When that measure is brought before the House it will be a matter demanding very serious consideration.  I wonder whether in the end the exaction of very heavy contributions from the community for social services will be an advantage to them.  I think they will probably find in the end that they are not getting as much in services.  I believe that, before introducing a big scheme of social insurance, the wage and salary position should be attended to and that the people should be left to their own devices to provide as a free people the services which free people provide for themselves.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not know what precisely the Minister for Finance means by saying that the wage and salary position should be attended to.  If he means that the wage and salary position should be further improved, it seems to be very much in contradiction to his statement in the Budget of this year and last year with regard to wage levels.  If he means that people should, from the wages and salaries they are at present receiving, make their own arrangements to look after the hazards <Col N="1556" /> which the Minister thinks should be cared for under a scheme of national social insurance, then he has not been very explieit about it.  Perhaps the Minister for Finance believes that not alone have the claims of social justice been met with regard to the levels of remuneration, but that those in receipt of wages or salaries should be able to take out insurance for themselves against the risks of life in the ordinary way.</P>
    <P>In reply to Deputy McCann, as reported in column 319, Volume 115, the Minister, having referred to his intention to bring this scheme before the House in the form of a White Paper some day, went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;When these proposals have been implemented, the question of increasing the allowances under the Children's Allowances Acts will be considered.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Nothing has been done about children's allowances.  Whether it is that the Minister feels that the money should never have been spent in that way, that it might have been spent more profitably and with more social benefit in another way, or whether it is an indication that the new social security plan as envisaged in the White Paper is going to exclude children's allowances altogether, I am not quite clear.  On the 1st June the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have now completed the examination of proposals for a comprehensive social insurance scheme which will be the Government's next objective in the improvement and extension of our code of social legislation. When these proposals have been implemented&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Does the Minister mean that they have been examined or does he mean when the proposals in the White Paper have been carried into effect?</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;&ldquo;when these proposals have been implemented the question of increasing the allowances under the Children's Allowances Acts will be considered.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We have the important question here&mdash;and I do not know again whether the Minister is prepared to give us any information in advance in regard to it <Col N="1557" />&mdash;as to the extent services for which the Minister for Health has some responsibility at the present time, like maternity, for example, ante-natal care, infant welfare and the provision of milk, are covered by the White Paper.  Are the extensions that are being envisaged in regard to maternity and medical benefits generally being included in the White Paper, or are we to take it that the Department of Health, whose Estimates we shall have for consideration after this one, is going to proceed with its own proposals? The importance of this matter arises from the question of the extension of additional benefits to rural areas.  It may be that the Minister, if he decides to give increased medical benefits, under national health insurance, for example, will be able to raise the additional cost through contributions, but there is that large section of the community, represented roughly by the rural population, which are not fully insured and which it is very doubtful, for technical and other reasons, could be brought fully into any scheme of national and social insurance if it is to be operated on the lines to which we have been accustomed. I should like if the Minister could give us any indication whether it is intended that the scheme will confine itself to the classes that are already insured or whether it is proposed to extend the schemes to bring other classes as far as possible into them, for example, the classes who work for themselves, and in particular the agricultural community.</P>
    <P>I think, as I have said, that the Tánaiste's reply gives the impression that children's allowances will not be considered until after this whole matter has been implemented and brought into effect.  I think that, having regard to the high level of expenditure on benefits, it would really be an extraordinary thing if we were to pass over those who have family responsibility.</P>

      <P>I think, perhaps, a Chinn Chomhairle, like my somewhat disorderly predecessors in the debate, who have been allowed to make their points, I might also be allowed to make my point.  I am sorry to be ruled out in that way, as I think this is a matter on which it is well to have opinions. I do not think the House or the country generally is likely to accept the point of view put by Deputy Cowan. I believe that the Government, of which I was a member, would have produced a White Paper, that they would have tried to give extended benefits, that they would, as far as possible, have made the scheme contributory but, not having been in the position of having the White Paper before us and of taking decisions on it, I cannot say how far they would have gone.  It is well known, as Deputy Dr. Ryan said, that two-ninths at least of the cost of some of these schemes comes from the State.  Whether the figure is two-ninths or a greater or lesser figure, it is obvious that the State comes in and will be asked to pay a certain proportion.</P>

The all-important thing upon which I think the House and the country would like to get information is whether the Minister has really succeeded in converting his colleagues to his point of view in regard to the necessity for comprehensive social security, or whether the statements that they have made are simply manæuvring or tactical, or whether they believe that there is danger in the State's extending the scope of these activities even where the basis is largely of an insurance character.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to Deputy Larkin, there is dissatisfaction with the Minister for Finance's point of view.  Deputy Larkin has taken it on himself to jump <Col N="1559" /> on this vehicle of social security at one stage and try to urge it further in its own direction at the speed which he would like.  Time will tell whether the Tánaiste will be able to supply the axle grease necessary to get this rather creaking vehicle into a proper rate of speed; whether the main spring that will be necessary to set it going in full motion will be there, and whether it will be unanimously supplied by the whole collective responsibility of the present Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is ridiculous to hear some Deputies boasting of what their Party has done in the way of social services.  We should all feel a sense of shame at how the unemployed, the widows and orphans, the old age pensioners and those who are ill and their dependents are being treated even at present.  I have listened to some speeches in this debate and nobody seems to have troubled about the basis on which payments under the social services are determined or whether the resources of the community are sufficient to provide for greater payments. One sure fact is that they were not based on human needs.  The trouble about the treatment of the unemployed is precisely that they lose their place in the family of the nation.  We have been doing everything we could by regulations, means tests, and rotational work to make them feel their situation as bitterly as possible, to give them to understand that there was no way for them to live except by sponging on their fellow citizens in work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The men who are in receipt of large salaries and incomes are given exemption from income-tax of £60 per year for each dependent child for nine or more such children and £100 for a wife, while the unemployed worker receives only £6 10s. 0d. per year for each dependent child and £19 10s. 0d. for his wife, or a total of £26, making a difference of £134 per year.  His benefit under unemployment assistance for a wife and one dependent child is £23 a year, a difference of £136 12s. 0d. In other words, an unemployed man's wife and one dependent child receives 10/- per week, which is 8½d. per day each for the seven days of the week or <Col N="1560" /> less than 2½d. per meal for three meals per day.  In the case of unemployment assistance, they receive 9/- per week, which is only 7½d. per day.  Up to the time this Government came into office, the unemployed worker only received benefit for a maximum of five children and no allowance was given for the sixth, seventh or eighth or more children. The payment of 10/- per week for wife and dependent child is to feed and clothe them.  That is equal to 8½d. per day for the seven days of the week or 2½d. per meal for three meals per day.</P>
    <P>We have Deputies on both sides of the House boasting of what their Parties have done for the unemployed. It was even suggested that some Parties are responsible for creating the demonstrations by the unemployed. If the unemployed were imposing half the privations on the members of this, House that have been imposed on the unemployed, they would create a revolution in 24 hours.  Let us beware of treating the unemployed and their, dependents in the manner in which we have been treating them.  We pay one unemployed man 3/2 per day, or 22/6 a week, and another unemployed man 2/3½ per day, or 16/- per week to feed, clothe, pay rent and pay for fuel and light.  I should like to know from Deputy Derrig and his Party, who were so long in power, on what basis they arrived at the decision that one man should be treated differently from another because he was compelled to be unemployed.</P>

      <P>Our aim as a Government or as Parties should be to establish a minimum based on human needs and, in establishing that minimum, everybody should be entitled to it without any taint of dole or charity.  In other words, the question is whether I shall have £12 a week and another man 16/- per week&mdash;a man who has no control over the position in which he finds himself, his wife and children.  These unemployed men are as anxious to educate their children and to have a decent home as any <Col N="1561" /> Deputy, yet we had Deputy Derrig speaking for over an hour about the social security scheme and not a word about what had been done for years to these unfortunate people.  I know Deputy Derrig will say that he has as much sympathy for the unemployed and their dependents and for the widows and orphans and old age pensioners as I or anybody else has.  But we forget them.  When I say &ldquo;we&rdquo; I mean all those who have had the responsibility have forgotten them all this time.  We can make speeches here and yet we know that there are decent men in this country who are allowed 22/6 per week and 10/ for a wife and child.  That only means 2½d. per meal for the three meals per day.  Yet we talk about what we have done under the Constitution, where it is stated that especial care is to be given to the economic interests of the weakest sections of the community.  Can we say we have tried to do that?</P>
      <P>Deputy de Valera stated here last Friday that everybody will admit there is a danger that, if the community as a whole make it almost as valuable to the individual to be idle as to work, the natural incentive to work will disappear. Let me say that if we were to double the present payments to the unemployed there would be no danger that the incentive to work would disappear. What about the men who receive £10 and £12 per week in unearned income and the men who are paid substantial pensions?  Is the incentive to work destroyed in their case?  No.  The reason is because the unemployed have been patient and docile up to now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Colley stated that if the Government record in the matter of social services was as good as that of Fianna Fáil when they left office they would have done a grand job.  I fail to see how the 55 Fianna Fáil Deputies who voted against any modification of the means test in October, 1947, can claim that they have done justice to these necessitous sections of the community.  That would only amount to £500,000 and £2,500,000 extra has been spent on social services during the past six months.  I want to say to the Minister that we are very far <Col N="1562" /> from doing justice to the unemployed and to the weaker sections of the community when it costs 27/3 a week to feed one person in prison and the man who never gets into trouble and who may have given up to 50 years of useful service to the community receives only 17/6 a week at the age of 70 years.  Yet we have all this boasting of what has been done in the way of social services. I feel that I am speaking to a Minister who has sympathy for these weaker sections of the community.  It is easy to criticise the unemployed for refusing employment in certain places where they have been offered it.</P>
    <P>From my knowledge of the unemployed, I would not say that there is 1 per cent. of them who would not take work if they got it.  Where they have refused work I would like to see the case investigated further.  At the moment the Electricity Supply Board and the Department of Posts and Telegraphs are laying lines along the streets of Cork and out into the suburbs.  The man who is employed in the city area is getting £5 8s. 0d. a week.  The moment he reaches a certain point on the borough boundary he is offered £3 3s. 0d. a week.  Is it fair treatment that because he goes to a certain point he gets £2 5s. 0d. a week less?  I suggest to the Minister and to those in authority that that should be ended, particularly when we bear in mind that the borough boundary of Cork City is even less than the urban council area of Macroom.</P>

      <P>I am pointing out that it is very easy to blame the unemployed because they will not take up employment. While on the verge of starvation, they will not submit to terms of that kind if they are offered to them.</P>
      <P>I am inclined to think that some of the Deputies who spoke about the Court of Referees have very little knowledge of the Court of Referees. As one who sat on the Court of Referees, I think the administration there is as humane as possible.  I am speaking now of Cork, of course.  The chairman of the court there is a humane man who has a decent sense of human values.  As one who often sat on the court and who at times had to advocate the case of men who were thrown off unemployment insurance benefit as well as being thrown off the dole, I can say that these cases were dealt with humanely.  It is not there that the problem is.  We have such cases as a man being employed for three days in the week and who may not get three full days' wages.  He signs on at the labour exchange for three other days and gets no payment for these three days.  Is there any reason why we would not have the unemployed surging in revolt as a result of these conditions?  I am referring to dockers who have to stand every morning in expectation of work and who, if they get three and three-quarter days out of the six days will not get anything from the labour exchange for the three days they are idle.  The most vicious thing of all is that if a man is employed casually and goes along to the exchange, he has to sign six days for nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then we have all this sympathy and all this crying out about the unemployed as if it was only yesterday or in the past 18 months that all these things were in operation.  They have been in operation for years.  I am glad that the Minister has seen to it that unemployment assistance will now be <Col N="1564" /> given to the family of over five children, up to eight or nine children, whereas, so far, the man with eight or nine children received an allowance for only five children.  Everybody can draw his own conclusions as to the implications of that.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a statement in reply to Deputy Dunne that when a man's income is calculated for old age pension his earnings for the previous year are not calculated.  Is that right, Minister?</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is put this way, that when you come to ascertain what he is likely to have in the year following that in which he attains the age of 70, it is no harm to have a look at what he got the previous year and to see whether that source of income is still available.  If it is not available to him, it cannot be used against him in the subsequent year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that a man who works up to a month or so before he retires at the age of 70, when he makes application for old age pension, has his income for the previous 12 months counted against him and he will not get the old age pension.  I know cases where men have been offered 6/- and 7/6 pension.  Now, after six months, they are allowing these two people that I know of 10/- each.  That is because of what they earned in the previous 12 months.  I am inclined to believe that the local inspectors are responsible for that interpretation of the Act.  I will quote another case.</P>

      <P>I do not want to waste any more time.  There is a serious problem in regard to unemployment, especially with regard to the differentiation between a man who is unemployed and in receipt of unemployment insurance and the man who is unemployed and in receipt of unemployment assistance.  It is not fair that a penalty should be inflicted on a man through no fault of his own.  We go further. We inflict that penalty on the widow of the unemployed man who had not stamps to his credit at a certain time. We go still further and inflict that punishment on the orphans.  The child of the widow who is getting the contributory pension will receive 10/- a week orphan allowance.  The child of the widow whose husband was not in credit on his insurance stamps will get about 2/- a week less.  I could say quite a lot about that mentality and how it has been developed.  These are matters that the Minister should go into because, undoubtedly, they are very sore points.  In conclusion, Mr. Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 3, Section 2, to insert before sub-section (4) two new subsections as follows:</P>
      <P>( ) Before a local authority proceeds to execute works under the next preceding sub-section the Minister may direct such local authority to prepare and furnish to him a preliminary report on any matters which he considers should be examined before the execution of the proposed works is begun, including in particular, any of the following matters: (a) the feasibility of the work, (b) the probable cost of the work, (c) the manner in which the work can best be executed.</P>
      <P>( ) A local authority to whom a direction is given under the foregoing sub-section shall comply with the direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1567" /> As the Bill stands, it would appear that any local authority, without reference to any constituted authority in the State, can proceed at the public expense to improve the property of any private individual.  That seems to me a highly undesirable position to provide for in our legislation.  If Deputies will examine the Bill carefully they will see that, provided a local authority is willing to finance the proposed works out of its own resources and does not look for a grant from the central authority, it can do what I have said at the expense of the ratepayers. It can improve the private property of any individual, it can improve any land not owned by it, any permanent construction, not being a permanent construction which was constructed by it or which it is required by law to maintain but which it thinks has sustained, or is likely to sustain, damage from flooding, landslide, subsidence or other similar occurrence.  That is the provision in sub-section (3) of Section 2. If it decides that it is in the public interest, it can execute such works as it considers reasonable for the purpose of affording such relief or protection. If land has sustained damage from flooding, or is likely to sustain damage from flooding or from any of the other causes which are recited in this sub-section, naturally its value will be less and, in most cases, I should think, considerably less than it will be if the land or property&mdash;the land or the permanent construction which, I must remind the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Surely I cannot argue the merits of that without referring to the sub-section as it stands.  I am pointing out that, in the sub-section, any land or permanent construction which, by definition, includes &ldquo;any road, bridge, house, buildings, walls or embankments&rdquo; may be safeguarded against flooding or against landslide or subsidence or other similar occurrences &mdash;that even if the land is not owned by the local authority, or if the permanent construction, bridge, houses or embankments <Col N="1568" /> are not owned by the local authority, the work may be done at the public expense.  I think that lends itself to grave and serious abuse&mdash;that public money may be spent in order to advance the interests of private individuals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Why do we want this preliminary report?  Because under sub-section (3) of Section 2, the local authority has power to spend public moneys in the way I have indicated. We do not know whether it is well to spend them in that way or not. Nevertheless, there is power to spend them in that way.  The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the local authority must, before it proceeds to execute the works under the next preceding sub-section and if the Minister so directs it, prepare and furnish to him a report on any of the matters which he considers should be examined before the execution of the proposed works is begun, including, in particular, any of the following matters, the feasibility of the work&mdash;that is to say, whether the work can be done or not&mdash; the probable cost of the work, and the manner in which it can best be executed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1569" /> The Minister, as we know, is, by the statute law of this country, constituted the general supervisor of the local administration.  But just as the local authorities are bound by the doctrine of <i>ultra vires</i>, so too is the Minister. As sub-section (3) of this section stands, the local authority, as I stressed at the outset, could spend the money of the ratepayers in improving the private property of any individual. So long as they provide those moneys out of the rates and do not resort to the Minister for financial assistance in carrying them out, they can do it, and I contend that as this Bill stands the Minister cannot intervene.  He cannot even ask them to describe the nature of the works.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that if an abuse is brought to the attention of the Minister, or if a proposal to execute certain works which appear to be contrary to the public interest in so far as the ratepayers' money will be expended for the benefit of private individuals is brought to the notice of the Minister, he will have power without having resort to the cumbersome machinery of a local inquiry to direct the local authority concerned to do what is specified in this amendment; that is to say, that he may direct that local authority to prepare and furnish him with a preliminary report on any matters which he considers should be examined before the execution of the proposed works is begun.</P>
    <P>He may, for instance, ask them in what way does the local authority consider the public interest will be benefited by the execution of the works.  He may ask them whether the person whose property is going to be improved at the public expense is a member of the local authority.  He may ask them whether he is an officer of the local authority.  Anyone who is familiar with the past history of local government in this country can see how frequently, not only members of local authorities but officers, abused the position in which they were.  We know what was alleged about the old grand jury system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and if I or any Deputy were Minister and somebody sent a communication saying that under sub-section (3) of this Bill certain works benefiting private individuals, improving the property of private individuals, were being carried out at the public expense and that the expenditure upon these works was not justified in the public interest, I should be entitled&mdash; and that is all this amendment asks&mdash; to ask the local authority before it proceeds with these works to give me a full report on any aspect of the works <Col N="1571" /> which I might consider desirable.  As the law stands, the Minister has not power to do that.  He has not power to do it in the form in which this amendment, if accepted, would enable him to do it.  He could, of course, if he felt a local authority was guilty of malfeasance or misusing public moneys, have a sworn inquiry, but we all know that is a cumbersome and expensive procedure.  It is a procedure which involves not only the local authority, but also the persons whose <i>bona fides</i> as private citizens may be questioned, in expense.</P>
      <P>This is a simple way of giving the Minister power to investigate any complaint which might be made to him as to the misuse of the powers which are to be conferred on a local authority by Section 2 (3).  The matters are &ldquo;any matters&rdquo;.  I mentioned that it might be a question of whether the work is being done for a member of a local authority or for the benefit of an officer of that authority or whether the local authority has misconceived the issue of public interests.  Remember, they can do these works only where they are of opinion that the public interest is going to be served.  These matters are very relevant to Section 2 (3) and to this amendment which, if accepted, is to be inserted before sub-section (4) and which refers immediately and directly to sub-section (3).</P>
      <P>It does not refer to sub-section (2). The case is very different.  If the Minister asks why I did not make it apply to sub-section (2), my answer is that in the case of sub-section (2) the property to be improved is property belonging to the local authority; if they wish to spend public money on improving their own property or in safeguarding their own property I am prepared to leave that decision to their own discretion and to, their own judgment.  But when, as under sub-section (3), it becomes a case of spending public money to improve, protect or safeguard the property of private individuals quite a different issue is involved and that is why I have suggested this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart altogether from any other matters, what are the matters to which <Col N="1572" /> particular reference is made?  The reason why they are particularly referred to in the amendment is to make sure that no local authority will be in a position to say that, as it is spending its own money, it will not be the business of the Minister to require such local authority to render an account of such expenditure.  When I say it is spending its own money, that is really merely a figure of speech because no local authority spends its own money. It spends the money of the ratepayers and it is the ratepayers' money this amendment is designed to protect.</P>
    <P>In relation to that expenditure there are three very important aspects to be considered.  First of all, one must consider the feasibility of the works, that is to say, whether the works which it is proposed to carry out are, in fact, well conceived in order to secure the purpose which the local authority has in mind.  We agree that the local authority acts <i>bona fide.</i>  There is no question of malfeasance.  There is no question of improper influence.  There is no question of corruption being involved. Granted that everything is open and above-board and that the local authority has come to its decision in good faith, believing that it is in the public interest that these works should be carried out, that does not end the matter because the works which it is proposed to carry out may, in fact, not subserve the end for which they were designed.  They may be ill-designed. They may lack skill.  They may be imperfect. We, all of us, when we are dealing with an engineering problem relating to flooding or subsidence, know that there is ample room to make many mistakes.  I think, again, that, just as a local authority if it is going to carry out a road work, construct a bridge, or even drain a river, has at least to draw the attention of the Minister to what it proposes to do&mdash;it does not do it in every case but it does in some cases&mdash;it should be bound, before it proceeds to spend this money, to report to the Minister, if the Minister so directs it, as to the feasibility of the work proposed.  I think no exception can be taken to that.</P>
    <P>I should like to stress that it does not require the local authority to make <Col N="1573" /> such a report in every case.  Some people might hold that it would be desirable that the local authority should be bound in every case to make such a report.  But this amendment does not propose to do that.  It only requires the local authority to do it in such case as the Minister may direct it to do so. I do not want to labour this unduly but, as I have already said, the purpose of this amendment is to give the Minister a convenient, easy and inexpensive method of securing the information he may desire to have.</P>
    <P>The next point is that they should in particular be bound to report as to the probable cost of the work in order that the Minister may satisfy himself as to whether the benefit which it is hoped will accrue from the execution of the work will in fact be commensurate with the cost of the work.  Again, I do not think any serious objection in principle can be taken to an amendment designed to secure that.  The third point is the manner in which the work can best be executed.  We must remember in that connection that the Minister has at his disposal a very highly qualified and widely experienced engineering staff, a staff such as no local authority can hope to maintain for itself.  When I say that I am not casting any reflection upon the existing engineering officers of local authorities.  I have had experience of them.  I found them very highly qualified indeed.  But I do know that they have not the same sort of specialised experience of certain problems and particularly, if I may say so, of drainage problems as have members of the engineering section of the Department of Local Government. They could not in practice have it.  The engineers of local authorities are general practitioners.  As we all know, many problems may and do arise in which they have to consult specialists for their guidance and information. The Minister is in a much more fortunate position than they are because he has on his engineering staff specialists in every form of civil engineering work.  It would be of considerable advantage, therefore, to the local authority concerned if the Minister were able to require that local authority to submit to him a report as to the manner in which they believed <Col N="1574" /> the work could best be executed and allow him, in turn, to submit that report to his own engineering staff for their consideration and advice, which, in due course, he will no doubt convey to the local authority concerned.</P>
    <P>I have given at some length the reasons why I think an amendment in the terms in which it appears here in the Order Paper should be accepted. The first part of the amendment provides that &ldquo;before a local authority proceeds to execute works under the next preceding sub-section&rdquo;&mdash;which would be sub-section (3) of Section 2&mdash;&ldquo;the Minister may direct such local authority to prepare and furnish to him a preliminary report on any matters which he considers should be examined before the execution of the proposed works is begun including, in particular, any of the following matters: (a) feasibility of the work; (b) probable cost; (c) manner in which the work can best be executed.&rdquo;  Now, the next consequent sub-section to that is a simple one.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A local authority to whom a direction is given under the foregoing sub-section shall comply with the direction.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The reason why that stipulation forms part of the amendment is because, so far as I am aware, the Minister has no power under any statute other than the one we are now considering to direct a local authority to furnish him with a report such as that stipulated in the first part of the amendment.</P>
    <P>I have read the Bill as amended in Committee very carefully and I can see nothing in the Bill as it stands which would give the Minister power to require a local authority proposing to carry out works under sub-section (3) to furnish him with the report which I consider desirable.  As I have said, if the local authority is getting a grant from the Minister in order to enable it to carry out works, then the Minister naturally will be in a position, since he holds the purse-strings, to require them to make a report and will be able to satisfy himself that the work which it is proposed to execute should be carried out in the public interest.  There is, of course, nothing in the Bill which <Col N="1575" /> requires the Minister to provide moneys to carry out any of the works which may be executed under this Bill.  There is certainly nothing in the Bill which requires him to provide moneys to defray the cost of any particular works which may be executed under sub-section (3) of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the position to my mind is that if a local authority proposes to spend only the ratepayers' money, to improve as I have said the property of private individuals, it may do so as the Bill stands without the Minister being able to interfere, to remonstrate with it or to make representations to it as to the unwisdom, or the imprudence of carrying out the works even, if his own engineering inspectors, having become aware of the proposals, report to him that the works are ill-designed for the purpose, that they will not achieve the ends for which they are to be executed, that they will be unduly costly, and that even if the end can be secured, the nature of the works which it is proposed to carry out is not the type of works which would be best calculated to prevent the damage which is referred to in sub-section (3) of Section 2.  That is the reason I ask the Dáil to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>This Bill is designed to enable local authorities to carry out certain works which they have desired to carry out for a long number of years. When the Bill was introduced, it was intended that it would be a simple Bill and a workable Bill.  Such an amendment as this is merely an attempt to lay down an elaborate procedure and, to my mind further to prevent local authorities from carrying out works such as those to which I refer.  I do not think there is any necessity at all to legislate for such an elaborate procedure for administrative work.  The basis of Deputy MacEntee's argument seems to me to be that the members of local authorities and their officials have not a proper regard for the public interest.  Deputy MacEntee and the House ought to remember that the type of people who elect these representatives are, in the first place, the same type of people who elect Deputies to Dáil Eireann and, if you <Col N="1576" /> like, Ministers of State and, in the second place, that they are ratepayers. Deputy MacEntee expresses great concern about ratepayers and ratepayers' interests.  The view on this side of the House is that local authorities are well fitted to say what the public interest is.</P>
      <P>Despite what Deputy MacEntee may think about their behaviour in the past, I think the House and the country generally will agree that the members of local authorities on the whole have shown themselves to be admirable guardians of the public interest.  They have the public interest at heart every time they make a decision in their own local council chambers.  They decide when they embark on housing schemes how they should build houses.  They decide how roads are to be made without any reference to the Minister.  In the case of water supplies they decide whether water fountains should be erected in this, that or the other place.  It does not enter into their minds whether such fountains are benefiting a member of a local authority, an official of a local authority or their friends.  If the Opposition have not sufficient confidence in local authorities and their regard for public interest, at least we, on this side of the House, have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy MacEntee introduced here about two years ago a Sanitary Services Act.  There in one section we had powers which are somewhat analogous to the powers which we are giving local authorities under this Bill.  There was a section which gave absolute power to the local authorities to do certain things of a type somewhat similar to that provided for by the Bill now before the House.  Section 49 of the Sanitary Services Act of 1948 lays down that &ldquo;a sanitary authority may take such steps as are reasonably necessary to prevent injury being caused to public health or the amenities of any locality by reason of obstructions in any river or watercourse.&rdquo; There is no reference there to public interest or to compensation. The local authority may decide themselves to do anything that is reasonably necessary without any reference or any appeal whatsoever to the Minister for Local Government.  Deputy <Col N="1577" /> MacEntee did not think that any safeguard of this kind was required when he introduced the Sanitary Services Bill as it then was, or when it passed through its final stages in this House.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the procedure laid down in the amendment is similar to the procedure which was required before the Minister for Local Government could make a Bridge Order. Nobody would suggest that the erection of a bridge such as the Youghal bridge or the Wexford bridge is at all comparable to the work which it is intended to do under this Bill.  The type of information which this amendment requires is information which enables the Minister to hold an inquiry and subsequently to make a Bridge Order. It is altogether too elaborate for this Bill.</P>
    <P>As I stated in my opening remarks, we intend to try to make this a workable Bill.  In my opinion we have far too many Acts of Parliament under which local authorities are bound up with red tape.  They become so disgusted with this red tape and with all the procedure they have to go through, that sometimes they do not think it worth while to go ahead with even some small works which are desirable in their respective areas.  The procedure takes altogether too much time. As I have stated, the Road Acts do not lay down any such procedure.  Deputy MacEntee might argue equally forcibly that a local authority might construct a road to benefit a particular publican or a particular garage.  Local authorities have to do things from day to day and from week to week without having to refer them to the Minister.  As I stated at the outset, we at least have sufficient confidence in local authorities to believe that they will have proper regard for the public interest when they decide on a certain line of action under this Bill.</P>

      <P>I am sure that the Parliamentary Secretary is aware of the fact that at county council meetings on many occasions matters that may not be found on the agenda are brought forward at the end of a meeting.  A similar position may arise in this case. Works which might suit a certain section of councillors for a particular area might be brought forward at the tail-end <Col N="1578" /> of a meeting and carried, even though the majority of the council might not be in agreement.  There is a possibility of such a thing happening. I am replying to the statement of the Parliamentary Secretary that it is not very likely to happen.  If a number of councillors from a particular end of a county want to have something provided, such as a water supply, they usually wait until the end of the meeting before they make the proposition and, when it is made, it may go through.</P>

      <P>I do not see the Parliamentary Secretary's objection to this amendment.  He states that it is going to set up a lot of red tape in connection with this whole business of carrying out work by a local authority. Actually, it does not propose to give the Minister any extra power beyond what he has already under the Bill as drafted over such works as a local authority may propose to do on its own property.  The amendment only asks that the Minister should empower himself, where work is not done on local authority property but on the land or for the benefit of some private individual, to ask the local authority what it is all about.  It does not say that he shall in all cases ask them to give these particulars.  It does not say that in a certain class of cases he has to do it, but that, if his suspicions are aroused by a complaint arriving in the normal way, he should have power to ask the local authority why they propose to carry out this scheme, is it feasible, and what is the cost.  I think the amendment is a reasonable one and that the Parliamentary Secretary has been making a big &ldquo;to-do&rdquo; about it.</P>

      <P>Strange as it may seem, the Parliamentary Secretary must have a hatchery for red herrings, because in relation to this amendment, as in relation to certain other amendments proposed on the Committee Stage, he trotted out a section in the Sanitary Services Act.  Those who remember the debate in the Committee Stage on some amendments to the Bill will remember that the Parliamentary Secretary contented himself by merely citing the numbers of sections or subsections <Col N="1579" /> and carefully refrained from reading slowly and audibly so that people might apprehend what he was saying, the text of the section which he was proposing to cite as a precedent for what he was doing in this Bill.  He has played the same game to-night.  He has referred to the Sanitary Services Act and tried to make the procedure under that Act a justification for what he proposes to do in relation to Section 2 and, particularly, sub-section (3) of Section 2 of this Bill.  He said that the Sanitary Services Act gave the local authority power to do something.  To do what?  To carry out its proper functions as a public health authority, so that in any case where a public health authority felt that the public health was being endangered it might come in and remove an obstruction from a watercourse.  Under the law it is bound to do that where the public health is in danger&mdash;at least it was presumed that it was bound to do that.</P>
      <P>The public health code was, as we know, prior to the enactment of the Public Health Act and the temporary measure, the Sanitary Services Act, in a state of the utmost confusion.  This was, as I have said, a temporary expedient.  What did it propose to do? It gave the local authority power to remove an obstruction from a watercourse in any case where it felt that the public health was being affected by the existence of that obstruction.  It meant that they could go in and clear the watercourse of decaying matter, of dead dogs, and all the undesirable debris that you sometimes find in a watercourse.  That is very far removed from the power given to the local authority in sub-section (3) of Section 2 of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not a question of removing an obstruction from a watercourse, though indeed the removal of substances or other things causing obstructions may be carried out under paragraph (b) of sub-section (4) of the Bill.  But the Bill gives the local authority a great deal more power.  It gives the local authority, in sub-section (3), which is the sub-section referred to in the amendment, power to execute such works as they consider reasonable for <Col N="1580" /> the purpose of affording relief from flooding, landslide, subsidence or other similar occurrences on the property of private individuals.  That property not only means land but, as I have pointed out, includes roads, houses, buildings, walls and embankments.  As I have stated before, this property may be very valuable to an individual.  If it is of any value to him when it is likely to sustain damage from flooding, landslide, subsidence or other similar occurrences, how much more valuable will it be to him when it has been safeguarded from damage arising from any one of these causes?</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of difference between spending public money to protect public health and spending public money to improve the property of a private individual.  And whereas the local authority and the State would be fully justified in the public interest in spending money to protect the public health, certainly, it is conceivable that cases may arise where they would not be justified in spending public money to improve the property or protect the property of private individuals.  So, there is no use in the Parliamentary Secretary trying to mislead the House by citing any sections of the Sanitary Services Bill.</P>

      <P>Those are the tactics which he adopted in relation to some of the amendments which were put down on the Committee Stage.  On this Order Paper, not to be dealt with now but, I hope, to be dealt with before this stage of the Bill concludes, there are amendments put down to write into this Bill similar sections to those to which the Parliamentary Secretary referred in endeavouring to justify the present provisions of the Bill.  He raised the issue which these amendments will raise on the Committee Stage of the Bill and I hope that, since he did rely on the sections upon which they are modelled to justify the provisions of his Bill, he will accept these.  I will be quite content if he does, because then there will be written into this Bill the safeguards which were felt to be necessary by the last Government <Col N="1581" /> and which the then Opposition, no doubt, would have insisted on in relation to these other very important <Col N="1582" /> statutes to which the Parliamentary Secretary has referred.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 3, to delete Section 3, lines 23 to 33 and substitute the following section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Where the Minister is satisfied&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  that particular works should be executed pursuant to this Act by a local authority, and</P>
      <P>(b)  that the local authority are unable or unwilling to execute such works, and</P>
      <P>(c)  that the execution of such works is essential for the efficiency of other works which any other local authority or local authorities are able and willing to execute pursuant to this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>the Minister may, after consultation with the first-mentioned local authority, by order authorise the other local authority or one of the other local authorities (as may be appropriate) to execute the first-mentioned works on behalf of the first-mentioned <Col N="1584" /> local authority and thereupon the local authority so authorised may so execute those works.</P>
    <P>(2)  Where&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  a local authority are of opinion that particular works should be executed by them pursuant to this Act, but that it is more convenient that such works should be executed by another local authority, and</P>
    <P>(b)  the other local authority are able and willing to execute such works, the first-mentioned local authority and the other local authority may enter into an agreement for the execution of such works by the other local authority on behalf of the first-mentioned local authority and thereupon, but after notification of the agreement to the Minister, the other local authority may so execute such works.</P>
    <P>In this amendment I am proposing to delete Section 3.  Some members of the Opposition, I think, had the idea that there was some sinister motive behind the section.  To allay their fears in that respect this amendment is being proposed.  The first part of the new section lays down that, where a local authority is unable or unwilling to execute works which are necessary for the efficiency of works executed by another local authority, the Minister may, after consulting with the local authority which is unable or unwilling to execute the works, authorise the executing local authority to do certain works in the functional area of the local authority with which the Minister has consulted.  I want to stress that the amendment lays down that the Minister may authorise this particular local authority to carry out certain works in the functional area of another local authority.  Part II lays down that a local authority may execute works for, on behalf of, another local authority.  This may be done by agreement. In a case where an urban council or town commissioners are unable to do certain works due to the lack of staff, plant or machinery, a county council may, by agreement, do that <Col N="1585" /> particular work for them.  I trust the amendment will meet with the wishes of the Opposition.</P>

      <P>I think the Parliamentary Secretary is interpreting very rigorously the word &ldquo;authorise&rdquo; when he says there is no power to compel a local authority to carry out certain works.  The section, as the amendment proposes it should be, provides that where the Minister is satisfied that particular work should be executed pursuant to this Act by a local authority, and that the local authority is unable or unwilling to execute such works and&mdash; and this is the kernel of the whole thing&mdash;the execution of such works is essential for the efficiency of other works which any other local authority or local authorities are able and willing to execute pursuant to this Act, then the Minister may, after consultation with the first-mentioned local authority, by Order, authorise the other local authority, or one of the other local authorities, to execute the works on behalf of the first-mentioned local authority.  Thereupon&mdash;and this is, I think, the crux of the matter&mdash;the local authority so authorised may execute those works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very difficult, I will admit, for a layman to interpret that particular sample of the draftsman's art with any certitude but, so far as I can interpret it, it would seem to mean this, that the prime mover in the whole of this section is the Minister.  He is the nigger in the wood pile, and where the Minister is satisfied that particular work should be executed pursuant to this Act by the local authority that is set out in paragraph (a) of sub-section (1)&mdash;and I assume the local authority referred to in paragraph (a) must be the first-mentioned local authority, since there is no other local authority mentioned in this sub-section prior to paragraph (a)&mdash;and where he is satisfied&mdash;paragraph (b)&mdash;that this local <Col N="1586" /> authority is unable or unwilling to execute such works he will take a certain course.</P>
    <P>If you will turn to the Bill, as amended in Committee, and look up paragraph (b) you will see that paragraph (b) of the proposed new section is exactly the same as paragraph (b) of the old section and that raises the question again as to whether, when a local authority is unable or unwilling to carry out works which the Minister is satisfied ought to be carried out, the Minister is going to have power, directly or indirectly, to compel that local authority to carry out the works.</P>
    <P>Then we go on to see what is the additional matter which is introduced into the first part of the section.  The additional matter is introduced in the form of paragraph (c), which reads &ldquo;that the execution of such works is essential for the efficiency of other works which any other local authority&rdquo;&mdash;and that is naturally any local authority other than the first-mentioned local authority, the authority referred to in paragraph (a)&mdash;&ldquo;or local authorities are able and willing to execute pursuant to this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, listen to the three conditions that you have&mdash;(a) that the Minister is satisfied that particular works should be executed pursuant to this Act by a local authority; (b) that the local authority is unable or unwilling to execute such works and (c) that the execution of such works within the area of the first-mentioned local authority is essential for the efficiency of other works which any other local authority or local authorities are able and willing to execute pursuant to this Act.  I will concede at once that if the local authority referred to in paragraph (b) is unable but not unwilling to execute the works, a great part of the objection which I am going to state in due course would immediately vanish; but the objection if not removed is this local authority is able but is unwilling to execute the works. We better put that this way: that where the Minister is satisfied that works should be carried out, that the local authority within those area he thinks these works should be carried out is unwilling to execute them for reasons which, no doubt, seem good to <Col N="1587" /> it and seem to be in the interest of its own ratepayers, but that the execution of these works is essential for the efficiency of other works which any other local authority is able and willing to execute pursuant to this Act, then the Minister, after consultation with the first-mentioned authority&mdash;the local authority which is unwilling to carry out these works because it believes that the works proposed are not going to be in the interests of its own ratepayers, of the inhabitants of its own administrative area to whom it is responsible&mdash;may, by Order, authorise the other local authority, the local authority outside and removed from and perhaps remote from the administrative area of the local authority which the Minister describes as the first-mentioned one&mdash;the local authority reluctant and unwilling to carry out certain works&mdash;to execute the first-mentioned works on behalf of the first-mentioned local authority and thereupon the local authority so authorised may so execute those works.</P>
    <P>Will the House hard back to the Parliamentary Secretary's reply to Deputy Thomas Walsh?  Deputy Walsh asked whether there was any power to compel a local authority to execute certain works which it was unwilling to do.  The Parliamentary Secretary, relying upon a very narrow interpretation of the provisions of this section, said: &ldquo;No, there is no power to compel a local authority to do works which it does not want to do.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He refrained, however, from pointing out to Deputy Walsh that he could authorise another local authority to step inside the administrative area of the first-mentioned authority, according to the terms of the section, and could authorise them to do the works. One can, of course, say: &ldquo;I will not compel you to take the roof off your house if I want to evict you, but I will give somebody else who feels that you ought to be out of the house, or because the roof in some way offends the amenities or injuries his property, the right to go in and strip the roof off your house.  I am not compelling you to remove the roof.  I am merely giving somebody else authority to do that.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>This gives the Minister the right to authorise one local authority to carry out works within the administrative area of another local authority, which is unwilling to carry out these works because it believes, let us assume, that these works would be detrimental to its own interests.  We are, of course, living under a Government which has told us that it will restore the rights of local authorities.  It has told us that it will do away with the managerial system.  It has told us that it believes in local autonomy.  We are living under a Government which believes, as the Parliamentary Secretary told us when he was discussing amendment No. 1, that the people who constitute these local authorities are elected under exactly the same franchise as are the members of this House and who can never do wrong.  According to him, they are all wise and all prudent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is giving to the members of another local authority the right to go from the South Riding of Tipperary into the North Riding, from Limerick into Clare, in order to carry out within the administrative area of the North Riding or the Clare County Council works which the North Riding and the Clare County Council are unwilling to carry out.  The Minister is giving the Limerick County Council power to carry out works in Clare for the benefit of the Limerick ratepayers.  That is precisely what the Minister proposed to do in this amendment.  I have read the debates on this Bill and I do not think this was the issue raised in Section 3. The issue raised in Section 3 was a narrow issue.  It was that the Minister should nominate a person to execute the works and that thereupon that person may execute such works in accordance with the directions of the Minister. What has the Parliamentary Secretary said?  He has said that he was meeting the objections of the Opposition.  But here he is putting before the House a proposal that was not mentioned by the Opposition at all and he is trying, as he did in the debate on the last amendment, to cover up by making us responsible for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is a local authority in any event except a corporate body?  It is a corporation acting under its own seal. It acts as a unit.  It is a corporate person. All the Minister does here is to substitute the local authority for an individual and, instead of nominating a local authority to go in and execute the works, he is authorising it to go in and execute the work.  I grant you there is a certain condition imposed so far as the execution of the works must be essential for the efficiency of other works carried out in the area of another local authority.  But I cannot see any very great distinction between the position as it exists under Section 3 of the Bill as it now stands and under Section 3 of the Bill in so far as this amendment proposes to alter it.  If I <Col N="1590" /> may say so, it seems to me to introduce a principle which is highly objectionable. The position was all very well under Section 3 as it originally stood. I will admit that the Minister, or any person, anxious to carry out work under this Bill could say: &ldquo;There is work which should be done; the local authority will not do it even though I will provide the full cost; I must, therefore, have the right to nominate a person to execute the work.&rdquo; Consider what is proposed here! Here we are throwing aside the whole foundation of local government.  We are throwing that overboard and we are making it a condition that it is only when the benefit will inure, not to the local authority within whose area the works will be carried out but to some other local authority, that the Minister then authorises such latter authority to carry out those works.</P>
    <P>There are a number of questions involved here.  They will readily occur to other Deputies and I shall not refer to them at any great length.  I shall mention them.  First of all, if this amendment is carried and if damage is done by reason of the execution of these works within the administrative area of a local authority which is unwilling to execute them, who then will be liable for compensation? I do not see where that is dealt with in the proposed amendment.</P>

As I was saying, undoubtedly questions of compensation will arise and it should have been mentioned by the Parliamentary Secretary that this question would arise.  We should then have been in a position to ask him is he asking the House to accept the principle that a local authority in Limerick may go in and damage the property of an inhabitant of the administrative County of Clare and did he think that was the sort of principle that should be accepted here in this House without question as something that could be smoothed over.</P>

      <P>Is there any reasonable fear it will happen?  About that I do not know.  I am not a prophet but I do know that the people who drafted this Bill had some reason to believe that, in consequence of works to be carried out by local authorities under this Bill, damage would be done to private property.  Otherwise why all these provisions providing that compensation would be paid in the event of damage being done?  This amendment No. 11 is a clear admission that damage may be done.  Now, it does not matter whether damage will be done or not.  That is not the point.  The issue that is involved is that, having regard to the jealousy with which local authorities maintain their rights and jurisdiction over their own administrative areas, having regard to everything we have heard about the sacrosanctity of local administration in this country, is it right that we should accept as a valid principle that a local authority&mdash; I said in Limerick and Clare, but let me say a local authority in Cavan should carry out works which would damage the property of inhabitants of Laoighis or Offaly or Monaghan?  It can be done.</P>

      <P>No, Sir, I just asked a question and my purpose in asking the question is related to the remarks which I am about to make now.  There seems to be a doubt in the mind of Deputy Timoney that any damage can be done under this section.  I can tell Deputy Timoney that, as far as two local authorities are concerned, damage can be done by one to the other.  I take the case of Kilkenny.  We have in Kilkenny the county council on the one hand and the Kilkenny Corporation on the other.  If Kilkenny County Council execute certain works north of the city on the River Dinan or other rivers, they are bound to do damage to the city.  There is a small river there called the Breaga and if the corporation refuse to clean it up, in order to get the water away, then the county council is authorised to go in and clean it up.  The cleaning of that river means that you are going to throw 16 or 17 feet of water into the City of Kilkenny as was done in 1947.  That was my reason for asking would the Minister compel a council to carry out certain works.  In connection with that river, it means that the City of Kilkenny will be flooded again if anything is done with that river.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>One of our main difficulties in discussing this Bill since it was introduced is due to the fact that we have not got any clear statement from its sponsors as to the actual work they propose to do under sub-section (3) of Section 2.  At one time we get the explanation that very little work of the nature envisaged will be undertaken by local bodies.  On other occasions we are led to believe that a lot of useful work, in so far as drainage is concerned, will be undertaken.  When Deputy Timoney and some others endeavour to make play with the amendment that we are now discussing, which is being moved by the Parliamentary Secretary, I do not know how they derive any source of enjoyment from <Col N="1594" /> the one paragraph in this amendment&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJosephTimoney" hpid="Mr. Timoney Mr. Timoney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timoney</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very far from being amused but I was pleased with the delightful manner in which the arguments were presented by Deputy MacEntee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJosephTimoney" hpid="Mr. Timoney Mr. Timoney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timoney</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I was enjoying. I can assure the Deputy, however, that I am very far from enjoying the implications of paragraph (c) if my understanding of what is meant by that paragraph is accurate.  In the whole discussion of this Bill since it came before the House I can see a state of confusion from the point of view of those who have introduced it and who will be responsible for implementing it as to what exactly they are endeavouring to achieve, what is the machinery they are actually putting into the hands of local authorities and the extent to which that machinery may be used.  The case which I am going to put is even worse than the one cited by Deputy Walsh, because the case he cited was the case of two local authorities in one county.  I can visualise a case where ratepayers in County Monaghan might petition the county council and be able to satisfy that body and the engineering advisers of that body as to the desirability of carrying out certain works under this Bill.  These works when carried out might result in an easier passage of water from that county into the neighbouring County of Cavan.  Suppose the engineering advisers of the Monaghan County Council were to say: &ldquo;This work is desirable and useful, but it cannot be made effective unless and until the Cavan County Council continue it from the point to which the work is carried out in County Monaghan to whatever point they think is necessary in order to make our work in Monaghan effective.&rdquo;  Supposing that proposal is put to the Cavan County Council and they say: &ldquo;That may be all right and may help to make the work carried out in Monaghan very efficient, but it will not confer upon us any tangible benefit.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1595" /> You may say: &ldquo;After all, if it will make the scheme in Monaghan effective, is not the State paying for it and why should the county council object as it will cost them nothing?&rdquo; The members of the Cavan County Council may say: &ldquo;Yes, it may facilitate work which is proposed in Monaghan but no land here will benefit to any extent which would induce us to proceed with the work even if it costs us nothing, because we will be liable for damages if they occur.  No one will give us any assurance that we will not have to pay for damages if they occur.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment is necessitated by the fact that there was not at any time since these proposals were conceived any proper thought or consideration given to the matters to which they refer and what these matters require.  This amendment is just brought in hastily because, in the discussion on the Second Reading and on the Committee Stage objection was raised to the fact that the Minister could nominate a person to carry out work.  Of course an effort was made to get over that by substituting &ldquo;local authority&rdquo; for &ldquo;person.&rdquo;  In doing so, the draughtsman said: &ldquo;Here is an awkward sort of situation that will arise.  A local authority may put forward a work which cannot be made effective unless and until somebody else downstream is compelled to continue the work.&rdquo;  In other words, is it not plain that you are proposing to force local authorities to begin at the wrong end?</P>
    <P>What will be the result in the case I have cited?  In that case, the water which will flow from the counties I have mentioned will ultimately, in the main, reach a Border county.  If, for example, you were to have a scheme proposed in Monaghan which could only be made effective by carrying out work in Cavan; if the Cavan County Council refuses because it did not see that benefit would result and the Minister regards the attitude of the Cavan County Council as unreasonable and authorises the Monaghan County Council to carry out work in an area which comes under the jurisdiction of the Cavan County Council and of the Cavan Urban Council and on to Belturbet, <Col N="1596" /> you will find yourself confronted with the County Fermanagh over which you have no jurisdiction. You will find that you are forcing water from Monaghan through Cavan until you reach Belturbet.  Then you cannot go on any further and the water will start to come back.</P>
    <P>Of course this may be just a bit of window-dressing.  As members of the Opposition, however, all we can do is to take this Bill as we see it and to regard its provisions as seriously meant and intended to be operated.  From listening to the discussion on the Second Reading and in Committee and on this amendment which has been introduced and which covers a different kind of field from that to which objection was taken during the previous discussion, I see clear evidence that there was no real attempt made to understand this whole problem.</P>
    <P>If we are to proceed along the lines envisaged in the amendment and in fact in this Bill, we are going to start on drainage where it appears to be harmless and where it will operate to give some relief without doing too much damage.  We are going to give one local authority power to go in on the territory of another local authority at the request of the Minister and carry out further work.  That local authority will find itself in an awkward position unless it gets power to go in on the territory of other local authorities and you will be proceeding from the wrong end.  That is, of course, if the proposal here is seriously intended and if work will be undertaken to any considerable extent under it.</P>
    <P>I think this amendment is a very serious affair.  If paragraph (c) means, as I suspect it does, that the Minister can authorise one county council which proposes certain work in its area to go into the area of another county council in order to carry out work so that its scheme will be effective, then I say that is a very dangerous proposal. When it comes to be operated, if it ever comes to be operated, and the minds of technical people are brought to bear upon it, unless it is examined more closely than it has been, you will find that very little work will be done under it.</P>

      <P>One thing abundantly clear from the statements of Deputy MacEntee and Deputy Smith is that any attempt made by the Parliamentary Secretary to placate them in their opposition to this measure will not be a success.  They profess to be interested in the measure but it is clear to anybody looking at it impartially that their one interest is to prevent the measure coming into operation.  The Bill is a simple measure.  Forty-five amendments were submitted.  Deputy MacEntee spent weeks adapting provisions in other Acts of Parliament and trying to fit them in and trying to block this measure in every way he could.  When the Government attempts to meet any opposition that may have been reasoned to enable the measure to be put into operation and to carry out the simple beneficial work that it is designed to do, each amendment, each suggestion and every section is pictured here as being the work of vandals coming in to destroy their own and other people's territory.  In regard to this amendment, anybody with common-sense can see that nothing further in the way of words could be put forward to satisfy any reasonable demand. There is no reason on the other side. Where a local authority wants to have work done and a second local authority impinges upon it and portion of the work will be done in the territory of the second local authority to enable the work to be effective in the lands of the first local authority, if the first local authority does not feel like doing the work, they will be consulted and asked to agree to have it done by the second local authority and should any damage arise from it, the compensation will be paid by the party performing the work.  That is the sum total.</P>

      <P>Nobody is going to do damage in Counties Monaghan or Cavan.  If they do work in Cavan to take waters from Monaghan and if there should be any incidental damage done, it will be paid for.  The work is unquestionably of a beneficial character being attempted by the local <Col N="1598" /> authority either in Cavan or Monaghan. Are we asked to believe that people are so unreasonable in Cavan, Monaghan, Limerick or Clare that they will refuse to co-operate to have this beneficial work done?  I suggest that everything that could be done reasonably and, in fact, unnecessarily, has been put into this amendment.  If that does not meet with the satisfaction of people over there, there is no use in talking any further here.  That amendment ought to be accepted by the House.</P>

      <P>Deputy Smith obviously had not read sub-section (1) of the proposed new section at all because he was in a bad way about the liability which would be undertaken by the local authority in whose functional area the work was carried out by the neighbouring local authority by reason of the fact that the local authority in whose functional area the work was carried out would have to pay compensation for the damage done.  Sub-section (1) of the proposed new section&mdash;amendment No. 11&mdash;covers that point specifically and puts upon the local authority which does the work the liability for payment of the damages.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timoney</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the Deputy will see there that the person who suffers damage by interference shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, be entitled to be paid compensation by the local authority who executed the works.  That could not be clearer.  It then goes on to say : &ldquo;or, if that local authority executed the works on behalf of another local authority pursuant to an agreement made under this Act, by such other local authority.&rdquo;  The net position is that there would be no local authority saddled with liability of any kind except it agrees to be saddled with that liability beforehand.  I think that is the net position.  I personally cannot see how any more reasonable or sensible provision could be put into an Act of the Oireachtas.  The work, as the Minister <Col N="1600" /> has just said and as every reasonable person could contemplate, is work of a beneficial kind, work which will cost the local authorities nothing which will be of an unexpected nature, nothing that they will not foresee, and the objections of Deputy MacEntee which, looking at it from over here, were made, I think jocosely and without any seriousness at all, are absolutely groundless.  Deputy Smith was obviously under the disadvantage that he had not read amendment No. 11. If he had, he would not have made the speech he made.  But, more important than all these points is that amendment No. 5 envisages a degree of reasonableness and a spirit of co-operation on the part of local authorities which we are entitled to expect in this country.  Deputy MacEntee mentioned the horror which would be entertained in the North Riding of County Tipperary if the county council of the South Riding dared to put its nose, so to speak, over the border to do something which would be of benefit.  I do not know very much about the people of Cavan but certainly the people in Tipperary are a very reasonable sort of people and I am quite satisfied that there would not be that horror in North Tipperary if the people of South Tipperary wanted a bit of help from them and even at a cost to North Tipperary.  But, here is a case in which it would cost the people of North Tipperary nothing to have something done which would benefit both counties and benefit the county at large.</P>
      <P>I would like to compliment first the Parliamentary Secretary for the idea behind amendment No. 5 and the Parliamentary draughtsman for the clarity with which that idea is expressed. Notwithstanding the confusion which Deputy MacEntee tried to make out of the matter, the sub-section is clear and reasonable and ought to be accepted by anybody who would study it, give it consideration and understand it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>While I do not agree with the arguments put forward by Deputy Smith, I admit that, compared with the speech of Deputy MacEntee, his speech was about the section and <Col N="1601" /> the amendment.  Deputy Smith certainly attempted to deal with both. Deputy MacEntee did nothing except try to obstruct this measure all through.  One would have thought that he had got a sufficient lesson from his own followers after the speech that he made on the Second Reading of the Bill.  It was quite clear that his tone changed when he saw the unwelcome reception his speech had got.  This amendment is quite simple.  I do not accept the situation that Deputy Smith appears to envisage.  I am going to take him on his own ground, that you have a situation in which work is required to be done in the County Monaghan which the county council there, at the behest of the people, think necessitates other work in the County Cavan while the county council in Cavan do not appreciate the necessity for it.  Deputy Smith seems to take the view that the work in Monaghan is going to be done before anyone has considered that the work in Cavan is necessary in order to make the work in Monaghan effective.  It is clear from that amendment that the matter will be considered before any work is undertaken.</P>
      <P>Again, take the position which Deputy Smith visualises, that the Monaghan County Council will take one line and the Cavan County Council another.  In the example given by the Deputy, what more reasonable thing can one imagine in these circumstances than that there should be, so to speak, arbitration between the two county councils, and that the Minister should be the arbitrator?  That is exactly what the amendment provides, that where two county councils do not agree the Minister should be the arbitrator. One of the county councils must be the moving body, and the Minister must be satisfied that it is correct.  If the Minister is satisfied that the work in Cavan is necessary and decides against the Cavan County Council then the Monaghan County Council can come in and do the work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite clear from amendment No. 11 (1) that it is the Monaghan County Council that is going to pay any compensation that may arise.  Deputy Aiken appeared to be confused <Col N="1602" /> by the last words in sub-section (1) of amendment No. 11.  That is to cover cases where the Monaghan and Cavan County Councils decide that there is work to be done and that, for the sake of convenience, the Cavan County Council requests the Monaghan County Council to do it.  When work is done by one county council at the request of another county council, clearly it is the county council which makes the request that should pay any compensation that may arise out of the doing of the work.  It appears to me that, unless you had this new section it would be utterly impossible, in the situation which Deputy Smith envisages but which is not the situation that I envisage, for any inland county such as Cavan, Kildare or Monaghan to get any work done under this Bill.  Without this new section, a county council might decide that it was not worth while bothering about allowing water to run straight to the sea.  Deputy Smith's contention appeared to be that such a county council was not going to bother about its own county at all. This amendment enables that situation to be met.  It enables all the objections that were raised by the Opposition on the Committee Stage to be met in a reasonable way.  It is not in the least dictatorial.  It will enable the people in the various areas concerned to have their full say, and everybody must agree that, where there is contention or a difference between local authorities in administrative matters of this sort, the only person that should be allowed to arbitrate on that is the Minister. That is what the new section does.  I congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on having brought it forward.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the only objection which Deputy MacEntee had to this particular section is now met &mdash;the power, as he alleged, which the Minister had to nominate a person to execute certain works that a local authority was unwilling to do.  This amendment meets any fears which Deputy MacEntee or other members of the Opposition had in that respect. Perhaps I should apologise to the House and, if you like, to Deputy MacEntee for the fact that, in moving these several amendments, I merely explained amendment No. 5.  I do not say that I misled the House as far as compensation was concerned by not referring to it.  I admit that it took Deputy MacEntee five or six minutes before he could get round to that amendment and still talk on it.  I think this should meet the wishes of the Opposition.  It is designed merely to promote better co-operation between different local authorities, whether they be county council and county council or county council and urban council or corporation.</P>
      <P>There are three conditions here which must be fulfilled before the Minister may authorise a local authority to carry out certain works on behalf of another local authority: &ldquo;Where the Minister is satisfied that particular works should be executed pursuant to this Act by a local authority and the local authority is unable or unwilling to execute such works and that the execution of such works is essential for the efficiency of other works which any other local authority or local authorities are able and willing to execute pursuant to this Act&rdquo;&mdash;I stop there.  Deputies will appreciate that, say, for example, in the case of the Westmeath County Council, where there was flooding and where there was an obstruction in a watercourse or some other stoppage in the town of Athlone, it would be quite reasonable for the Minister to authorise the Westmeath County Council to carry out certain works in the town of Athlone to alleviate flooding in the functional area of the Westmeath County Council. That is one of the things which it is hoped to effect under this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1605" /> But there is another condition: &ldquo;The Minister may, after consultation with the first-mentioned local authority.&rdquo;  The Minister, with the benefit of his engineering advisers, consults in this case the Athlone Urban District Council and decides then whether or not he may authorise the Westmeath County Council to carry out particular works.  In case anybody has fears in that respect &ldquo;authorise&rdquo; in this particular case does not mean &ldquo;compel&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>So far as compensation is concerned, if damage may be done I think it is perfectly clear, under amendment No. 11, what particular local authority is liable for the compensation.  In the case of a local authority executing works in its own area for its own benefit, that local authority will pay compensation.  If the Minister authorises a particular local authority to carry out works in the area of another local authority, the executing local authority is liable for any compensation that may arise as a result of damage.  In the case of agreement where one particular county council, after consultation with another, agrees to do the work on their behalf, the compensation is paid for by the county council which benefits.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEntee talked about red herrings.  So far as I could judge in the half-hour speech he made on this very simple amendment, he got to a stage where he was arguing with himself. He tried to convince himself that there was something wrong with the amendment.  I do not think anybody else recognised that there was anything sinister or damaging or which could be used as a method of punishing a local authority.</P>

      <P>In page 3, to delete &ldquo;or person&rdquo; in line 34, in line 36, and in lines 40 and 41.</P>
      <P>This is merely a drafting amendment rendered necessary by reason of the deletion that was made and the insertion of the new sub-section (3).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I wanted on the previous <Col N="1606" /> section to state that the Minister, the Parliamentary Secretary and Deputy Sweetman, when denouncing Deputy MacEntee for, as they called it, obstructing this measure, had a right to be grateful to him and one of the reasons is this drafting amendment and the last amendment.  On the Second Reading Deputy MacEntee pointed out where the Government proposed to go when they were going to use the jackboot around the country. Whenever anybody came along and wanted a job of work done and the local authority was not prepared to do it, they wanted to nominate a particular person.</P>
      <P>This amendment is taking out that person and it would not be proposed if it were not for Deputy MacEntee's criticism.  He was the first to point out what the Minister was at.  The Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary have now had to admit it, and they also admitted it in the debate on the last section.  Up to this moment Deputy MacEntee has pointed out other weaknesses in this measure, even after his efforts and the efforts of other members of the Opposition to amend the Bill.  In these circumstances I hope we will not hear any more about any Deputy blocking the work or obstructing this measure.</P>
      <P>This measure was introduced in the Dáil on 23rd February.  It is now the 30th June and we are getting the Report Stage.  That is not our fault. It is altogether the fault of the Government. If they wanted to get this measure through they should have taken some pains to present it in a form which would commend itself to the people and we would not have had to spend so much time on the Committee and Fourth Stages.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timoney</NameTxt>
      <P>If I understood Deputy MacEntee properly, he made the point that legally there was no difference between the person who is being deleted now&mdash;and the deletion of whom Deputy Aiken considers to be a good thing&mdash;and the juristic person known as a local authority.  Deputy MacEntee made the point that in the legal sense there is no difference whatever between them, so I do not see <Col N="1607" /> much point in Deputy Aiken's remarks at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy has contributed to the discussion without clarifying it.  Of course there is a difference, a natural physical difference, as Deputy Timoney well knows, as between a juristic person and an individual.  The point was made that the Parliamentary Secretary was not meeting the full views of the Opposition which were these, that he should not have power to authorise any person, juristic or individual, to enter on land and to carry out works in the manner in which it was originally proposed he should have power to do under Section 4.  His authority is now confined to what Deputy Timoney has called and rightly called, I assume, a juristic person&mdash;that is to say, a local authority acting as a corporation.</P>
      <P>It is no longer within the right of the Minister to empower an individual, a person of his own unfettered selection, to go in and carry out works, say, under sub-section (3) of Section 2 of the Bill, if we accept his amendment, as it would have been within his competence to do if the amendment were not proposed.  Now the objection which I stated in regard to Section 4, as it originally stood, was a plain and simple one.  Under it, any Minister who was sufficiently corrupt&mdash;and I gather from the spokesmen for the Government that we have had a plethora of corrupt Ministers here over a considerable period of time&mdash;could decide that a local authority under sub-section (3) of Section 2 of this Bill should carry out works which would improve the value of a private individual's property; and, if this corrupt Minister came to that corrupt decision, he could under Section 4 of this Bill, as it stood prior to this amendment, nominate a creature of his and send him in&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>I was dealing with the position which we are anxious to remedy.  I do not suggest that the present Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary would do what this Bill would give them the right to do if it were not amended in the manner in which the Minister now proposes to amend it.  The Bill as introduced into this House would have enabled the Minister, if he so desired, to send in an individual to spend public money in order to appreciate the value of a private individual's property. I am grateful to the Minister for the fact that he has recognised that that was the position and that by this amendment he will at least ensure that <Col N="1609" /> if any person has the right to enter land or to carry out works thereon that person will be, as Deputy Timoney has described it, a juristice person and one who is a competent authority and not likely to secure a personal advantage by reason of the works so carried out. That is the only reason why I spoke as I did on the Second Reading of this Bill in order to make sure that this opportunity for abuse would be removed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 3, Section 4, to insert before sub-section (2) a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>( ) Save for the purpose of carrying out urgent works, no person shall enter on any land under this section between the hour of 6 p.m. on any day and the hour of 9 a.m. on the following day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of the discussion which has taken place on the several provisions of this Bill and on the amendments we sought to introduce in order to tighten up procedure under the Bill, the Parliamentary Secretary has referred on several occasions to measures for which his predecessors were responsible.  To-day, for instance, on another amendment he referred to the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act, 1948.  He referred to a specific section in it which lays it down that &ldquo;a sanitary authority may take such steps as are reasonably necessary to prevent injury being caused to public health or the amenities of any locality by reason of any obstruction in any river or watercourse.&rdquo;&ldquo;Take such steps as may be reasonably necessary&rdquo;&mdash;there is nothing in this section as it stands providing that entry on land shall be made at reasonable times.  In another section in another statute to which the Parliamentary Secretary referred when he was discussing this Bill on the 7th June justifying a particular amendment he said: &ldquo;This amendment is not a new one.  There is a similar provision in the Water Supplies Act, 1942.&rdquo;  As I pointed <Col N="1610" /> out in the course of the debate, the Parliamentary Secretary was not being candid with the Dáil on that occasion because he did not quote the relevant section of the Act in order that the House might recognise for itself the vital and essential difference between what was done in the Water Supplies Act of 1942 and what it was proposed to do under Section 4 of this Bill. However, since the Parliamentary Secretary thinks that the precedents we have set up should be honoured, I would like to remind him what the Water Supplies Act of 1942 does provide in regard to entry upon land.</P>
    <P>Section 17 of the Act of 1942 states that: &ldquo; Any person or agent of a sanitary authority who is duly authorised in that behalf by such sanitary authority&rdquo;&mdash;I do not think you will see anything here about being duly authorised in that behalf&mdash;&ldquo;may, subject to the provisions of this section, enter on land at all reasonable times&rdquo;&mdash; there is nothing here about &ldquo;reasonable,&rdquo; as I have said before&mdash;&ldquo;for either of the following purposes&rdquo;&mdash;and the purposes are strictly limited&mdash;&ldquo;that is to say, ascertaining whether an adequate supply of water can be conveniently taken from a particular source of water.&rdquo;  Now, entry upon land for that purpose is not likely to do any damage to it.  The position is very different, however, where instead of entering upon land for the purpose of ascertaining whether an adequate supply of water can be conveniently taken one enters upon land for the purpose of executing certain works.</P>
    <P>Then Section 17 goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;repairing or maintaining any pipes, conduits or other works which are used by such sanitary authority for the purposes of a supply of water.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These are the purposes for which under Section 17 of the Water Supplies Act, 1942, a person may enter on land. They are, in the main, harmless purposes. As I have said, no damage can be done by a person entering land mainly to satisfy himself that water is available.  I am certain no damage would be done to the land if a person entered it for the purpose of mending any pipes, conduits or other works which are used by the sanitary <Col N="1611" /> authority for the purpose of supplying water.  On the contrary, if the pipes were in need of repair, the owner of the land would probably be demanding that the sanitary authority should enter on the land in order to repair the pipes.</P>
    <P>Having shown that, in the main, the purposes for which the land might be entered on under Section 17 would not be harmful to the land in one case and would, perhaps, be positively beneficial to the land in the other, let me go on to point out how limited, how restricted and guarded was the power of entry given to a sanitary authority under this Act because sub-section (3) of the section provides that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Save for the purpose of carrying out urgent repairs, no person shall enter on any land under this section between the hours of 6 p.m. on any day and 9 a.m. on the following day.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That, Sir, is one of the things which we propose to do by this amendment, to limit the right of entry on land to reasonable hours&mdash;from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.  I think that should be accepted as a reasonable and proper limitation, that at least a person should not be permitted to enter land except during the hours of daylight, in order that the person who owns the land may satisfy himself that the person who has entered upon it, has entered upon it for lawful purposes.</P>
    <P>As the section stands at the moment, any person who holds himself out as being an officer, servant or agent of a local authority may enter on land.  He is not called upon to carry any proof of authorisation.  In other cases, where a person is permitted to enter premises he must at least produce his authority.</P>

He does not have to carry anything with him.  He may enter at any time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnJosephTimoney" hpid="Mr. Timoney Mr. Timoney">

      <P>Is the Deputy serious?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am serious.  I can see why it was considered necessary under the Water Supplies Act and other Acts to which I do not want to refer, to limit the right of entry or rather to prohibit the right of entry except within certain hours.  Why was it considered necessary to do that? Because people could enter on land holding themselves out, as they can here under this section, to be officers of the local authority and in the hours of darkness, outside the ordinary hours of daylight, and do considerable damage to the property of the landowner. Deputy Sweetman shakes his head.  Why is this proviso found not only in the Water Supplies Act but in other Acts&mdash;Electricity Supply Acts passed by our predecessors as well as by us?  Would the Deputy tell the House why it was necessary to insert this proviso, that entry should be made only within certain hours, in the statute law of this country?  That is the position we want to see, that a safeguard protecting the property owner, which was thought essential in relation to important work, works of first-class magnitude, about the importance of which there could be no difference of opinion, will be inserted here in this Bill which deals only with minor works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy MacEntee I am afraid does not understand country areas very well.  I would have thought that even if the Deputy did not appreciate what occurred in the country, there would have been some Deputies in his Party who would have explained the position to him.  This work, as I think even the Deputy appreciates, is going to be carried out by officers and servants of local authorities.  In the country the officers and servants of the local authority, who will be carrying out this work, will be road men and so <Col N="1613" /> forth under the control of the county engineer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the country, as I would have thought the Deputy would have found out, we get up before 9 o'clock, even though people in the City of Dublin may not get up at that hour.  The effect of this amendment would be, of course, that the local authority and the Exchequer would be paying men employed by the local authority who would be sitting twirling their thumbs on the side of the road for an hour every morning.  I do not know whether the Deputy wished that to be the case, but certainly that would be the effect of the amendment.  I want to put it to Deputy MacEntee also that the work that will be done under this Bill will be different from the kind of work that is visualised, for example, under the Water Supplies Act.  The purpose of this Bill is to clear up natural watercourses that have become clogged up.  The purpose of the Bill is to remove obstructions in natural watercourses, to clear them out of the way and to enable the water to flow in the manner that Nature intended it should flow, before the watercourse became clogged up and thus assist in the prevention of flooding in any part of the countryside.  All the work to which the Deputy referred under the Waterworks Act and under the Electricity Supply Board Act is an artificial type of work.  We all know that there is a very great difference between going in and doing new artificial work, such as laying watercourses or putting up electricity poles and the work of assisting Nature to clear up her own watercourses. There is not the same necessity in this as there is in these other cases for identification of the persons concerned.  In the country, as I thought the Deputy would have learned from his own colleagues, everybody knows in every area who is working for the local authority and who is not.  If Paddy Murphy goes into a field, we know quite conclusively that Paddy Murphy is a local road ganger and is doing drainage work under this Bill.  In the case of the Water Supplies Act, to which Deputy MacEntee referred, the work is never done by the local authority. It is always done by contractors, by strangers in the locality.  Similarly, <Col N="1614" /> in regard to Electricity Supply Board work, it is done by strangers whom people in the area do not know are working for the Electricity Supply Board.  Even if it is done by local people, the news does not travel in the same way as the news that people are working for a local authority.  It is an entirely different type of work and there is an entirely different class of people doing the work.  As Deputy Smith will explain to Deputy MacEntee, in the country we get up before 9 o'clock if we have to start work before that hour.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy MacEntee goes on the assumption that local authorities are not reasonable men and have not reasonable officials.  Listening to Deputy MacEntee, you would think the road workers romped around the countryside digging up roads and drains at 3 o'clock in the morning.  You would also imagine that it is necessary for the execution of works under this Bill to supply the council workers with identification cards or passports.  Apart from that, under this Bill the landowner will get 14 days' notice.  He will know that he may expect county council workers to enter on his land for the purpose of doing work which, in the majority of cases, will be a benefit to him.</P>
      <P>We ought to realise that there is some sense of co-operation between the farmers or landowners or rural dwellers and the local authority in the execution of works such as this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is expected that this Bill will be worked on the basis of co-operation.  It is a Bill which is intended to do good to such people as farmers and landowners. We do not need to lay down when the county council workers should work, or between what hours they should work.  In any case, I do not see the necessity for the provision that they should not enter between 9 p.m. and 6 a.m.  County council workers' hours are well defined in most counties and are generally from 8 a.m. to 5.30 p.m.  As Deputy Sweetman said, it is not intended that county council workers engaged in work for the relief of flooding should twiddle their thumbs between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m.  I do not think we should accept the amendment or assume that the people in rural <Col N="1615" /> Ireland will not co-operate in the execution of works under the Bill which will be subsantially for their own benefit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJosephTimoney" hpid="Mr. Timoney Mr. Timoney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timoney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like Deputy MacEntee to tell us what would be consequential on this.  Assuming that this sub-section is inserted in Section 4 and that a servant of a local authority enters upon land before 9 a.m. or after 6 p.m. what is to happen then?  Is not the sub-section as it stands incomplete? It merely prohibits the entry Would it not be necessary to have some consequential provision as to whether he was committing an offence by entering? Apart from that, there will arise cases in which the men working and the people having charge of the work may find it desirable to work overtime.  If this sub-section were accepted, it would prohibit the working of overtime.  In weather such as this, there are many working hours outside the period between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m.  The sub-section as it stands seems to me to be open to quite serious objection, to be totally unnecessary and to serve no useful purpose, and I would certainly oppose the acceptance of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary asked Deputy MacEntee whether he thinks county council workers romp around the roads at all hours of the night and morning.  Could not the Parliamentary Secretary adopt Deputy MacEntee's amendment by simply substituting for the hours of 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., the usual working hours of county council workers?  I am sure that would meet Deputy MacEntee's point of view.  The Parliamentary Secretary said that Deputy MacEntee wanted county council workers to go around with identification cards and that all the people whose land will be entered upon will get notice.  No thanks are due to the Parliamentary Secretary for that.  On the Second Reading, the Parliamentary Secretary and those supporting him stood strongly by the Bill as introduced, in which there was no provision for notice of any kind to be given to the owner of land, whether the county council worker or the surveyor came to him in the middle of the day or the middle of the night.  As the <Col N="1616" /> Bill was introduced, these workers could enter upon his land at any hour of the day or night without notice.  One of the reasons for Deputy MacEntee's speech on the Second Reading, about which so much complaint was made at the time, was that there was no provision for notice and that at any hour of the day or night land could be entered upon.  I do not think the Parliamentary Secretary should continue on that particular line.  He should agree with Deputy MacEntee, as so much play was made by members of the Government with the fact that &ldquo;pipsqueak&rdquo; inspectors were to be kept outside the farmer's gate.  But here he is objecting to a reasonable amendment that would keep them out during the small hours of the morning and at midnight and he refuses to accept it.  I would not mind a member of a Government who had less of that type of speech behind it than the present Administration has refusing to accept Deputy MacEntee's amendment by saying that it is not really necessary, but they accused Fianna Fáil, when in the Government, of providing thousands of inspectors and arming them with all sorts of powers to kick farmers around.  Deputy MacEntee has called attention to the fact that when we were supposed to be doing that we actually had in Bills introduced by us safeguards which went quite in the other-direction. The Parlimentary Secretary now says that we are giving the farmer unreasonable powers to keep people off his lands.  Instead of the Parliamentary Secretary having to justify letting people in or arming local authorities with powers to enter on farmers' lands at any hour, he wants us to justify keeping them out.  He thinks that we should make the exact case as to the exact number of minutes during the late night and the early morning that they should be kept out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary was living up to a lot of the speeches that were made by his colleagues who are now in the Government he should have been overwilling to meet Deputy MacEntee's amendment and, if he was not completely satisfied with the terms of it, he should have introduced an amendment to that amendment setting out the exact time during which <Col N="1617" /> county council workers could enter on the farmer's land.  I want to remind him that the Bill as introduced gave power to enter any time of day or night and what I am suggesting is that he should accept Deputy MacEntee's amendment with perhaps a minor amendment that the hours should be, not from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., but the usual working hours of the county council.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>Really, I cannot see the necessity for this amendment.  It is going to confine the hours of work from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.  As men of commonsense, surely Deputy Aiken and Deputy MacEntee must recognise that there are certain works in the county which he and I have the honour to represent, such as the repair of embankments, when a breach occurs as the result of a spring tide, that necessitates the closing of the breach as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I can visualise a job being done to one of these embankments and if the men must stop at 6 o'clock, within half an hour of the completion of the work, if the high tide comes again the work they have done will be rendered useless and the last position will be worse than the first. Do Deputy Aiken and Deputy MacEntee want that state of affairs to occur by simply stating 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.?  Take the example of a man making a cock of hay.  At half past five he has a premonition that there <Col N="1618" /> will be a cloud-burst that evening that would destroy the cock of hay.  Is he to down his fork and say: &ldquo;I will not work one minute after six?&rdquo; Surely Deputy MacEntee and Deputy Aiken do not wish that state of affairs to occur.  It could happen that there would be a very bad week of wet weather, that the men could not work, and the ganger, with the consent of the county council or the urban council, in order to give the men an opportunity of making money and to make up for the broken time, would allow them to work until eight or nine. That is often done even in building work.</P>
      <P>A good employer will allow his men to work a little overtime to make up for the time lost as a result of wet weather.  Surely both Deputies do not wish to prevent these men from earning a few extra shillings, especially if the work is of such a nature that when once begun must be finished.  The same thing occurs when there is a break in water pipes.  Once the plumber starts on the work he has to continue, if necessary, during the night, until it is finished.  I am sure Deputy Aiken and Deputy MacEntee would be two of the first men to make a complaint to the city manager if they found there was no water in their homes.  Surely it would be unreasonable to expect the city manager or the county engineer to carry out their work satisfactorily if they were restricted to these hours. There is no necessity to fix the hours from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.  Deputy MacEntee quoted the Act dealing with entry into land where water pipes and water mains are concerned.  That is all right up to a point.  Everyone knows that if you have to renew or examine pipes there is a good deal of inconvenience caused to the farmer. Trenches have to be opened all over the fields through which the pipes run. It is not the small job that Deputy MacEntee seems to think it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely we are all reasonable men. The farmers are reasonable men and the members and officials of public bodies are reasonable men.  There is no such thing as people going in with tommyguns or machine guns to point it at the farmer and to say: &ldquo;I am going <Col N="1619" /> to enter your land at 3 o'clock in the morning.&rdquo;  What fool is going to enter land with an army of men and picks and shovels at that hour of the morning? He will not be there very long before he will be asked why he is there. No matter what precautions the county council may take, some people, for a joke or otherwise, could go in and say: &ldquo;I am a member of the county council.&rdquo; Who is to say that he is not?  No matter what the Minister may put into the Bill, there is always something that can happen if people want it to happen. Some of the Deputies opposite see dreadful dangers in this Bill.  I cannot see any.  Knowing the condition of affairs in the country, I cannot see why, above all, there should be this fixation of hours from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.  It is a case of &ldquo;Thus far shall you go and no further&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The Deputy who has just sat down gave us a pathetic picture of the haymaker about to finish a cock of hay, throwing down his fork at 6 p.m. and walking home.  It is quite clear that the members of the Government Party who are supporting this Bill are cock-eyed and hay-wire as to what it means.  This Bill is not a Bill to facilitate local authorities making hay though it will, I am sure, enable some of them to make hay on another man's land.  It is a Bill which provides for the carrying out of certain works.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I may be permitted to stress the reason why I think the amendment is an essential one.  Apparently, in the case of this Bill a split seems to have occurred in the Ancient Order of Hibernians.  The national president believes in keeping inspectors or pip-squeaks outside every farmer's fence at all hours of the day and night.  Deputy Coburn who, I understand <Col N="1620" /> is a national trustee of the organisation, on the other hand, feels that pip-squeaks and inspectors ought to be permitted to invade and trespass on any man's land at any hour of the day or night.  Quite obviously there is no unity in the Party opposite in relation to this question of the right of a man to ensure that his property, his premises, his house or his lands will not be invaded except by due authority at reasonable hours.  I know, of course, that there are people opposite who think that a landowner should have no rights, that, in fact, it is a crime against the natural law for a man to possess, or claim to possess, private property and land.  It is quite clear, from the attitude which is being taken here by people who are supporting this Bill, that that principle meets with much more general acceptance among Government supporters than we ever could have believed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment proposes to restrict, by inserting a following sub-section, the general power of entry given under sub-section (1) of Section 4 to the power of entry at reasonable hours.  Under Section 4, as it stands at present, a person holding himself out to be an officer, servant or agent of a local authority may enter land of any kind, and if a person resists his entry and should be proven to have resisted it under the misapprehension that the person who was the trespasser on his land was not in fact an officer of the local authority, then, under sub-section (5) of the section he commits an offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Timoney wanted to know what was the purpose of the amendment. Its purpose was to ensure that, <Col N="1621" /> by limiting and restricting the right to enter at reasonable hours, a farmer would not be guilty of an offence under the section if he drove off his lands a person whom he regarded as having no right to be there, if that person happened to be there during the hours of darkness between 6 p.m. and 9 a.m. the following morning.  Where is the injustice to a local authority or to any other person by trying to give the landowner that protection against unauthorised trespass?  Where is the public injustice done to anyone?</P>
    <P>Deputy Fagan, apparently, believes that a local authority has the right to enter any man's land at any time he likes, and so, apparently, does Deputy Timoney.  Deputy Sweetman has made it clear in his contribution to the debate on the section that he does not know what is in the Bill.  He said, in the course of his speech on the amendment, that the sole purpose of the Bill was to enable watercourses to be cleared.  I would ask him to read Section 2 again.  If he does, he will see that it gives the local authority power to do any work, including, in particular, &ldquo;the making of drains, the removal of substances or things causing obstructions in watercourses, the widening or deepening of watercourses, the making or repairing of walls or embankments, the diversion of water into watercourses&rdquo;.  A great deal more can be done under this Bill than the mere removal of obstructions or the implementation, as I think Deputy Sweetman said, of the ordinary operations of Nature.  Well, I never saw Nature clearing watercourses of its own accord, except perhaps as the result of volcanic upheavals.</P>

If it is felt the hour of 9 a.m. is too late, why not make it 8 a.m., and if it is thought that the hour of 6 p.m. is too early to exclude trespassers, why not make it 7 p.m.?  We would at least give the landowner this assurance, that if he finds a man on his land who is not able and who is bound to produce an authority showing that he has a right to be there, he will know that he will be entitled to ask that man to leave his land and, if he does not leave, he will be entitled to eject him and will not be committing an offence.</P>
      <P>Deputy Timoney asks what is the purpose of the amendment.

It is only reasonable we should do that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>He would know&mdash;I beg the Deputy's pardon.  In the case of the Water Supplies Act the works were carried out by strangers and, therefore, the farmer had a safeguard. I am saying that if the farmer had to have that safeguard in the case of water supply schemes he should equally have the same safeguard in the case of this Works Bill.  I think I am justified, in order to refute Deputy Sweetman's argument, in telling the House that local water supply schemes have been carried out in the main by officers of local authorities, by the servants of the local authorities, by people who are sometimes road workers, at other times quarry workers and at other times working on behalf of the local authority where the schemes are carried out by direct labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was suggested, by Deputy Coburn in particular, that this amendment would prevent the officers of local authorities entering on land in order to carry out repair works which were urgently needed.  He referred to the sea breaking through embankments and encroaching on the land.  This amendment provides for that, because it makes it clear that if the purpose of the entry is to carry out works of urgent importance the land may be entered on at any time; but the fact of the matter is that Deputy Coburn did not read the amendment any more than he read the Bill and any more than Deputy Sweetman read the Bill and, therefore, neither one nor the other knew what he was talking about when he tried to induce the House not <Col N="1626" /> to accept the amendment.  However, I think Deputy Aiken has made a reasonable suggestion to the Parliamentary Secretary.  That is, if he thinks that the servants or officers of the local authorities in general start work earlier than 9 a.m. and work later than 6 p.m., he should accept the principle at any rate and put some reasonable limitation upon the hours during which land may be entered on by the officers of local authorities.</P>

      <P>I do not.  I am leaving it to the discretion and judgment of the Parliamentary Secretary to fix his own hours.  I do not want him to give them power of entry for 24 hours round the clock under the Bill as it stands.  I gather that that may not meet with the approval of some people, but I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will look at this matter reasonably. As he cannot do anything here, perhaps he would introduce an amendment in the Seanad accepting that principle.  It is not right that the officer of a local authority or, indeed, any person, should be given unrestricted right of entry at all times in the day and night upon private property.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 4, Section 4, to insert before sub-section (4) three new sub-sections as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>( )  Any person to whom a notice of intention to enter on land has been given under this section may, not later than 14 days after the giving of such notice, apply to the justice of the District Court having jurisdiction in the district in which such land is situate, on notice to the local authority by whom or on whose behalf such notice was given, for an order prohibiting the said entry on such land, and, upon the hearing of such application, such justice may, if he so thinks proper, either wholly prohibit such entry on such land or <Col N="1627" /> specify conditions to be observed by the person making such entry.</P>
    <P>( )  Where a justice of the District Court prohibits under the next preceding sub-section of this section a proposed entry on land, it shall not be lawful for any person to enter on such land under this section, and where a justice of the District Court specifies under the said next preceding sub-section of this section conditions to be observed by persons entering on land under this section, every person who so enters on such land shall observe the conditions so specified.</P>
    <P>( )  Any person who suffers damage by anything done on any land under this section and, within one month after such thing is done, makes to the local authority on whose authority such land was entered under this section a claim for compensation in respect of such damage, shall be entitled to be paid by such local authority reasonable compensation for such damage and to recover such compensation (when the amount thereof has been agreed upon or has been determined under the next following section) from such local authority in any court of competent jurisdiction as a simple contract debt.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to confer upon persons whose land it is decided to enter upon some of the rights of appeal conferred by existing statutes on persons similarly affected. In the course of his speeches on the Bill the Parliamentary Secretary referred on occasions, apparently with approval, to Acts of his predecessor.  He referred to one in particular, the Local Government Act of 1946.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary in this section to give a person upon whose land a local authority proposes to enter the same right of appeal as is given in Section 54 of the Local Government Act, 1946. That section provides that any officer or agent of a road authority who is duly authorised in that behalf by the authority may, subject to the provisions of the section and without prejudice to any other power, enter on any land between the hours of 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. <Col N="1628" /> on any day for the purpose of performing any duty imposed on the authority by that Act.  Apparently the House is not disposed to accept that restriction upon the right of entry under this present measure.  It then goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A person entering on land under this section may do thereon all things reasonably necessary for the purpose for which the entry is made, and, in particular, may survey, make plans, take levels, set up gauges to record the flow of water, make excavations and examine the depth and nature of the subsoil.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These are all works of a minor character which would be extremely unlikely to damage or injure land in any event.  Section 54 of the Local Government Act, 1946, provides that right of entry is restricted to the hours of daylight; the purpose for which entry can be made is strictly defined and limited.  Furthermore, sub-section (3) provides that notice shall be given. The Parliamentary Secretary has already accepted the principle that notice should be given.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 11:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 4, to delete Section 5 (1) and (2), lines 9 and 19, and substitute the following sub-sections:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1629" /> (1) Any person who suffers damage by reason of any interference, caused by the execution of works pursuant to this Act or an Order or agreement made thereunder, with any land owned or occupied by him or any easement, profit-a-prendre or other right belonging to him shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, be entitled to be paid compensation in respect of such damage by the local authority who executed the works or, if that local authority executed the works on behalf of another local authority pursuant to an agreement made under this Act, by such other local authority.</P>
    <P>(2) Every claim for compensation made under this section shall be made in writing to the local authority concerned before the expiration of the period beginning on the commencement of the works which caused the interference to which the claim relates and ending either two years thereafter or one year after the completion of such works (whichever is the later).</P>
    <P>I am concerned with sub-section (2) On the Committee Stage I promised to reconsider the section dealing with the claim for compensation.  Some Deputies thought that the time given during which to make a claim for compensation was inadequate.  Other Deputies made the point that it might be easier to date the period either from the commencement of the work or from the completion of the work.  I gathered that it was merely a matter of opinion as to whether the date of commencement or the date of completion was the most appropriate.  This amendment, therefore, gives the applicant for compensation the option of making that claim within either two years from the commencement of the work or one year after the completion of the work, whichever is the later.  I think that ought to go a long way towards meeting the desires of those Deputies who spoke on this particular section on the Committee Stage and I recommend acceptance of the amendment to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Sub-section (2) of this amendment is certainly an improvement <Col N="1630" /> on the Bill as introduced.  Under the Bill originally, the period set down was 18 months from the commencement of the work.  This amendment fixes the period at two years from the commencement of the work or one year after the completion of the work.  I still think it does not go far enough.  The claim put forward by the majority of the speakers on the Committee Stage was that a person who is damaged by reason of the carrying out of these works should get a reasonable time within which to discover and make a claim if damage is caused.  Many people approach this whole question of drainage as if water were an enemy to be got rid of as quickly as possible.  It is in certain circumstances an enemy but, like many other elements, it is a friend if you treat it properly.  You may have a situation where drainage is undertaken which will have the effect of lowering the water-table in certain districts.  That lowering of the water-table may carry with it no ill effects when a dry year comes but as we have often a succession of wet summers following wet winters, it would be impossible to discover what real damage has been done to the level of the water-table by drainage until a dry summer or a succession of dry summers comes. We therefore ask that a longer time should be given than a year after the completion of the works or two years after the commencement of the works as the Parliamentary Secretary suggests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should do what Deputy MacEntee suggests in amendment No. 13, namely, give a man whose property has been damaged five years in which to discover the damage and make his claim.  It would be very little consolation to him to discover at the end of two years or one year, whichever is the later, that damage had been done but that the time for claiming compensation had passed.  To take again damage that may be done by flooding, if water is released from upstream down to middle stream or to the lower reaches of a river, and a lot of drains are opened upstream, they may not cause damage if we have a succession of reasonably dry winters.  It is only when we get a really wet winter that we see the full effects of the presence of a lot of water <Col N="1631" /> in the river basin upon drainage. Deputy MacEntee wants to give farmers in the middle stream or the lower reaches of the river five years in which to discover the damage and make their claim.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Parliamentary Secretary would indicate that he would accept that five year period at this stage rather than the year or two years.  I do not think he would have anything to lose in doing that and by doing it he might prevent very serious injustice.  If the public interest demands that certain works be carried out, there is no reason why any individual adversely affected by the performance of such work, should be prevented from claiming reasonable compensation. If no damage arises within the five years, we may take it that none is likely to arise and there is no reason why a person should not be estopped from claiming compensation thereafter, but there is every reason to allow at least a period of five years. If we take the present spell of fine weather, I think it can be said that it is five years or more since we have had a dry summer following a dry spring.  I do not remember the Electricity Supply Board ever having to call for a saving of electricity at this time of the year, even though a couple of power plants have come into operation within the last 12 months that were not in operation before.  Many farmers have had to go four or five miles to get drinking water for cattle and for human consumption within the past few weeks. It might easily occur&mdash;and I am sure it will occur in certain cases&mdash;that with the best will in the world even when the work has been carried out by competent engineers, farms will be affected by this drainage to such an extent that farmers whose lands never suffered from absence of water, will be left without water and will have to travel several miles to find water for themselves and their cattle.</P>
    <P>I should not be so much concerned about this were it not that the Parliamentary Secretary has given no undertaking that he will consult with the only properly-constituted authority in the country before executing works under this Bill.  We set up the Board <Col N="1632" /> of Works as the drainage authority. We spent a lot of money in getting engineers trained.  We also spent a lot of money in one way or another in paying for the mistakes these engineers made, and they now have a knowledge of their business much better than exists in any other Government Department, whether that be the Department of Local Government under this Bill, or the Department of Agriculture under another Bill that is before the House.  The Parliamentary Secretary has steadfastly refused to commit himself to taking advice from these people. In the absence of some commitment from the Parliamentary Secretary that he will consult with the Board of Works when damage is likely to be done by drainage, I feel that we should make certain that the time for claiming compensation is extended beyond a year after the completion of the works or two years after the commencement of the works as mentioned in sub-section (2) of the Parliamentary Secretary's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand Deputy Aiken, these amendments&mdash; three of them running one after another&mdash;are in a descending order&mdash;five, four and three years.  While from one point of view, I am in theoretical agreement with what Deputy Aiken suggests, from the practical point of view I am not very happy about it.  We all know that even after damage has been ascertained farmers are sometimes slow to move and it might be that the point at which a court would declare that damage had been ascertained was in fact a point more than three months before the claim was lodged by that particular farmer. Therefore, while the Deputy is trying to confer a benefit, it could possibly be construed in a way which would affect the claim of the owner of the land more prejudicially than the amendment of the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has made a very great concession in fixing the time within which a claim may be made as commencing from the date of the completion of the works.  As I said the last time, I am entirely in agreement that it is essential that the work should be finished before the period <Col N="1633" /> should start to run.  I am afraid, however, that if one were to take the first amendment to which Deputy Aiken has referred, that is, three months after the damage was done or five years after the work was completed, it would be very difficult indeed for anyone to determine five years after the work was done whether or not in fact the damage was done by the work carried out by the local authority.  However theoretically beneficial such a procedure might be, certainly the practical difficulties of it would completely outweigh any theoretical benefit which might arise and I think that, in these circumstances, the balance is strongly in favour of the Parliamentary Secretary's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJosephTimoney" hpid="Mr. Timoney Mr. Timoney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timoney</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel obliged to say that I consider that any one of the three amendments by Deputy MacEntee is preferable to Part II of amendment No. 11, sponsored by the Parliamentary Secretary.  It is very easy to visualise a case in which damage will not become apparent until after the statutory limit laid down in the second part of amendment No. 11.  As a solicitor practising in the country, I can visualise a farmer coming in to me and saying: &ldquo;Work was done two and a half years ago; damage has now resulted to me as a consequence of that work&rdquo;, and I having to tell him that he is statute barred, that he has no redress.  If any of the amendments of Deputy MacEntee would meet that situation, it ought to commend itself to the Parliamentary Secretary and to the House.  Even at this stage I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to reconsider the position and accept the principle laid down in Deputy MacEntee's amendments.  The principle is important and I think it ought to be accepted.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 18:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 4, Section 5, to insert before sub-section (5) a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>( )  Notice of application for determination by the District Court of the amount of compensation to be paid by the local authority under this section shall be in writing signed by the applicant or his solicitor, and shall contain such particulars as shall in the opinion of the court be necessary and may be served on the local authority by posting same by ordinary post to the secretary of such local authority, and the District Court Rules applicable to the time for service, the entry, the notice of defence and the hearing of ordinary civil processes, shall apply to every such notice of application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since I put down this amendment, it has been pointed out to me that in Section 17 of the Interpretation Act of 1937 provision is made for the idea I had in mind in putting down this amendment.  I agree that that provision is there, but I think it is a very handy and desirable thing that an enactment which provides for a reference to a specific court of specific matters should provide in as simple a form as possible the machinery for that.  There are statutes which do contain in themselves machinery for an application to courts.  Speaking from memory, one of these would be the Public Dance Halls Act.  There are other enactments which do not contain machinery for application to courts and rules have had to be made by the rule-making committee to provide the machinery necessary.  Sometimes these rules are not very satisfactory.  While I understand that this amendment would not be accepted, I feel I ought to say that, from the point of view of the solicitor down the country&mdash;it is mostly country solicitors who will be dealing with cases under this Bill&mdash;the <Col N="1635" /> acceptance of the amendment would be of very considerable convenience.</P>
    <P>I do not know how long the rule-making authority will take to provide rules which would give us the machinery.  There will, however, be a time lag and it is desirable that there should not be such a time lag.  Therefore, from the point of view of simplicity, I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to consider the acceptance of this amendment.  It is a good principle that, as far as we can do it, each enactment should stand by itself and should contain in itself the machinery for its own implementation.  We all agree that simplification of the law is desirable.  People have strong views about the desirability of a codification of the laws from that point of view.  A start could very well be made with the idea which is behind my amendment, namely, that an enactment which provides for specific matters ought to contain within itself the machinery for its implementation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy complains that I have not the same legal experience or knowledge as he has but I think he will appreciate that this particular Bill would be an inappropriate place to amend legislation or to provide for legislation which would change court rules in any way whatsoever.  I think it is undesirable as well as being unnecessary that we should accept this amendment because, as the Deputy himself stated, Section 17 of the Interpretation Act provides that the rule-making authority of the court shall have power to make rules to lay down the practice and procedure to be followed in making application for compensation. I am advised that no such provision as that proposed by the Deputy is embodied in any legislation which gives to a district justice a power to assess compensation.  So, I think he can readily take it for granted that the rule-making authority will lay down the practice and procedure in this particular case.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 20:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 4, to delete Section 5 (5) and (6) lines 34 to 45 and substitute the following sub-sections:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(5)  A justice of the District Court when making an order under this section may at his discretion order the costs, to an amount not exceeding three guineas, incurred in relation to the proceedings by any party thereto (together with such witnesses' expenses as the justice considers reasonable) to be paid by any other party thereto.</P>
      <P>(6) Where, in the case of an application to the District Court to determine the compensation to be paid under this section by a local authority, the compensation determined by the court does not exceed that offered unconditionally by the local authority before the application was made, the court may order that such costs and witnesses' expenses of the local authority as the court considers reasonable shall be deducted from the compensation determined by the court.</P>
      <P>During the Committee Stage we had a discussion in which Deputies expressed the opinion that under the terms of the Bill as it was the district justice did not have power to award witnesses' expenses.  I am still of the opinion, and I am advised, that even if this particular amendment were not introduced he would still have power to award witnesses' expenses and I quote here Article 147, sub-section (1) of the District Court Rules, 1948, which reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A justice in hearing and determining any civil process shall have jurisdiction to grant to the successful party such witnesses' expenses as he shall think fit to award and the grant of such costs shall be in accordance with the schedule of costs annexed hereto.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment, in any case, is to allay any misgivings or fears that <Col N="1637" /> Deputies might have as to the power of the district justice to award witnesses' expenses and I recommend it for acceptance.</P>

      <P>I would like to state that there were several allied amendments providing for proposed works to be executed in accordance with the decision of the Board of Works.  The key amendment was No. 11, put down by Deputy MacEntee and moved by Deputy Aiken, and I suggested that amendments Nos. 11, 12, 13, 14 and 42 could be taken together as far as the principle was concerned and that the principle be decided on amendment No. 11.  That was agreed to.  Then Deputy Aiken asked about a decision on some other amendment and I said the principle was decided on No. 11 but that if Deputies desired they could have a decision on any of the others.  Amendment No. 42 of that series now becomes No. 24, but the Deputy did not move for a decision on No. 42.  However, if he thinks he is in any way aggrieved, I am sure that he would get a decision now on it, but there should not be lengthy discussion as the principle was discussed on No. 11.  If the Deputy desires to get a decision on the matter I would say, in fairness to the House, that there should not be a long discussion on it.  If the Deputy should think he was aggrieved he can get a decision now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 24:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 4, before Section 6, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1) The Commissioners of Public Works, if satisfied upon a report of their chief engineering officer that serious flooding is likely to occur if additional waters are drained into a river basin shall, by Order made under this section, schedule such river basin as a prohibited river basin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2) It shall not be lawful for a local authority while a river basin is <Col N="1638" /> scheduled under this section as a prohibited river basin to cause additional waters to be drained into such river basin without the prior approval of the Commissioners of Public Works.</P>
    <P>(3) An Order made under this section may by Order be amended or cancelled.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to discuss this amendment at great length and I thank you for the opportunity.  All I want to ensure is this: We have one fully qualified drainage authority in the country.  They have taken decisions in the past that what were called minor drainage schemes should not be embarked upon where they would cause additional waters to flow into river basins which were not prepared to receive them.  Seeing that the Commissioners of Public Works have adopted that attitude in the past, I feel certain that, if notified, they would take up the same attitude in future and I want to give the commissioners the power to schedule a river basin into which additional waters must not be caused to flow until they have prepared such river basin or until they or the local authority or some other person has improved the river basin to such an extent that the additional waters will not cause destructive floods.  I think the amendment does not require to be read.  It is clear in itself and I am hoping that the Parliamentary Secretary will accept it.  If he does not accept the wording as it stands, if he accepts the principle, he could amend it to his liking in the Seanad.  However, as it stands, it seems to me to be perfectly all right to give the power to the Commissioners of Public Works to schedule certain rivers and to keep them on that schedule until they are satisfied that they are in a fit condition to receive extra waters.  It will save a lot of growing in the country and will reassure a number of people who live on the lower reaches of rivers who have been subject to great floods in the past that worse floods are not going to be caused under the operation of this Bill.  I gave him one instance before where in Sligo the Board of Works refused to carry out a drainage because the main basin was not prepared.  I <Col N="1639" /> put it to the Parliamentary Secretary that the Board of Works should have powers to schedule a river such as the Nore, which caused such havoc in Kil-kenny last year, and to keep it on the schedule.  They should have the power to prevent further waters flowing into the Nore until the Nore is in a better position to receive the floods.  If not, Kilkenny, instead of getting a couple of feet of water for a few days, may get several feet of water for several weeks and the indignation of that district will certainly make itself felt around this district.  In his own interest, and in the interest of the community, the Parliamentary Secretary should accept the principle of this amendment.</P>

      <P>We discussed this particular subject at length on Committee Stage and, contrary to what Deputy Aiken said earlier on this evening, I did state, and it was stated several times here, that we have consulted both the Commissioners of Public Works and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance on this Bill and its provisions.  I do not think we ought to legislate for work which is purely administrative.  We ought not to legislate for what would be done in the normal course of events. The local authorities will be advised to consult with the Department of Local Government if they think there is any danger of an interference with arterial drainage, or the causing of a greater flow of water into a river than it could hold.  They will be advised to consult, through the Department of Local Government, with the Commissioners of Public Works.  In view of the fact that these will not be huge schemes, Deputies may be assured that all the precautions necessary to allay the fears of Deputy Aiken will be taken.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking with a considerable experience of Government Departments, I do not believe they will undertake to carry out all the consultation that is necessary to avoid damage unless there is a duty imposed on them by law to do so.  Every <Col N="1640" /> Department is in a hurry to get its work done and wants to cut out consultations with other Departments. That is quite natural.  It wants to get along with its work.  I feel that there should be a definite legal obligation imposed on the Department of Local Government to consult with the Commissioners of Public Works, and that the latter should have power to operate their authority by scheduling rivers into which additional water should not be caused to flow.</P>
      <P>It is all very well for the Parliamentary Secretary to say that the works under this Bill will not be big, but a number of small rivers sometimes carry more water than would be regarded as normal for a big river.  If you have several minor rivers emptying into a river basin, which is already full, it is going to overflow its banks.  I would strongly press on the Parliamentary Secretary to accept the amendment. The Commissioners of Public Works will be reasonable.  They will not schedule rivers unless they know, from their past experience, that extra water would cause damage.  I think it is a reasonable assurance to ask for people who live on the lower reaches of certain rivers that they are not going to wake up some morning and find great floods of water in their houses or on their lands.</P>

      <P>In page 3, Section 2, line 6, to insert before the word &ldquo;transmit&rdquo; the following words: &ldquo;or land of which the Land Commission is the registered owner.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is a purely drafting amendment required by the Land Commission for administrative convenience.  The intention of the exception is to make it unnecessary for the Land Commission to notify the Registry of Deeds in the case of unvested land held by tenants and allottees.  As the sub-section stands, the exception does not extend to the parcel of land allotted on an untenanted land estate which was registered land at the date of its acquisition by the Land Commission.  The fact that the charge in each case has not been notified to the Land Registry or the Registry of Deeds does not mean that the charge has not been recorded.  The holdings in question being non-vested holdings, a solicitor or other interested person would normally approach the Land Commission if there was any question of sale, and the Land Commission would have a record of the charge in their books. For this excellent reason I invite the House to accept this amendment.</P>

Here is a very important point affecting the Land Commission, the prime holder of all the land of this country, and an amendment is brought in on the Report Stage by the Minister in charge of a Bill proposing to deal with the question of land reclamation and he tells the House that he does not know what the amendment is about.  We have had reason in connection with another measure which has been under discussion for some time to complain of the manner in which legislative proposals are presented to the Dáil.  We certainly have this feeling about it, that those who are responsible for those proposals know very little about what they are doing; that these measures, in the first place, have been agreed in principle by the Government and sent to the draftsman without any proper examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was, during the long years that another Government was in office, a Cabinet procedure laid down which made it impossible for any legislative proposal to be put before this House until it had been examined in detail, minutely examined, by all the Departments which were likely to be affected by it.  I am not going to say, because the facts will contradict me, that because of that close examination errors in draftsmanship did not occur. I am not going to contend that all the measures that were introduced in this House fulfilled the intention of the <Col N="1646" /> Government which introduced them or of the Oireachtas which enacted them for, as I said, experience would contradict me.  The courts have on many occasions interpreted statues passed by this House in a manner which surprised those who were responsible for them.</P>

      <P>Precisely.  Let the Minister for Agriculture laugh as he likes, but this is a very serious matter. I am pointing out to the House and, if the Minister does not want to listen to me, I am pointing out to the country, that despite all the care that was taken in drafting legislation, not merely by the Fianna Fáil Administration but by the Cumann na nGaedheal Administration, to ensure that every aspect of a legislative proposal would be strictly scrutinised, nevertheless, flaws were found in the enactments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I never in all my experience heard &mdash;and I am certain that those who sat in preceding Dála will agree with me that they never heard&mdash;a Minister get up and recommend a legislative proposal to the House in the terms in which the Minister for Agriculture recommended his proposal here this evening.  I do not think that any one of his predecessors ever said in relation to a motion which they put to the House that frankly they did not know what it was about or that they knew less than nothing about it.  As I have said, the fact that the Minister is admitting that is proof of what we have long suspected&mdash;that measures are put to this House without having been properly examined by the Government and the Cabinet responsible for them, that measures are submitted to this House without the proposals being referred to the Departments which are most intimately concerned with them and whose procedure or administration is likely to be affected by them.  If this amendment is of the importance which the Minister for Agriculture admits it to be, there is not any doubt whatever that the need for it would have been recognised if the Land Commission had been given time by the Government to consider the implications <Col N="1647" /> of the Land Reclamation Bill.  Is anybody going to say&mdash;because that would be the only explanation that would be tenable&mdash;that this proposal was submitted to the Land Commission, that the officers of the Land Commission were asleep or were stupefied when the proposal was put to them and that, therefore, they did not recognise the need for this amendment?  That is the only possible explanation, or was it the fact that the Bill in its original form did not go to them at all and that one Ministry did not know what another Ministry was going to do until this Bill got its First Reading here, was circulated to the Dáil and was published?</P>
    <P>There is an Article in the Constitution which says that the Government has collective responsibility.  The obligations of such collective responsibility cannot be fulfilled unless all proposals for legislation are submitted, before they are discussed by the Cabinet, to the Departments which are likely to be affected by them.  There is and there should be in existence, because there was in existence a definite code&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I would have thought that an amendment of such importance would have been fully explained to the House.</P>

      <P>Apparently, the purpose of this amendment is to make sure that the charge in all cases is registered.  Without going into the details of the matter, it has to be related firstly to the wording of the section.  Let us first refer to the draft of the original Bill.  These amendments refer to Section 3 in which we are told:&mdash;</P>
      <P>This section applies where&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) the occupier in accepting the Minister's proposal, informs the Minister that he wishes to pay his contribution by means of an annuity, or</P>
      <P>(b) default occurs under sub-section (4) of Section 2.</P>
      <P>One then goes back to sub-section (4) of Section 2 which says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) Unless the occupier, in accepting the Minister's proposal, informs the Minister that he wishes to pay his contribution by means of an annuity, the contribution shall become due and payable to the Minister by the occupier for the time being on the date upon which the Minister certifies that the works have been completed,</P>
      <P>(b) in default of payment, the Minister shall inform the Land Commission of the default.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the original Bill stood, it applies where the occupier does something or defaults in something I take it. On the Committee Stage this was amended.  You have the Bill now before the House as amended in Committee which I take it is the form of the Bill to which this amendment <Col N="1649" /> applies.  You have &ldquo;in page 3, Section 2, line 6&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

      <P>Is it not to a different section from the one which the Deputy has just read?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Different sub-sections but the application of the sections are the things that matter.  I was merely tracing back the application from start to finish of the section.  Sub section (3) of Section 2 now reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where the occupier of land accepts the Minister's proposal the Minister shall notify the Land Commission forthwith in the prescribed form and the Land Commission shall, except in the case of unregistered land subject to a purchase annuity or land held under a temporary agreement with the Land Commission transmit&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Now that needs to be parsed to see what this first sub-section applies to&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where the occupier of land accepts the Minister's proposal, the Minister shall notify the Land Commission forthwith in the prescribed form and the Land Commission shall, except in the case of unregistered land subject to a purchase annuity or land held under a temporary agreement with the Land Commission, transmit...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In other words, as the section stands, where the occupier accepts the Minister's proposal the charge, apparently, will be notified by the Minister to the Land Commission and the Land Commission shall then transmit for registration. That is the content of the section in its original form and its content here, except that on the Report Stage we have an exception and it is this:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Except in the case of unregistered land subject to a purchase annuity or land held under a temporary agreement with the Land Commission, transmit...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The exception, therefore, is that the Land Commission does not transmit in the case where unregistered land is subject to a purchase annuity.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;subject to a purchase annuity or land held under a temporary agreement with the Land Commission...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The net point, as I read it now, is that there is to be included in the exception: &ldquo;or land of which the Land Commission is the registered owner&rdquo;.  Am I right in that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of that, therefore, is that the Land Commission does not notify the registry in the case where the Land Commission is the registered owner itself.  It seems to me that if you have gone so far as to except the case of unregistered land and land held under a temporary agreement with the Land Commission, in the first case the land would not be subject to registry at all and, obviously, there is no need for notification. I take it I am right in that. In the second case of a temporary agreement with the Land Commission, quite frankly, I am not quite clear what the content there is.</P>

      <P>Therefore, this drafting amendment is in the nature of avoiding an unnecessary statutory manoeuvre or, shall I say, &ldquo;going through the motions&rdquo;, as they say in the Army.  Therefore, it seems to me that, on the section as it stands, this amendment is unobjectionable.  I am, however, very surprised at the Minister's presenting it to us in this way, particularly as he has all the qualifications for being on the top of a job. <Col N="1651" /> Having put it that way, I feel that we have a responsibility in this House for not letting even the slightest, even the most innocuous thing through without fully appreciating for what we are legislating.  I have risen simply in an effort to discharge that duty&mdash;I admit, impromptu.</P>
      <P>I should like to know from the Minister now whether my attempt at reasoning out the content of the section is correct.  As I say, the Minister has all the professional qualifications that would enable him to be very much on top of a job of this kind and in his particular case, at any rate, we cannot accept any excuse for not getting an authoritative and reasoned statement from the Minister who, as I say, has the personal qualifications.  I would, therefore, be obliged if the Minister would tell me whether I am wide of the mark or whether I am on the mark on the lines I have tried to indicate, whether I am right in coming to the conclusion that this amendment is merely designed to obviate a statutory necessity for &ldquo;going through the motions&rdquo; in the Department which would be meaningless by virtue of the fact that the Land Commission, being the owners and having complete power over the alienation of land, the registration of a charge in that case would be relatively pointless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would hold myself remiss were I to recommend an amendment to this House without offering the House an adequate explanation of it and justification for it.  Fortunately, although my observations do not seem to have made the impression which I had hoped they would, I have a copious note of what I then stated and I am in a position substantially to recapitulate it.  I submit for the consideration of the House that it is a model of succinct clarity.  This is purely a drafting amendment required by the Land Commission for the purpose of administrative convenience.  The intention of the exception referred to in the section is to make it unnecessary for the Land Commission to notify the Registry of Deeds in the case of unvested land held by tenants and allottees.  As the sub-section left the <Col N="1652" /> House after the Committee Stage, the exception does not extend to a parcel of land allotted on an untenanted land estate which was registered land at the date of its acquisition by the Land Commission.  The fact that a charge in these cases has not been notified to the Land Registry or the Registry of Deeds does not mean that the charge has not been recorded.  The holdings in question being non-vested holdings, a solicitor or other interested person would normally approach the Land Commission if there was any question of sale and the Land Commission would have a record of the charge in their books.</P>
      <P>Now, is there any facet of this drafting amendment that is not succinctly and clearly described in the language I have just employed?  It is not an uncommon practice in this House, where a Minister is called upon to deal with a highly technical aspect of Land Commission administration, which is notoriously obscure, for a childish member of the Opposition, who himself does not understand the amendment&mdash;and I do not refer to Deputy de Valera but to Deputy Smith&mdash;to ask, in terms which make it quite clear that he did not know what the amendment was about, for further and fuller clarification, the object being to suggest that the Minister in charge of the Bill is inept or incompetent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I decline to offer the affront to this House of dissimulating an expert knowledge which I have not got.  I do not hold myself out to this House as an expert in the land law.  Anyone who knows as much about the land law as I do&mdash;which is a good deal&mdash;appreciates what it takes to be a facile expert in the land code.  Anyone in this House who has an expert knowledge of it would regard it as offensive deception on my part to suggest that I was in a position to go through the land code and explain it to the House.  It is no reflection on my sense of responsibility in coming before the House if I recommend an amendment to them as being purely administrative, of no effect to the principle underlying this section which it is designed to amend, having no other purpose than to simplify administration but of so technical a nature <Col N="1653" /> as to tax the capacity of one not competent to expound the land code in all its complications in presenting it to this House.  Armed, therefore, with a copious note from the best authorities that can be found in the country, I did not attempt to pass off on the House the statement as representing my considered view.  I have told the House that I had got the best advice I could, that I vouched for the accuracy of my version of that advice to the House, that I guaranteed its authenticity and that, on that, I asked the House to incorporate the amendment in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy de Valera approached this matter honestly and fairly, but I do not think he is right and I think it is something that is regrettable if we try to bring the procedure of this House into disrepute.  I do not think it is a right thing to try to raise the suggestion that a Minister would have the insolence, the impertinence, to present to this House an amendment, disowning his obligation to hold himself at the disposal of the House to explain it to the limit of his capacity and it is grossly offensive to me to suggest that I would do it.  I was surprised when the Leas-Cheann Comhairle found himself constrained to allow a wide relevance to Deputy MacEntee on the ground that I had made no attempt and had disowned the duty of explaining my amendment.  I think the words I used in opening, which I have recapitulated from my copious note, constitute as succinct and clear an explanation of this amendment as it is within the power of any Minister to give.  Nothing less would have satisfied me in preparing myself to meet the House.  I confess that when Deputy MacEntee was speaking it seemed to me as though for a moment we had passed with the white rabbit through the looking-glass, we were hurrying down the burrows of Wonderland where the Duchess shook pepper on her baby and the red Queen played croquet with the stork.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>We had on Committee Stage considerable discussion.  I do not want to cover that ground again.  I am anxious to know the reasons why the Minister has not seen fit to accept this.  On the Committee Stage he made the point that the Circuit Court would be available to people who might not be satisfied that the work had been done according to the specification.  I still think that by making available to them the Circuit Court only you are making it more difficult and very expensive, especially in regard to work that might not be very costly.  A particular job of work might not cost more than £50 or £60 and you are asking the person on whose land that work might be carried out if he is not satisfied with the way in which it was done to go to the <Col N="1655" /> Circuit Court to have the matter reviewed by a court of law.</P>
