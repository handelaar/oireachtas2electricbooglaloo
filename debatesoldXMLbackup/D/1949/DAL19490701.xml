      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 2.</P>
      <P>1.  In sub-section (8) Section 2 the following words added at the end of the sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>and if a resolution is passed by either House within the next 21 days upon which that House has sat after the Order has been laid before it annulling the Order, the Order shall be annulled accordingly but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment provides that the Orders made and confirmed by the <Col N="1658" /> Minister when laid on the Table may be annulled after the usual period of 21 days if a motion is put down to that effect.  It is in the usual form and it follows the practice in a number of Statutes.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I should say at this stage that I agreed, during the Committee Stage of the Bill in this House, to move an amendment in the Seanad which would give power to the Electricity Supply Board to take into consideration a period during which the Pigeon House station was closed and for which period gratuities had already been paid to certain employees. I undertook to move that amendment provided the persons concerned were prepared to abate their gratuity on ultimate retirement by an amount equal to the gratuity already paid.  Since the passage of the Bill through this House the Electricity Supply Board interviewed these men with a representative of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  All of them were prepared to have the position remain as it is.  In other words, they preferred the <i>status quo</i> rather than to have the ultimate gratuity abated by an amount equivalent to the gratuity they received before.  Consequently, I did not move the amendment in the Seanad and the case made here by a number of Deputies was not supported by the men concerned.  Therefore, there is no amendment to the section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have found from the Minister himself that social security legislation is not quite such an easy matter to formulate as we were told it was a few years ago.  From the fact that preparation of the White Paper takes a year and a half, one can reasonably expect that legislation in connection with it or consonant with it will take quite as long.  In view of the fact that quite a considerable amount of preparatory work was done before the change of Government, I think it is now quite apparent to everybody that this is somewhat more complicated than we used to hear.  Whether it ever comes into operation or not on the lines envisaged by the Minister is quite another matter, in fact it is very doubtful that it will because, after all, the Minister for Finance has made a number of statements all in agreement with one another and even as recently as yesterday in the Seanad he emphatically reiterated his previous statements. Social security, of course, is a very fine thing and an ideal to be aimed at as far as the necessitous people of this country are concerned, but I think it has been agreed by everybody now that the best form of security is employment, particularly employment of a gainful nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry to say that that has not been a very strong point with the present Government since it took office. Spending money as the Minister has boasted of with regard to social welfare during the past year is a laudable enough thing, but when it is counterbalanced by the number of people who have lost employment I think it is a very unbalanced form of economy.  Of course the unemployment problem has been relieved to a considerable extent by emigration.  We heard a good deal about how emigration was to be ended with the change of Government but not merely did it not end but it has been considerably increased.  It is all very <Col N="1660" /> well for the Minister to state that £2,250,000 is being paid out in old age pensions, widows' and orphans' pensions, blind pensions, etc., but when we find that 9,000 people emigrated in 1948 in excess of the number who emigrated in 1947 I think it is reasonable to conclude that the amount that has been paid out by way of increases in social welfare has been very much more than offset by the loss to the country.  It has been estimated by people who have made a study of this thing that every person who leaves the country is a loss of at least £1,000.  If we multiply 9,000 by 1,000 we find that the loss has been very great indeed and it will take a long time before the amount of money paid out to what might be termed the non-productive sections of the community could be made good, in fact it is a loss, in my opinion and I am sure everybody will agree, that cannot be made good.  We had emigration all the time and I am not one of those who believe that it can ever be ended in full because after all there are people who no matter what their circumstances are inclined to travel and try to find those very green fields they hear so much about in distant countries.  The 9,000 people who emigrated in excess of those who emigrated in 1947 were undoubtedly physically fit people as otherwise they would not be permitted to emigrate and had they been kept in employment here the social problem would not be so grave as it is to-day.  Every day since the present Government took office there has been unemployment here, there and everywhere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am relating unemployment and how it has been dealt with to emigration.  The Minister for Social Welfare has established a commission on emigration and population and that is why I am relating it.  At the present time a form of retrenchment is being carried out in a Department in which I am sure the Minister is very interested.  There is a reorganisation in the Post Office at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that unemployment assistance, unemployment benefits and all the rest come under the heading of this Vote, and the more unemployment that is created the more unemployment and unemployment insurance benefits that will have to be paid out.  That is the point I want to make.  Why the Minister agreed to the setting up of a commission on emigration and population is very difficult to fathom or understand.  He knew the position.  He was never very slow to criticise the Fianna Fáil Government with regard to emigration and he always gave us to understand that if he was in the place of the responsible Minister in the Fianna Fáil Government he would find a very quick solution.  It should have been very apparent to him when he decided to set up this commission on emigration that it was going to take some time, and in doing so he should have known quite well that, as a result of the things that happened in the early days of the régime of the Coalition Government, a number of the people who were deprived of employment were going to lose confidence in the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is what I have been trying to deal with, and <Col N="1662" /> progress has been rather slow.  We have been given the excuse that the reason why progress has been slow is that the members of the commission are very busy people and that they are not paid.  Emigration is an acute problem, and this must have been realised by the Tánaiste and the Government when they set up this commission. There is, therefore, no reason in the world, if it was a question of payment, why they should not be paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That statement is most unfair and contains an allegation that the members of the commission are going slow because they are not being paid.  I say that the people selected for this commission were capable, competent, eminent people with other occupations and interests.  They have tackled this problem in a most expeditious manner and are rendering a very valuable public service.  I think it is unfair to discuss the matter at all while the commission is still sitting, but I think it grossly unfair that the members should be accused of going slow and the whole matter raised of whether they should be paid or not.  I appeal to the Deputy not to go into that matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not questioning the high opinion of the Minister of the people concerned.  I think the Minister ought to have given his reasons why the report had not come out and not merely say that they were men in business and were not being remunerated. Whether that is true or not I do not know, but I do think that as <Col N="1663" /> this is a very important and acute problem there should be no obstacles whatever placed in the way of getting out the report.  It has been mentioned by members of the Government that there is a labour shortage for schemes.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am relating it to the number of people who are unemployed and to whom unemployment assistance and benefits are being paid and also to the fact that the number of people who left my county in 1948 was in excess of the numbers for 1947.  In 1948, 966 males left County Galway.  In view of that I think it is no small wonder that there is a labour shortage.  I think the Minister should try and get this report out as quickly as possible in order to try and bring back the confidence of the people who have lost all confidence in view of the policy that is now being followed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has spoken of the abolition of the means test, but he will admit that he was not the first to be responsible for such abolition.  It was sponsored by Deputy Lemass under the Children's Allowances Bill.  The old age pensions committees were doing good work and I believe that they should be given every assistance in continuing to do that work properly and discharge their duties as they have been discharging them in the past.  I will say that in 90 <Col N="1664" /> per cent. of the cases they have discharged their duties in a conscientious manner.</P>
      <P>I do believe, and I am sure that it is a fact, that the committees are always sympathetic to the claimant.  I presume that that is the reason why they were inaugurated at the outset.  In recent times, I have known of cases where it has happened that the committees, working in strict accord with the regulations, have as far as humanly possible given every consideration to the applicant in making their awards.  I have known in some cases where the investigation officer has taken the usual step of appealing against the committee's award and when the cases came to hearing not only were the awards upheld but the amounts to the applicant were increased.  I would like that in cases of that sort an explanation should be sent to the clerk of the committees pointing out the reasons for the increase because that would be a guidance to the committees in making future awards.  Perhaps the reason why these increases of the awards were given was that these committees are not yet fully conversant with all the regulations and by giving this explanation it would be helping them in their work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter that I would like to bring to the notice of the Minister is that of persons in receipt of sick or disablement benefit.  In a number of cases it is no inconvenience for them to be paid monthly or fortnightly but in the cases of poor persons living perhaps with neighbours they are anxious that they should be paid these benefits weekly and I think that where an application for a weekly benefit is made it should be met.  The late Minister for Local Government had acceded to such a request for weekly payments in the case of county council workers. The Minister for Local Government was very insistent on county councils paying their workers weekly, in spite of the fact that it was going to put something extra on the rates, and even though the workers, in my county, at any rate, did not ask for it and persons who are drawing disablement benefit are even more needy than <Col N="1665" /> people who have their health and are working.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am one of those individuals who pay very few compliments to Ministers of any kind, but I want to compliment the Minister for Social Welfare on being able to get from the Department of Finance the necessary money to give increases to old age and blind pensioners and to widows and orphans during the past year.  Whatever may be said to the contrary, the increases given have proved very beneficial, and, in view of the fact that most of them, or practically all of them, are given on a non-contributory basis, we can say that this country has now reached a stage, with regard to the payment of non-contributory pensions, at which it is almost as good as any country in the world.  If they could be improved slightly and if the promised social welfare scheme which the Minister is to introduce increased these pensions by means of contributions from the people who are to get them in time, it is something which we would all welcome and which we would all like to see.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this matter of social services, we are prepared to be fair to all Parties. We cannot say that the present Minister is the father of all these services. Old age pensions were first given by the British Government many years ago at the rate of 5/- per week, which in its time was a pretty valuable rate, and probably more valuable than the 17/6 of which they are in receipt to-day. At a later stage, the Fianna Fáil Government decided to give widows' pensions and children's allowances and the fact that this Minister has again improved the existing rates is in keeping with the upward trend of these rates.  The position is that social schemes of this kind must be kept in operation for the benefit of those who are unable to help themselves and for that reason the Minister, having the handling of the Department the primary object of which is to provide for those who are unfit to work or who cannot be provided with work, deserves every encouragement and should get whatever advice can be given by the <Col N="1666" /> House to enable him to go ahead with this work.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, social services can be abused and it is the abuses of the scheme that most people object to.  For my own part, when I was a member of the Opposition and when this Department was being debated, I, with many others, was opposed to the idea of social services, and, like others, my reason for opposing them was the fact that I knew they were open to plenty of abuse.  That abuse will always be there, despite the closest attention of the Minister and his officials.  The abuse I refer to is in the fact that men well able to work and who should be at work are inclined to prefer to register at the labour exchange and draw unemployment benefit.  It is perfectly true that no country can build itself up on social services and that social services have never added in any way to the production or output of any country, and, when men who are fit for employment prefer to lounge around and refuse to work, it is time the Minister should take notice and should see to it that some system will be provided in his new social welfare scheme by which it will be possible to catch these individuals who are of the type who bring otherwise good schemes into disrepute.</P>
    <P>It is the duty of the Government to provide the necessary money for the financing of schemes of pensions and benefits for those who are unfit to work, such as the disabled and the blind; and, secondly, it is the duty of the Government to provide employment. If the Government fails to provide that employment, its duty is to provide money which will keep these people in existence until employment is found, but to-day we have reached the stage at which, due to the fact that so many have emigrated in the past number of years, there really is no necessity for the payment of any unemployment benefit, except in the very rarest of cases.  If people think it wise for them to rely to too great an extent on the State, it is time they were taught otherwise, and people's individual efforts should be combined to help the Government in operating the social welfare scheme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1667" /> We must also remember that there are different grades amongst the people who are on the register at present.  Deputy Lemass pointed out that these different grades existed and suggested that those fit for different classes of work should be classified under separate headings.  To my mind, the greatest volume of employment which we are likely to have in years to come is to be found for those who are fitted for heavy manual labour.  The different schemes which are to be operated will give employment to at least 20 men on heavy manual labour for every one man employed on the lighter type of clerical work and what we have to do therefore is to check up on the register, to find out the men who are fitted for this heavy toil and see that they get employment, and then to find out the men who, because of health or other reasons, are not fit for it and try to provide for them.  Heavy manual work cannot be taught to an individual overnight&mdash;it is something which he learns from the cradle.  I come from a constituency which can boast of some of the finest manual labourers in the world.  Many people have emigrated from my county in the past 100 years, since the Famine, and have given by their hard labour, valuable assistance to other countries and the small farmers' sons in my constituency, as well as in others, have been brought up on hard work and taught from their very school days what it is to use their hands and the muscles of their arms, so that they will be able to go out and work for their living in later years.</P>
    <P>I have a higher opinion of those people than I have of any other class. I regard them as being by far the most valuable class of people that we have in the country at the present time.  The biggest amount of emigration takes place along the western seaboard and from Donegal, Clare and Kerry.  I think the Minister should cast his eye in those directions and see if this emigration can be curbed by the provision of employment that would be beneficial and useful not only for the people concerned but for the country.  I think that the Minister would be better advised if, instead of paying £1 or <Col N="1668" /> 30/- a week to any individual to keep him in idleness, he would provide him with another £1 or 30/- and put him into some kind of employment.  A man drawing money in idleness is no good to anybody, not even to himself, while a man who draws money and gives a return in work for it is a benefit not only to himself but to the country.  I think the Minister would be well advised to take those matters into consideration, and, if possible, couple up the work of his Department with that of other Departments so that there will be no overlapping and no wastage.  If that were done, all Departments of State would be moving along the right lines.  The people expect that from the Government.  The members of the different Parties who support the Government and the Minister also expect it.</P>
    <P>I now want to refer to the treatment of those in receipt of unemployment assistance when they are called before the Courts of Referees for an examination of their claims as to whether or not they are entitled to receive it.  I I can speak from personal knowledge of this because I have attended those Courts of Referees to see how the people were treated.  It is very rarely that I hand out bouquets to officials or others, but, in fairness, I want to say that I have found the Courts of Referees to be most lenient in their examination of claims.  They examine them in every detail.  I found that they take into consideration such things as the distance that a person is from the work that is offered to him, his family circumstances, whether he should be expected to travel outside his own county or to travel eight or 12 miles from his own home in which there may be old and infirm people depending on him.  On the whole, I think there can be no complaint on the part of the people who come before these Courts of Referees. Their position is fully looked into.</P>
    <P>The real trouble arises in the case of the smaller farmers in the West with valuations under £4.  Unfortunately, they do not know what category they come into or how they can be described. Their holdings are too small to enable them to be called farmers <Col N="1669" /> and too big to be called labourers. Something will have to be done to give those people an idea as to what status they have in the country&mdash;those who are continually registered as unemployed. During the springtime many of them could not go out and work, even though they were offered £10 a week.  They can be much better employed at home sowing the crops and cutting turf to provide fuel for the home for the rest of the year.  Between the months of October and March or April they are available for work because very little can be done at home at that time.  During those winter months they should be provided with work.  There should be some regulation which would give them a clear understanding as to whether or not they are entitled to unemployment benefit in that period.  I understand that, in the case of people with valuations of £4, there is a regulation which debars them from getting unemployment benefit during certain months of the year.  That is perfectly right because, after all, they find that during those months they can be usefully and gainfully employed at home. Therefore, it would be wrong for a Government to be continually pouring out money into their pockets during that time.</P>
    <P>There is another system under which the Department of Social Welfare is being hoodwinked.  I refer to the case of people who settle down in life and become the owners of small farms of land, in some cases fairly substantial farms.  The practice has grown up that many of these individuals do not become the registered owners of their holdings.  They allow their fathers or grandfathers to remain on as a registered owner.  People of that kind are entitled to make a claim for unemployment benefit.  That may happen in the case of a man with a holding the valuation of which is £20 or £30.  He can make a claim for unemployment benefit because he is not the registered owner of his holding, and by that means can pull the wool over the eyes of the Department.  He can get the same amount of benefit as the man living on a very small holding or the man who is quite properly registered <Col N="1670" /> as unemployed.  These are things which I see happening in my constituency. I hope the Minister will take note of them.</P>
    <P>I think that, in fairness to the present Minister, we must give him the praise and the credit that is due to him.  The increase in the old age pensions, for which he has been responsible, has been very welcome.  It has been welcomed by every Deputy and the people, on the whole, are very well satisfied.  It is all very fine to say that the increase given by the present Government has been only the small amount of 2/6.  It has been pointed out that that is only the increase which has been given.  Up to a point that is right and up to a point it is wrong, because another 2/6, which they were being allowed as a cash payment, had to be provided by the local authority. It was open to any local authority, at any time over a number of years past, to strike the necessary amount of rate to provide that extra 2/6.  The local authorities were forced to provide it.</P>

      <P>As far as I know, if the local authorities did not strike a rate to provide that extra 2/6, the old age pensioners would have to do without it.  The fact that the old age pensioners had to go to the local home assistance officer to get that extra 2/6 seems to me to suggest that there was no security that its payment could be, or would be, maintained.  I am glad the Minister has found it possible to put across the page of the pension book the amount of pension payable to the recipient and this removes any doubt that there may be in the minds of some people as to whether or not they are entitled to this money.  By doing that the Minister has done something for old age pensioners which they have long sought, and the same applies to widows and blind pensioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1671" /> Deputy Beegan referred to old age pension committees.  They are useful people in one sense, and in another sense they serve no purpose whatsoever. Rarely has any Deputy come across a case of a pension committee refusing an applicant the full amount. When the old age pension committees grant the full amount to the applicant the usual procedure is for the pensions officer to appeal against the decision and the case is finally decided in the Department of Social Welfare.  A certain practice has grown up over the years&mdash;whether it is wise or unwise, I do not know&mdash;and that is that, on receipt of the pension, and if there is to be an appeal, the pensioner in question makes post haste for the nearest Deputy and asks him to intercede on his behalf&mdash;to see the Minister or some of the officials in the Department of Social Welfare and use his influence in securing the full pension.  That practice has been in operation for many years; whether it can be destroyed or not, I do not know.</P>
    <P>Deputies on all sides of the House must admit that after making representations on behalf of pensioners during the past year the increase given to those who consider their pensions too small has been very considerable compared with what was customary in previous years.  That is proof that a certain laxity has entered the Department of Social Welfare, that there is a certain easing up, which all of us welcome.  All of us are pleased that it has happened.</P>
    <P>Deputy Beegan told us of the experience he had, that after the appeals were checked up and decided in Dublin the amount of pension granted was more than the amount allowed originally by the pension committee.  That is proof that the Minister must have put his hand over his Department in the right way.  Whether it is the result of an Order from him, or whether it is due to new regulations, there is a certain easing up as regards the allowance to pension claimants.  It is very welcome and is fully in keeping with what we have been wishing for over the years.</P>
    <P>The only thing which will tend to <Col N="1672" /> abolish representations of any kind will be the abolition of the means test. Everybody wants to see the means test abolished.  The Minister when he was in Opposition here was always most anxious to see the means test removed. There are two ways of looking at this means test.  When it is abolished the man who may be as rich as Croesus and the man who is as poor as a church mouse will be equally entitled to the old age pension.  Whether we could leave it to the honour of old people who can afford to do without pensions to do without them, and expect them to withhold their claims and allow the money to go to the poorer classes, is something that will have to be considered. I have always opposed the means test.  I have always maintained that a person who reaches 70 years is entitled to some consideration after his life's toil.  If people have, through industry and keen management, built up a little bank account for their old age, they should be given credit for that rather than penalised.  If the Minister decides that it will be possible to allow full pensions to people who reach 70 years and thereby abolish the means test, he will, I feel sure, have the whole-hearted sympathy of every Deputy.  The means test is a sort of penal code that has been handed down to us and the sooner it is abolished the more our people will be pleased.</P>
    <P>My real reason for paying compliments to the Minister is that I regard him as one of the Ministers who seem to be able to take on the Department of Finance and say: &ldquo;I want so much money and you will have to provide it for me for these social services.&rdquo;  I hope the new social welfare scheme that he intends to introduce will be on the same good lines as the Bill he introduced some time ago increasing the old age pensions.  If it is, it will meet with a welcome reception in the House and I am prepared to give it every encouragement and assistance.</P>

      <P>Tá rud amháin le rá agam ar an Meastachán seo. B'fearr dhom é a rá i mBéarla i dtreo is go dtuigfhdh an tAire é.  The Minister remarked to me the other day when I said I had something to tell <Col N="1673" /> him that he hoped he would understand it.  In order that he will, I am speaking in English and I want to refer to a matter that concerns the movement for the restoration of the language as it affects the Department for which the Minister is responsible.  I have here a national health and a pensions insurance card, one of the new cards published since the Minister took control of the Department.  I have also the card that was in use for years previous to the change.  The old card is bilingual and the new card is completely in English.  An Teachta Tomás Ó Deirg referred to this matter yesterday and the Minister told him that there is also a card available in Irish for anyone who wants it.</P>
      <P>It we are in earnest about this matter of the language we should act differently.  This is an indication of a very reactionary, a backward, trend. The Minister for Finance is probably the nigger in the wood pile in this matter, but if it is decided that there is to be a uni-lingual card, why should it not be in Irish, and why should not any person who wants it in English have the English one made available for him&mdash;not that I see there is any necessity for it?</P>
      <P>I think this is an outrageous change. After all the years that have been spent, in various ways, trying to make the national tongue the spoken language of the country, it is regrettable that we should have a tendency such as this.  There is no danger of English, at any rate, during our generation.  It is our own language that is in danger and this certainly, is a very bad sign.  It is one of the straws which show what way the wind is blowing at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to change it right away and put the language the other way round&mdash;have the cards in Irish and, if there are people who want them in English, let them have them that way.  The uni-lingual card should be in Irish.  If the older generation cannot read and understand these cards, there are young people in every household in every parish who can read them and they will be in a position to explain to their parents or <Col N="1674" /> their grown-up brothers and sisters what the cards contain.</P>
    <P>I repeat that this is an outrageous change and should never have been agreed to by the Minister.  I hope an alteration will be brought about immediately.  If there is any sincerity in this Government with regard to continuing the work for the restoration of the language, they will do as I suggest. This debate has gone on for a considerable time and I do not intend to prolong it very much longer.  Most of the matters which I would like to raise have already been referred to by other Deputies.</P>
    <P>A good deal of the discussion has centred round the operation of the means test.  Most speakers have dealt with it according to the experience they have gained and the knowledge they have acquired in their own personal efforts in dealing with this very touchy question.  The Minister when he was a Deputy referred to this test as an iniquitous one.  I would like to refer specifically to one matter with regard to the decisions arrived at by the old age pensions appeal committee and by the Department of Social Welfare.  I have in mind people who grow old and who decide to transfer their property, let it be a shop, a farm or some other type of property, to some member of their family.  Having done that, they apply for the old age pension.  In numerous cases, particularly in the case of small farmers, the old age pension is granted in full by the local committee. It is immediately opposed by the social welfare officer.  In my experience it is invariably opposed because it is alleged that the transfer was made for the purpose of qualifying for the old age pension. I think that is an outrageous suggestion.  This is not the first time I have raised this matter here.  I have protested on several occasions against that allegation.  How can anybody decide as to what was the object which motivated such a transfer of property? How can a social welfare officer make that allegation?  How can he prove that?  When a man reaches 70 years the best days of his life are over.  Any work that he may do after that age will be very little.  I think the outlook of the Department of Social Welfare in <Col N="1675" /> relation to the administration of the Old Age Pensions Act is wrong.</P>

      <P>I thought it could be changed by regulation.  I was under that impression.  When a person, having transferred his property to some member of his family, applies for an old age pension, that person does not always get that pension.  I think that is wrong.  I was under the impression that Departmental regulations made under the Old Age Pensions Acts were responsible for that position.  I thought that some years ago a previous Minister made some arrangement under which there was a certain relaxation on the part of the deciding officers with regard to their interpretation of transfers of that nature.</P>
      <P>There is then the case of the labouring man working for a farmer or on the roads.  His wife reaches 70 years of age and she applies for the old age pension.  She is debarred because her husband is in receipt of a certain annual income.  Within the past month I have come across two or three cases of that.  I know that, as the law stands, there is no remedy for that situation, but it seems to me to be very wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has also been made to the operation of the Courts of Referees and their activities.  I have had some experience of a Court of Referees.  I have always found them very humane and very reasonable in their decisions. That has been my experience.  I do <Col N="1676" /> not know whether there has been any change in recent times.  Recently, I did come across a case where a man was summoned to work on the bogs in Kildare.  He is a single man with aged parents depending upon him. They are not in the best of health and it is his responsibility to look after them.  I think it is very wrong that a man in that position should be called so far away to work.  I advised him to make a statement to the Court of Referees or to the local labour exchange explaining the position.  I came across another case where a single man, without any dependents, could go if he wanted to go.</P>
    <P>The whole problem with relation to employment and unemployment is the fact that people want work near their homes.  They are not always prepared to travel.  We have had experience of that down through the years.  During the emergency plenty of work was available with Bord na Móna.  Yet, on several occasions I believe there was a shortage of labour on the bogs.  The migrants from the West of Ireland would not go to the bogs.  They would not change over to County Kildare. They were in a groove.  They were accustomed to travelling to the other side year after year.  It is not always easy to change customs of that kind. The same applies to the rural workers in County Limerick.  They want work as near as possible to their own homes. I suppose that is quite a natural desire. There are others who have no hesitation in emigrating to England.  I saw young men and women leave work here in order to go to England.  The same is happening now with regard to America.  People are now permitted to emigrate there again.  It is a very serious problem.  We were promised a solution for it.</P>

The solution to this problem of emigration will require the united efforts of all the people.  It is a disease more than anything else. I understand that at the moment there is a scarcity of workers for the Bord na Móna machine-won turf schemes. The Government cannot escape responsibility for that scarcity because, following on the cessation of the hand-won turf scheme early in 1948, there was a big increase in the numbers emigrating.  Those people who had been working on the bogs prior to that saw no other alternative available to them. Then when the Minister wanted&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Tá go maith. Tá an dá rud ceangailte go dlúth le chéile.  A Deputy from Mayo, Deputy Commons, referred also to the type of work that will be available in future, heavy manual work.  There is a good deal of that available always, but it is very difficult sometimes in rural areas to get workers to undertake it.  I suppose it is human nature again that the working section of the community want to get work in factories or other industries and to avoid heavy manual work if possible.  That is another problem we have got to face.  I suppose if the rate of remuneration for heavy work were better, there would be a better <Col N="1678" /> chance of getting workers to engage in this type of work.  The essential work of the country cannot be carried on without such workers and they are becoming scarcer as the years go on. We, of course, are all anxious for the most suitable and softest type of work and it is no blame to people who are trying to better their position, as they think themselves, to try to get a different type of work from the ordinary work available in rural areas. The scarcity of workers willing to undertake that type of employment is a problem we must face in the future.</P>
      <P>I probably would not have intervened in the debate at all were it not that I wanted to make a protest against the reactionary change which has taken place with regard to the national health and pension insurance cards.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I heard a remark made the other night from the Government side of the House that a great many matters that we now seem to regard, when in opposition, as virtues were looked upon by us as matter of detriment to the people generally when we were the Government Party and had responsibility for providing social services.  I would say in reply to that that the argument cuts both ways.  I do not think there is any political point to be secured by pointing to the fact that we were 16 years in office and that, because we complain of certain things now, that remark is good enough as a reply and as an argument. I should like to make the comment that the score was settled in the result of the last general election.  When a question of education comes up here we are told that it was the teachers' <Col N="1679" /> strike that brought us down, and when it is a question of social services we are told that it was our negligence in the matter of old age pensions and things of that sort that caused our defeat.  Again, if it is a finance Bill that is before the House, we are told that it was our Supplementary Budget that was responsible for turning us out of office.  Whatever the cause may be, the fact is that the score has been settled.</P>
      <P>We are at present in Opposition, as the Parties who now form the Government were 18 months ago, and I think we are quite entitled to assert our rights and to point out to the Minister that the matters that caused this interchange of places have not been dealt with by him as Minister in the way that he promised when he was in Opposition. After all, he and the Parties associated with him promised that they would abolish the means test for old age pensions, for example.  What do we find?  We find that the maximum income within which a person may qualify for a pension is now £52, whereas under Fianna Fáil it was only £39.  I would ask the Minister to apply to this argument that the position has been bettered considerably by that change in the maximum income allowed, the remark of the Minister for Finance, so often repeated in this House, that the £ is now worth only 10/-.  If there is no conflict between himself and the Minister for Finance as to the value of the £, then the least he should have done was to double the £39 5s. od.  If he does not increase it very much more than £52, he certainly does not improve the position.  He is not even attaining the position which these old age pensioners enjoyed before the war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Department of Social Welfare is of the first importance to the areas which comprise the Gaeltacht and the story of the Gaeltacht since the Government came into office has been a very sad one indeed.  I do not at all agree with Deputy Commons, who also represents a constituency somewhat similar to my own, that men register because they are work-shy or because <Col N="1680" /> they do not want work.  My experience has been that the reverse is the case&mdash;that men register because they cannot in any other way get work. That is the position in the constituency I represent.  They register for work and if they are not registered they have no chance of getting it.  As a matter of fact, they have no guarantee of getting it, even after registration. There are so many registered that men must, in fact, be in receipt of unemployment assistance before they have any likelihood of getting work.  In any event, registration is the absolute minimum to enable a man to get work.</P>
    <P>Another point which Deputy Commons made was that men do not register their land in their own names because if they do, they will not qualify for unemployment benefit.  I take it that he was referring particularly to unemployment insurance benefit.  I do not know what the position at the moment is but I know that I have many complaints from men who, whether the land was registered or not in their names, did not qualify for benefit.  The user of the land was the important thing in deciding whether a man would qualify for unemployment insurance benefit or unemployment assistance.  If he lived on the land and if he got any benefit from it, that was taken as means and very often prevented him entirely from getting any assistance.</P>
    <P>The social services which the Minister took over from the previous Government are very necessary for social welfare in general.  I should like to point out, however, that there are things which minister to social welfare much more effectively and much more permanently and which strengthen the moral fibre of the people and their independence much better than any social service.  I do not accept entirely the description of these services as so many medicine bottles, but they are not nearly so good as the other means whereby the people's welfare can be advanced.  Of course the first amongst them is employment.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of employment, the Minister gave some figures culled from the records of the <Col N="1681" /> National Health Insurance Department. He gave a series of figures beginning in 1938 and ending in 1948 to show that sale of national health insurance stamps had increased. When the Minister has time, I would ask him to examine the figures for employment in the industries which produce transportable goods and which he will get readily from the Department of Industry and Commerce.  He will find there that the steady upward trend of employment in these industries from the ending of the war in 1945 until Fianna Fáil left office was something over 3,000.  For the first comparable period after the present Government came in that upward trend had been reduced nearly to 500. I think these are far more important figures for the Minister in regard to the question of social welfare than the figures for national health insurance stamps, because the figures represent, in the main, permanent employment, whereas a great deal of the employment represented by the figures for national health insurance cannot be so classified.  That stopping of a very good trend has, of course, its result in heavy emigration and because of this emigration, which is heavier in the poorer areas than elsewhere, the need for still better social services is very pressing.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister will require a great deal of persuasion to see that where young men leave the land, particularly the small holdings worked by family labour, the older people on these holdings are left in a very poor way indeed.  After all, it is by the labour of the young men on these poor holdings that the people have been able to exist at all and it is a bad state of affairs to see that labour depleted.  I admit that these young men have not full employment on their own holdings.  For that reason, public works are necessary to enable them to eke out some sort of a decent existence.  Because of the stoppage of these supplementary schemes, their services in producing turf, potatoes, fish and other food are lost to their aged relatives at home and these young men have had to clear out of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>The lack of help which these young people were able to give accentuates the need for further social services.  It has increased the need for better unemployment assistance allowances, better old age pensions, and generally better allowances for all those people who are catered for by the Department of Social Welfare.  I want to reiterate a statement which I have often made&mdash;that the unemployment assistance service is not a demoralising one.  It has been of great benefit in my constituency.  The number of people who have been demoralised and made work-shy as a result of it is negligible.  I do not know of any able-bodied man who has refused work and shown a preference for unemployment assistance.</P>
      <P>If I were asked what was the net result in my constituency of the operation of the unemployment assistance service, I would unhesitatingly make one reply that in Connemara it has substituted a cash trade in the shops for that iniquitous ledger system.  The ledger is finished as a feature of the relations between the customer and the shopkeeper in these poor areas.  The people are now, in the main, paying for the goods as they get them and that has brought a degree of independence to them which they never experienced before.  Whatever paying orders they got from America, from employment on public works or any other source formerly went automatically into the shopkeepers' till.  The customer was given credit for them and was given goods.  This continuous process went on and he never knew how he stood. Unemployment assistance was the most potent factor in wiping out that system. I know that the increase in the circulation of money during the war was a great help in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, however, we are falling back into a position in which the people in my constituency are again almost as much without hope as they were formerly.  I am not saying that through any Party bitterness or any desire to score a Party point, but, unfortunately, it is only too true.  The abandonment of the hand-won turf <Col N="1683" /> industry is the main cause of it.  It seems to me that some mí-ádh has set in in the poorer areas with the change of Government.  I am not suggesting that it is entirely due to the change of Government&mdash;it may be just a coincidence. Some industries which were set up in these areas do not seem to be doing as well as formerly.  There is the toy industry, for instance.  Then the Minister for Agriculture deliberately tried to stop another profitable industry&mdash;the tomato industry.</P>

I want to say to the Minister that the condition of affairs is such, if he wants to come anywhere near approaching the conditions of frugal comfort which the people formerly enjoyed in my constituency, that he will have to increase greatly the provision for these social services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the keynote of the whole thing.  The Minister for Finance, when he was on these benches, said that the £ was only worth 10/-. He said that our sterling assets were worth only half their nominal value. That statement could have only one argument and I want to apply it to this change in the means test.  The maximum allowance is being increased from £39 to £52.  I am quite positive that that does not give anyone anything approaching the value of the old age pension as it was pre-war.  I do not think the Minister would attempt to argue that it does.  I know that the Minister's plans were much more ambitious than he has been allowed to carry out.  I know he supported the campaign <Col N="1684" /> carried on by an organisation known as Cothrom na Féinne which lambasted Fianna Fáil for a few years before the last election, mainly on the question of old age pensions.  I think 26/- a week was their minimum, and men were to get it at 65 and women at 60.  The Minister and his Party backed that, but his present proposals fall very far short of what the people were led to believe would be done if there was a change of Government.  The score has been settled by our having been put out.  We are now entitled to hoist the Minister with his own petard. I do not think he could claim that there is any justification for the preening of feathers which he displayed in his opening statement.  I think the shoe is entirely on the other foot.  I know that in certain cases in the operation of the new scales the position of some people has been worsened. Blind pensioners were getting the statutory allowance of 10/-, plus the cash supplement of 2/6, plus the local authorities' allowance.  The interpretation which local authorities, in a great many cases, put on the new scale of payments was that they were no longer under obligation to subsidise these allowances.  I know cases of blind pensioners where the position has been worsened as a result of the failure of local authorities to provide the money which they were under the impression the State, under the new dispensation, was providing.</P>

      <P>A statement was made here by Deputy Commons, I think, that the first supplement was provided entirely by the State and that the second supplement was provided by the local authorities.  I think the second supplement of 2/6 in County <Col N="1685" /> Galway was provided by the State to the extent of 75 per cent.  In my area, a large number of old age pensioners had 10/- statutory pension, plus two half-crowns, making 15/-.  Now the maximum is 17/6, which is an improvement of 2/6.  What they ask in my area is why they are not getting 26/-a week, which was campaigned for, and why they are not getting the pension until they are 70.</P>

    <P>The big idea behind the setting up of the Department of Social Welfare, as I understand it, was that we were not going to confine our attention merely to the administration of these social services that have already been <Col N="1686" /> established, but that we were going to have wider vision in regard to social welfare.  I would ask the Minister to consider the various types of distress that occur for which there is no provision under any scheme I know of.  Take, for instance, the chronic invalid and the unfortunate child who comes into the world with an incurable disability.  I admit that they have the ordinary outdoor relief, but they have been taught to believe that there is a stigma attaching to it.  In any comprehensive scheme, there should be provision for that type of affliction.  Up and down the country, there are people who become chronic invalids and where the members of the family are good, thrifty, industrious workers it is hardly fair that chronic and incurable invalids should be left a burden for their entire lives on the industry of the family.  That is one type of case.  Then there is the defective child.  I think the scope of social welfare should range out even further.  Take the question of housing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I wanted to suggest that a social welfare scheme of so many medicine bottles, as it has been dubbed, was not the idea behind the scheme begun by the Minister's predecessor.  There was a far wider field to be covered and I wanted to say to the Minister that I feel he should get down to the charting of that wider field as soon as possible. The Minister might very easily have said to me: &ldquo;What have you in mind? It is very easy to let me out into the wilderness.  Cannot you give me some landmarks by which to go?&rdquo; That is really what I was at.  There are a great many cases of families where there are distress and affliction which are not covered by any of the schemes at present in operation.  Their number may not be very large in any parish but they stand out in relief because they are so obviously in need of attention. The average observer compares them with families that are not quite so badly off and who are provided for by various social welfare schemes.</P>
      <P>Whatever improvements the Minister can bring about will be most welcome in the poorer areas.  At present, there is a great need to supply some of the deficiencies created by the unfortunate effects of Coalition policy in various directions.  Employment has been curtailed and the need of the people for assistance is greater in my constituency than it was at any time since the ending of the economic war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am particularly worried about the inactivity of the Minister for the past 16 months, particularly in connection with many views that we held in common.  I remember on previous occasions attacking what is to my mind a wrong position in which an old farmer and his wife, on reaching the age of 70, find themselves unable to get the pension, although their property has been made over to their family who are the people who have earned the property, some of them having worked on that farm from the age of 14 to the age of 40 for no wages. In previous years, when we were a <Col N="1689" /> Government and the Minister was in opposition, he loudly applauded my viewpoint and supported it, and I expected that his first move when he attained the position where he could do things would be to change that condition of affairs.  Instead of that, the Minister has remained completely inactive in that matter and a very grave injustice is being done to a very large number of people who would be entitled to the old age pension.</P>
      <P>There is another anomaly that I would like the Minister to take into consideration. The ordinary labourer finds for practically the first 12 months after he reaches the age of 70 that he has to live on the wind.  The Minister, in his wisdom, has increased the income allowance to £52 a year.  That means that if that unfortunate man succeeded during the past 12 months in getting 17 weeks' work, he is automatically debarred from the old age pension for 12 months.  I would expect a Labour Minister, who has been in office for 16 long months, to consider those old colleagues of his, the people for whom he bled and sweated, and that he would do something in those 16 long months to remedy that condition of affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister spent 16 years here howling about the injustice of it and howling about the outrageous Minister who was allowing it to continue and I would expect that the moment he got the opportunity he would look after those for whom, as he often told us, his heart bled, the aged and infirm.  The Minister did not.  The Minister sat down there for the past 16 months and completely ignored those two sections of the community and left them there under the same rotten condition of affairs, according to himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

If the Minister continues his inactivity, very shortly we will have to cut the arms of that chair so that he can sit <Col N="1690" /> down and stand up.  He is getting too fat from laziness.  That is one of the first two points I want to bring to the Minister's notice and I hope that, having brought those inactivities to his notice now, he will remedy them.</P>
      <P>The Minister is a man who is very fond of telling other people what they should do, very fond of it entirely.  I happen to be the chairman of a board of assistance down in Cork.  Every month I receive a little notification from the Minister&mdash;a new form of the autocracy that is practised by, I might say, the three jolly pigeons, the Minister for Local Government, the Minister for Social.

If the Minister considers that those under his care&mdash;widows and orphans, those in receipt of unemployment assistance and all the rest of those categories&mdash;can continue to live, with the present largely increased cost of living, on what they were getting previously he is living in the sky or in the air.  Only a few weeks ago we had to increase the scale for the South Cork Board of Assistance by something between £7,000 and £10,000 a year owing&mdash;I was there as chairman and I did it&mdash;to the appeals of the Minister's colleagues on the grounds of the enormously increased cost of living on those people during the past 12 months.

      <P>I am making my case and if it is so good that it is getting under the hides of those opposite it is having a very good effect.  We find the present position to be that the people who have contributed every week out of their earnings to the little pension to which they are entitled at the end are now getting less than the people the Minister alluded to.  &ldquo;Cash benefits,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;would be provided on an adequate scale without reference to the poor law or to the test of pauperism prevalent to-day.&rdquo;  We find that the people who have to have recourse to the poor law and to the taint of pauperism are getting more than those who work hard, who pay out of their weekly earnings their contributions. These thrifty people now find themselves getting less by from 7/-to 10/- a week than those who are getting benefit, according to the Minister, under the taint of pauperism.  I <Col N="1694" /> am not prepared, as I said, as a member of a board of assistance or chairman of that board, to advise my committee to shoulder the responsibilities that belong to the Minister and to his Department.</P>

      <P>Keep the children quiet, then.  As I said at the start, I do not wish to delay the House and those are the few instances I have to give.  In my personal opinion this circularising of local authorities, this new dictatorship that has arisen under a new guise, should stop.  Officials are either officials of a local authority or not.  If they are officials of a local authority and, due to the action of the Government in increasing the cost of living so much, feel that they are entitled to increases in salary, the application for those increases in salary should be made to the local authority concerned, but the local authority under this democratic inter-Party Government is now completely ignored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we get is a letter down from the Minister telling us that in response to appeals from local authorities the Minister considers that a bonus of 12/- a week or an increase of salary for a 45-hour week, or something else of that description, should be given. If there is any justification or any case for increases of that description it should come from the officials to the local authority concerned.  As a member of, I take it, a democratic State, I wish to protest against this autocratic attitude of the Minister and I state here that I think it is time it stopped.  It will soon be a matter that local authorities should get out altogether <Col N="1695" /> and leave it to one official scratching another official up in Dublin with the Minister giving his blessing. I do not wish to delay the House further.  I have given as briefly as I could what I consider to be the condition of affairs.  I hope the Minister will get over his lazy ways and tell us what he is going to do in a not far-distant day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy forgets that a motion was down when we were in opposition and his Party marched through the lobbies to vote against the old age pensioners having anything.  I think the change of Government was worth while to give something to the people who were in need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost of living has been very much referred to.  The cost of living was increased on the old age pensioners who were given no increase in benefit by the then Government which the Deputy supported.  There was no thought by the Fianna Fáil Government of these old people.  I am very glad of the small increases that have been put into operation inside the last 16 months.  They have been welcomed by the old people and widows and orphans throughout my constituency and a great number of people who were getting nothing have claimed that they come into their scope.  I refer to the widows and old people who were debarred under the last Minister because they were not a certain age and had to go on the home assistance.  Men in rural areas to-day are not cut off from unemployment assistance.  Married men are still retained in the rural areas and that is one thing for which I thank the <Col N="1696" /> Minister.  If those people in rural areas could not find work from June to October they had to go to the relieving officer but now they are granted unemployment assistance and can remain on the exchange.  That is a relief to the ratepayers to a certain extent and in my own town the number of men who have to go to the home assistance officer are much less and they are no doubt grateful that this concession has been granted to men in rural areas.</P>
    <P>I am also glad to be at this side of the House when the pension books are handed to old age pensioners all over the State to go to the Post Office for 17/6 a week rather than that they should go, as they had to under the last Government, for 2/6 to the home assistance officer.  I think that is an improvement. When we took over and found the bills with which we were presented, such as that from Córas Iompair Eireann, when the Minister had to provide almost £500,000 to pay the employees last May, we recongnised the difficulty the State is in.  I would like fair criticism because it is healthy, but we have had unfair criticism from the people who were in the Government that persuaded the people for 16 years that they were doing everything for them.  The reason they were put out of office was their failure to do something for the plain people of this country who were in need.  When the White Paper is introduced I think the people on the far side will stop talking because I am sure it will be 100 per cent. better than anything that was done by the one Party Government that held office.  Now they are asking for impossibilities, but no matter what the Opposition say the people I represent, the plain working class people, the old age pensioners, the widows and orphans, are grateful for the little, small as it is, that has been done for them.  That is admitted by all sides.  We have an assurance that something will be done for those people and our policy to do something for the plain down and out people of Ireland went a very long way towards changing the Government. We put the one Party Government out of power because they had forgotten those people.  They played on them long enough with promises.  The talk <Col N="1697" /> of Deputy Corry, the Deputy from Galway and other Deputies is making no effect on the plain working man throughout the country.  It is only killing their own Party because the people ask why they did not do it and what they are talking about now when they were 16 years in office.</P>
    <P>That is really the position in the country.  We hear a lot of talk from the Fianna Fáil Deputies about unemployment to-day, but I remember, when I was on the Opposition Benches when Deputy de Valera was Taoiseach, that just shortly before he went out of office, at a time when there were 75,000 registered unemployed, he said in reply to me that there was work for the unemployed everywhere.</P>
    <P>Much has been said of emigration, but I would like to ask some of the Deputies who have been so eloquent on the matter whether they are satisfied that it is unemployed men from the labour exchanges who are emigrating.  Surely they must know that many of those now leaving the country are travelling by air, and nobody could ever accuse them of being men signing on at the labour exchanges. Many people with the best possible positions in the country have gone to live in America, Canada and Australia.  If they desire to do so it is surely their own business.</P>
    <P>During the emergency my busiest task was going around to Mount Street to try and get unfortunate unemployed men away to work in England, but if they were men from the rural areas or turf workers they could not get permission to travel because of Government regulations.  At the same time concessions were given to others, and some had only to join the army to get free passes to Goraghwood.  These people would not have been facilitated had they been going out of the country to do some honest work.  These are all things which should be borne in mind by Fianna Fáil Deputies when they are talking about emigration and spreading lying propaganda.  While all these things were happening under the previous Government not one individual member of the Fianna Fáil Party <Col N="1698" /> raised his voice in defence of the people.  Whether they were compelled by their leaders to remain silent on the subject I do not know.</P>
    <P>To-day we find them talking a lot about the numbers of people now unemployed in the housing industry and about the dropping of the turf scheme. Is it not a fact that had Fianna Fáil got back to power the turf production would have ceased anyhow because there would not have been room for the turf, stacks of which are still dumped in the Phoenix Park and at various points throughout the country?  I am really terribly surprised to hear Deputies, elected by the people, coming here and making statements which they know to be untrue.  I regret that any man should find it necessary to sign on at the labour exchanges and having done so myself I realise what a terrible position it is to be in and the miserable pittance which is given to a man for his existence.</P>
    <P>It is the duty of every Government to provide full employment for those able and willing to work.  It should too have been the duty of Fianna Fáil but in the light of the promises they made in 1932, not only to find work for those at home but to bring back the emigrants, we can see how poor their progress was.  It took 16 years to open the eyes of the people to the inability of Fianna Fáil to deal with the problem but during that time they held on to power by threatening the people with cancellation of old age pensions, unemployment assistance, and other services if they were defeated.  I heard a story of three people in the West living three miles from the post office who on the day following the change of Government debated as to whether their pensions would still be available.  They drew lots and when the man elected went to the post office and returned with his pension the others said: &ldquo;Well it shows us that the talk of the pensions being stopped was all rot.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>It purported to come from the Minister and when I put the question the Minister replied that no such circular had been sent out by his Department.  To do that was going a long way in false propaganda.  The Minister and his colleagues should see that there is no possibility of such things happening again.  Actions like that were damaging to the whole structure of the State.</P>
      <P>We have had a lot of crocodile tears from the Opposition about the poor of the country and the old age pensioners. They clamour for increased rates and pensions but when they were in Government they voted as a body against any increases.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will issue the White Paper on the social welfare scheme as soon as possible.  It is already very much overdue and the public is waiting anxiously for it.  I hope the pensions will be given at 65 and that the pensions will be brought up to the 26/- figure operating in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  We know that somebody must pay for these things and the workers in England and Northern Ireland are paying with 8/- a week for the social services but they look on it as money well spent.  I do not believe anyone would object to a few pence a week extra on their cards if they knew that it was going to benefit their fellow workers, old age pensioners and the sick and infirm.</P>

      <P>I was both amazed and amused by the speech delivered by Deputy O'Leary.  I was amazed to hear a Labour representative advocating emigration.  He gives as one of his reasons for doing so that we on this side stated that there was work in full and in plenty, when it was not available. The House and the country know the reason why we had emigration during <Col N="1700" /> the war.  No houses were being built because of lack of materials and factory production was held up for a similar reason.</P>

      <P>I was replying to Deputy O'Leary who talked about unemployment and emigration for 20 minutes.  I want to voice a protest against the insidious way this Vote was introduced.  It was a continuation of the dissemination of deception practised all over the country last year. The Minister at column 1320 of Volume 116 of the Dáil Debates said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The new maximum weekly pension for a widow without dependent children is, under the Act of last year, 14/- in the urban area where formerly it was as low as 7/6, and could not exceed 11/6.</P>

      <P>The Minister went on:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In the rural areas, the same pension is 10/- where formerly it was 8/-.  For a widow with ten children the maximum weekly pension is now 58/- in the urban area, where formerly the rate of pension was as low as 43/6 and could not exceed 52/-.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>What was the idea in the Minister's mind when he quoted these figures in that way?  Was it not in order to disseminate something that was not true; in other words, that his maximum was so much greater than the Fianna Fáil maximum?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy does not want to be consciously incorrect in this matter.  Under the Social Welfare Act of last year there were four separate areas: cities, large urban areas, places with town commissioners and rural areas.  I abolished these four areas and substituted two, and the comparison I made was a comparison of maximum rates to-day with maximum rates before that happened, and the reason why a phrase like &ldquo;was 8/-and could not exceed so much&rdquo; occurs is that I have now telescoped four areas into two.  That is the only reason these two figures are used.  The Deputy represents a Kilkenny constituency. Will he tell me what a widow who lived four miles from Kilkenny City had before 1st January last and what she <Col N="1702" /> has to-day?  Is that not a fair test? If the Deputy has not got the figures. I will get them for him and give him a chance of reading them.</P>

Prior to the advent of the Coalition Government there still were two classes&mdash;those regarded as living in rural and in urban areas, the qualifying factor for an urban area being the population.  That was where the supplementary allowances were being given, so it does not make any material difference whether or not you change them from four to two, in so far as these supplementary allowances were being given.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Cosgrave)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves of the Sugar (Prohibition of Import) Order, 1949.</P>
      <P>The Sugar (Control of Import) Act, 1936, empowers the Government to prohibit, by Order, the importation of sugar except under licence.  Import licences may be granted to the sugar company only.  The first prohibition Order on the importation of sugar was made in May, 1936, and since that time the importation of sugar has been regulated by an annual prohibition Order.  The current prohibition Order, which is the 14th Order of the series, prohibits the importation of sugar during the period from the 1st May, 1949, to the 30th April, 1950.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 3 of the Sugar (Control of Import) Act, 1936, provides that every <Col N="1704" /> prohibition Order shall cease to have effect at the expiration of six months from the date thereof unless the Order has been approved by resoultion of the Oireachtas, passed before the expiration of the said six months.  The current Order was made on the 22nd April, 1949, and consequently it will require to be confirmed not later than the 21st October next.</P>
    <P>In normal times, when sugar is freely available in the world markets, it is necessary to restrict imports in the interests of the local sugar factories. The annual demand for sugar is at the rate of approximately 100,000 tons a year and the local factories have been able to supply about 80 per cent. of this figure.  It is necessary, therefore, in the ordinary way to import about 20,000 tons of sugar per annum.  This is imported by the sugar company.  That enables the imported and the home-produced sugar to be sold at a uniform price.  During the emergency, there was a world-wide shortage of sugar, and, consequently, a prohibition on the imports of sugar during that period was not necessary.  Nevertheless, it was considered advisable to maintain the prohibition on the import of sugar throughout the war and only allow it in under licence.</P>
    <P>There is an exemption from the prohibition in the case of sugar not exceeding 14 lbs. in weight which is intended for the personal use of the importer or of his household and samples of sugar. The quantities which it was possible to import during the war years were limited.  In the last two years, 1947 and 1948, there has been a substantial improvement. Last year, 40,000 tons were imported.  The total consumption last year was 101,768 tons which was the highest consumption since 1941, and which is little short of the annual consumption between the years 1938 and 1941.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">

      <P>And that, in consequence, there is no real importer of sugar in this country except one, and that concern imports sugar to the extent of 40,000 tons per annum at a cost of about £1,520,000.  Is it true that a considerable profit is being made upon that imported sugar?  Is it true that a profit is being made on the import of that sugar which is not shown in the accounts of this company, and that that profit, by what has been described in this House as an irregularity, is being conveyed somewhat surreptitiously to the Exchequer, so that, in fact, the people of this country are paying a concealed tax upon this sugar?  The normal ration, I suppose, for every man, woman and child for sugar is about 26 lbs. per year.  The import of 8,960,000 lbs. of sugar per annum would be more than sufficient to provide a ration for 300,000 persons if we exclude children and sugar used for commercial purposes. We find that the production of home-produced sugar would probably more than supply the ration.  We may assume, therefore, that as everybody takes his sugar, the home-produced <Col N="1706" /> sugar is sold at the ration price, and that the imported sugar is sold at a price which, I am told, considerably exceeds the price of the rationed sugar.  People in this country who find that their existing ration of eight ounces of sugar is insufficient and who require to supplement it, purchase this 40,000 tons of imported sugar, which, I am told, is sold to the ordinary consumers at a price considerably in excess of the price of home-produced sugar.  But only the price of the home-produced sugar is taken into consideration in computing the cost-of-living index&mdash;only the cost of the home-produced sugar on the basis that no one consumes more than eight ounces of sugar per week is brought into the calculation, and any person who finds it necessary to supplement his sugar ration by buying imported sugar in order to enable him to perform, say, heavy manual work, has to pay through the nose.  In this way the people of this country are being misled.  Perhaps that is an exaggeration.  I think the people of this country are too intelligent to be misled by this trick, but, undoubtedly, an attempt is being made by the Government, by this and similar devices, to fake the cost-of-living index.</P>
      <P>We have been hearing <i>ad nauseam</i> that the cost of living has fallen.  Well, the official cost-of-living index contradicts that assertion.  The cost of living has not fallen, even having regard to the way in which the cost-of-living index is being fraudulently or deceptively manipulated by excluding from the items which make up the cost of living articles such as this imported sugar, which many people, let me repeat, find it necessary to buy and which is sold to them at a price far exceeding that at which the cost of sugar is taken for the purpose of computing the cost-of-living index.  In this way an attempt is being made deliberately to deceive the people of this country.  I do not think it is succeeding because, after all, the people do not live upon figures; they live upon commodities which they have to pay for when they go to the grocer, and they know what they have to pay for tea outside the tea ration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well, Sir.  I think it cannot be gainsaid that there are two classes of sugar being sold in this country, native sugar which, as I have indicated, on a rough computation practically supplies the ration now allotted to each family and is being sold to them at a cheap price, and the imported sugar which, I am told, costs considerably more and with which we are concerned in this prohibition Order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have tried to indicate to the House, with the meagre information which the Parliamentary Secretary was able to supply me, how this reacts upon the cost of living of the ordinary people and how, because of that reaction, the cost-of-living index cannot be taken as in any way a reliable indicator of the true cost of living. But there is something more than that involved in this Order.  Under the last Government a determined and, I should say, on the whole, successful attempt, was made to expand and develop those industries which use sugar as a raw material.  When the <Col N="1708" /> last Government took office the sugar confectionery trade was in a very poor way indeed.  One or two minor chocolate-making concerns were being hit savagely by outside competition which, if not encouraged by the Cumann na nGaedheal Government, was at least connived at by them under the guise of what they called selective protection. When Fianna Fáil took office one of the first things it did was to protect the Irish market for the makers of Irish sugar confectionery and, in consequence of that, not only were the existing concerns maintained in production, but new manufacturing concerns were established here and over the years these new concerns justified themselves in the public view. Of course, when they were first established the usual attempt was made by the then Opposition&mdash;the present Government&mdash;to vilify the manufacturers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well, then, you say I must not refer to the past.  Let me refer to the present.  Let me say that these concerns, which were established in the way I have indicated at the end of the war, found that there was a great opportunity for them to develop an export trade.  We have been hearing a lot from members of the Government recently about the desirability of expanding our exports. We are told we have an adverse balance with sterling.  We are told it is necessary for us to try to earn dollars by exporting products.  Let us see how this Government, of which these Ministers are the spokesmen, try to encourage the export trade in sugar confectionery.  Every manufacturer of sugar has to buy his raw material at a price which covers not merely the cost of the raw material as imported here, as processed here and as distributed to the industry&mdash;and, I presume, at a price which earns a profit for the sugar <Col N="1709" /> company in processing it&mdash;but also at a price which yields, I am told, something like £700,000 annually to the Exchequer.  The competitors of the Irish sugar confectionery manufacturers have their raw materials which are used by them in manufacturing goods for export subsidised.  Our native manufacturers have to buy their raw materials at a price which yields indirectly to the Exchequer a profit of several hundreds of thousands of pounds.</P>
      <P>Now, mark what would happen if this position were dealt with in a straightforward, honest way and if the taxes were openly imposed.  The customs and excise law provides that where duties are levied upon the raw materials of an industry and subsequently those processed materials are exported the manufacturers get a drawback equivalent to the amount of duty imposed and collected on the raw material in the first instance.  If this tax were levied in a straightforward way the manufacturers of sugar confectionery would be entitled to such a drawback and they would consequently be able to compete in the external markets in a much more favourable position than they can to-day, handicapped as they are by the excessive price which they are compelled to pay for their raw material.  But, of course, if they did that the Exchequer would not be able to collect the surreptitious revenue which I have described.  The relevancy of that to this prohibition is that under the prohibition Order there is only one processor and one distributor of imported sugar in this country and it is from that processor and that distributor that these several hundreds of thousands of pounds are collected.  If it were not for this prohibition Order that could not be done.  The Minister for Finance would be compelled to come into the open, if he wanted to get the several hundreds of thousands of pounds of additional revenue for the Exchequer, and tell the people that he proposed to levy a tax at a rate which would yield him the total amount of money he required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question has been raised, and I think it may soon be raised in the courts, as to whether in fact the present <Col N="1710" /> proceeding is not invalid and irregular.  Of course the Minister for Finance is, I suppose, relying on the fact that if any person happens to go counter to him or if any person happens to win a case against him in the courts or before a tribunal, or appeals to a court or a tribunal against him, that person does so at his own expense and at his own risk.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that there was a very heavy subsidy on sugar.  This subsidy lay heavily on all sections of the community.  It was necessary in order to make sugar available at the controlled price.  To offset that subsidy and, at the same time, ensure that those who were entitled to <Col N="1712" /> cheap sugar would get it, the increased sugar at the higher price was made available.  There is still available to all consumers the ration of sugar at the lower price of 4d. per lb.  That is available to everyone.  Over and above that sugar is available at 7½d. per lb.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacEntee seemed concerned about the fact that this is an imposition on those who use sugar for confectionery. He referred to the difficulties which these people encounter.  He referred in particular to the fact that by reason of the higher price for sugar they were not able to compete successfully either here or abroad.  He omitted to mention that in the last year of the Fianna Fáil Government sweets and jam amounting to over £1,000,000 in value were imported here at a time when their import became such an embarrassment that a number of confectioners and sweet manufacturers, particularly the smaller ones, were put out of business.  Not only that, but the jam became such an embarrassment to those who had it that if facilities had not been provided for its export the jam would have walked out of the premises.  That was the situation which faced this Government and they had to find a remedy for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should say that amongst those who were most seriously affected were a number of ex-Army men who, after having entered the business of manufacturing confectioners, could not find a market for their sweets.  That situation no longer exists.  There is now no danger to home manufacturers from imports of that character.  As I said at the outset we propose to continue this Order which enables the sugar company only to import sugar.  It is necessary in order to protect home manufacturers that this Order should be available.  While imports vary over a number of years, the imports of sugar have remained fairly constant.  Last year home production of sugar was exceptionally high.  It amounted to 83,000 tons as against 64,000 the previous year. It fluctuates considerably as between one year and another.  The highest production arose I think in 1941 when it reached 95,000.  It dropped in 1942 to 49,000 tons.  It is necessary in order to protect the sugar beet industry that <Col N="1713" /> we should restrict imports of sugar and it is for that reason that I move that the Order be confirmed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The annual consumption of sugar in pre-war years was anything from 107,000 to 112,000 tons. It dropped during the war.</P>

    <Title>Committee on Finance. - Local Authorities (Works) Bill, 1949&mdash;Fifth Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill as it now stands. &mdash;the Parliamentary Secretary can correct <Col N="1715" /> me if my calculation is wrong&mdash; contains 199 lines.  As introduced it contained 110 lines.  It has a completely altered look, since it first appeared in this House.  As a matter of fact, if its own father saw it in its new look, he would not recognise it.  As introduced, this Bill gave the Minister power to appoint persons other than local authorities to go in on anybody's land at any time without notice, to trample over that land, to throw spoil anywhere and give no compensation.  As it now stands, thanks to the work of Deputy MacEntee and the other Opposition Deputies who assisted him, this Bill now provides that the Minister cannot send in any person he likes to nominate, that it is only the local authority can do that.  It provides that the farmer must get reasonable notice and that he can get full compensation from the ordinary competent courts of jurisdiction and there is a special arbitration arrangement for dealing with claims for damage which are more than the local court could normally adjudicate upon.  In face of the change that has been made in this Bill, how could the Parliamentary Secretary yesterday complain that the Opposition had put down too many amendments to this Bill?  Why should he use words which enables the <i>Irish Times</i> to-day to have a display caption: &ldquo;Opposition blamed for impeding Bill&rdquo;?  Who impeded this Bill?  It was first submitted to this Dáil on the 23rd February and it is now the 1st July.  The Bill was debated in the Dáil for a very short time.  It got every facility from the Opposition and they had to do what the Government did not do.  That is, they had to examine the Bill, to examine the problem that was supposed to be dealt with, to introduce amendments and to write into the Bill safeguards for citizens that should have been in the Bill as introduced if the Government had been thinking of how to deal expeditiously and fairly with the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister yesterday said, according to this caption in the <i>Irish Times,</i> that the Opposition were trying to block the Bill.  In making that allegation yesterday, the Minister had no <Col N="1716" /> basis for it.  If there is anybody to blame for the Final Stage of this Bill being taken on 1st July, it is the Government. The Government spoke about the Bill on the 23rd February.  I grant you they were in a very great hurry on that date to state that they were going to do something about the relief of unemployment.  When the First Stage was taken on 23rd March, there was a great fuss made about getting it through quickly.  It was not our fault that it was not got through quickly.  In the time at its disposal and the opportunities which it got, the Opposition did introduce and get the Government to accept, I am glad to say, certain amendments which give some protection to citizens who might otherwise be adversely affected by the proposals introduced.  We failed to have certain clauses inserted which would have provided additional safeguards.  I must not discuss those now.</P>
    <P>I want to appeal to the Minister however, to give a pledge on this Fifth Stage that he will take steps to ensure that wherever a major drainage is undertaken it will only be proceeded with after consultation with the one drainage authority we have, the one body of experts we have in the Board of Works.  The Minister has power to do that.  Before work can be undertaken for which the Minister is to give a grant the particulars of that drainage scheme have to be sent to the Department of Local Government.  It is a simple matter to consult the Board of Works about such drainage projects. It will be a safeguard to people living on the lower reaches of a river that they will not be flooded out if the Minister will see that the Board of Works are consulted as to whether the main river basin is in a fit state to take additional water.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true.  I do not want to discuss that particular amendment. I am glad to see that the Minister and those associated with him did accept a number of other amendments which now appear in the Bill and which lessen the dangers which were in the Bill as originally introduced. Even though he did not accept other amendments, I hope that in the operation of the Bill the Minister will do his utmost to carry out the spirit of the amendments, which were purely designed to see that damage would not be done unnecessarily to a number of people who have no means of defence against the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Aiken that the Bill has been altered considerably since it was first introduced. It is a tribute to the Dáil as a whole that we can discuss a measure. that amendments can be suggested from all sides of the House, and that the Parliamentary Secretary in charge of the Bill and the Minister, who will have the responsibility of administering it, have listened to the arguments and, as far as possible, have endeavoured to meet the views of the Dáil.  That is something for which we should all be grateful.  As a Parliament, we all should be proud that we have in our own way contributed to the production of the best possible measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From this side of the House there was a certain impatience to get the Bill on to the Statute Book so that work would be provided for people who are now looking for employment; that work which would be a benefit to the country as a whole would be done. In our enthusiasm to have the Bill placed on the Statute Book, I admit that there was a certain amount of impatience with the attitude of the Opposition.  Probably we were wrong in that, because if we are to maintain Parliamentary democracy there must be the right for every individual in Parliament to press as strongly and as <Col N="1718" /> hard as he can such amendments as he thinks will improve or better a Bill. It has been stated that the Bill has been held up by the Opposition.  Having said what I have said in favour of the line taken by the Opposition, I think that everybody outside this House, as well as inside it, will agree that the Bill has been held up unnecessarily by the Opposition.  For instance, last night we reached the Fifth Stage. Everything we could do as a Parliament in regard to the Bill has been done and the usual procedure is to accept the Fifth Stage.</P>

I hope that we will be able to get through this stage to-day and send the Bill to the Seanad for their consideration and that it will be law by this time next week.  The unfortunate point is that, if this Bill had been law two months ago, a considerable number of people could have been employed in the last two months.

      <P>Deputy Cowan is breast high for most measures that will deny to the owner of private property his legitimate rights.  We on the other side stand diametrically opposed to that point of view.  We do not think that the State should be omnipotent, we do not believe that the local authority should be given dictatorial powers.  We believe that the State and the local authority exist for the individual citizen, that the individual citizen has rights in regard to private property which he owns and that those rights should not be interfered with.  The task of the Opposition in relation to this Bill has been raised by Deputy Cowan, and by the Minister for Local Government yesterday, and it is right to put it on record that here in this Dáil the Opposition was fighting the battle of the farmers of Ireland, and particularly the small farmers of Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill was introduced on the 23rd March.  The Second Stage was ordered for the 31st March, but the Bill was not circulated to Deputies until the 29th March, and when the debate opened on the Second Stage there were Deputies who rose to say that the text addressed to them in the ordinary course of post had not reached them before they left their homes that morning.  Therefore, this House was expected by Deputy Cowan and members of the Government to discuss legislative proposals which had not been seen by many of its members. <Col N="1720" /> While we may not be enthusiasts like Deputy Cowan where private property is to be trespassed upon, we were not elected here to be enthusiasts.  We were elected by our people to form a deliberative Assembly; we were sent here as prudent, thinking, far-seeing men, to deliberate together and to discuss with each other proposals which might make for the betterment of our people.  We could not do that if we were to accept every proposal which comes from the Government as something coming down like the tablets of the law from heaven; and accept the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government as another Moses.  That is not how we can improve measures as this measure has been improved.  Nobody will deny that.  I do not think that the Bill as it stands is even a good Bill, but it is a better Bill now than the measure when it was first introduced.  How has that improvement been secured?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was saying that the debate on the Second Reading opened on the 31st March.  An attempt was made then by the late Minister for Local Government to steamroll this measure through the House.  We were told that all stages were expected on that day&mdash;of a Bill which had only been in the hands of some members for not two days and had not reached the hands of many members at all.  The Opposition refused to discard its proper function, which is that of being critical of proposals which are sent here.  We have a duty as an Opposition to look after primarily the interests of plain ordinary citizens.  When the Government proposes to take over to itself, or to confer powers upon any corporative authority, it is our duty to examine those proposals and see how the rights of the ordinary individual are going to be affected.  We stood on that principle and, disabled and all as we were by the short time given to us to consider the measure, we did at any rate elicit from the Minister, even before the conclusion of the Second Stage, an undertaking to consider some of the objections we had expressed, some of the disadvantages and dangers of the Bill, to see if he could remedy those disadvantages and remove those <Col N="1721" /> dangers.  It took us&mdash;let us make no mistake about it, because the concession was not willingly given&mdash;three days of prolonged and careful discussion to secure that concession from the Government.</P>
    <P>After the debate on the Second Stage had concluded, the Committee Stage was ordered provisionally for Wednesday, 20th April last.  The Dáil did not sit, however, until Wednesday, 27th April, and then the tragic and regrettable death of the late Minister for Local Government intervened and, quite naturally and reasonably&mdash;none of us could make any complaint about the delay&mdash;the Committee Stage, which had been originally fixed for the 20th April, was not taken until Wednesday, 1st June.  The Opposition had no responsibility for the delay which took place between the 6th April and the 1st June and I certainly would be the last to suggest that the Government had any responsibility for that either.  The hand of Providence intervened in a manner which we must all regret and we simply had to shape our purposes to its decrees.  However, the Committee Stage commenced on the 1st June.  There were, I think, some 45 or 46 amendments put down to this Bill on Committee Stage. They were amendments which were put down in all earnestness and in all seriousness.  They were amendments which were put down with several purposes, the first one being to protect the ordinary private property owner in this country, to secure him against an unjustified invasion of his property. Others of the amendments were put down to ensure that if works were carried out by a local authority under this Bill those works would be properly co-ordinated with major works which the Central Government was carrying out through the agency of the Office of Public Works or through some other instrument such as Bord na Móna or the Electricity Supply Board.</P>
    <P>It has been pointed out in the Drainage Commission Report and in more recent reports, the report dealing with the agricultural conditions in this country, that a great deal of damage can be done if the natural flow of water is interfered with, that <Col N="1722" /> drainage works, instead of being a blessing, can very often be a bane, and that the only way to ensure that they will do no harm and some good is to fit them into a preconceived and adequate design.  Several of the amendments which were rejected had that purpose in view.  I do not want to discuss the merits of them.  I am merely stating the purpose.</P>
    <P>Another purpose which we had in mind was this: it is quite clear and, unfortunately, it still remains the case that under sub-section (3) of Section 2 of the Bill, opportunities for, as the Americans say, dipping into the porter barrel, present themselves, opportunities for using, as I said last night, public moneys for the benefit of private individuals.  We endeavoured by some of our amendments to preclude so far as it was practicable to do so the misuse of the powers which the local authorities are given under sub-section (3) of Section 2 of the Bill in that way.</P>
    <P>Now, what was their objection in principle in amendments having one or other of these purposes?  Is there anything to object to in trying to ensure that a man's land will be safeguarded against unjustifiable trespass? Is there anything unjustifiable in endeavouring to ensure that if works are carried out under this Bill they will be co-ordinated in such a way that they will yield some benefit and will not result in some disadvantage or damage?  Is there anything to be ashamed of or anything to apologise for in trying to ensure that legislation passed by this House will not be abused in such a way that, as I have said, private individuals may reap a private profit out of public expense?</P>
    <P>These were the purposes which our amendments were designed to secure. The Parliamentary Secretary accepted, in what I must candidly say was a grudging, meagre and insufficient way, the principle of some of these amendments. He rejected others.  Why he rejected them is to me incomprehensible, except that, perhaps, no good can come out of Nazareth, that he believes that and that, accordingly, there could be no merit in any proposal submitted in this House by the Opposition. I suppose we owe the fact that <Col N="1723" /> he has accepted some of them to this, that the criticisms which we were making of this Bill made many of his followers uneasy in their minds as to the consequences of them; that a certain amount of pressure was brought to bear on him to hearken to what we were saying and to be guided by a spirit of common sense and to accept in, as I have said, a meagre and insufficient way, the principle of some of our amendments.  In so far as he has accepted them, I suppose we should be grateful to him for it, but let us be clear about it that not one of these amendments would have appeared in this Bill if the Government and the Government Parties had had their way when the Second Stage of the Bill was opened in this House on the 31st March last; not one single one.  The question of compensation would remain in the same unsatisfactory way as it was when this Bill was first introduced. The sole resort that a person claiming that his land had been damaged would have had would be the District Court with all the limitations imposed by law upon the District Court in relation to torts, and I think this would have been a tort.</P>
    <P>Fortunately, and again let us give credit where credit is due, when this matter was discussed on the Committee Stage or on the Second Reading, I think both Deputy Timoney and Deputy Cowan felt that Section 5 of the Bill, as originally drafted, was a very imperfect section and they joined their voices with ours in asking the Parliamentary Secretary to reconsider it.  As a result of that, we have now, as Deputy Aiken has reminded the House, a section in relation to compensation which has been considerably amended and, to the extent to which it has been amended, considerably improved.  I do not think it still goes far enough in that regard but, in any event, we are grateful to the Deputies and to the Parliamentary Secretary for the concessions which have been given. Now a person who claims that the damage to his land or property exceeds £20 can have the damage on that issue determined by arbitration under the <Col N="1724" /> Acquisition of Land Acts and I think that is highly satisfactory.</P>
    <P>Much more satisfactory, however, from the point of view of the fundamental principle, is the amendment which has been made in regard to Section 4.  When this Bill was first put before the House we had a great many lawyers, not Deputy Cowan nor Deputy Timoney, on the other side claiming that one of its merits was that the purposes had been tersely and succinctly expressed.  I concede that in regard to Section 4 of this Bill, as originally introduced, because it provided:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A local authority or person executing works pursuant to this Act or an Order made thereunder or any officer, servant or agent of such authority or person, may enter on any land for the purposes of the execution of the works.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The succeeding sub-section of the section provided:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A person who obstructs or interferes with the exercise of the power conferred by sub-section (1) of this section shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding £10.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Very tersely and very succinctly expressed.  There was no right of appeal.  There was no provision, first of all, that notice should be given to the person who owned the land that entry was going to be made on the land.  There was no right of appeal to any quarter to restrain a local authority from entering on that land, even if the owner of the land believed that grave and irreparable damage might be done to his property.</P>

      <P>First, we have a local authority &ldquo;executing works pursuant to this Act or an Order or agreement made thereunder, or any officer, servant or agent of such authority...&rdquo; The person who now enters the land must be a person who enters it as a servant or agent of such authority and only a local authority, acting through their servants or agents, may enter on the land.  That is a considerable improvement, I think, over the measure as first introduced.  It was an improvement which was secured as a result of many debates in this House, as my colleague, Deputy Aiken, reminds us.  It was not an improvement which was spontaneously given.  It was an improvement which was extorted and exacted.  It was not an improvement which was announced when the Bill was first introduced.  So that, at any rate, in so far as it is an improvement, the people of this country, and particularly the landowners of this country &mdash;and ultimately, I am sure, it will be found to be the workers of this country&mdash;have a right to be grateful to those who succeeded in having that section of the measure redrafted until it now appears in the Bill in its present form.</P>
      <P>What next is in this Bill?  In this particular Section 4 of the Bill, dealing with the right of entry, we read:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Before entering on land under this section for a purpose other than the execution of urgent works, a local authority executing works pursuant to this Act or an Order or agreement made thereunder, shall either obtain the consent (in the case of occupied land) of the occupier, or (in the case of unoccupied land) of the owner or shall give not less than 14 days' notice in writing of the intention to make such entry.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that the House&mdash;those who have been talking about the alleged obstructive attitude of the Opposition, and the Minister for Local Government who alleged that we were impeding the passage of the Bill&mdash;will note what we have secured and wrung from him very unwillingly, because the discussion of this measure need not have <Col N="1726" /> occupied the time it did take if the Government had been willing to consider criticism reasonably.  We are now, as I have said, in the position that a local authority must either obtain the consent of a person before it enters his land or shall give not less than 14 days' notice in writing of the intention to make such entry. There was nothing about consent in this Bill as originally drafted.  There was nothing about giving notice in this Bill as originally drafted.  As I have said, the admission of the principle that a man has the right to be forewarned before his house or his land is entered upon had to be exacted from this Government.  It is because they refused to give it willingly that so much time of the Dáil was occupied in the discussion of the Bill.  Sub-section (3) of Section 4 lays down the procedure by which notice shall be given.  I do not think it is necessary to spend any time on it beyond saying once again that provisions of that sort did not appear in this Bill when it was originally submitted to the House.</P>
    <P>Then, what I think is perhaps&mdash;next to the fact that notice must be given of entry&mdash;the most important concession that the intelligent criticism of the Opposition succeeded in securing appears in sub-sections (4) and (5) of Section 4.  What are they?  I doubt whether any of those people who have been critical of the Opposition's attempt to secure justice and protection for the landowners of this country have read these sub-sections.  Sub-section (4) of Section 4 provides:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Any person to whom a notice of intention to enter on land has been given under this section may, not later than 14 days after the giving of such notice, apply to the justice of the District Court having jurisdiction in the district in which such land is situate, on notice to the local authority by whom or on whose behalf such notice was given, for an order prohibiting the said entry on such land, and, upon the hearing of such application, such justice may, if he so thinks proper, either wholly prohibit such entry on such land or specify conditions to be observed by the person making such entry.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1727" /> Is there any member of a Government Party who represents a rural constituency who says that the Government was not justified in writing into this Bill, after it had been introduced and at the instance of the Opposition, a provision of that sort?  Does Deputy O'Higgins&mdash;I forget which is the rural Deputy, but I know that Deputy Seán Collins represents West Cork.  Does Deputy Seán Collins contend that it is a bad thing that a farmer who has been given notice that his land is about to be entered should have the right to go to the District Court and ask the district justice to determine whether the entry could be rightfully and properly made or whether the proposed entry should be prohibited?  I think if Deputy Seán Collins were to take a plebiscite of the farmers of West Cork on that he would secure a majority very much larger than the majority the Government secured recently in that constituency in favour of the proposal Fianna Fail has succeeded in persuading the Minister for Local Government to accept in relation to this Bill.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (5) is, of course, consequential upon sub-section (4).  It merely provides that once the District Court has prohibited entry under sub-section (4) it will not be lawful for anybody to contravene that prohibition and enter upon the land.  There is what is in sub-section (4); there is the addition that has been put into the section by reason of the examination given to the measure by the Opposition.</P>
    <P>Then we come to Section 3 as it now stands and I think that even now it is a very objectionable section.  I concede that it is, perhaps, an improvement on the section as originally introduced, but to whom is such improvement due, to what is such improvement due?  It is due to the Opposition, to the stand which the Opposition took, and the persistence with which the Opposition, despite all the attempts of the Government to misrepresent its view, pointed out that Section 3 as it originally stood in the Bill gave the Minister virtually dictatorial powers.  I agree that he has, <Col N="1728" /> to some extent, fettered his hands and, to that extent, it is an improvement. On the other hand, I think that when he introduced an entirely new principle into the section, a principle of his own conceiving, he has practically nullified the good which he has done by accepting in part our point of view by the ill which he has done by giving effect to his own ideas in relation to this matter.</P>
    <P>I do not want to weary the House any further on this Bill.  It will pass in this House and go elsewhere.  I hope when it goes elsewhere and is discussed in another House it will be approached by the Government with a more open mind, that it will be considered by the Government with a mind more ready and more receptive to helpful suggestions than was manifested by the Government here.  Before it leaves I should say that we have no objection to enabling local authorities to carry out the works which they are empowered to carry out here.  I made that clear in my speech on the Second Reading of the Bill and I quote column 2159, Volume 114:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am not for a moment going to deny that it would be useful to give power to the local authorities to do some of the things that are embodied in this Bill.  It would be very desirable that they should be able to make drains in certain circumstances. It would be very desirable that they should be able to remove substances causing obstructions in water-courses. For instance, as the Minister has said, the accretion of loose stones which often chokes the eyes of bridges and causes flooding is not a very desirable thing.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>However, as I said, this Bill went far beyond that.  It gave to local authorities, and I am afraid it still gives to them, arbitrary power to go into any man's land and do any of the things they think are reasonable or necessary. The attitude of the Opposition with regard to this Bill was motivated&mdash; it is not a nice word but I cannot think of another at the moment&mdash;by the desire to improve the Bill.  We have no objection to local authorities being given power to carry out any of <Col N="1729" /> the works mentioned in the Bill, but what we did object to was the fact that local authorities were being given these powers without concomitant safeguards being provided for the rights of private individuals.  It was the trespass on their rights we objected to, and it was to prevent that trespass we objected to the Bill.  It is some consolation to us that we succeeded in securing amendments, not very far-reaching amendments, but amendments of some substance which will make it more difficult for local authorities to dismiss the rights of private individuals when they think works should be carried out for their own benefit or for the benefit of an individual.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government (Mr. Corish)</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all I would like to say at this stage that I welcome the conversion of Deputy MacEntee to the idea of this Bill at all, because anybody who listened to him on the Second Reading, or who read his Second Reading speech, would get the impression that he was totally opposed to it. He talks about pressure being brought to bear on me to accept certain amendments, but I think it is more obvious that pressure was brought to bear on Deputy MacEntee by members of his own Party.  When he opposed it on the Second Reading there was a noticeable murmur around him and there was a notable change when the Second Reading was resumed; practically every member of his Party who spoke condemned the attitude of Deputy MacEntee and welcomed and lauded the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been certain criticism here about obstruction and delay in having this measure brought before the Dáil. I think it is a happy thing that Deputy MacEntee came to the rescue of his companion, Deputy Aiken.  Deputy Aiken could not give any reason why there was delay, but I am glad that Deputy MacEntee has the good sense or the courtesy to admit that there were certain circumstances since the Second Reading which prevented the taking of the Bill in Committee.  I would like to point out to the House and to Deputy Aiken, as he forgot to mention the fact, that there was the <Col N="1730" /> Easter Recess, the Budget and certain financial resolutions which had to be taken.  As far as the Government is concerned, I do not think anybody can allege that there was any unreasonable delay.  Again I want to stress, although I do not want to slap anybody on the other side, that there were unusual circumstances inasmuch as the Minister who introduced this measure did not have the opportunity of piloting its other stages through Dail Eireann. So far as obstruction is concerned, I do not think anybody on the opposite side of the House can accuse me of alleging obstruction against the members of the Fianna Fail Party.  I refrained from doing so because, personally, I did not want to allege obstruction and provide further opportunities for still more obstruction. However, last night, Deputy MacEntee went out of his way to obstruct the passage of this Bill.  He spoke for 35 minutes on the deletion of Section 3 and the insertion of a new Section 3.  Afterwards, when consequential amendments were being discussed he welcomed that particular section and nearly went so far as to say that he had been instrumental in having this particular section included in the Bill. I might say with respect that both Deputy MacEntee and Deputy Aiken displayed ignorance of the case because neither of them had read subsequent amendments about compensation.  Even here to-day Deputy Aiken suggested that Section 3 meant that the local authority, on whose behalf a person was nominated by the Minister to carry out works, would not be liable for compensation. There was such a provision in the original Bill and I think it is unfair for Deputy Aiken to allege that there was no such provision for compensation even in respect of Section 3. I do not know why Deputy MacEntee has taken up the attitude he has.  He has been in an argumentative and contrary mood ever since he began to talk about this Bill.  He wants one thing and then again he does not want it.  If he gets it he is not satisfied and if he does not get it he is again not satisfied.</P>
    <P>I am not one of those who think that all the ideas are on one side of the House.  I take a poor view of any assembly that is not prepared to concede <Col N="1731" /> a point to the other side and to accept an amendment as I did last night.  I remember when Deputy MacEntee was on this side of the House he sat resolutely through debates and refused at all times to accept any amendment, no matter how reasonable it was, from the Opposition. He talks about the rights of individuals and safeguarding the individuals, but my experience in this House was that there was very little consideration for the individuals when Fianna Fail gave taxi drivers and bus conductors the right to remove from vehicles any person whom they considered to be suffering from a disease.</P>
    <P>I suggest that in this Bill the local authorities have, and always had, sufficient regard for the rights of the individuals and their interests.  The debate on this Bill has always been charged with suspicion on the part of the Fianna Fáil Party towards local authorities.  One would imagine that they are totalitarian bodies or dictators. I have no hesitation in saying that some of the protections and safeguards included in the Bill are unnecessary, and if we had accepted even 25 per cent. of the amendments suggested by the Opposition this Bill would be totally unworkable and you would have no local authority availing itself of the power which they have to execute certain works under this particular Bill.  We had amendments running to the extent of one and a half pages and it was almost suggested that the colour and thickness of the paper on which applicants should make their claims for compensation should be laid down.  Deputy MacEntee tried to make the point that the original Bill was 110 lines and it was now 199.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <P>It was Deputy Aiken who made the point.  I think that difference is easily explained especially when you consider that it takes 30 lines to lay down a procedure to be adopted in serving 14 days' notice.  That would take a big slice out of the difference <Col N="1732" /> between 110 and 199 lines.  Deputy MacEntee talked about the effect on farmers and landowners for whom this Bill is intended to do good.  This Bill is intended to secure the co-operation of the farmers, landowners and local authorities in the protection of lands against flooding and to protect the property of the local authority which is the ratepayers' property against the things mentioned in the Long Title of the Bill.  Too much time has been taken up already on this Fifth Stage and I feel sure that none of the back benchers behind Deputy MacEntee will be willing to vote against the measure.</P>

      <P>When speaking before the adjournment of the debate, I was saying that Fianna Fail had done something for the poor and necessitous people of the country.  I tried to point out that increases had been given in old age pensions, even before the Coalition Government was formed. During the elections we heard from the Labour people about the great necessity for the abolition of the means test, and during the year the Minister introduced a Bill extending the amount of means from £39 5s. 0d. to £52.  When he was interfering with it at all, I wonder why he did not go further, or how far he did go, in making up his mind to increase the amount by 33 per cent. Having regard to the value of the £1 now and its value when old age pensions were instituted in 1909, when agricultural wages were only 9/- per week, why did he not take these matters into consideration?  Agricultural wages have gone up by 700 per cent. but the amount in respect of means has been increased by only 33 per cent.</P>

      <P>I do object to it, certainly. If £39 5s. 0d. was the amount in respect of which a pension was payable in 1909, surely it should have been increased to the same extent as wages have increased since.  The man in receipt of a pension in 1909 would not qualify for a pension in 1949, viewing it from the angle of the means test alone.  A sum of £39 5s. 0d. was the amount laid down then and there has been a change of only one-third in 40 years.</P>

      <P>Nevertheless, he should restrain himself.  I want to say to Deputy Walsh that that would require legislation and a Deputy cannot advocate legislation on an Estimate.  To raise it from £39 5s. 0d. to £52, the Minister had to get legislation, and to increase it further would require further legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely trying to point out how surprised I am that the Minister, who was so concerned about these people, did not take that into consideration when introducing his Bill. Under the Act of last year, it was the poorer sections of the old age pensioners who were victimised.  These people who were not in receipt of a supplementary allowance got an increase of 5/- per week, whereas the people entitled to a supplementary allowance, particularly in the urban areas where they were getting up to 15/- per week, got a halfcrown.  The people in receipt of 10/- got the full increase of 7/6.</P>
      <P>I have from time to time come across a position which I have brought to the Minister's notice with regard to the payment of national health insurance benefits.  It is the law, I understand, that a recipient of benefit is not paid for the first five days of his illness.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Because it is happening wholesale.  Returning to the question of old age pensions, the Minister said that he was going to give £3 per week, 26/- per week and various other sums to the old age pensioners.  He finally decided on 17/6, and, in giving that amount, I take it that he regards it as an amount on which the old age pensioner could live.  It was never the idea of Fianna Fáil that the old age pension was sufficient to enable an old person to live.  It was meant as a help towards providing him with the necessaries of life and nothing else.  The Minister, however, when out on the hustings, made promises in this connection, and, now that he is in office. I wonder why he does not fulfil the promises he made on that occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter to which I want to draw his attention is the method adopted by the investigation officers of assessing the income of small farmers living on very poor land.  I do not know if there is a special scale laid down for these people who make these investigations&mdash;I take it there is&mdash;but I should like to know what qualifications they have, apart from whatever scale may be laid down.  In the constituency I come from, a cow may have a greater value in one district than in another, because, by reason of the poorness of the land, she will not produce as much <Col N="1736" /> milk in one district as she would produce in another, but, at the same time, it is on the number of cows which the farm can carry and the number of acres of corn a farmer has that his income is assessed.  I wonder if these people are fully qualified to give a true assessment of a small farmer's income.  I have come across small farmers living on farms up to 15 acres who are in very much poorer circumstances than agricultural workers, but, when they apply for a pension, the size of the farm, the number of cows it is supposed to be able to carry and the value of an acre of corn, if they have an acre of corn, are taken into account.  The result is that, in most cases, they are refused pensions.  The Minister may not think this to be so, but it is a fact that at the moment it is harder for a small farmer to qualify for a pension than it was under Fianna Fáil.  I should like to remind those Deputies who stated that Fianna Fáil did nothing for the old age pensioners that, in the period when our Party was in office, the expenditure on old age pensions went up from £2,500,000 to £5,000,000.  In view of that, I wonder how can the Deputies opposite say that we did nothing for the old age pensioners.  Certainly, Fianna Fáil did a lot for the old age pensioners.  One of the first things it did was to restore the cut of 1/- in the old age pensions which the Fine Gael Party had made.</P>

I wonder would the Deputies opposite be surprised to learn that there were <Col N="1737" /> 69,000 people in receipt of pensions or allowances under the widows' and orphans' scheme before the present Government came into office?  There were 35,000 widows and 34,000 children in receipt of benefit.  The scheme introduced by the present Minister for Social Welfare was not the first attempt to look after those people. They were well looked after by Fianna Fáil during the previous 12 or 14 years. The amount of money that was spent on these schemes in 1944 was £867,000. In addition, we had supplementary schemes under which free food, free milk and free boots were provided.  All that was done by Fianna Fáil.  Therefore no one can say that Fianna Fáil was not mindful of the needs of the people.</P>

      <P>All that we can do now is to look forward to the White Paper which was promised 12 or 16 months ago, and hope that it will cover a number of the points which, apparently, were forgotten when last year's scheme was introduced.  If the Minister does that he may get some credit from people down the country.  There has been a lot of talk in the House about this Department, but the Minister and his colleagues will have to go very far until they will be reminded by people about all the services that they were told they were to get before this Government came into office and which they have not got.  I hope that the Minister will consider these things when introducing his promised White Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one small matter to which I desire to draw the attention of the Minister.  I understand that a person insured under the National Health Insurance Act will not receive benefit if his stamped cards are not returned in due time.  I suppose that is natural enough in a certain way, but yet it constitutes a very severe hardship on the average worker.  Take the case of a man in permanent employment. He believes that he is insured against illness since he has handed in his card to his employer. When he becomes ill, he believes that he is entitled to benefit but then finds that, through some error on the part of his employer, his insurance card was not handed in.  In consequence, the worker is deprived of the benefit to which he is legally entitled.  He has the right, of course, to institute proceedings against his employer for the recovery of the amount due to him. That seems to me to be an inadequate way of dealing with the situation.  I think that, if a worker complies with the law by handing his card to his employer and making his weekly contribution, he is entitled to full benefit under the law, and that if any action is to be taken against an employer it should be taken either by the Minister's <Col N="1739" /> Department or the National Health Insurance Society.  The onus for doing so should not fall on the employee, because everyone will agree that the ordinary worker is hardly in a position to institute proceedings against his employer.  Rather than do so, he probably would prefer to suffer the loss, particularly if he has recovered his health.  I wonder if the Minister could do anything to remedy that injustice without introducing legislation?</P>
      <P>I do not intend to deal very much with the Minister's Estimate.  In many ways, one would be rather inclined to refrain from discussing it at all as it would seem to be almost <i>sub judice</i> at the moment.  I do want, however, to express a certain amount of disagreement with a view which I heard expressed by Deputy Cowan to-day. He suggested that an unemployed worker is entitled to the same benefit as a person who is in employment. Now, while I hold that an unemployed worker should get the maximum assistance that can be provided for him, I think that the man who is in employment is entitled to a little more.  I think everyone will agree that a man who is working will require a little more to enable him to get nourishment to sustain him, to replace worn out clothes and so on, than the person who is idle.  It is the duty of the State&mdash; and I think it is well that Deputies on every side of the House now acknowledge it-to provide for the unemployed, but there is a more important duty, and that is as far as possible to prevent unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think in the statistics that are available there is a good deal of misrepresentation of the position.  There are on the unemployment register a considerable number of people who are not suitable for employment that may be available.  For example, there are people who are not in the best physical condition.  There are people suffering from various nervous troubles who should be assisted in some way other than being put on the unemployment register.  Then there are women with dependent children and I do not know <Col N="1740" /> how they can be regarded as unemployed. From the point of view of the children, they are entitled to State assistance, but they are not in a position to take up employment.  I think a definite segregation should be made of people who are in a position to take up employment immediately. Those people should be put in a definite classification.  That would be helpful to the Department.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to deal in detail with old age pensions, but there is one thing that struck me with reference to the administration of the Old Age Pensions Acts.  There is a marked difference in one district as against another as regards the manner in which the means of an applicant are arrived at.  In one district a small farmer with a certain valuation and income can obtain an old age pension, while in an adjoining district a man with the same valuation and income will be debarred by another pensions officer.  It may be due to a difference of outlook on the part of the social welfare officers, but I think something might be done to ensure uniformity, because the present system makes for a wide feeling of discontent.  One old person is denied the pension and he sees other individuals in similar circumstances receiving pensions.</P>
    <P>At some period the Minister will have to find a better way of dealing with very small farmers than by the methods employed now.  Some valuation limit would probably be better than having officers trying to find out how many hens are on the farm, and if they are laying, how many cows or calves are there and to what member of the family they belong.  All these things create immeasurable and almost insurmountable difficulties for the social welfare officers.  A simple test with regard to poor law valuation and the amount of cash available might be more reasonable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to certain aspects of the policy of the Department of Social Welfare which, it would seem to me, more especially in recent times, have caused a certain amount of hardship among the unemployed. The unemployed, in the course <Col N="1741" /> of their applications for unemployment assistance, have to undergo a somewhat strict examination in order that it may be determined whether or not they satisfy the conditions necessary for the granting of assistance.  One of the statutory conditions requires the applicant to be genuinely seeking suitable employment.  On this question, I should like the Minister to tell us exactly what he regards as suitable employment.  I would like him to indicate what the words really mean. Will a person's place of residence and family circumstances be taken into consideration when considering whether employment is suitable or not?</P>
      <P>Seemingly, it is not enough that our people should be unemployed, but they have to be examined very strictly in many cases before they become entitled to assistance.  Apparently, being treated harshly is not enough from the point of view of the Government, but we have Ministers publicly declaring that our unemployed are work shirkers. I hardly think that is fair to them and, on behalf of the unemployed in my own constituency, I take exception to those statements.  I think it is known to the Minister and to other members of this House that the inhabitants of the counties along the western seaboard are among the best workers to be found in any place in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent times unemployed men in my constituency were offered work on the Erne scheme at Ballyshannon. They refused to take that work and their unemployment assistance was stopped.  I believe that the work at Ballyshannon is not suitable for labourers living 60 or 70 miles away, as many of them are in the north of my constituency.  Would not place of residence and family circumstances exempt a man 60 or 70 miles away from the job?  Would not a person in such circumstances be justified in not wanting to take that work?  As well as that are the conditions on that job such that the man who would take work there would be in a position to keep himself and to send money to his dependents at home?  I say that he would not be able to do so.  In support of that, I might mention that at our county council meeting on Tuesday last, <Col N="1742" /> a motion was passed unanimously asking that an investigation be made by our county medical officer of health into the insanitary condition of the camps in which the men are housed at Ballyshannon.  Lest there be any thought that the proposer of the motion had any political object in view, I may say that he is a supporter of the present Government, being one of our Fine Gael councillors.  In support of his claim that the conditions are not good at Ballyshannon and are not suitable for men who would have to travel long distances to work there, he gave us some enlightening facts and I will give them briefly to the House as I heard them from him.</P>

If there is any doubt in his case it is referred to the Court of Referees.  The Court of Referees does not consist of the Minister.

      <P>In case there may be any doubt in the mind of the Minister or in the mind of any Deputy on the Government Benches with regard to what I have to say as to the suitability of the work being offered on the Erne scheme I shall give the House the facts as set out by a Fine Gael councillor at a council meeting recently.  He stated that the conditions prevailing in the camps were insanitary because of the fact that no sanitary accommodation whatsoever is available in the huts in which the men are housed.  He further pointed out that when the men returned from the 12 o'clock midnight shift about a week ago they were refused supper.  That is hardly the way in which to treat men who have been working until midnight.  We have been told furthermore that the wages for the labourers on this particular job&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has no responsibility as to wages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think&mdash;possibly I may be wrong&mdash;that it is relevant from the point of view that the wages paid are not sufficient to keep a man in camp and at the same time permit him to send something home for his dependents. The figure of £4 8s. 0d. per week was mentioned.  My information <Col N="1745" /> is that for many weeks, with the exception of the past few weeks during which good weather has prevailed, the average wage was £3 per week, not £4 Ss. Od. as alleged.  Out of that £3 per week 33/- goes towards the man's accommodation.  Does the Minister, or any member of the Government, believe that a man who is living away from home will have anything to send to his dependents out of a balance of 27/-.  I do not think the Minister for Social Welfare will say that he believes that that can be done.  I am sure no other Deputy believes it either.</P>
      <P>There was another point brought out also at this council meeting.  In Ballyshannon, a town adjacent to the Erne scheme, there are 200 labourers unemployed.  When they presented themselves to the manager of the works at the Erne their cards were given back to them stamped &ldquo;No work available&rdquo;. At the same time I know that in my own area, 60 and 70 miles from the Erne works, we had cases where men's unemployment assistance was stopped because they refused to take work on the Erne scheme.  I gather now that work did not exist.  Is this some kind of racket with the object of cutting out unemployment assistance altogether and at the same time leading the people to believe that it is being paid? If that is so, does the Minister for Social Welfare condone that proceeding? If he is not aware of the position the sooner he investigates it the better.  We want the facts.  We want to know whether or not work is available.  Is it only available for men from a distance and not available for men in the locality?  If there is work there why not give it to the local men? Why give it to the men who have to come long distances and to whom it is not profitable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely, it is not the Minister's object to stop unemployment assistance. If it is the object of the Government, then the Government should have the courage of its convictions and it should tell the House that it intends to stop the payment of unemployment assistance.  Why try to cod the people into believing that unemployment assistance is being paid when, in fact, it is not?  I have given the facts.  Those facts were publicly <Col N="1746" /> stated at a council meeting by a Fine Gael county councillor.  I want to quote now from a leading article in the <i>Donegal Democrat</i> of Friday 24th June, 1949, lest there should be any doubt in anybody's mind that this is something introduced here with the purpose of causing a bit of a rumpus. That is not the object.  The leading article says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Judging by the many letters which we have received during the past few weeks relating to the question of employment on the Erne scheme a stage would appear to have been reached when the responsible Government Minister, who has labelled a not inconsiderable number of Irish workers as lazy men, should consider holding a full-dress inquiry into the position.&rdquo;</P>

I am only quoting a comment in a leading article which brings in a letter from a worker on the Erne scheme, which also appears in that paper and which I intend to read as showing the unsuitability of the work on the Erne scheme.  The article goes on to state:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;However far from the truth allegations of discrimination and bad conditions may-be, it has become clear that all is not well, not alone so far as the Erne scheme is concerned, but in regard to most Government sponsored undertakings including the turf development scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the letters which have reached us this week on the subject we selected one for publication because it shows in concrete form why it is that all men are not eager to leave their homes, unpretentious and humble as they may be, for work on public schemes, where in the special <Col N="1747" /> circumstances the remuneration is no more than a pittance.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>With your permission, I shall read the letter to which I have already referred. This letter also appears in the <i>Donegal Democrat</i> of the 24th June, 1949, and is headed &ldquo;Letter from ex-Erne scheme workers&rdquo;.  It states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Relative to statements by Mr. Morrissey regarding conditions on the Erne hydro-electric scheme, I wish to put the following facts on record.</P>
    <P>As a married man with a family to support, I sought employment on the scheme ten weeks ago.  Owing to the inadequate remuneration caused by small rate of pay and wet time, I found it impossible to support my family in anything like ordinary comfort. Example: Total wages for seven weeks average £2 14s. 5d., which represents shift work.  As regards Irishmen refusing work on the Erne scheme, I would like to point out that I asked Mr. Burke for a transfer to a job with more overtime on it, but was refused.  Owing to domestic reasons, I was compelled to go home for a week and when I came back I saw Mr. Gannon who, in ignorance of the fact that I had previously worked on the scheme, engaged me as a labourer.  The reason I saw Mr. Gannon was because I thought I would get more overtime with his men.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These are, I take it, some of the foremen on the job.  The letter goes on:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;However, it was necessary that the starting card would be O.K.'d by Mr. Burke, which he refused to do&mdash; as he wished to send me back to the work I previously was at When I pointed out to him it was overtime I wanted, he said it was no use arguing and refused to start me at all. The only alternative left to me was to see Mr. Vahey, personnel officer, who, when I explained my domestic position, very generously gave me work with the Electricity Supply Board.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>No, but men in my area who were asked to go there and work under these conditions and who refused to do so, have been cut off.  I want to know if the Minister will agree that an offer of work such as is described in that letter, in the editorial and in the statements of the councillor at our council meeting last Tuesday, is sufficient justification for cutting men off from unemployment assistance.  I would ask the Minister to consider the statements which I have quoted.  They were made in all good faith, they are supported by my own findings and by the statements of a member of the county council who supported the Government and supports them still.  I should like the Minister to look into the matter and to find out for himself just what the conditions are on this scheme because men who have refused to work under these conditions are cut off from unemployment assistance.  I would ask him not to tolerate the hardships which have been created due to this offer of work on the Erne scheme.  I should also like him to look into the matter to see if it is true that 200 men are unemployed in Ballyshannon town adjacent to the Erne scheme and that they have been refused work on the scheme. Seeing that they have been refused work, why should he cut off men from my area because they would not take work which apparently does not exist?</P>

      <P>I do not intend to detain the House very long with the remarks which I have to make on this Estimate. I listened with a good deal of amazement and a certain amount of amusement to the speech delivered by Deputy Dr. Ryan on this Estimate last week. Were it not that I have a very long <Col N="1749" /> experience of the mentality of the man who made the statement, I could hardly recognise him as the same Dr. Ryan who at one time occupied the position of Minister for Social Welfare. He accused the members of this group of having forgotten the promises they made during the last general election campaign in reference to social security and other matters.  He seemed to overlook for the purpose of his argument the fact that when this Government was established, it issued on coming into office, a ten-point programme upon which the Government proposed to act.  One of the principal points in that ten-point programme was that they intended during their period of office to draft and put into operation a scheme of social security.  The Deputy now knows, if he did not know at the time he was speaking, what the position is in regard to that whole matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to know from Deputy Dr. Ryan or any front bench speaker of Fianna Fáil before the debate concludes what they would have done if they had remained in office until now or what kind of social security scheme Deputy Dr. Ryan would have put into effect.  It would be interesting to hear from the various Fianna Fáil spokesmen what they would have done and when it would have been done, because there seems to be a good deal of mystery surrounding the whole policy of Fianna Fáil in connection with this matter.  If I wanted any indication of what was in the minds of the Fianna Fáil Party when they were in office or what they would be likely to do had they remained in office, I would read up, as I may say I have read up and listen attentively to, the statements made on his matter in October, 1947, only three months before the general election.  We then had a discussion in this House upon a very modest motion calling for a modification of the means test.  That was opposed by Deputy Ryan on behalf of the Government although he indicated that the approximate cost of putting into operation a slight improvement in the social services would only cost between £500,000 and £750,000.  The excuse given by Deputy Dr. Ryan on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Government speaking on <Col N="1750" /> that matter on the 15th October, 1947, was that the country could not afford that modest sum for the purpose of improving, in the interests of old age pensioners, blind pensioners and widows and orphans, the small allowance paid at that time.  If the attitude adopted by Deputy Dr. Ryan when he was Minister for Social Welfare was any indication of the amount that would be set aside at a later stage by the Fianna Fáil Government had they remained in office, the old age pensioners, the blind pensioners and the widows and orphans need not have expected to get anything like what they have got under the Act of 1948.  They could not afford between £500,000 and £750,000 but, since it came into office, this Government has made provision for increased allowances to the type of persons I have mentioned amounting approximately to £3,000,000 per year.  As I say, I hope it is not too late even now, before the contents of the White Paper are disclosed, for the leaders of Fianna Fáil to disclose what they would have done if they had been in office or how much money they would be willing to set aside for this particular purpose. I am not sure whether the scheme which they intended to put into operation would be on an insurance basis, whether it would be a compulsory contributory scheme to which the State, the employer and the worker would subscribe.</P>
    <P>For a good many years I have advocated in this House and outside a compulsory insurance scheme, because I have come across too many cases where married men with dependents, when passing out of this world, left nothing even to bury them, not alone something to maintain their widows and orphans.  It must be a terrible thing for any Christian-minded citizen to be given timely notice of leaving this world and to be lying in bed feeling that he is leaving the world with no provision having been made during his lifetime for those he is leaving after him.  I have no hesitation in advocating a compulsory social security scheme on an insurance basis whereby every wage-earner of every class, male and female, would be made to contribute to provide for those who would <Col N="1751" /> be left after them.  This is not the first time I have indicated my views in this House and outside.</P>
    <P>I wonder whether these were the lines on which Deputy Dr. Ryan and his colleagues would have gone if they had been allowed to remain in office and at some time brought in a social security scheme or so-called social security scheme.  If the amount they were thinking of is anything like the sum they were quibbling about on the occasion I have referred to, they would not have done any more than has been done in the scheme brought in by the present Minister in 1948.</P>
    <P>I want to draw attention to another matter and I hope I am in order in doing so.  I take it it is the duty of the Minister as head of the Department and as a Minister who has collective responsibility to make provision to ensure that, as far as it can possibly be done, work is provided for every class of unemployed citizen, whether registered or otherwise.</P>

Some attempt should be made by the Department of Social Welfare or the Department of Industry and Commerce to make certain that when works, either locally essential or nationally necessary, are being put into operation, this out-of-date method of only providing money where there is a sufficient number of registered unemployed in the area will be done away with and that wherever the Government find that essential works can be carried out the necessary money will be provided from the central funds and an attempt made to secure the necessary number of persons to carry out the work, not only from the register of unemployed in the area, but from all available unemployed persons.</P>

      <P>I also want to ask the Minister what is the position of his Department in relation to the conditions of persons employed as labour exchange managers or assistant managers?  On a number of occasions the Minister, as well as other colleagues of his, advocated some better provision for such persons.  I know the Minister has been in touch with the organisation claiming to represent the views of managers or assistant managers of labour exchanges and I hope he will indicate at an early date some change in the existing rotten conditions of persons employed in this form of activity.  I should be glad to hear from him if anything is likely to be done during the coming year in that respect.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made by other Deputies to decisions of Courts of Referees where genuine applicants for unemployment assistance have been turned down and in regard to which&mdash; I am not sure if I am right in this&mdash; the Minister is not willing to reverse the decisions of the chairman or members of the court.</P>

      <P>The Minister can take other steps to see that if, in his opinion, cases have been dealt with unfairly in the past, they will be dealt with more fairly in the future.  I came across a case recently which I reported to the Department and in which I am not satisfied with the decision of the Department where a blacksmith who applied for unemployment insurance benefit was turned down by the Court of Referees because, in the opinion of the court, he had not taken suitable alternative employment.  Does any Deputy, regardless of what side of the House he sits on, think that suitable <Col N="1753" /> alternative employment for a blacksmith would be labourer's work on a drainage scheme?  I do not think so. I think a decision of that kind should be reviewed.  I shall not take up the time of the House in quoting the details of other cases.  I think it is unfair, however, that a blacksmith who had been working at his trade for the best part of his lifetime should be refused unemployment insurance benefit on the ground that he refused to take suitable alternative employment, that employment being labourer's work on a drainage scheme far away from his place of residence.  If the Minister can secure power for the purpose of reviewing cases of that kind in which he considers the decisions to be unfair, I would be glad if he would look into them in the future.</P>

      <P>This Estimate has been discussed over a long period and the discussion has been on a rather widespread scale.  Deputy Dr. Ryan opened the debate on the Estimate for the Opposition Party in the House and it was quite clear that this year, as last year, he took the general line of trying to write down as far as he could the achievements of the Department during the past year as well as doing his best to create in the mind of anybody listening to him doubts as to the progressive policy which the Department would adopt during the ensuing year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Ryan, reeking with sympathy, passionately desired that this, that and the other thing be done. He was obviously suffering from amnesia, as he forgot to tell the House that, four months before the last general election&mdash;that is, in October, 1947&mdash;when a modest motion was introduced here to modify the means test, he himself, who was then Minister for Social Welfare, whose heart allegedly bleeds to-day with passionate solicitude for those affected by the means test, on that occasion, on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Government, said that the Government could not, and would not, find the £500,000 necessary to meet the claim contained in the motion.  Yet the Deputy, who was responsible on that occasion for expressing the Government's point of view, and who declined <Col N="1754" /> to accept the motion asking for a modest modification of the means test, has the hardihood, 16 months after his Government has left office at the request of the Irish people, to tell the House that he is now thoroughly in favour of a modification of the means test.  Some people might call that a change of mind and others might call it hypocrisy.  I think I would be on the side of those who describe it as hypocrisy and I think most intelligent people would do so, too.</P>
    <P>What is the use of mouthing about what you would have done if you were in office, or what you would do if you were put back, when you did not do those things when in office?  What is the use of pretending to be sympathetic about a modification of the means test, pretending you are anxious to secure it, if, having had 16 years in office, you declined to modify the means test in any way?  The means test stood there all the time Fianna Fáil was in office. They had 16 years in which to abolish it or modify it but, notwithstanding that, all the folk organised in the Fianna Fáil Party are now bursting with enthusiasm to modify it.  Would it be unfair to say that Fianna Fáil would make a marvellous Government if it were kept always in opposition, as it is only when in opposition it shows or pretends to show sympathy? When it is in office, many of the things which it advocated in opposition it deliberately decides not to do&mdash;as it deliberately decided not to modify the means test, four months before the general election.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Deputy Dr. Ryan on having inoculated himself against two disabilities.  He is certainly not suffering from any introspection and he is not in any way embarrassed by any sense of modesty as to the achievements of himself and his Government in the realm of social welfare.  His whole line has been to try to write down what was done in the Social Welfare Act last year.  That was the tuning note for every speaker from the benches opposite.  That was the war-cry.  Fianna Fáil Deputies came in armed with statistics, which had been fed to them like fodder, to try to write down the Social Welfare Act. Some of them could not even understand the statistics they got.  One notable personality in that respect was Deputy Walsh of Kilkenny, who could not read even the simple figures.  He thought that, as a result of the Social Welfare Act last year, the people got less benefit than they had previously. I advised him to read the Act.  I think he said he had read it, and I gave him further advice, to get someone else to read it and explain it to him.  What are the facts?  In rural areas of County Kilkenny, prior to the introduction of the Act, the maximum amount of pension under the noncontributory scheme for a widow with six children was 22/6 per week.  As a result of the Act, that person is now getting 38/- a week.  Is it not a substantial improvement, within 11 months, to have the pension stepped up from 22/6 to 38/- a week?  That is what is happening in the rural areas of County Kilkenny, and Deputy Derrig <Col N="1756" /> knows it perfectly well.  I know it must be embarrassing not to be able to explain why this Government has the money to do that, when it was pleaded so often that the previous Government was unable to do it.  That is very embarrassing to Deputies Walsh and Derrig.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not embarrassing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, the Deputy is showing no great enthusiasm.  Poor Deputy Walsh read the figures upside down, or they slipped about on whatever page he was reading, as we got a pitiful exhibition of his inability to understand them.  I tried to help him. However, I have written that into the records now, so that Deputy Walsh and his constituents may understand what they have got.  I do not believe the people in County Kilkenny are as dull as that.  I imagine that any widow who goes to any post office in County Kilkenny, since this Act was passed last year, and gets 38/-, knows the difference between that and 22/6.</P>
      <P>Deputy Walsh may think she cannot count and that a simple-minded person would misunderstand figures as he does; but I have no doubt in the world that such a widow is not concerned with Deputy Walsh's propaganda and when she holds 38/- in silver in her hand, which she gets from the inter-Party Government, she knows that it is heavier than the 22/6 which she got from the Fianna Fáil Government.  So long as she is left with a sense of touch and a sense of weight, she will not be deceived by these mendacious figures of Deputy Walsh, who himself is not suffering from any excess of brilliance in the matter of explaining.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Ryan, of course, wanted to know about the White Paper.  The White Paper is Deputy Ryan's ghost&mdash; and no wonder, it ought to be&mdash;and so are many other things.  I have told the House that the Government already has the White Paper and I am going to tell the House this as well, that when the Fianna Fáil Party left office in February of last year, decisions had not been taken on a whole variety of matters on which decisions must be taken before anybody could attempt to produce a White Paper.  If anyone <Col N="1757" /> wants to look at the official files of the Department, let a committee of this House be set up and let it examine the official files, and there will be seen there on record correspondence which clearly indicates that, when the electorate last spoke, decisions had not been taken on important matters which could not be ignored if they were to be incorporated in a comprehensive social insurance scheme.  Officials of my Department worked hard on the social welfare scheme of last year.  The very fact that they worked hard all the year is clear evidence that decisions had not been taken and that information had not been sifted.  At all events, as a result of my association with the White Paper and this Government's association with it, it is now a better White Paper than it would have been, and substantial improvements were effected even over and above the suggestions for an earlier draft White Paper, as a result of my association with that particular scheme.  However, we will come to the question of the scheme at a later stage, when the House and the country will have an opportunity of reading a very informative document.  When it comes to be considered, I do not suppose that we can assume that it will be considered independent of the Party feeling which has manifested itself so clearly in the discussion on this Estimate, this year in particular.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Ryan or somebody else said that in respect of the reciprocal arrangements some early efforts had been made to effect the arrangements. I want to say that I think the manner in which the whole question of reciprocal arrangements was handled in respect of unemployment insurance benefits constituted a colossal blunder. During the war we sent tens of thousands of Irishmen to work in the bombdrenched areas of Britain&mdash;Britain was badly in need of Irish workers at the time.  We allowed these Irish workers to go.  We gave them certificates to go. We facilitated their going.  We facilitated examination as to their suitability to go.  They went to Britain and we never made a deal with the British Government whereby they would give these men credit in an Irish unemployment insurance fund for unemployment <Col N="1758" /> benefit purposes if and when they came back to Ireland.  Men went to Britain in 1939 and 1940 and they stayed there for five, six, seven, eight, nine and ten years.  Over nine years about 90,000 of them came back and not a single one of the 90,000 has got one farthing credit from the British Government in respect of the unemployment insurance stamps which he put on his card when he was in Britain.</P>
    <P>I want to know what serious effort was made to try to recover for these workers during the period of the war, credit for the stamps which they were compelled to put on their cards in Britain.  The British said they must comply with their Acts, they must put on the stamps.  A condition existed in Britain in which they would never need to draw a farthing there.  The British knew in fact, that they would only need the benefits when they returned to Ireland and were awaiting re-employment here.  They forced Irish workers to put stamps on their cards.  Circumstances existed in Britain in which they could not get benefit and they refused to refund one farthing to be placed to the credit of Irish workers when they returned, having rendered to Britain all the services which they did render during the war years.  Deputy Dr. Ryan has the hardihood to talk about initiating reciprocal arrangements.  I know of no more colossal blunder than was committed in the gross mismanagement of that question.</P>
    <P>No Minister would lower his dignity to go to talk to a British Minister about it.  No Minister would bother to leave Dublin to go and see that tens of thousands of Irish workers got some credit for the stamps they put on their cards during the war years, and the position is that when we took office not a single farthing had been placed to the credit of any of these Irish workers who worked in Britain during the war years.  If I were Deputy Dr. Ryan, I would try to envelop myself in secrecy about reciprocal arrangements, having regard to the grossly incompetent manner in which that matter was handled and the appalling losses which were suffered by Irish workers because nobody was prepared vigorously and vigilantly to enter the battle on their side. <Col N="1759" /> A situation was created in which a couple of hundred thousand of our workers went to Britain and subscribed to build up the British unemployment insurance fund and that during the war years, when we had a bargaining power with Britain and when we might have got something from Britain in respect of Irish workers&mdash;it did not mean much to Britain; it was a trifling sum&mdash;in fact, no effective steps were taken to recover for the Irish workers the credits which they had in the British unemployment insurance fund and which were not then or since retransferred to an Irish fund.  The past is gone but I still think we must try to make a fight to get from the British what is morally due here.</P>
    <P>The whole position has been queered by the manner in which it has been handled.  Some people ought to come down off their perches.  It would not have offended their dignity if they had discussed the matter with the British at the time when they had bargaining power with the British.  Instead of that, their sense of face and their artificial sense of dignity would not allow them to enter into discussions with the British on the matter on a face to face basis.  Apparently, our nationality would not stand the test of discussing with British Ministers during the war period the rights to unemployment insurance benefits of Irish workers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Ryan talked about the decision to set up the Department of Social Welfare.  It was advocated in this House on many occasions, particularly advocated by the Labour Party and, indeed, it was a pretty long and painstaking task to convince the last Government that it was desirable but, as a result of constant pressure and constant agitation, they were forced to recognise the fact that a separate Department of Social Welfare and a separate Department of Health were necessary if the dead hand was to be taken off the spheres of activity concerning health and social welfare. But, everybody knew that there would be no progress in these fields so long as the Cæsarlike rule of the Custom House continued and the Cæsars in the <Col N="1760" /> Custom House were then compelled to shed some of their dominion over these Departments and two separate Departments were set up.</P>
    <P>Quite obviously, the function of the Department of Social Welfare was to co-ordinate the existing services which were then administered by separate Departments, to bring them all together and ultimately to weave them into a comprehensive whole.  That has been done.  It has been done by integrating the staffs of the different sections into one, in the first instance, to get a unified type of administration.  It will be done to a greater extent by weaving our existing unco-ordinated social welfare schemes into a broad pattern of social security which might be described colloquially by the phrase &ldquo;a comprehensive insurance scheme&rdquo;. That will be done and it is being done.  So far as I am concerned, no effort will be spared to ensure that the pattern of our social services in the future will be the best we can provide for the toiling people of this country&mdash;subject, of course, all the time to the overriding consideration of what it is possible for the nation to pay and do justice to those who rendered service to it. During the past 12 months and during the next 12 months, energy without stint has been and will be put into the task of improving these social services. So far as I am concerned, my personal attitude in the matter is that I will not be satisfied with our social services until I am satisfied that they are the best the nation can afford.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Ryan may seek, if he likes, to write down what has been done&mdash;to try to minimise what has been attempted.  Let me say this to Deputy Dr. Ryan.  He is not a good judge of what has been done or of what ought to be done.  His period in the Department of Social Welfare from what I discovered there, was a bleak and a fruitless one.  I say to him now and to every other Deputy in this House to compare 1947 with 1948 in the matter of the achievements in the sphere of social welfare and then nobody will deny, so far as those affected by schemes are concerned, that they were better off in 1948 than they were in 1947.  Fianna Fáil may pretend now to people that, <Col N="1761" /> all the time, it had a hankering after doing these things.  It is not terribly easy to convince the people that you can have a hankering for 16 years and yet all the time display such an iron discipline over yourself that you would resist the hankering.  &ldquo;Fianna Fáil was bursting to abolish the means test. Fianna Fáil was bursting to give people higher rates of benefit.&rdquo;  There was no impediment during the past 16 years in the matter of doing it.  If it was not done one can only conclude the obvious &mdash;that Fianna Fáil did not want to do it.  Now it is in the dilemma of not being able to explain why it did not do it and why money has since been found to do these things for which Fianna Fáil could not discover the money when they were in office.</P>
    <P>A number of questions have been raised on various matters in connection with this Estimate.  I should like to deal with a few of them so as to give the House a picture of the position. Deputy Beegan, I think, got himself worried over the emigration commission, as he called it.  His leader. Deputy Lemass, similarly evinced a rather excited interest in the activities of that commission&mdash;to such an extent that he could not refrain from reflecting insultingly on the members who are trying to serve the nation on that commission. I do not suppose Deputy Beegan knows all the secrets of the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to assure the Minister, through the Chair, that I did not intend any reflection whatsoever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with that and I give the Deputy the credit that when he came to deal with the commission he did not follow the bad and unmannerly example of his leader.  This is not merely a commission on emigration.  It is a commission on emigration and on other population problems.  The terms of reference to the commission asked it to investigate the causes and consequences of the present level and trend in population in Ireland; to examine, in particular, the social and economic effects of birth, death, migration and marriage rates at present and their probable course in the near future; to consider what <Col N="1762" /> measures, if any, should be taken in the national interest to influence the future trend in population; and generally, to consider the desirability of formulating a national population policy.  We have got no population policy to-day.  Nobody knows what is happening in the social and economic sphere in respect of these matters which have been referred to this commission.  We have never had a population policy and we have not got one to-day.  This commission has been set up to advise the Government on the causes and consequences of the present level and trend in population.  I think every Deputy in the House ought to be glad that it is possible to select high-minded men and women to apply themselves at no cost to the nation to such a highly technical job as that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course not.  I would not insult these people by reducing the thing to the level of an auction or a bargain.  They have gladly put at my disposal the talents which they unquestionably possess and they subjected themselves to very considerable hardship in doing so.  This has been a very technical and a very difficult task.  The commission has heard evidence on no fewer than 40 occasions from individuals, from representative bodies and from Government Departments.  It is doing what I think no other commission has ever done&mdash;it is sitting each week in order to continue with its work. It has now, I understand, completed the taking of evidence.  It is engaged now in presenting to itself questions which must be answered in order to comply with the terms of reference and which have flowed from the evidence already submitted to the commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The members of the commission have assured me that they are anxious to finish this job as soon as possible.  They are devoting considerable time to the task of finishing the report.  They are most anxious to do it because they are men with other interests.  There is no question here of trying to prolong the job.  They are most anxious to do it. I have tried to get a date from them as to when the report will be available. At this stage they are not able to say <Col N="1763" /> when they will have it available but they have given me the assurance that so far as they are concerned they are most anxious to complete the work and that, for that purpose, they have been sitting each week at very considerable inconvenience to themselves.  That information ought to be reassuring to the House and to the nation generally. We are now going to get for the first time a report on economic and social issues which we do not possess at the moment and which, in fact, we have not tried to get any year since 1922.  We are going to get it now for the first time.  Instead of engaging in offensive sneers against a talented commission of this kind I think that Deputy Lemass, as deputy leader of the Opposition and as an ex-Minister, ought to show some sense of good taste in a matter which affects the standing of estimable citizens of this country.</P>
    <P>The question of social services has been raised.  There was the usual cut and thrust of debate.  Efforts were made to quote the views of one Minister on social services, to quote the promises of other people before elections and the speeches made by Deputies and Ministers here, there and everywhere else.  I suppose the problem of social services is a wide social and economic problem on which it is possible to have a difference of opinion. Differences of opinion were even reflected here in this House by different Deputies.  Some members of the Fianna Fáil Party pretended to be bursting with enthusiasm for a comprehensive scheme of social services, whereas the Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party, Deputy de Valera, talked on the matter as if he had some doubts yet in his mind as to whether we could afford a comprehensive scheme, or what kind of a comprehensive scheme we could afford.  My impression, when he finished speaking, was that he would like to see a White Paper&mdash;not so much with a view to finding a date for the operation of the scheme but with a view to finding out the ideas of the people&mdash;whether we could afford such a scheme and what that scheme was likely to cost the country.  He did not appear to me to share some of the wild <Col N="1764" /> enthusiasm of his supporters for the introduction of a scheme of that kind. I do not mind that: I do not think that is terribly serious; I think it is quite normal and natural that on such a huge problem which has played, and will in the future continue to play, an ever-expanding part in social and economic problems in every country in the world, there should be divergence of opinion. I want to put my views on record for what they are worth; I do not worry if they disagree with other people's views; they are my views at all events and I want to convert people to them because I think they are sound.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one kind of view.  It is an honestly held view I think.  I do not agree with it myself. It is said that the need for social services arises out of the conditions of the people and that therefore the remedy is to provide the people with the wherewithal to enable them to provide against the hazards against which social insurance schemes endeavour to guarantee citizens.  In other words, step up the wages and salaries of wage and salary earners, give them regular employment and in that way render unnecessary the provision of social insurance schemes to cater for the risks which are generally covered by them.  That is one type of remedy for a situation which normally calls for the provision of social insurance schemes in enlightened countries throughout the world.  What we have to do is to say to ourselves: is it possible that in the foreseeable future we will be able to remedy our economic conditions on that basis?  Does anybody here to-day believe that it is possible, bearing in mind the fact that we have to compete in a highly competitive market with our exports, to give people such wage and salary scales as will enable them out of their own resources to provide against such risks <Col N="1765" /> as unemployment, sickness, childbirth, old age and such certainties as death? I am not accusing Deputy Beegan in this regard, but he will, I think, admit that it would be quite impossible in the foreseeable future to create conditions West of the Shannon and in Connemara in particular to adjust things in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>All I can do then is congratulate the Deputy on having kept it so secret.  The Deputy can be trusted if that was his policy.  Whatever other charges can be made against him, spilling the beans is not among them, but let us come back to the realities of the situation.  It is obviously quite impossible to create these conditions in that area in the foreseeable future.  It is impossible to imagine that among these working people, workers who get fragmentary employment for a few months of the year and whose wage rates are still probably inadequate for decent sustenance or small farmers who have to work poor, barren land you can create conditions whereby out of their own resources they can provide for all risks.  In my opinion you simply cannot do it.  Take other countries throughout the world.  New Zealand, for example, which is one of the richest countries in the world to-day from the point of view of industrial and agriculural potential has found it impossible to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no comparison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It has not been found possible in the rich, highly developed Scandinavian countries with their higher standard of life than we have, their higher industrial potential than we have and their higher agricultural potential than we have.  They have had to face up to the fact that left to their own resources the toiling masses could not provide against these risks and hazards.  I do not believe it is possible to provide against them here in Ireland by any reasonably effective adjustment of salary and wage scales and I am not prepared to wait until wage and salary scales are adjusted in order to give people a guarantee <Col N="1766" /> against these risks.  It seems to me quite absurd to say to a poor widow: &ldquo;The social services are inadequate and do not cover you, but we have a plan for the future whereby if your husband had lived he might have got more wages and you could have provided against his death and insulated yourself against economic hardship.&rdquo; In our circumstances we have got to evolve a comprehensive scheme of social insurance to cover people against the risks against which they are not able to insure themselves.  It is because I believe that that I am a firm supporter of the idea that the only practicable policy for use in our circumstances is the inauguration of a comprehensive social insurance scheme to provide in an organised way a guarantee under State auspices against the worst hardships which follow when misfortunes make their impact on the lives of the ordinary people who are not well endowed with this world's wealth.</P>
      <P>There is another school of thought. You may regard social services as something indicative of the fact that the body politic is not healthy.  Maybe that is right too; it depends on the angle from which you look at it, but it seems to me, in the type of society in which we live, the world in which we live and the economic conditions which we see around us, that the person who wants to wait until the body politic gets so healthy that it will not need social insurance schemes is fondling hopes which I do not see being realised at any time in the foreseeable future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that an admission that some of your statements in the past were not well considered?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>My statement to-day is the same as it always was.  I believe that the ordinary man in the street who toils in a factory, at the dock or on a farm is not able to meet these risks out of his own resources, and organised provision must be made against the hardships which follow the impact of these misfortunes on the lives of the people under a State scheme because it is not possible to do it in any other way.  There are people who stand for the philosophy of the <Col N="1767" /> survival of the fittest and let the devil take the hindmost.  They say to the cabin boy that there is a possibility that he will be captain, but that is an illusion in our conditions of life.  I believe that we must face up to the matter, recognising that in our circumstances a comprehensive scheme of social insurance is the best way to inoculate and insulate our people against the worst hardships which follow upon the impact of misfortune on their domestic life.  The ordinary man in the street, in my view, is not able to provide for the rainy day, adversity or misfortune for the simple reason that in the economic world there are too many rainy days.  Just because he cannot make that provision for himself we must organise a scheme whereby the State will do it for him, taking whatever is reasonable as contribution to ensure that he helps to meet the risks which he is expected to meet according to his own capacity to meet them. A comprehensive social insurance scheme will do all that.  We hear in this country boasting of the fact that we are a Christian people.  Now and again in idyllic moments we talk about our Christian Constitution.  I have not much use for beautiful lines in a constitution which allow an unemployed man to go hungry, a sick woman to suffer the pangs of malnutrition, or which allow a woman to hawk her orphans from one door to another to get the wherewithal to live.  If you are going to have a Christian constitution based on the Christian concept of life you ought to have some balance between our day-to-day relations.  We ought not only to write Christianity into the Constitution in our day-to-day lives but write it in a complete and effective form into the legislation which we are passing in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to see flowery language in a constitution and our institutions filled with poverty-stricken people.  I want it to take the form of providing security for human beings, for flesh and blood, for our own kith and kin so that we can insulate them as far as we can against the hardships which beset our Christian life.  That can be done only by a comprehensive social insurance scheme and so far as I am concerned <Col N="1768" /> I have always stood for that and will continue to do so in the future.</P>
    <P>I do not want to suggest that the implementation of a comprehensive social security scheme should in any way extinguish or even diminish the obligation on the ordinary individual to provide, as far as he can from his own resources, against the risks which are inevitable in this life.  I would not like to see a comprehensive social insurance scheme in any way weaken the incentive to any man or woman to make whatever provision they can against the ultimate rainy day.  I do not think the one materially detracts from the other.  In any scheme you build up standards for a people, and if you build up decent concepts of life for the people I venture to say you can teach them much more easily the ways of thrift and prudence than you can if you just regard them as economic flotsam and jetsam which is nobody's responsibility and with which the State is not concerned. I want to say that I am an unrepentant believer in the value from the national and Christian point of view of providing a comprehensive social insurance scheme aimed at giving some measure of security to the bulk of the people of this land of ours: to eliminate discontent and friction which bad economic conditions provoke and to make progress in enlightening the community.</P>
    <P>Deputy Derrig apparently spent some midnight oil gathering statistics for this debate and went through the hoary tomes of other days to find speeches which might cause embarrassment to people in the course of this discussion. In the course of his nocturnal ramblings he apparently got into the realms of figures because he said that under the health insurance scheme of 1911 the people were getting 9d. for 4d. and he seemed to have grave doubts as to whether that position was being maintained or whether the reverse was the case and the people were now getting 4d. for 9d.  The Deputy will be glad to know that the outlook is not as black as he thought because in 1948 approximately £897,000 was collected in contributions under the National Health Insurance Acts.  That was collected between employers and employees, <Col N="1769" /> and if you take a rough division of that figure you will find that employees contributed roughly £450,000 but during the same year £1,342,000 was expended so that instead of getting 9d. for 4d. it will be seen that they are getting better dividends than they got under the original National Health Insurance Act.</P>
    <P>The question of the Courts of Referees was discussed at some length on this Estimate and there were some who said they embarked on a policy of depriving the people of unemployment assistance.  I do not want to see this question of unemployment assistance made a Party matter and I do not want to see it drawn into the ordinary cut and thrust of political life.  There are certain aspects of unemployment assistance and assistance for the old age pensioners which merit the serious consideration of everybody concerned with the wellbeing of the people of this country.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the unemployed people, as such, are work shy.  I do not believe the ordinary decent married man is unwilling to work.  I suppose you would find in every community a percentage who will, for one reason or another find work distasteful and who are not inclined to work if they can get along without it.  That is not confined to the poorer people. Quite a lot of wealthy people do very little work.  The ordinary unemployed decent man with a wife and children is as anxious to work as anybody I know. If there are black sheep let us segregate them but do not let us come to the conclusion that all men, because they are unemployed, do not want to work.</P>
    <P>I want to look at this thing dispassionately. What is the position under the Act which was passed in 1933? That was a blanket Act for the whole country and it is still in operation throughout the country.  Although it has been in operation since 1933 no serious effort has been made to get down to evaluating the consequences which flowed from that Act or to measure out in any way the types of the persons claiming benefit under it. Our unemployment figures to-day are not honest figures because we are not <Col N="1770" /> merely taking into consideration those unemployed who had work and lost it. We take into the unemployed figures&mdash; a defect which we inherited&mdash;not merely men who had work and lost it but those whose normal occupation is to be unemployed.  That is not their fault.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that Deputy Smith visited a number of employment exchanges during his term in the Board of Works to ascertain the people who were genuinely unemployed and the people who were not fit to take employment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that there are no reliable figures in the Department.  I have collected a vast amount of information as to the types of people which constitute the recipients of unemployment assistance registered in four large areas and I am going to send out men who can look at these people and see what kind of folk they are.  Are they able to work?  Do they want to work?  What are their ages?  Where do they live?  What sustains them?  What kind of life do they live in their little cottages on small-holdings?  It is not that I want to deprive them of one halfpenny, but, if we are to spend £1,500,000 each year on unemployment assistance, we ought at least to know who is getting it and in what circumstances it is being paid. The House will be all the richer for getting some picture of that kind.  It will not be prepared by me; it will be prepared by impartial people; but the House is entitled to have that information. It has not got it at the moment and it did not get it in the past.  I am going to try to collect it and a great deal of work has been done in that respect and I hope soon to put people on the road to look at these people and to ascertain where exactly the money is going, to what areas it is going and to what classes of people it is going.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From my close observation of the problem&mdash;and I have spent a good deal of time observing it&mdash;we are paying unemployment assistance not to a man who works for six months, loses it for a month or two and then goes back to work again.  In many cases in <Col N="1771" /> certain countries&mdash;I do not want to discuss the countries at the moment; that is a matter we can discuss later &mdash;and even in certain groups of countries, the class of person who is seeking unemployment assistance is the small farmer who is living on a holding of £2, £3, £4, £5 or £6 valuation. He is not an unemployed man in the ordinary sense of the term. Admittedly, he will work on the bog, if he can get a job there, and, admittedly, he will work on the roads or on a drainage or relief scheme, if such a scheme comes his way; but, over the whole year, there is not sufficient employment for him.  There is very little employment.  He may have a good year this year, but, if a particular job is done in his area this year you cannot undo it next year and give him a job on it again.  This year may be his El Dorado from the point of view of getting work and wages, but good fortune may not come to that district next year or the year after, with the result that he has two bad years of unemployment.  During these years, he has to seek unemployment assistance. That is not because he is not working&mdash; there is no work in the place for him. He has not lost his job&mdash;he was employed temporarily to do a temporary job and it has finished.  There is then no other work for him.  His farm will not provide him with work all the year round, but he has to live all the year round and what he says is: &ldquo;I have no work.  My farm will not keep me and I have to live.  There is an Act known as the Unemployment Assistance Act in operation and I am going to claim assistance under that Act for myself and those dependent on me&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Are there not numerous tradesmen in the same position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>We will come to that in a moment.  That is what happens in many of these cases.  The basic problem there is not an unemployment problem&mdash;it is an underemployment problem or an agrarian problem.  If that person had enough land, he would have enough opportunities to exploit his land, but the fact that he lives on a small parcel of barren or arid land, not capable of sustaining him, means <Col N="1772" /> that he is not a farmer because the land is too poor and too small in area and he is not an ordinary industrial worker because there is no industry in the place.  At best, his prospect is that he may get occasional employment in that way.</P>
      <P>That is the pattern of life in some of these places.  It is not an emergency condition in the same sense as unemployment.  It is not something which has cropped up in the past year, two years or three years.  It is the whole pattern of life in these areas, and in that case unemployment assistance is in fact a concession to life to those living in these areas.  The Unemployment Assistance Act, in other words, enables them to get a type of benefit which was normally perhaps not intended for them, but which they are eligible and qualified to receive because they are not working, and they are not working because there is no work available and their general economic condition and background are such that they have to be sustained and unemployment assistance provides the means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it not inflict considerable hardship on such people if they were asked to take employment 100 miles away?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that in a moment.  In that respect, the Deputy's or anybody else's help will be welcomed.  Much depends on the direction in which they are prepared to take up the employment.  Some of these folk will take employment 100 miles or 200 miles away, if it is directly to the east, while some of them will not go ten miles north or 50 miles south, but we will discuss that in a moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The basic problem in relation to these people is an agrarian problem. They are now eligible for unemployment assistance.  They are human beings with all the feelings of human beings.  I think we might wisely deal with them in another way, instead of dealing with them through the medium of the Unemployment Assistance Act, because in that way they give a distorted picture of the whole unemployment position, but, let me say, if they <Col N="1773" /> are to be dealt within any other way they ought and must be dealt with fairly and no consideration merely of saving the money should influence the final decision in the matter.  My view is that they do not belong to an industrially unemployed class.  They belong, where they are small-holders with a certain acreage of land, to another class. There may be a case for segregating them, for regrouping or reclassifying them.  That has not been considered. Even if it were considered, it ought only to be considered on the basis of appreciating the lives these people have to live and their necessities and the whole matter ought to be considered in a sympathetic atmosphere.  So far as I am concerned, it will be considered in none other than a sympathetic atmosphere.</P>
    <P>The question arises whether we should ask people to leave their areas and go to work elsewhere.  There, again, I think you can make a case for it and a case against it, depending on the angle from which you approach the problem.  Let me, however, without expressing an opinion, put some considerations before the House.  We have two national schemes operating at the moment.  One is a Bord na Móna scheme, aimed at the production of the maximum amount of machine-won turf, and the other is the Erne hydro-electric scheme, which seeks to provide greater electrical energy for the country and to render it more independent of foreign coal imports.  I do not think that any Deputy will question the statement that these are two vital national schemes of reconstruction, the completion of which will add to the national estate, strengthen the economic fabric of the nation and generally improve the amenities of life in Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is desirable, therefore, that they should be completed, and I think it is desirable that the necessary labour should be recruited in order to complete these schemes of work, but those responsible for promoting the schemes say, and say with truth, that it has not been possible for them to recruit the necessary labour.  Bord na Móna complained that it could not get the staff it required for the camps, and the Erne people complained that they could not <Col N="1774" /> get the necessary staff for the Erne scheme.  Special efforts were made to recruit these people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Was that proposal put up to people who were married or to single men with dependents?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>In an effort to recruit labour for employment at Ballyshannon, representatives of Cementation Company visited certain areas in the West for that purpose.  By agreement, interviews were arranged at four special areas where the men attended for the purpose of certification of evidence of unemployment.  At each of these places, the men were fully informed of the terms of employment, the terms being a rate of 1/10 an hour, which was fixed as a result of a trade union agreement, with a 48-hour week, board and lodging on the site at 33/-a week, free transport was offered to the site of the work, and a long spell of employment was anticipated.  Men considered suitable by the employers' representative were interviewed and employment was offered to each man who was considered suitable.  Married men were eligible for employment if they were desirous of applying, but special attention was directed to the recruitment of single men without dependents and under 45 years of age, because the employing authority felt that single men would be less, and ought to be less, restless on the job, and they wanted, in any case, to keep a reasonably low ceiling in the matter of recruiting workers for what was heavy manual work.  Now, a total of 319 persons were interviewed at these four centres and, as a result of these interviews, the number who accepted employment, out of a total of 319 persons, was eight.  I do not think that even the whole eight stayed on the job.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me go on.  The men were then interviewed and asked why did they not want to take a job at 1/10 an hour, with continuous employment, a 48-hour week, hut accommodation and so on.  A record was made at to the reasons for their unwillingness <Col N="1775" /> to accept work.  The excuse, in nearly all cases, was to a great extent the same, namely, &ldquo;required at home in connection with the spring work and would not take up outside employment at present.&rdquo;  A few men pleaded circumstances of aged or infirm relatives who needed attention, but the overriding view expressed was that they did not want to travel; that they preferred to get a job in their own districts and that, if they were at home receiving unemployment assistance they could do the spring work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Will you tell us about the 41 Maltese who were brought over?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us think first of the Irish and forget about the Maltese for the moment.  Here is a situation in which you have got two important schemes.  For the purpose of these schemes, you look for labour which is physically fit and vigorous.  Jobs are offered.  Three hundred and nineteen people unemployed, mind you, are offered jobs on this particular scheme at Ballyshannon.  The wages are £4 8s. 0d. a week, less 33/- deduction for board and lodging, leaving them, if they get the £4 8s. 0d. a week, 55/- a week nett, with food and lodging provided for them.  As single men they probably would not have got any more than that amount as wages if they were working on the roads or on a relief scheme.  This was a place where they had the chance of earning 55/- a week with board and lodging, and yet they declined to go and take up the employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All that I know about their reason for doing so are the reasons stated by themselves in reply to the interviewing authority, namely, in the main that they preferred to stay at home and do the spring work and that they did not want to work on the scheme.  That is all right.  I do not think that, in a free country, you can compel a man to work if he does not want to work. People have that right and they exercise it every other day.  They decide whether they will work or will not work, whether they will live on their dividends or take up some kind of professional or other employment. But, in this case, what you have to ask yourself is this: If you have a national scheme such as the Ballyshannon scheme, in operation and if you want to bring it to fruition, should you continue to pay unemployment assistance to single men without dependents who will not leave their own areas to work on this nationally desirable project at Ballyshannon? Should you say to men: &ldquo;Although we need your help there because it is a very desirable scheme, if you do not go and will not go, we will still continue to tax the community to pay you unemployment assistance to which you yourself contribute nothing?&rdquo;<Col N="1777" /> That is a serious economic and social problem.  Nobody will deny that. What is the wise thing to do in circumstances of that kind?  I should like to have more information about it.</P>
    <P>In another case which came to my notice in connection with the same scheme, some of these people who were interviewed, single persons without dependents, said they were waiting for work to turn up on the roads.  They were asked &ldquo;Will you go to Ballyshannon until such work does turn up? At least you will get food, you will get board and lodgings there, and you will still have 55/- a week.  You are not being sentenced to stay there, because you can come back.&rdquo;  They said &ldquo;No, we will hang on until the road job turns up.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not purporting to investigate this matter here.  I think it needs further examination.  It may be that that is the explanation, but bear in mind that there is a trade union agreement in operation there and there are very large numbers of people working there already.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>And as Deputy Maguire says, quite content.  Again, there are very large numbers of people working in the turf camps and there, too, you have a trade union agreement.  What you have to ask yourself is: are you going to say to the single man without dependents that, although there is work available for him elsewhere he need not take it, and if he does not take it we will still give him unemployment assistance?  Deputies can think over that problem.  I am not going to come down on one side or the other to-day.  It is a problem that we all shall have to think over, because this may very well be the incipient stage of a social abscess which can have very serious repercussions in our national life.  I want to be quite fair and I do not want to make up my mind until I am satisfied that this matter has been <Col N="1778" /> thoroughly examined.  I propose, from the unemployment assistance aspect to have it further examined to see what the explanation is.</P>
      <P>Let me say in passing that, in another case, where workers were being recruited by the same firm, one of the reasons given by some of the single men who were offered employment on the scheme was that they were going to work in England, where they had never been before.  They were going to travel a couple of hundred miles to work in a city where they never worked before and they could not be induced to work in a place 40 miles away among their own kith and kin.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister bear in mind the point I raised?  It has been alleged that there are local men unemployed in the town of Ballyshannon, signing on at the employment exchange there.  When they presented themselves for work to the works manager they would not be accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The position in that respect is this.  Anybody at Ballyshannon who was considered by the manager to be suitable for employment on the scheme was sent forward for employment, but the decision to employ or not to employ rests with the company which is carrying out the contract. They cannot be forced by my Department, at all events.  I have nothing to do with the firm or the institution for which that firm is working, to enable me to force them to employ people they may not want.  All the unemployed at Ballyshannon considered suitable for employment on this scheme were sent to try to get employment.  If they were not employed, that responsibility is the responsibility of the employing company. If they were not employed because they were not suitable for employment they, of course, retain their <Col N="1779" /> right to unemployment assistance and, of course, they continue to draw it.</P>

There are trade unions there and they have made agreements with that firm.  They may undertake an investigation or the Minister for Industry and Commerce may undertake it but, quite frankly, I have no power to undertake it.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr Norton Mr Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not asking the House to accept anything.  I am merely giving Deputies the facts objectively.  I shall have further <Col N="1780" /> inquiries made in order to see what is the real explanation.  It may be just a case where, if an Irishman wants to work he wants to work near his home, and, if he wants to go away, then he wants to go a long distance away.  That may be the psychology revealed by probing the matter deeply.  I am not going to do that to-day.  It is a problem that every intelligent person must face up to because it has a deep social and economic significance.</P>
      <P>Some questions were raised by Deputy Lynch about the means test.  I think I have dealt with that already. Deputy Lynch then got a bit gloomy and he said that on examining the Estimate he saw savings under some headings.  I can assure the Deputy that no matter what the headings were, the over-all Vote is much higher than last year and the sections of the community who rely on social services are getting more than they got last year.  The Deputy need not worry unduly that any savings of a rather automatic kind, due to variations of one kind or another, have in any way brought about a reduction in the benefits paid to recipients; on the contrary, the benefits are higher than they were last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lynch also referred to the Wet Time Act.  He wanted it extended and the rates of benefit increased.  I suggest to the Deputy that that is a position he could very well leave to the trade unions concerned.  This Wet Time Act was brought into operation to provide some kind of benefit during periods of wet weather on housing schemes.  As a result of the operation of the Act, workers, both skilled and semi-skilled, now get certain benefits if they are obliged to stand-off employment during periods of wet weather. I have discussed, orally and by correspondence, with the Trade Union Congress and the Congress of Irish Unions the question whether the benefits should be increased and the scope of the Act extended.  These are matters which require very careful consideration, because I do not think we have yet reached the stage when it is possible to say that there is a reasonable balance struck between what comes into the fund in contributions and what <Col N="1781" /> goes out in benefit.  For instance, as a result of a very wet year in 1947, the balance in the fund was reduced from £93,000&mdash;the figure at which it stood in March, 1947&mdash;to £63,000 by the following March, showing that any abnormally wet season might very well affect the stability and the solvency of the fund.  I think most people would desire that we should have a little more experience of the demand on the fund and the vagaries of the weather we may have to meet before coming to any decision to reduce rates of benefit.</P>
    <P>On the question of extending the scope of the Act, I have told the trade union congresses that I am willing to discuss that matter with them in a helpful and sympathetic way.  They, of course, appreciate that this sum of £69,000 in the kitty at the moment has been put there by the building trade workers and their employers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a good job that somebody remembers that there was an abnormally wet season.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It has got finer since the Deputy's Party went out of office. I do not think the Deputy need fear any return at all to blizzard conditions. At all events that £69,000 in the kitty at the moment was, as I was saying, put there by the building trade workers and their employers.  Any effort to extend the scope of the Act to bring in other workers will immediately bring them in with a right to draw on a pool which they did not create and any suggestion of doing that will immediately give rise to considerable difficulties, especially with the unions responsible for creating the pool.  I have said, however, to the congresses concerned that I am willing to discuss the matter with them if they can come along to me with an informed view as to what additional classes they want covered by the scheme and if they can talk authoritatively for those whose contributions have created the wet-time surplus.</P>

      <P>The question of the Courts of Referees was discussed.  I think I have already explained what happens in that respect.  I do not know of any fairer machinery when one has to decide whether or not a man is genuinely seeking work than to constitute some kind of tribunal for that purpose.  That type of tribunal is constituted by the Court of Referees, representative of trade unions, on the one hand, and employers on the other with an independent, neutral chairman&mdash;a person who is adjudged to be capable of holding the scales evenly between both sides.  In the main, he has been a gentleman of legal standing.  Some Deputies&mdash;I suspect those Deputies who have no intimate knowledge of Courts of Referees&mdash;have complained that the decisions are not always given in favour of the aggrieved person.  On the other hand, one finds an experienced trade union official, like Deputy Hickey, with an intimate day-to-day and week-to-week knowledge of Courts of Referees saying, with a critical eye on the operations of these courts because of the point of view he represents, that he thinks the Courts of Referees work very well on the whole and that the cases are dealt with sympathetically. That is the machinery provided at the present time under the law for dealing with these particular cases.  That is a much better type of machinery than to allow a Government Department to decide the cases.  If I were an aggrieved person I would prefer a tribunal of that kind to deal with my case rather than have it dealt with by the Departmental machine.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The machinery is there at all events.  It seems to me to be as good in its general character as any other kind of machinery one could evolve.  If, however, Deputies are prepared <Col N="1783" /> to say that, based on their intimate experience of Courts of Referees, there is room for improvement here or there, we can have that matter examined particularly in connection with the comprehensive scheme in order to discover the type of machinery that ought to be established to deal with these particular matters.  I do not see any reason why the chairman ought to be opposed to the applicant.  Neither do I see any reason why he should be violently in favour of the applicant.  It does not matter to him.  He has no personal interest in the matter.  All he has to do is to decide is the applicant genuinely seeking work, or is he not?  It does not matter what he thinks of the man.  If the worker's representative and the employer's representative think that he is genuinely seeking work, then the chairman has no view. It is only when the employer's representative and the worker's representative disagree that the chairman is called upon to exercise a casting vote. I think we would need further evidence that the present machinery is not effective before we engage in the doubtful experiment of changing it merely for the sake of change.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dunne raised the question of the insurability of agricultural workers under the comprehensive scheme.  That is a matter for consideration in connection with that scheme.  I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that it would be undesirable for us to discuss it in advance of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe raised the question of the conditions of persons employed as branch employment managers, as I understood him, and Deputy Davin raised a similar question.  Last year I indicated that I was not enamoured of the system under which branch employment offices exist in the Department of Social Welfare.  These branch employment offices are placed where the managers are employed allegedly on a part-time basis and paid on the basis of the units of work with which they deal in the office.  Naturally, the less work he has the less pay he gets. The more unemployed, therefore, that he has in his particular area and the more transactions he carries out the better will be his scale of pay.  These people are not civil servants.  They are hybrids discharging important functions closely analogous to those performed by civil servants in those branch employment offices which are staffed with civil servants.  I do not like that type of employment which is associated with these branch employment offices and I hope to get rid of that type of employment in connection with the comprehensive scheme.  I think it is bad in its conception.  I think it is most objectionable in its operation.  I cannot say yet what the ultimate destiny of the folk concerned will be.  All I want to convey to the Deputies interested is that so far as I am concerned I would like to get rid of that type of employment and I shall do my utmost to get <Col N="1785" /> rid of it.  What the solution will be I cannot at this stage indicate.  Deputies will learn that in due course.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Ryan was responsible for a most egregious error when he was discussing old age pensions, a subject about which one would imagine he should know something.  He contended that people got very little increase under the Social Welfare Act of last year.  In case anybody else suffers from a similar loss of memory I want to reiterate the facts now.  One hundred and four thousand persons who were getting from the Department of Social Welfare a pension of 12/6 per week before the Act came into operation had that pension increased to 17/6 per week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Hold on a minute and I will tell you all about it.  Do not be so impetuous.  An otherwise stable man like Deputy McGrath has got to restrain his impetuosity in this matter. I cannot understand why he gets so annoyed that old age pensioners have got an increase of 5/- a week. The fact is that 104,000 of them have got an increase of 5/- a week and 25,000 of them an increase of 2/6 a week.  The position now is that there are more people drawing old age pensions in Ireland than ever before.  They are getting more than they ever got before and the means test is easier than ever before.</P>

      <P>Somebody said that the local authority made a contribution. They did but they were empowered to do that only in rural areas.  Deputy Dr. Ryan did not know that they could not do it in the cities and Deputy Dr. Ryan is an ex-Minister.  Deputy McGrath says he knew it all the time but the ex-Minister did not know it. Here is what happened.  Under the scheme, by which local authorities in rural areas were allowed to increase the amount of old age pensions&mdash;that is where a person had 12/6 a week&mdash; the local authority conducted another odious inquisition into the means of the <Col N="1786" /> applicant.  Although the person got through the Department of Social Welfare means test to get 12/6, the local authority had another round with the person and put him through another test to get the other 2/6. Then when the person was awarded 2/6, he or she had to trek after the home assistance officer to get that 2/6.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me tell you what it cost.  The total amount spent in the year 1948 in the supplementary allowances of 2/6 a week, 75 per cent. of which was recouped by the State, was only 5½ per cent. of the total expenditure. In other words, local authorities supplemented the normal total expenditure on home assistance by 5½ per cent., and 75 per cent. of this 5½ per cent. was recouped by the State.  Of course, Deputy McGrath, in his less impulsive moments, knows very well that these people have done very much better under the Social Services Act than they had done previously.  Deputy McGrath's only annoyance is that he could not induce the Fianna Fáil Government in its day to do what we have done.  He is annoyed only because they missed the tide.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have dealt with most of the major matters raised in connection <Col N="1787" /> with the Estimate.  The question of printing cards in Irish has been raised by Deputy Ó Briain, and I shall have that matter examined.  Whether it is possible to do anything as a result of the examination, at this stage I cannot say, but at all events I shall have it examined to see whether it is possible.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cogan raised the question of persons insured under the Acts being likely to lose benefit if their cards were not stamped in time or were not returned to the Department in time. All I can say to the Deputy is that there is on the insured person an obligation which he is asked to exercise only once in 365 days&mdash;that is an obligation to get his card at the end of the period from his employer and surrender it himself.  That is not a very onerous duty but it is a desirable duty because it puts a check on the employer. It is not too much to expect of an insured worker, from his own point of view and from the point of view of his wife and children, that he will at least see that his employer will surrender his card.  It is at least a guarantee that the card has been stamped and it is an assurance that if the insured worker gets sick, or becomes unemployed, he and his dependents will not be in the position in which they will not get any benefits. I think it is a reasonable check to apply and my only desire is that insured workers would discharge that duty with more enthusiasm and alacrity than they do at the moment. In any case, employers should realise the serious hardship which they may cause to employed workers by withholding their cards.  Admittedly the worker can recover from an employer who is guilty of negligence in returning a card but that is often a slow remedy. A much more effective remedy is to have the cards collected when they are due for return to the society and thus avoid the difficulties which might arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cogan also mentioned the fact that he thought there were various interpretations as to what was means as between one old age pension district and another.  Conceivably there might be, human nature being such a variable commodity, but at all events <Col N="1788" /> there is at least the guarantee that if a pension is awarded by a local pensions committee, and if either the applicant or the social welfare officer appeals against the decision, the appeal goes to the central pension authority in Dublin and there is dealt with by the one group of people all the time, so to that extent at headquarters you get a reasonable interpretation as to what is means.  In the main I think you get a common pattern as to what is means&mdash;at all events, the social welfare's officers' method of assessing means.  It is a standard method.  It varies from the standpoint that barren land has not the same value as fertile land and that stock on poor grass is not as valuable as stock on rich grass. These variations are allowed for, so far as it is humanly possible to do so, and the general instructions which have been issued to investigation officers have not changed in any way since the Social Welfare Bill of last year.</P>
    <P>Therefore, under that Act, with a modification of the means test and with the old standards of value maintained although agricultural produce prices have risen, it is now easier to get an old age pension than it was previously and it is easier to qualify now than it was relatively some years ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>What happens is that the matter is dealt with at first by the local pensions committee.  They award or refuse a pension or award a partial pension.  The social welfare officer, who is familiar with the case because he investigates all the circumstances, may appeal against the local pension committee's decision.  In that case, the applicant is notified that the social welfare officer has appealed and the applicant is told that he can submit any evidence he wishes to the Central Pensions Authority against the social welfare officer's appeal.  The social welfare officer puts in his case, the applicant puts in his or her case.  They both go to the Central Pensions Authority in Dublin.  They look at the applicant's case and the social welfare officer's case and, in an atmosphere in which neither the applicant nor the social welfare officer is present, the Central Pensions Authority decide what in their view is the pension payable on the facts as presented.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister think it would be advisable to issue instructions to local pensions officers that they are not to try and prevent applicants from getting pensions?  If they have instructions not to try and prevent applicants from getting pensions, will he issue instructions to them to co-operate with applicants in trying <Col N="1791" /> to get a pension?  The general belief is that the local officers try by every means in their power to prevent applicants from getting a pension.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that is a commonly held view and is of old origin, when inspectors normally were not the bearers of good news and inquisitions of that type had a malevolent intent behind them.  The social welfare officer has been told in a letter to which my signature is affixed that I desire that he should co-operate to the fullest extent with applicants and help them; that his function is to administer the law; that if applicants are entitled to pensions under the law, they ought to get them, and he ought to help them.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to another matter to which I might have made fuller reference in my opening remarks, and that is the position in connection with the Blind Welfare Consultative Council which I set up last year.  That council was set up for the purpose of co-ordinating the activities of various blind welfare organisations, to get them to establish, as it were, a kind of clearing-house for the grievances of blind welfare organisations.  The chairman of the council is Deputy Martin O'Sullivan.  The council has held a number of meetings and I have got from it ten pretty comprehensive recommendations affecting the welfare of the blind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of these recommendations affect Departments other than my own but, in so far as they do, I am having these recommendations transmitted to the other Departments for examination in the hope that they will be sympathetically considered and adopted if possible.  So far as the recommendations affect the Department of Social Welfare, I want to assure Deputy O'Sullivan and those interested in the matter that they will be examined with a sympathetic and understanding mind.  I might perhaps avail of this opportunity to express my very sincere thanks to the public-spirited men and women who constitute the consultative council for the very valuable work which they are performing on behalf of our sightless community. <Col N="1792" /> I feel sure that, as the work progresses, then in the same ratio will the welfare of the blind community be improved.</P>

The Deputy might bear this in mind, that last year I asked local authorities to step up the allowance from £20 to £40 for each person, and other allowances from £5 and £13 to £20.  In addition, the State grants towards blind persons in blind institutions, which was £20 for the last 28 years, was stepped up to £40.  To that extent, we improved substantially the financial position of those institutions and I think they all acknowledge that they were dealt with in a very fair and generous way.  I do not know what the financial position in Cork is, but I will undertake to have the position examined to see what can be done, if the responsible authorities write to me on the matter.</P>

      <P>Before reviewing the progress of the Department in the past year and explaining the details of the Estimate, I would like to comment on some matters of significance which come under the heading of vital statistics.  I might mention, however, that the figures for the year 1948 are provisional and may be subject to some modifications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of births registered in 1948, 65,584, was nearly 3,400 less than in the preceding year although it was about 4,000 above the average for the previous decade (1938-1947).  The birth rate per 1,000 of the estimated population last year was 21.9.  The corresponding figures for England and Wales, <Col N="1797" /> Scotland and Northern Ireland were 17.9, 19.4 and 21.9 respectively.</P>
    <P>The number of marriages registered during 1948 was 16,331&mdash;an increase of 41 over the previous year.  The 1948 figure was nearly 1,300 lower than the figure for 1946 which, however, was the highest recorded since 1878.  The 1948 marriage rate per 1,000 of the estimated population was 5.4 compared with 9.0, 8.5 and 7.0 in England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland respectively.</P>
    <P>The number of deaths registered in 1948 was 36,502, or nearly 7,500 less than in 1947.  The death rate per 1,000 of the estimated population was 12.2, the lowest rate ever recorded for this country.  There is still considerable scope for improvement, however, as the figure for several European countries varies from 7.2 to 9.9.</P>
    <P>The need for vigorous anti-tuberculosis and cancer campaigns is emphasised by the fact that, while the all-over picture is definitely brighter, these diseases have once again reaped a heavy harvest.  Provisional figures show that the number of deaths from cancer was 3,885 as compared with nearly 4,000 in 1947.  The total number of deaths from all forms of tuberculosis is estimated at 3,017, a decrease of 683 on the previous year and the lowest ever recorded.  I will deal with the tuberculosis problem in greater detail.</P>
    <P>During the year, the number of deaths of children under one year was 3,212 representing an infant mortality rate per 1,000 births of 49, compared with 68 in 1947 and 65 in 1946.  The 1948 rate is the lowest ever recorded in this country, but there is still room for considerable improvement.  The 1948 rates in England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland were 34, 45 and 46 respectively.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw the special attention of the House to the tremendous improvement which has taken place in the death rate in infants under two years of age from diarrhoea and enteritis.  Throughout the country as a whole, the number of deaths from this disease was 1,233 in 1943.  This figure had fallen to 1,092 in 1945.  Since then, progress has been spectacular and is <Col N="1798" /> reflected in the figure of 340 for 1948. In Dublin County Borough alone, the figure has been reduced from 573 in 1943 to 80 last year.  It is difficult to ascribe this welcome reduction to any particular cause, but it may be significant that measures to combat the disease have been intensified by the local authorities concerned.  Instead of drawing any conclusions in the matter, I shall confine myself to expressing the hope that the welcome trend regarding the mortality from this disease will continue.  The number of deaths from whooping cough in 1947 was 298 and the number of deaths last year was 196. The number of deaths from measles in 1947 was 106 and last year 61.  The total number of diphtheria deaths in 1947 was 56 and last year 31, so it will be seen that measles and whooping cough each claimed many more victims during the last two years than diphtheria.  The adoption of protective measures against them is showing promising results.  Local authorities have power to provide such protective measures free of charge.</P>
    <P>During the year 1948, the number of cases of typhoid, diphtheria, and scarlet fever notified was 4,891.  While this showed an increase of over 2,000 on the previous year, the number of deaths was 30 less than the previous year.  Of the 1948 total of deaths, 31 were due to diphtheria, 14 to typhoid and the remaining four to scarlet fever. For the fourth successive year, no case of typhus occurred.</P>
    <P>The number of cases of diphtheria notified in 1944 was over 5,000.  The number last year had fallen to 521.  It is reasonable to assume that extensive immunisation against the disease has contributed largely to the decline.</P>
    <P>While, therefore, our health statistics for 1948 do not warrant complacency, the figures for the year show that we are gradually improving our position.  I would like to emphasise briefly the highlights, in case these points may have been submerged in the statistics I have quoted, viz.:</P>
    <P>(a)  the infant mortality rate and the general death-rate were the lowest ever recorded;</P>
    <P>(b)  the total number of deaths from <Col N="1799" /> all forms of tuberculosis shows a decrease of 683 on the previous year, and deaths from cancer also showed a decline;</P>
    <P>(c)  the number of deaths in infants under two years of age from diarrhoea and gastro-enteritis has dropped from 1,233 in 1943 to 340 last year; and</P>
    <P>(d)  there was a marked decrease in the mortality from the principal infectious diseases.</P>
    <P>An important aspect of health services development is the provision of hospital beds.  While we have a good nucleus on which to build, the fact that we are far from having adequate accommodation available may be gauged from the fact that when I took up office there were 135 proposals before the Department for the provision of new hospitals and for the adaptation, reconstruction, and repair of existing hospitals.  I felt that it would not be conducive to real progress to try to deal in one piece with all these proposals and as I indicated when introducing the Estimates last year, I decided that it would be best to concentrate on a short-term hospital building programme to be completed in seven years.  The size of the programme was determined by reference to the availability of materials, of skilled labour and of professional consultants. Local authorities and the authorities of voluntary hospitals concerned have been notified as to the decision reached in relation to each project which had been submitted.  In the case of projects included in the seven-year programme those responsible have been encouraged to press forward speedily with the planning and construction work.  In an effort to expedite building the promoters of certain voluntary hospital projects and the smaller local authority proposals have been given a free hand to get on with the job without referring detailed plans and documents to the Department for approval once agreement had been reached on the work to be done and on the amount of the grant to be made available from the Hospitals' Trust Fund in cases where such a grant was to be provided.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1800" /> The first and most urgent problem was the provision of additional accommodation for tuberculous cases and notable progress in this direction has been made in the past twelve months. As regards building work on general hospitals, maternity hospitals, fever and mental hospitals, clinics and dispensaries, an immense amount of planning has had to be undertaken. Much of this is now well advanced and will be reflected very shortly in the increased rate of construction of these institutions.  At the beginning of 1949, hospital building work was proceeding at an annual rate of between £500,000 and £600,000.  Since an average annual rate of almost £2,500,000 would be necessary to complete the seven-year programme, it was clearly a matter of great urgency to get on quickly with works which were nearer the point of starting.  For that reason works likely to start in 1949 have been given the highest priority within the programme.</P>
    <P>The projected building programme for 1949 envisages the stepping up of the monthly rate of hospital building from £45,000 in January to £220,000 in December, or a rate of about five times greater.  This rate, if it can be attained, will represent a very considerable achievement.  It will mean that by the end of the year a commencement will have been made with £6,250,000 worth of hospital building work, i.e. about one-third of the seven-year programme.  So far as we can foresee, there is every indication that this can be done and the replies received from the promoters concerned confirm our anticipations.  A difficulty which is envisaged, and which may impede progress is the likelihood that there may be a lack of competition in tendering for the more important hospital works involved.  In terms of total volume of output, hospital building work would not represent more than about 15 per cent. of the annual output of the building industry, but when it comes to major projects, hospital works represent a very high proportion of the total number of such works being undertaken in the country.</P>
    <P>In the seven-year programme there are 40 jobs which are estimated to cost £100,000 or more, and 20 of these would <Col N="1801" /> each cost approximately £250,000 or more, including a number of works which are estimated to cost about £1,000,000 each.  The field of competition for major works is limited and in order to ensure that contracts are placed at keen prices it is necessary that as far as possible we should stagger the starting times of such works.  In addition to the difficulty of the limited number of building organisations capable of tackling major works, there may be difficulties common to all major building undertakings such as shortage of skilled labour.</P>
    <P>Important hospital works, the building of which it is hoped to see started this year, include Ardkeen Sanatorium, Waterford; the new Fever Hospital at Dublin; the Limerick Regional Hospital; Galway Regional Sanatorium and Galway Regional Hospital; the proposed major extension at Portiuncula Hospital, Ballinasloe; the new County Hospital at Manorhamilton; the Children's Hospital at Crumlin and the new hospital at Gurranebraher, Cork.  Site works in connection with some of these works have been completed.  Others are in progress and it is hoped to commence the site works of the two remaining regional sanatoria at Dublin and Cork by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>If the works which it is hoped to commence in 1949 can be got under way, there is not likely to be any holdup which would delay the completion of the seven-year programme as far as planning is concerned.</P>
    <P>It has been represented that the short-term building programme is a reduced one.  I would like to emphasise that it compares favourably with what has been done on hospitals construction in the period from the initiation of the sweepstakes up to the outbreak of the last war.  Approximately 6,800 extra beds will be provided on the completion of this short-term programme and the magnitude of this increase and the important change it will bring about in the hospitalisation position can be appreciated from the fact that the total number of general hospital beds in the voluntary hospitals, county hospitals and district hospitals in the country at the present time is not much in excess of this figure.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1802" /> Apart from hospital works, the programme envisages the building of new dispensaries and improvement of dispensaries that are capable of improvement, as well as the provision of clinics in each county at which specialist facilities can be provided. Most of the local authorities concerned are already proceeding with the planning of the &ldquo;county&rdquo; clinics and it is hoped that most of them will be available within the time allotted to them in the programme.</P>
    <P>The amount of money in the Hospitals' Trust Fund, towards which hospital authorities generally will be looking for reimbursement of portion of their expenditure on hospital building, is not as large as we would like it to be.  It is hoped, however, that the receipts from sweepstakes in future years will be adequate to enable the fund to meet the amount of grants allocated towards building costs, as well as the deficits on the running expenses of the voluntary hospitals and some encouragement for this hope is given by the return from recent sweeps.</P>
    <P>While on the subject of Hospitals' Trust Fund, I must refer to the question of the deficits on the running of the 55 voluntary hospitals participating in the sweeps for this purpose.  I mentioned last year that these deficits had been increasing year by year and that the increase gave cause for concern. Nothing which has happened in the past year has helped to allay that concern. The total amount payable on foot of deficits in respect of the year 1939 was £157,000.  In 1946 it had risen to almost £238,000.  For 1947 it had further increased to £334,000 and I understand that it is anticipated that the figure for 1948 will be as high as £420,000.  These increases have occurred despite the substantial increases in maintenance charges levied by the hospitals in respect of patients sent in by local authorities and despite an annual contribution of over £100,000 to the Dublin voluntary hospitals from the Dublin rates.  It is obvious that with so large a capital programme depending on Hospitals' Trust Fund moneys some ceiling must be put on the <Col N="1803" /> amount of recoupment in respect of deficits and I have been in touch with the Hospitals' Commission about the matter.  I hope to be in a position to make recommendations to the voluntary hospitals concerned in the near future.</P>
    <P>Deputies are aware that I have devoted a considerable amount of my time since taking up office to the anti-tuberculosis campaign.  This disease has been one of our major public health problems for some time and has taken heavy toll of our youth in particular. The death rate from all forms of tuberculosis per 1,000 of the estimated population was 1.25 in 1940, 1.47 in 1942, 1.14 in 1946, 1.24 in 1947 and 1.00 in 1948.  The actual number of deaths was 3,017 last year.  While the number of deaths last year was the lowest recorded in recent years, we are very far from the stage when we can say that the problem has been reduced from major to minor proportions.</P>
    <P>The death rate per 1,000 of the population in Denmark in 1947 was 0.30, in Sweden 0.51, in England and Wales 0.56, in Scotland 0.79, and in Northern Ireland 0.72.  It will be seen that we have a considerable leeway to make up, even though, as I have mentioned, our 1948 rate is estimated at 1.0.</P>
    <P>Tuberculosis is not a problem which can be solved merely by the provision of beds and staff.  Good housing conditions, adequate nutrition, appreciation of health hygiene and a more rational public attitude towards the disease are essential elements in the anti-tuberculosis campaign.  Such measures as utilisation of mass radiography for early diagnosis, B.C.G. vaccination, follow-up of contacts and a greater readiness on the part of sufferers to seek early treatment, will all play an important part, but the first essential is to provide institutional accommodation without a waiting period for persons who are found to need such accommodation.  The dangers of the spread of the disease by way of openly infective cases are too well known to need comment here.</P>
    <P>I feel that we have achieved quite a lot in the matter of bed accommodation. From February, 1948, to the end <Col N="1804" /> of last month 984 additional beds for tuberculous cases had been provided in local authority institutions and 226 in voluntary institutions, i.e., a total of over 1,200 extra beds.  The provision of additional accommodation is being pressed continuously and further substantial progress will be made before the end of the current calendar year. The maintenance allowances for tuberculosis patients and increased diagnostic facilities have, of course, had the desired effect of increasing substantially the numbers coming forward for treatment.</P>
    <P>Projects in hands, including the provision of temporary accommodation at St. Mary's Hospital, Phoenix Park, Dublin, should reduce the waiting list to manageable proportions before the end of the calendar year&mdash;in most areas, including Dublin, long before that date.  The latest of these projects is the acquisition and conversion of the former airport hostel at Foynes; a very fine, newly-built structure, to accommodate cases of primary tuberculosis in children and as a preventorium.  About 100 beds will be available.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to burden the House with a list of all the projects which have resulted, to date, since February of last year, in the provision of 1,200 beds and will result before the end of this year in the provision of a further 800 odd beds.  The projects are over 20 in number and Deputies will already be aware of those which relate to their own areas.  Some consist of permanent adaptation of existing buildings, e.g., St. Mary's Hospital, Phoenix Park, Dublin, already mentioned.  Others are temporary adaptations, the largest of which are the conversion of the District Mental Hospital at Castlerea and the District Hospital at Mallow.  They include also the diversion of certain fever hospitals to tuberculosis purposes. In all this, I want to express my appreciation of the co-operation of members of all political Parties and of the members and staffs of the local authorities concerned.  In all but a very few cases, that co-operation has been whole-hearted and unstinted.</P>
    <P>The longer-term solution of the problem lies in the provision of the three regional sanatoria at Dublin, Cork and Galway, of a sub-regional <Col N="1805" /> institution at Waterford and of a children's sanatorium at Ballyowen, County Dublin.</P>
    <P>As I have mentioned, site works at the Galway institution are nearing completion and building will commence later this year.  Site works at the other two regional institutions will also commence this year.  Tenders have been invited for the site and building works at Waterford and the planning of the children's institution is proceeding.</P>
    <P>In regard to the last-mentioned institution, it was decided, in order to press forward as quickly as possible with the building programme, to form a company limited by guarantee to erect the 250-bed sanatorium at Ballyowen for children suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis.  The sanatorium will be provided on a site which had been previously acquired by the Dublin Corporation.  The company will be financed from the Hospitals' Trust Fund to the extent of some £250,000. The eight members of the company&mdash; who also comprise the directorate&mdash; will not be remunerated for their services.  The company has been incorporated and has carried out a considerable amount of preliminary work to date.</P>
    <P>The total number of beds to be provided under this longer-term programme will be about 2,000 which, with the beds already provided since February last and the remaining beds which will be available before the end of the calendar year, will bring the total to about 4,000.  When allowance is made for the beds lost in institutions which will revert to their former use, e.g., Castlerea and Mallow and certain fever institutions, and in institutions which by that time will have become sub-standard, e.g., Pigeon House, Crooksling, Dublin, the net number of additional beds will be of the order of 3,000 which, on present indications, should be adequate.</P>
    <P>Perhaps, I should say a few words at this stage about our proposals for dealing with orthopaedic cases.  Discussions have already taken place with local authorities in connection with the need for appointing orthopaedic surgeons <Col N="1806" /> and it is hoped that an adequate staff will be available soon.  Improved provision will also be required for the hospitalisation of orthopaedic cases, both tuberculous and non-tuberculous. It is contemplated that Woodlands Sanatorium, Galway, will be reserved for orthopaedic cases in the western area as soon as Galway Regional Sanatorium has been provided.  Additional units will be added to Woodlands Sanatorium, if necessary.  Orthopaedic cases in the southern region will be catered for at the projected regional hospital and regional sanatorium.  The possibility of securing 60 beds in the Cork County Home and Hospital for orthopaedic cases is also being examined. South Leinster will be served by the unit to be provided at Kilcreene House, Kilkenny, which has been acquired by the local county council and it is proposed that the accommodation should initially consist of 80 beds, with provision for expansion.  The Orthopaedic Hospital, Coole, should cater adequately for the needs of North Leinster where tentative plans for an extension have been implemented.  It is intended that the Dublin area consisting of Dublin City and County, Meath, Louth, Kildare and Wicklow should be served by the institutions at Cappagh, Clontarf, Baldoyle and Arklow.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal now with some other aspects of our anti-tuberculosis campaign.  Early diagnosis is most important and I have requested health authorities to take steps to improve and equip any health clinics which were not up to standard.</P>
    <P>A mass radiography unit has been operating in Dublin since 1946. Approximately 8,000 persons were mass radiographed by this unit in 1948 and of these, 175 were found to have pulmonary tuberculosis and in 165 cases it was deemed desirable to keep the persons concerned under observation. With the provision of full X-ray facilities at the Dublin Corporation's reconstructed and extended tuberculosis clinic at Charles Street, to be opened next week, it should be possible to make more extensive use of the mass radiography unit in future.  A mobile X-ray unit has commenced operations <Col N="1807" /> in Cork City and County and the experience gained in this area will be useful in the extension of mobile X-ray facilities throughout the country, a matter which has already been taken up with local authorities generally.</P>
    <P>During the latter part of 1948 a new scheme of chest surgery for tuberculosis patients in local authority institutions was initiated.  Operating theatres containing the most up-to-date equipment and facilities have been provided in the new sanatoria at Castlerea and Mallow and a thoracic surgeon was appointed to carry out operative procedures at each of the institutions referred to and at St. Kevin's Hospital, Dublin.  This is a most important development of our tuberculosis schemes, providing as it does, a first-class service, free of charge, for patients requiring chest surgery.  When additional fully - equipped operating theatres are available in the very near future in Rialto Hospital, Dublin, in St. Mary's Chest Hospital, Dublin, and in the proposed enlarged tuberculosis unit of the Limerick City Home and Hospital, the existing scheme of chest surgery will be expanded and two additional thoracic surgeons will be appointed.  A suitable division of work between the three surgeons will then be made.</P>
    <P>It is essential that tuberculosis medical officers should keep abreast of current developments elsewhere and it is part of our policy that they should visit other countries and study techniques and problems there.  Arrangements have already been made for a number of medical officers engaged in the local authority service to undertake an eight weeks' course in Wales, covering field and institutional work.  Five medical officers have already undergone the course.  Four medical officers have completed a course in Canada and one has finished a course at Cheshire Joint Sanatorium.  Further courses are visualised.</P>
    <P>A scheme of training of probationer nurses for the new grade of sanatorium nurse was initiated during 1948 with the co-operation of the General Nursing <Col N="1808" /> Council.  The rules of the nursing council under which sanatorium nurses would be trained were approved and steps are being taken to provide training facilities at various sanatoria.  Probationers are already being trained at the sanatorium at Castlerea and at Peamount and Newcastle.  It is a matter of regret that delay in the provision of accommodation has delayed the recruitment and training of probationers in the Dublin and Cork local authority services.</P>
    <P>It is a generally accepted scientific fact that persons who have successfully passed through the primary stage of tuberculosis are much less vulnerable to the ravages of the secondary and later forms of the disease than persons who have not passed through that stage.  The effect of having passed through the primary stage successfully can be produced by B.C.G. vaccination, a procedure not more painful and little more elaborate than ordinary vaccination against smallpox or inoculation against diphtheria.</P>
    <P>Schemes of B.C.G. vaccination have been initiated by the Dublin Corporation and the authorities of St. Ultan's Children's Hospital.  A committee representative of St. Ultan's, the Corporation and Department of Health has been set up to supervise the extension of the scheme operated at that hospital.  The hospital authorities will, in the first instance, offer vaccination to susceptible groups of the population, including students (particularly medical students), hospital nursing staffs and children who are in contact with open infective cases of tuberculosis.  They will make B.C.G. vaccination available to health authorities and will train the medical officers of those authorities in B.C.G. vaccination.  This vaccine is offered to negative reactors to tuberculin tests and we hope it will be a factor of considerable importance in reducing the incidence of tuberculosis in adolescents.</P>
    <P>Under the Infectious Diseases (Maintenance) Regulations, 1948, a scheme of monetary allowances was brought into operation on the 1st March, 1948.  The scheme applies to sufferers from specified infectious diseases who, by reason of illness or of taking precautions in <Col N="1809" /> certain circumstances, are unable to maintain themselves or their dependents. The regulations have proved to be of considerable benefit to eligible persons&mdash;particularly in the case of sufferers from tuberculosis, where the period of treatment is sometimes prolonged. The regulations were amended in September last so as to extend eligibility for a domestic help allowance to a married woman receiving institutional treatment, whose husband is unable to make proper provision for the care of their family.  The regulations have now been further amended so as to permit of the payment of the domestic help allowance in the case of certain patients whether they are undergoing domiciliary or institutional treatment and whether or not a relative is employed as the domestic help.</P>
    <P>All local authorities maintaining institutions, i.e. district, tuberculosis and mental institutions, have been asked to adopt special measures to protect the staffs against contracting tuberculosis.</P>
    <P>The consultative council on tuberculosis is considering the question of rehabilitation of patients.  This problem presents many difficulties and a practical solution will not be easy to find. Due to the generous action of Senator R. M. Burke, in placing Toghermore House, Tuam, at the disposal of a local voluntary committee a splendid opportunity has been given of gaining practical experience of the operation of an experimental rehabilitation scheme. Patients discharged after sanatorium treatment are already engaged, under medical supervision, on suitable rehabilitation treatment at Toghermore House,</P>
    <P>There is a wide field in tuberculosis institutions for the employment of expatients in suitable posts and with suitable safeguards.  I have recommended that course to health authorities and I hope that they will respond generously.  I have also been in touch with trade unions about the matter and I hope that they, also, will co-operate.</P>
    <P>So much for tuberculosis, the most prevalent and most costly of our infectious diseases.  I would like to say a few words now about some of the other infectious diseases.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1810" /> In January last each health authority was requested to furnish a report from the chief medical officer on the practical operation of the infectious diseases regulations in their area with particular reference to the provisions relating to vaccination, immunisation and the notification of cases of tuberculosis and venereal diseases.</P>
    <P>It was rather disturbing to find that in some counties no schemes of vaccination against smallpox were in operation, while in others schemes were operating only to a limited extent.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that the number of full immunisations against diphtheria carried out in 1948 appears to indicate that the decline which had become noticeable in recent years has been arrested.  The number of children fully immunised during 1948 under schemes administered by health authorities was nearly 80,000 compared with 49,000 in 1947 and 42,000 in 1946.  In the odd case where the disease is contracted by a person who has been recently immunised, the course of the disease is generally light and the death rate among children who have been fully immunised is almost negligible.  Of the 31 diphtheria deaths in 1948, only one death occurred among children who had been immunised.</P>
    <P>Health authorities were advised during the year to have all infantile paralysis patients examined by an orthopædic surgeon before discharge from fever hospitals and to make arrangements for any follow-up examinations considered necessary and for the provision of local facilities for physio-therapeutic treatment in suitable cases.  Considerable progress has been made by health authorities in the organisation of this necessary service and a number of health authorities have already made suitable arrangements for the after-care of patients.</P>
    <P>Health authorities were also urged to press forward with measures for the control of enteric fever, to sustain their efforts in the extended use of D.D.T. preparation in the fight against vermin-carrying diseases and to improve the facilities provided in urban areas (other than the county boroughs) for the treatment of scabies.  (The facilities provided in the county boroughs are regarded as adequate.)</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1811" /> A revised scheme for dealing with venereal disease is under consideration at present and will be communicated to health authorities as soon as some difficulties have been cleared up.</P>
    <P>In concluding the review of the fight against infectious diseases, I want to emphasise that all services provided by health authorities in connection with these diseases are free of all charge to the recipient.  They are of a high order already and are improving rapidly and failure to avail of them in appropriate cases is a disservice to the entire community.</P>
    <P>When introducing last year's Estimate I gave a resumé of the provisions of the Health Act, 1947.  That Act and the regulations and Orders made under it are intended to codify and bring up to date the law dealing with public health.  Further regulations were made during the year now under review and initial steps were taken in the preparation of others.</P>
    <P>A draft set of regulations dealing with food hygiene has been prepared and sent to interested outside bodies for their views.  This draft has received a certain amount of publicity and Deputies will probably be aware of the general purport of the regulations. The intention is that the sale or importation of unfit food will be prohibited and that all premises where food is normally manufactured, prepared or sold for human consumption should comply with certain structural and hygienic standards.  There are also provisions in the draft regulations dealing with the registration of food premises and special articles are included to ensure the safety and cleanliness of ice-cream and shellfish&mdash; foods which are particularly liable to suspicion as vectors of infectious diseases.</P>
    <P>This draft has been welcomed by the traders and other organisations interested in the food business who have been consulted.  Many of the bodies to whom the regulations have been sent have suggested amendments in the details of the scheme.  All these suggestions will be fully and sympathetically considered and will, where feasible, be accepted.  It is intended <Col N="1812" /> that the officers of local authorities, whose duty it will be to enforce the regulations, will furnish advice and guidance to food traders regarding compliance.  Progress and improvement in food handling conditions can, it is felt, be best achieved by such advice and guidance but, of course, local authorities will also have adequate power to enforce the regulations by prosecutions.  Apart from the advice and guidance which will be given by health officers, it is very desirable that food workers should, in their apprenticeship, be trained in the fundamentals of food hygiene.  A step in this direction has been taken in Dublin, where the City Vocational Education Committee have, with the co-operation of trade organisations, established a course for persons in the grocery trade.</P>
    <P>When the food hygiene code has been brought into operation it is proposed to consider, in consultation with the trade and other interests concerned, further regulations to deal with the separate, but related, problem of standardisation of certain foods, that is, the prescription of the nature, quality and proportion of the ingredients which may be included in these foods so as to ensure that proper nutritional values are maintained.</P>
    <P>The retention in the medical assisttance service of some of the features of the old poor law system is a serious defect in our health services.  One such feature is the &ldquo;red ticket&rdquo; system.  Accordingly, it is proposed to amend the existing regulations regarding the provision of medical assistance so as to provide that persons who are eligible for such assistance under the Public Assistance Act, 1939, will, upon application to the appropriate public assistance authority, be furnished with a medical card which will entitle them to medical assistance either in the dispensary or in the home of the person, as the case may require without the <i>ad hoc</i> ticket required at present.</P>
    <P>While on the subject of the medical assistance service I would like to say a few words about county homes.  Many of these institutions fall far short of minimum standards of comfort.  For many reasons connected with the development of the <Col N="1813" /> county home system and the lack of suitable alternative accommodation we find old persons, unmarried mothers, children, mental defectives and destitute persons sharing the same institution. This situation must be brought to an end.  In order to expedite this matter the Government has decided that an inter-departmental committee should be established to advise on the problem.  When this committee will have completed its work I hope to be in a position to formulate concrete proposals but as an interim measure, I recommended to public assistance authorities that existing conditions in the homes under their charge should be surveyed and that they should draw up proposals for effecting improvements in sanitary accommodation, bathing facilities, cooking and dining arrangements, segregated accommodation for children and mental defectives, dietary scales to ensure properly balanced and varied diets, general cleaning up and painting.</P>
    <P>One of the first matters which engaged my attention last year was the unsatisfactory condition of many of our public assistance dispensaries. The lack of proper accommodation was not only a cause of bringing the medical assistance service into disrepute, but, more important still, it rendered the provision of proper medical assistance in dispensaries very difficult.  The standard of accommodation and necessary amenities for patients is, in general, very low.  Public assistance authorities were urged to take early steps to ensure that their dispensaries should be brought up to a reasonable standard and that where such was not possible, new dispensaries should be provided.  They have since surveyed the dispensaries in their areas and are taking steps to improve them.  The solution of the problem is not easy. A large number of dispensaries are not capable of reconstruction and it will be probably necessary to replace them.  This must, of necessity, be a gradual process, but everything possible will be done to ensure that no undue delay will occur.</P>
    <P>Since the field of medicine is wide, it would be folly not to avail to the full of the accumulated knowledge of experts in different spheres of medicine <Col N="1814" /> which has been so generously placed at the disposal of my Department through their membership of the various consultative councils and committees which have been established. In addition to professional interests, we have had the benefit of the services of representatives of administrative bodies concerned in health matters.</P>
    <P>The Consultative Child Health Council was established in May, 1948, and, at my request, directed its energies in the beginning towards the production of a short-term plan for reducing infant mortality.  As the problem in Dublin County Borough was easily the most serious in the country they considered this area demanded prior attention.  The council have submitted their report on this matter and the necessary examination and discussions have been proceeding since.  The problems involved are considerable as will be appreciated when it is borne in mind that the service will have to cover about one-third of the community. Integration of the projected service with the existing medical assistance service is another of the difficulties.</P>
    <P>One of the most important elements in the projected service is the making of arrangements for care of sick infants in the neo-natal stage.  The council put forward certain recommendations in this matter and it was decided that it would be best to have it fully discussed between representatives of the three maternity hospitals, the Dublin Corporation and my Department.  It was gratifying to find that not only had we unanimity on the need for co-ordinated vigorous action but a large measure of agreement also on the manner in which the problem might be solved.  The authorities of the hospitals are considering the problem now in greater detail with a view to the evolution of a practical working plan.  Considerable progress has already been made.</P>
    <P>The council have not been idle since the furnishing of the Dublin County Borough Report.  They have submitted recommendations as to how a service might be organised for Cork County Borough and a report covering areas other than the county boroughs.  These <Col N="1815" /> reports are now being considered in my Department.</P>
    <P>As I have already mentioned when dealing with vital statistics, cancer is one of our most serious problems and, consequently, the work of the Consultative Cancer Council is of prime importance. I expect that the council's report conveying their long-term recommendations will be available shortly. The problems involved in a cancer campaign are many.  Early diagnosis and treatment are essential and efforts at public and professional education must be intensified.  The availability of beds, highly-trained staff and equipment will be important elements in the fight against this disease.  The manner in which a national cancer service might best be organised will also need careful consideration.</P>
    <P>I will lose no time in having the council's report examined and I am sure that it will be of considerable assistance to us in formulating our plans to reduce the death rate from this disease.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the position of St. Kevin's Hospital, Dublin.  Following consideration of the report of the committee which was set up to examine the existing facilities in the hospital, certain decisions, which I feel will have an important influence on the standard of local authority medical services, have been taken.</P>
    <P>The public will have noticed advertisements which appeared recently in the Press inviting applications for the positions of director of medicine, director of surgery and director of pathology at St. Kevin's Hospital. These appointments represent the first major step in the carrying out of the policy of which I have approved, for the improvement of the standard of service to be provided at St. Kevin's Hospital and in the local authority service.</P>
    <P>In order to improve the standard of medicine in the local authority service generally, it is proposed to establish in St. Kevin's a post-graduate school of medicine.  The school, which will be established if the necessary legislation is enacted, will provide post-graduate <Col N="1816" /> courses in medicine, surgery and pathology for members of the local authority medical service.  Each of the three branches of the hospital and of the school will be under the supervision of a director, who will be a man of the highest professional qualifications and who will be paid a salary commensurate with his qualifications.  In order to attract the very best possible material, the salaries and emoluments of the posts have been fixed on a scale considerably in excess of those ordinarily applicable in the local authority service.</P>
    <P>In addition to their responsibility for the organisation of the post-graduate school, the directors of medicine and surgery will be responsible for the treatment of patients in St. Kevin's and shall, when necessary, provide such treatment.  It follows from this that the standard of treatment for patients in St. Kevin's Hospital will be at the highest specialist level and that the best, and only the best, treatment will be provided at that hospital.  In order to assist the directors in their work, it is envisaged that each will ultimately have the help of an assistant director. All this flows from the adoption of a policy for the provision throughout the country of the best possible medical, surgical and pathological facilities for those sections of the community who are unable to provide them from their own resources.</P>
    <P>The gastro-enteritis advisory committee is compiling its final report, which, I expect, will be submitted in the near future.</P>
    <P>Last year I mentioned that the new procedure provided for under the Mental Treatment Act aimed at encouraging patients to seek treatment in the early stages of mental illness. Statistics for 1948 encourage us to hope that this fundamental aim of the Act will be realised.  The number of voluntary patients admitted to mental hospitals in 1948 was 501 compared with 376 in 1947.  The number of temporary patients admitted increased from 773 in 1947 to 995 last year, while the number of persons of unsound mind admitted totalled 2,752 in 1948 as compared with 1,929 in 1947.  The total number of admissions in 1948 was 4,248 <Col N="1817" /> compared with 3,078 in 1947&mdash;an increase of 1,170, but the total number of discharges in 1948 was 2,875&mdash;an increase of 1,009 over 1947.  This total comprised 430 voluntary patients, 657 temporary patients and 1,788 persons who had been committed as of unsound mind.</P>
    <P>Clinics for affording advice and preventive and curative treatment in cases of mental disorder, including cases of suspected or incipient mental disorder, have been established by the majority of mental hospital authorities in view of the importance of the provision of facilities for early treatment of mild cases.</P>
    <P>During the year, a branch of St. Augustine's Colony, Blackrock, County Dublin, was opened at Drumcar House, Stamullen, County Louth, for male mental defectives and Moore Abbey, Monasterevan, became available for female epileptics.  Schemes for providing additional accommodation for about 800 mental defectives have been approved and planning is proceeding. I have also been giving attention to the broader aspects of the protection and care of mentally deficient persons and legislation to deal with the position is under consideration.</P>
    <P>I feel that too much stress cannot be laid on the importance of fair living and working conditions for all our nursing staffs.  Adequate remuneration alone is not enough.  Proper amenities and adequate recreational facilities are also of primary importance and during the year the attention of local authorities was drawn to the matter.  In many districts considerable improvements have taken place and progress is being made towards the introduction of a 96-hour fortnight.  Some counties are experiencing difficulty in introducing the shorter working hours owing to the absence of residential accommodation for the extra nursing staff which is required, but efforts are being made to provide the necessary accommodation, and in some cases arrangements have been made to allow the staffs to live out.  In order to relieve the existing overcrowding of our training schools and to ensure a more liberal supply of nurses, I have urged the public assistance authorities responsible for some of our larger county hospitals to <Col N="1818" /> endeavour to fulfil the requirements of the General Nursing Council in order that they may be recognised as training schools.  As already mentioned, a new grade of sanatorium nurse was instituted during the year.</P>
    <P>Health authorities were encouraged to appoint further health inspectors, where required, to meet the demands of the public health services and courses in sanitary science were held at University Colleges, Dublin and Cork, which afforded persons desirous of being appointed as health inspectors an opportunity to obtain the necessary technical qualifications.</P>
    <P>The local authority medical services have been handicapped by the non-availability of specialist services outside the larger centres of population. Hitherto, persons who required specialist attention could not, generally, receive such attention in the areas in which they reside and were, therefore, obliged to travel to Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway. It is essential to have the services of specialists more widely available throughout the country.  Discussions have taken place between officers of my Department and county managers and county medical officers with a view to finding an early solution of this problem.  There seems to be general agreement with the view that the specialist services should be brought to the people and that local authorities should make appointments, or combine to make joint appointments, of wholetime officers.  An enormous improvement in the health services at relatively little cost would be achieved if orthopædic, ophthalmic, obstetric and ear, nose and throat specialists were available regularly at the county clinics or smaller clinics in a county as required and in the local hospitals.  The saving in human suffering would be very appreciable and I hope that before the year is out considerable further progress will have been made.</P>
    <P>The availability of a complete range of laboratory services is another essential element.  It is hoped to provide a full range of pathological and bacteriological services in each region, with county laboratory services to deal <Col N="1819" /> with routine work not requiring more specialist intervention.</P>
    <P>The pattern of medical service which is evolving should now be apparent. The general practitioner is obviously the basic unit in that pattern and he will have as backing the local pathological services to which I have referred, or, alternatively, the specialist clinic to which he can refer his patients.  The clinics in their turn are backed by hospital beds of the appropriate kind in the district hospital or the county hospital or the local sanatorium. These hospitals are in turn backed by the regional hospitals or other specialist institutions, including the regional sanatoria, orthopædic centres, etc.  Outstanding in this pattern must be the position of St. Kevin's Hospital, Dublin, where, as I have already mentioned, not alone will there be a medical service second to none for the patients, but refresher and other courses will be provided to enable the medical staffs of local authorities to improve and to bring up to date their knowledge and to ensure that the highest possible standards are maintained at every level of the service.</P>
    <P>In regard to all this, I would like to emphasise that it is my desire that treatment up to and including a high specialist level should be available to every patient as near to his own home as possible and that the processions of ambulances from the furthest corners of the country to hospitals in Dublin and Cork should become more and more attenuated.</P>
    <P>I now come to the details of the Estimate before the House.  The increase under sub-head A&mdash;Salaries, Wages and Allowances&mdash;is attributable to the additional staff required in my Department and the payment of increased remuneration to civil servants arising out of the recent revision of Civil Service salaries.  The additional provision under sub-head B&mdash; Travelling Expenses&mdash;is necessitated by the increase in the inspectorial staff at headquarters and also by the fact that the amount of inspection and supervision work will be greater than in previous years, due to the expansion of local health services.</P>
    <P>The main provision under sub-head <Col N="1820" /> E&mdash;Expenses in Connection with International Congress, Etc.&mdash;is for the payment of this country's contribution towards the Budget of the World Health Organisation for 1949.  Ireland's contribution has been fixed at 0.34 per cent. of the total budget which amounts to about $5,000,000.  Our contribution for 1949 amounts to £4,280.  Sub-head F (2) makes provision for the payment of expenses connected with the activities of the different consultative health councils which have been established. I have already explained in some detail the work done by these councils in the past year.</P>
    <P>Deputies will note that greatly increased provision has been made under sub-head F (3)&mdash;Dissemination of Information and Advice on Health.  I regard publicity measures as a vital part of any campaign for the inculcation of health habits among our people.  If we can fully awaken the community to a well-balanced appreciation of the need to safeguard health, we will have taken a very big step forward in the ceaseless struggle against ill-health and towards the attainment of a healthy community.</P>
    <P>Sub-head F (4)&mdash;Miscellaneous Expenses in connection with the Health Act, 1947&mdash;is a new sub-head.  I have already referred to the regulations which it is proposed to make in the near future.  It is unlikely that any considerable expenditure from central funds in connection with the administration of these regulations will arise for discharge during the present year, but a token sum of £10 is being provided under this sub-head.</P>
    <P>The provision made under sub-head G (3)&mdash;Expenses in Connection with a Survey of Human Nutrition&mdash;is greatly reduced from last year as the field work arising from the survey has been concluded.  The nutrition survey, as Deputies are no doubt aware, consisted of a dietary survey concerning selected families in various areas throughout the country and a clinical survey concerning thousands of school children and some adolescents and expectant mothers and nursing mothers.  A report of the methods employed in the dietary survey generally and on the results of the dietary survey in Dublin in particular was published last February. <Col N="1821" /> Deputies will recall that the survey indicated that, with the exception of calcium, the intake of nutrients was, broadly speaking, satisfactory at all levels of income, food expenditure and family size.  The deficiency in calcium was found to be considerable in some groups, due to the low consumption of milk and cheese.</P>
    <P>The statistical analysis of the returns received from the nutrition investigators in respect of the congested districts has been completed and it is hoped to publish a report on this portion of the survey at an early date. Analysis of the dietary returns in respect of the remainder of the country, and of the clinical returns, is in progress and it is hoped that the work will be completed by the end of the current year.</P>
    <P>We now come to sub-head H&mdash;Grants to Health Authorities&mdash;which is the largest item in the Estimate.  I explained the principle underlying the Health Services (Financial Provisions) Act, 1947, in my statement on last year's Estimate, but perhaps a little recapitulation may be helpful.</P>
    <P>The Act provides that the State will bear each year the difference between the net expenditure of each health authority on health services and the net expenditure of that authority on such services from local funds in the year 1947-48, (i.e. the standard expenditure) until such time as the State contribution equals the expenditure of the health authority.  Thereafter, the cost will be borne equally by central and local funds.  The method of recouping health authorities for health expenditure has also been simplified and a single grant replaces all previous grants in aid of expenditure on recognised health services.</P>
    <P>It is not expected that any health authority will, in the current financial year, reach the point where its expenditure will be equal to twice its standard expenditure.  Consequently, the costs, excluding capital costs, of any new developments of the health services in the present year, together with any increases in the cost of the old services, must be met in full by the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The ascertainment of the standard expenditure in each case must await <Col N="1822" /> the audit of the local accounts, but it is estimated that the aggregate standard expenditure of all health authorities is in the region of £4,731,000.  The aggregate expenditure of health authorities on recognised health services for the year ending 31st March, 1950, is estimated at £6,915,000, as detailed in Part III of the Estimate, and the difference to be borne by the Exchequer is, therefore, £2,184,000.  Of this amount it is expected that 95 per cent., or £2,075,000, will actually be paid within the year, the balance to be paid on receipt of the auditors' certificate.  A further item of £85,000, contained in sub-head H, is to pay the balances of grants due in respect of the year 1948-49 which will fall due as the accounts of that year are audited.</P>
    <P>The total disbursements by health authorities on health services for the current year are estimated to exceed the disbursements for the year ended 31st March, 1948, by £1,273,000.  The corresponding excess of expenditure for the year ended 31st March, 1949, over the preceding year's expenditure is estimated at £859,000.</P>
    <P>Sub-head (I)&mdash;Grants to Voluntary Agencies for Child Welfare, Schools for Mothers, etc.&mdash;shows an increase of £500 on last year's estimate of expenses.  The provision under this sub-head is for grants to voluntary agencies, such as district nursing associations, which provide, outside local authority schemes, services for mothers and children in the forms of boarding out, nursing homes, etc.</P>
    <P>The Grant-in-Aid provided for under sub-head J&mdash;National Blood Transfusion Service&mdash;is a contribution towards the expenses of the establishment and maintenance of the non-profit-making body, a company, limited by guarantee, set up in August last to organise and administer a blood transfusion service on a national basis.  Suitable premises have been acquired by the company and the medical director has already taken up duty.  It is hoped that effective progress towards the establishment of an adequate transfusion service will be made in the present year.</P>
    <P>Sub-heads L and M (1) to M (5) provide for balances of grants payable to local authorities arising out of expenditure <Col N="1823" /> in years previous to 1948-1949. Expenditure by health authorities on the corresponding services in respect of subsequent financial years will be recouped from sub-head H&mdash;Grants to Health Authorities.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to say a few words about further plans.  Some appear to think that progress is reflected in the production of grandiose schemes, attractive in theory but not capable of early implementation.  We must build on a solid foundation. Widely-available health services would soon fail if they had not the backing of hospital and specialist facilities and ancillary medical and nursing personnel. We must first concentrate on providing these facilities before we impose an undue strain on the health services by too great an immediate widening of their scope.</P>
    <P>My main concern is the provision of facilities designed to eradicate weaknesses in our existing services, and when this has been accomplished gradually to extend their scope.  The provision of beds to relieve the pressing needs of the acutely ill, the successful prosecution of an anti-tuberculosis campaign, the provision of an improved mother and child health service, the raising of the standard of the medical assistance service by the provision of post-graduate courses, specialist teaching and suitable premises, the organisation of an adequate cancer service, the provision of proper care for mentally deficient persons, the organisation of a clean and nutritious food campaign, and other projects to which I have already referred, form the basis of our short-term plans to give the country a better health service.  The bringing of the plans I have outlined to a successful conclusion will need the whole-hearted co-operation of local health authorities, the public and medical and nursing personnel.  I feel that such co-operation will be forthcoming, as we are all at one in agreement to improve the health services, and once we have the will, the removal of any difficulties and the smoothing out of any disagreements on the means or methods to be adopted should not present too serious a problem.</P>
    <Col N="1824" />
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Health has been good enough to give us a number of figures regarding the general state of the public health.  It is satisfactory to know that, on the whole, the trend is satisfactory.  Although, as I understand, there seems to have been a decrease in the number of marriages, there has been, on the other side, a considerable decrease also in the number of deaths in the past year. It is satisfactory to know that the mortality rates in respect of tuberculosis and gastro-enteritis, and in other respects, have improved.  It is good also to know that the measures that have been taken with regard to diphtheria over the past number of years are succeeding and that this disease is no longer the menace which it used to be to the health of the community. I think the fact that the Minister has such a fairly good bill of health to show from the national point of view is, to some extent, accounted for by the fact that a considerable amount of work had been done over a long period of years.</P>
      <P>One does not expect to achieve revolutionary results in spite of these wonderful drugs that we hear of and that it would seem are being constantly produced in the United States of America.  The impression one gets is that it is only a matter of time until specifics for all classes of diseases will be easily available in tabloid form. Nevertheless, most of us must feel that we are not going to bring about revolutionary changes in a very short period of years.  If we were to do so, perhaps the research students of the future might find that the results on the human frame and organism were not all that had been anticipated when specifics were first put into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that, in the start of any national health service, the foundation would seem to lie with the family unit. Our Party attach a good deal of importance to the scheme which was known as the mother and child scheme.  I notice that the Minister, when speaking down the country, referred to the stigma of pauperism which, he alleged, the present Opposition Party were guilty of allowing to continue in the <Col N="1825" /> dispensary system taken over from the old régime.</P>
    <P>We set up the Department of Health, and even before the Department was set up a considerable amount of work had been accomplished.  It is quite true that the then Department of Local Government and Public Health was unable to deal with health problems in the way that we would have wished.  But the problem of setting up a new Department, and the fact that it was obviously going to be one which, if it were expanded in a modern way, would involve very big financial and other considerations, was naturally a matter that a good deal of thought had to be given to, if it were feasible to keep the number of Government Departments and Ministries at the minimum&mdash;at the former level.  We would have wished that that would have been the case, but we felt that, having regard to modern developments and the great improvements in medical science generally, and the fact that a great part of the work of local authorities was taken up with public health matters, and, furthermore, that in connection with the building of new hospitals and the moneys which had come along from the Hospitals' Trust, it was obvious, now that the war had come to an end and things had taken a somewhat different aspect, a Department of Health would justify itself and would be worth the cost of the country in the advantages it would bring. Various measures, and not alone mental disease measures, were passed through this House dealing with that particular matter.</P>
    <P>The question of the treatment of gastro-enteritis was taken up and steps were taken to provide proper hospital treatment, with the result that, following the efforts which have been continued, the disease has been very largely eliminated.  Steps were also taken with regard to rheumatism and I have referred to what was done in regard to trying to get immunisation extended.  I do not think, therefore, it is quite proper for the Minister, or indeed worthy of him, to suggest that nothing had been done and that, in fact, it was to a certain extent his task <Col N="1826" /> to try to undo the harm that had been done by Fianna Fáil, during their administration, because we set up a committee to deal with this question of health services and the recommendations of that committee are there to be seen.  They were not, of course, asked to make recommendations which it was intended to pass by or not to give effect to in due course.  The committee examined the whole question of the health services in great detail and went to a great deal of trouble and made certain recommendations.  All these recommendations were the subject of active consideration.  White Papers were issued with regard to the proposals the Government had in mind for the extension of the health services and for tuberculosis.</P>
    <P>There was also, as part of the general Government policy, the question of a building programme and in connection with that, so far back as 1945, it was indicated that hospitals would have to receive a considerable amount of priority.  It was intended to start off the building programme as soon as building materials became available, and to do so on a considerable scale.  We attached a considerable amount of importance to the mother and child scheme.  We have been discussing, under the Department of Social Welfare Estimate, an extension of the social services.  Various questions have been asked regarding the basis of the proposed extension, and it seems to me that the extension of the health services is allied with that question and it might, indeed, be regarded in a broad way as being part of the whole question of social services. For example, in national health insurance, obviously the health services come very much into the picture in whatever proposals the Government has in mind for its new social security scheme.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties, as I mentioned on the Vote for the Department of Social Welfare, is the problem of the rural population and how, in a scheme which may be quite suitable for a population of insurable people, an industrial population, which can be made actuarially sound and very satisfactory from the point of view of the benefits <Col N="1827" /> that will accrue to the contributors, to get the rural population of the type that we have in this country and which constitutes nearly half of our total population, into your scheme.  That is a matter of difficulty.  We, therefore, considered that, side by side with whatever developments might take place from the point of view of social insurance, and which would probably mean improvements in health benefits and in medical treatment for participants in the scheme, at the same time there should be a development in health services, particularly in areas that might not otherwise benefit, that would not be covered in the same way as would the industrial areas by social insurance.</P>
    <P>The intention was to have, instead of the dispensary scheme, a local health unit composed of a doctor, a fully trained nurse and a maternity nurse, and that these would be integrated with the infant welfare scheme, where this existed, and with the school medical inspection scheme and that, broadly speaking, the same type of service would be free, or almost free.  There is always a question whether you want to go so far in this question of health services as to make them completely State services, or whether, because you want to leave room for the individual practitioner or because you do not want to bring the schemes completely under the State, even though you are bringing about a reform, you will not make it entirely free but you will make a certain charge.  That, of course, is one of the big questions which will ultimately have to be decided.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, the idea was to develop the existing dispensary system and have the doctor, the trained nurse and the maternity nurse working in conjunction with one another, with special attention to ante-natal care and to the welfare of mothers.  Through the increased attention that the nurse and the doctor would be able to give the school it was hoped to have more frequent inspections and to do a great deal more from the point of view of health education.  It was also contemplated that hospital services would be made available to rural residents.  There again, there might be a small charge <Col N="1828" /> or a certain limit of valuation but, generally speaking, the services would be readily available, even if not entirely free.  The intention was that certainly in the county hospitals obstetrical and ophthalmic advice and so on would be available.  It was hoped that in the regional hospitals, of which there was to be a number throughout the country, the same services would be available as, broadly speaking, are available in the big metropolitan hospitals.  That was the general scheme.</P>
    <P>If it is said that there was a certain neglect in carrying these matters forward I can only repeat, as some members of the present Government seem to forget and which, I am afraid, has escaped the attention of the Minister for Health, that the world has gone through a very severe crisis.  We have had a very big war and, even in neutral States, it has not been possible to go ahead.  The emergency problems created, although perhaps not nearly so serious in character as those which confronted the belligerents, were nevertheless grave and there were difficulties particularly in securing materials and in keeping the ordinary economic life of the country going which prevented the Government from giving that attention to social reforms which would have been given to them in normal times and under normal conditions.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the rotten stigma of pauperism which the Minister alleges still adheres to the dispensary system.  As far as I am aware, there is not that rotten stigma of pauperism attaching to the dispensary system.  It is true that the system may have defects. The fact that it is, to a certain extent, a legacy to us from the British Government may mean, to those who want to clear out everything and build anew from the foundations, that they would like to sweep away that system completely.  It had the advantage, which people examining the present state of the world and asking themselves seriously where we are going would not consider by any means a disadvantage, that it happened to combine two important things&mdash;firstly, the element of medical assistance for the poorer persons of <Col N="1829" /> the community and, secondly, freedom for the medical officers, since they are only part-time officials, to carry on their private practices.  The present trend of events in other countries which are going in for State services would seem to indicate that, while there may be defects in the existing system, it will be by no means easy to replace that system.  Very often when such a system is replaced it is found, as has been discovered in a neighbouring country recently, that such replacement has serious disadvantages and that in time their disadvantages are even greater than those in the system they supersede.</P>
    <P>The Minister has told us that he will give us plenty of sanatoria, dispensaries and clinics.  He said that when he took office there were 135 different proposals before the Department for the provision of hospitals.  He said that most of these stretched back as far as 1932.  I had thought of putting down a Parliamentary question asking the Minister what exactly were the 135 proposals, most of which went back to 1932.  Irrespective of whether they did or did not go back as far as 1932, the Minister went on to say that they were awaiting decision when he took office but that no one was sufficiently interested to say whether they should be built or not.  One would imagine that the Minister, even in an election campaign, might more worthily devote his attention to explaining to the public what exactly he himself is doing, what he has not been able to accomplish and what he hopes to accomplish in the future, rather than berate his predecessors for alleged neglect.</P>
    <P>I have said that we suffered from a great scarcity of building materials during the war period.  When war broke out a good deal of valuable work had been done in the erection of hospitals throughout the country and in bringing some of the famous Dublin hospitals up to date.  Despite the aid that the Hospitals' Trust Fund gave, the problem of the administration of these institutions, upon which matter the Minister has given very little information to the House, was a matter of the greatest importance.  To build an institution is one thing.  To staff it is <Col N="1830" /> another thing.  To maintain it over period of years and look after it pemanently is quite another matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister himself, in spite of all his enthusiasm, admitted last year that the programme he found before him had to be cut down.  I think he said that it was about £27,000,000 in all and it was his intention to spend £17,500,000 over the next seven years.  He had made an almost identical statement this year.  I fear that the Minister becoming so embarrassed with all the millions of pounds that he is in danger of having them hanging around his neck like a millstone, if one can visualise a millstone made of bare notes.  Obviously, this millstone will make it impossible for him to make the progress that he hoped to make. During the present year, if I have interpreted his opening speech correctly, he has not been able to point to a single building project which has been completed.  I have seen in the newspapers during the past few days advertisements for the building of a sanatorium in Galway.  It will be easily understood that these things take a considerable time.  As the Minister now knows, it takes a number of years to prepare the plans for very large institutions.  Having prepared the plans, it takes a further period of year before the building can be erected.</P>
    <P>We have an example in my own constituency, in Kilkenny, where, before his predecessor left office, a house was acquired for a new sanatorium.  The old sanatorium was an eyesore. It had been a cause of complaint for years, and rightly so, and it was felt that it was a matter of the greatest urgency that it should be replaced but, although the house was actually acquired before we left office, and although it does not seem by any means a tremendous job to get it fitted up and reconstructed, or to change the patients from the existing very unsuitable premises, I cannot see that any progress whatever has been made in the matter except whatever progress the Minister may have made with his own officials and by reason of certain consultations, which I understand, he has had with the local authorities concerned.  That is a simple <Col N="1831" /> example of the delays that will occur even when intentions and desires are of the very best.</P>
    <P>The Minister has told us of the 135 different proposals, of 40 jobs of £100,000 which are to be executed, and 20 of £250,000, some going as far as £1,000,000.  I understood him to say&mdash; perhaps the Minister would correct me if I am wrong&mdash;that it was hoped to provide an additional 6,800 beds for a capital expenditure of £17,500,000.  I do not know whether this capital expenditure envisages anything except building but even if it includes all the equipment that is necessary for a modern hospital, as is probably the case, it means that if the expectation is to make 6,800 beds available for £17,500,000 the cost of each bed is going to be about £2,500 so that the costs are not nearly, as the Minister stated and as I think he will find, twice as great as before the war.  I should be greatly surprised, having regard to the general level of building costs, which seems to have gone up by 300 per cent., if the costs would not be nearer three-fold than two-fold.</P>
    <P>The Minister in reply to a Parliamentary question indicated as he had already indicated last year on his Estimate speech, that the amount of money available to the Hospitals' Trust Fund was about £10,000,000.  On the 31st December, 1948, the total assets of the fund stood at £10,300,000.  The total amount invested at that date was £9,783,000.  Dividends from investments totalled £308,000 for the year 1948.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is not possible to say at this stage what the deficits of the voluntary hospitals will amount to in 1949 but in 1947 the deficits totalled £334,000.  The estimated figure for 1948 is £420,000.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is to say that the dividends from the fund amounted to £308,000 but the hospital deficits were £428,000.  Last year the Minister said he was giving very serious consideration to this question of the deficits.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the figures which I have just mentioned, obviously the yield accruing from the Estimates would not be sufficient to meet the <Col N="1832" /> existing deficits and the question is, if these deficits are to increase, as they must increase having regard to the general increase in maintenance expenses, wages, price of medicines, drugs and in services of all kinds, how the deficiency would be made up.  At the end of this answer the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The full amount of the fund is available for capital expenditure.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If this £10,000,000 is hypotheticated&mdash; I do not know whether that is the right word&mdash;or if it is earmarked to meet hospital deficits in that way and if all the interest accruing from the investments would be needed for that purpose how can it be utilised for capital expenditure?</P>
    <P>I think that another proof of the fact that the country was not quite so neglected by the Fianna Fáil Administration, as the Minister would have some of us believe, was the measure which was passed by this House before we left office which ensured to local authorities that they would not have to bear the burden of the increased liabilities which would otherwise fall on them and which would be very heavy indeed if they had to finance even a percentage of the local public health charges which they had to meet up to that time.  It was arranged by the then Minister, Deputy Dr. Ryan, under legislation which we passed through, that any additional expenditure would have to be borne by the State and until such time as the grants made by the State would reach the level of the then existing expenditure from the local rates, the ratepayers would not be asked to pay further contributions for extensions of the public health services.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, the Minister has now stated that out of an expenditure of £6,900,000 roughly, £2,224,000 is being provided by the State.  That is provided by legislation which we passed and whatever Minister or whatever administration is charged for the time being with public health, will have to meet that liability from the State for the extension of public health services throughout the country until such time as the legislation is amended or is cancelled altogether.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1833" /> As I have said, we tried to meet the position that arises from the difficulty of dealing with the problem of public health to even a greater extent than in the case of social insurance proper, by coming to the aid of the public health authorities throughout the country in that way and by encouraging them through legislation, through propaganda and through certain educational measures, to take advantage of the facilities which the State was offering because the State has certainly made a tremendous gesture and given a wonderful inducement to local authorities to take advantage of the opportunity to equip their local hospitals and other institutions with the most highly qualified staffs and with the best personnel they could possibly secure.  It was complained against the Minister on former occasions&mdash;I should not say former occasion but on the last occasion when he came before the House with his Estimate&mdash;that he rather tended to stress the curative side of his responsibilities rather than the preventive side.</P>
    <P>In connection with the nutritional survey to which he has referred, I think it is quite clear that nutrition and the other factors which come in on the preventive side are so important that on an occasion like this, when we are discussing the general national health, they should be given pride of place.  For example, we are told in connection with tuberculosis that the causes of it arise from poverty, malnutrition and housing.  We have not heard a great deal in the past year or two on this.  We used to hear a great deal before certain Parties came into this House about malnutrition.  One would have thought, from some of the stories that were going the rounds at that time, that there were large sections of the population dying from malnutrition. Where they were not dying from some disease such as tuberculosis, they were simply wasting away from malnutrition.</P>
    <P>It is very valuable that we have this scientific document dealing with the standards of nutrition among representative sections of the Dublin population in the year 1946.  In spite of the very high marriage rate and the <Col N="1834" /> admirable optimism which brought about the excellent state of affairs, it was not by any means a very good year from the food point of view.  Though it was not as bad as 1947, it was not good by any means.  There had been bad weather right on from the summer of that year and it continued until 1947, with serious results on the food output and agriculture.  Nevertheless, I notice from the survey that even the poorest people were able to get practically the full ration of butter and, as the Minister has mentioned, the report was able to say that, with the exception of calcium, the nutrient intake for the representative samples, including slum dwellers and artisans as well as a certain middle-class section, was, broadly speaking, satisfactory. The calcium difficulty arose on account of the 100 per cent. extraction from flour which, owing to the shortage of cereals, we had to adopt at the time.  But after that and while the survey was taking place, the flour was fortified to give the necessary calcium content at any rate.</P>
    <P>The report says that they attribute the lack of calcium, which was the only constituent they seemed to think lacking to a degree that would indicate that we were in any respect whatever below good international standards, to the fact that the milk and cheese consumption was very much below what they would have liked.</P>
    <P>As we are interested in this question of milk, not alone from one aspect, but from the point of view of helping our dairy farmers, it is no harm to mention what exactly the report said in that respect:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The deficiency in calcium was mainly due to the low consumption of milk and cheese.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Further on they say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The main defects of the diets were an insufficient intake of milk, and a lack of variety among the poorer and larger families.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>From the summary of the findings of the National Nutrition <Col N="1835" /> Survey, page 16, paragraphs 3 and 5. As to the consumption of milk they state:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Advisory Committee on Nutrition, Ministry of Health, stated that &lsquo;the desirable amount of milk is for children from one to two pints per day; for expectant and nursing mothers about two pints per day; and for other adult members of the community ½ a pint of milk daily.&rsquo; Basing their figures on these recommendations, Bransby and Magee, in 1947, allowed the following quantities daily: up to 14 years, 1.5 pint; 15 to 20 years, one pint; nursing and expectant mothers, two pints; other adults, 0.5 pint.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The figures for Dublin given in Table 3C, when compared with these allowances, show that the percentages which the actual intakes represent of the requirements are those stated in Table 1.</P>
      <P>In other words, if you take 100 as the standard intake and measure the actual consumption in Dublin families of these representatives types, you find that in the slum family, as it is called, where there are one or two persons the intake is 116; where there are three or four persons it is only 73; five, six or seven persons, 53; eight, nine, ten or 11 persons, 53.  In the case of the artisan family with one or two persons in the family, 189; in the case of three or four persons in the artisan family, 110.  But in the larger artisan families of five, six or seven persons it is only 70, and with eight, nine, ten or 11 persons, 43.  That is to say, that where there are more than two persons in a slum family the percentage of milk consumption falls below what would be the proper standard.  In the artisan family where there are five or more persons in the family, it also falls below the standard.  As the report says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The outstanding feature of the Table is that the milk consumption of the large families in the whole Dublin sample falls seriously short of requirements; in fact, the greater <Col N="1836" /> the need for milk, the less that need is met.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not know that this is a particularly appropriate time for calling attention to the milk question.  But, by way of advertisement, there is a further paragraph in this very excellent report which might interest the Dáil.  I think we should congratulate those who devoted so much time to it.  It was a very difficult question.  They examined it from the point of view of dietetics. They did not examine it from the point of view altogether of £ s. d., but they mention:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The survey brings out the need for food education to encourage the spending of money to the best nutritional advantage.  It emerges, for example, that families of different social grades but of approximately the same proportion of children to adults and the same average food expenditure bought significantly different quantities of food.  Thus with the expenditure on food of 10/-to 15/- per diet head per week, the average consumption of milk rose from 4.1 pints in slum families to 5 pints in middle-class families.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Generally, the conclusion was that the larger the family the less the expenditure per head on food, and apparently that is particularly so in the case of milk.  It is well known that the consumption of milk has been increasing in Dublin and, in spite of the fact that we have had certain shortages, I notice that during the emergency period in regard to eggs we were only reduced from the position of having roughly five eggs per week per head of our population to about four per week.  While our consumption of bacon went down very substantially, we still had a ration and our consumption of fresh meat increased enormously.</P>
    <P>I am sure that trend has continued during the past two years and that our standard of living is not alone comparable to that of other countries but is higher.  I see no reason why we should attempt to conceal that fact. Instead, we should stress it.  Those of us who had responsibility during the emergency and immediately after it know what visitors from other countries thought of our conditions and how <Col N="1837" /> very glad they would have been to exchange their circumstances for ours.</P>
    <P>I have done my duty in opening the discussion on this Vote and hope that the reforms we had envisaged, of getting on with the mother and child scheme, integrating the dispensary medical officer with the local health unit and paying special attention to maternity and infant welfare services, will receive the attention of the Minister.  I would like him to explain, when replying, how the hospital programme he has in mind is to be financed and what scheme is likely to operate in connection with the administration of these hospitals.</P>
    <P>It is quite true that housing, like nutrition, has a great deal to do with the incidence of disease.  While the Minister is to be congratulated on demanding some priority for hospitals as against housing requirements, I now understand from him that about 15 per cent. of the annual output in building will be devoted to hospital construction and improvement.  That is somewhat on the lines we have been expecting. The average annual output in building in pre-war days was about £8,000,000 and it was anticipated that, when building materials were freely available again, if you could aim at that during the first year&mdash;though you would not reach it&mdash;and if during the succeeding period of years you reached £8,000,000 or perhaps £10,000,000, you would be doing very well indeed.  On the basis of the target of £8,000,000, it was anticipated that about £500,000 might be allocated to hospital construction and the figure the Minister has read out seems to indicate that that is his present aim.  However, we have no information before us as to the actual building output for the country as a whole, or for hospitals or public health institutions, during the year.</P>
    <P>It seems that we are still in the region of planning and, in spite of the large programme the Minister mentioned that he had in view last year and that he has spoken so much about and the millions of pounds that he is going to spend, in fact very little actual building work has been brought to a conclusion during the year.  I hope I need not assume from that that considerable schemes are not, for all I <Col N="1838" /> know, in progress ; but if the Minister would enlighten the House a little further in his reply as to what exactly is being done and not merely give us another litany of projects and schemes he hopes to carry out during the coming seven years, some of us would feel that more real work was being accomplished.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I sincerely congratulate the Minister on the courageous and enthusiastic way in which he has faced up to the many problems that confronted him when he came into this important office of Minister for Health. If he is to get a fair chance of dealing with tuberculosis in a reasonable period, he must get the co-operation of all members of the House&mdash;I am sure he will get it&mdash;and also the friendly and active co-operation of public service companies, the Civil Service, local authorities and employers generally, whose workers in some cases are affected in large numbers.</P>
      <P>I wonder if the Minister, since he came into office, has made inquiries or, if he has, whether he has particulars of the varying manner in which different employers treat their workers who are suffering from tuberculosis.  If so, is there any possible chance that he could use his good offices&mdash;or even take the necessary authority, if he has not got it now&mdash;to bring up to a decent Christian standard the way in which employers can help him and his Department in dealing with this terrible problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been asked on a number of occasions to listen to deputations which come to a group with which I an associated, in connection with the varying treatment meted out to workers suffering from tuberculosis. Some of them are employed by the biggest public service companies in this State.  One such corporation, which employs 20,000 workers, had a rule, under the old régime, of striking such people off the payroll and terminating their services at the end of six months.  The Minister will agree that it is not possible to cure any person seriously affected with tuberculosis in that period.  I suggest once again to him&mdash;I have already suggested it&mdash;that  should take an early opportunity, in <Col N="1839" /> the case of public service corporations who are not helping in this matter, to see that they treat their workers in a humane way when they are found suffering from this terrible scourge. Whatever may be the Minister's view as to the minimum period in which a serious case of tuberculosis can be cured, he should lay that down as a standard for the Civil Service, local authorities, public service corporations and every employer of any note. When he does that, he will get the co-operation of people who can help him to go some way to solve this problem.  I know of employers who pay their workers who are suffering from tuberculosis over a period of two years.  I know others who strike them off the full payroll at the end of three months or at the end of six months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Some do not pay them at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.  I know places in this city where the colleagues of the tuberculosis patients make up the full pay for the wives and families of the people who are receiving institutional treatment.  Some reasonable standard should be laid down for the guidance of employers, and the employer who does not come up to that standard should get the works, in plain language. It is a rotten state of affairs for any public service corporation or any employer who professes to be a decent employer to strike off the payroll a man who has given long service and to strike him off without pay and to leave his wife and children at the mercy of the local authority or public health authority.  I am sure that the majority of decent employers will respond to any reasonable request made by the Minister in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to go into the case in detail.  I would merely ask the Minister, if he has not already done so, to make early inquiries and, if necessary, to pay a visit to the institution where members of the Garda who are suffering from tuberculosis are being treated.  I do not know whether or not he is acquainted with the conditions under which a fairly large number of Gardaí are being treated.  The <Col N="1840" /> place itself does not appear to come up to the standard required for the provision of modern curative treatment for people suffering from this terrible scourge.  The cost of providing treatment for members of the Garda is met out of what is known as a medical aid society, a society with very limited funds.  I was amazed to learn, for instance, the manner in which the matron of that particular place is being treated, a lady who had long service many years ago with one of the best surgeons in this country and who has 14 years' service in the place where the members of the Garda are at present being treated.  As far as I know, she has less pay and longer hours than any of the nurses working in our city hospitals.  I shall not go into the matter any further but, if the Minister will take an early opportunity of making inquiries into the conditions, I am sure he will convince himself that some change should be made in the kind of institutional treatment that is provided for members of the Garda suffering from tuberculosis.  I want to say quite definitely that in making these remarks I am not casting any reflection whatever on the medical officer concerned, because he is working under considerable difficulties and I am quite certain that it is not his fault or the fault of the few qualified people who are helping him in this particular place.  I leave it at that.</P>
    <P>I understand that a certain amount of argument and correspondence has been proceeding for some time past between the local authorities in my constituency and the Minister's Department regarding the extent to which the local authority should help to defray the cost of reconstructing institutions in Counties Leix and Offaly. We have been told to-night by Deputy Derrig, in a very reasonable speech&mdash; I congratulate him on the reasonable way that he moved the reference back of this Estimate&mdash;about the huge funds that are at the disposal of the Minister for dealing with public health problems generally.  In these days of rapidly rising rates, and especially in view of the fact that we have millions of money which no other country has the good fortune to have at its disposal, such a high percentage of the <Col N="1841" /> total cost of reconstructing county institutions should not be passed on to the local rates.  If, say, 50, 40 or 30 per cent. is, in the opinion of the Minister, a reasonable figure to pass on to the local ratepayers in a case of this kind, the amount should not be collected out of one year's rates.  If there is any local charge to be borne for the reconstruction of county institutions it should be spread over a period of years and the ratepayers should not be mulcted by having to provide £20,000, £30,000 or £40,000 out of the rates in one year.  I make that suggestion to the Minister and I hope that this long drawn-out correspondence will be brought to an early conclusion by agreement between the Minister and the representatives of the local authorities concerned.</P>
    <P>This is not the first time that I drew attention in this House to the necessity, the urgent necessity in some cases, for the provision of decent dispensaries in the rural parts of my constituency and for the provision of residences for dispensary doctors.  I know of a number of places in my constituency in connection with which proposals have been repeatedly put forward over a period of years by the county manager for the provision of decent housing accommodation for the local dispensary doctor and I know that, as a result of the failure of the local authority to go ahead and provide a decent residence for a dispensary doctor, it is impossible to get highly qualified doctors to come in and act as dispensary doctors and that is understandable.  I know of cases where very good doctors remained only a short while and transferred to other places where better housing accommodation and perhaps better remuneration were made available for them.  I would invite the Minister to take an early opportunity to inquire from the county manager for Leix and Offaly as to the extent to which decent housing accommodation is required for the dispensary officers there and to ask him to furnish a report generally on the condition of the dispensaries and the degree of urgency for the provision of decent houses for dispensary doctors.  The lack of such accommodation is an old grievance in some cases in my area and <Col N="1842" /> it is about time that it was settled in the interests of the whole of the rate paying community and particularly in the interests of those who require treatment by dispensary doctors.  Dispensary doctors are entitled to have modern dispensaries, properly equipped, and to have decent housing accommodation for themselves and their families.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the provision of better schools in many areas.  I assume that the Minister, since he came into office, has made a general survey of that situation.  I know of school-houses in my constituency that are not fit to house Christians, where there is not proper accommodation for the children.  Representations in regard to these matters have been sent recently to the Minister from various portions of my constituency.</P>
    <P>I do not want to detain the House unnecessarily because I am perfectly satisfied that the present Minister for Health is doing everything that can reasonably be expected of him, especially having regard to the short time that has elapsed since he came into office, to face up to and to deal in an effective way with the many major problems that confronted him and that were awaiting solution when he came into office.</P>
    <P>Deputy Derrig mentioned the question of the extent to which the increase in tuberculosis is brought about as a result of malnutrition.  I was speaking to a very prominent county medical officer of health, a man who is well known to almost every member of the House, on this matter some time ago, as a result of what I knew to be a huge increase in the number of cases per head of the population suffering from tuberculosis in a certain portion of my constituency, and he assured me &mdash;and I accept the assurance of this man with long experience&mdash;that 50 per cent. of the increase in tuberculosis in his area in recent times was due to malnutrition.  If that is true, it is a terrible state of affairs and a condition which the Minister will have to face up to, if it is, generally speaking, a picture of the situation throughout the country.  The Minister, so long as he takes such an enthusiastic interest, as <Col N="1843" /> I am sure he always will, in the work entrusted to him, will receive the full support of this group in his efforts to stamp out the terrible scourge of tuberculosis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJMaguire" hpid="Dr. Maguire Dr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last occasion on which I spoke on the Health Estimate I appealed to the Minister to expedite the implementation of the Health Act in so far as it provides for the introduction of maternity and child welfare services, and I am still hoping that he is not overlooking this very essential aspect of the medical services. It is hardly necessary for me to say that the foundation of the health of the community rests on ante-natal and post-natal work, on ensuring that mothers will receive adequate medical attention prior to and after confinement and on the children being attended to from every point of view to ensure that they will in future be the healthy personnel we all would like to see.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very difficult for a dispensary doctor to co-ordinate the various medical services under the present system, and the sooner a comprehensive medical service is established, the better, and the easier it will be for everybody.  Everybody will agree that the medical services of the country centre around the dispensary system. It is a system which, I feel, could scarcely be improved upon as a system, but it is one which, as it exists at the moment, calls for improvements in many directions.  The buildings in a great number of cases are deplorable&mdash; they are shanties&mdash;and, despite the fact that a number of new clinics have been erected throughout the country, there still remains room for the erection of many more.  I feel that in a number of cases, in rural areas particularly, the replacement of these old dispensary buildings by new buildings is unnecessary.  With improvements in transport and so on, the centralisation of good clinics is preferable even to improvement of some of the shanties to which I have referred.  In the erection of new clinics in towns and even in country districts the local medical officer of health should be consulted <Col N="1844" /> as to the site.  I have noticed in a number of urban areas that the clinic has been erected as far away as possible from the residence of the doctor, making it extremely difficult for him during the day, when he is busy, and particularly at night, to attend there.</P>
    <P>In connection with the dispensary system, I note that the Minister contemplates the abolition of the ticket system and the introduction of cards. We all know that the ticket system is archaic and objectionable, but it is a system which, I want to inform the Minister, is practically non-existent.  It has almost died a natural death. Nobody asks for tickets and very few people bring a ticket to the dispensary. I believe that the same will happen with regard to cards.  These are supposed to be renewed every year and, initially perhaps, people will get cards, but at the end of a year they will be discarded and nobody will ask for them, and they also will probably die a natural death.</P>
    <P>When I say that it is difficult for a dispensary doctor to carry out his medical duties, I suggest that, although I am sorry the Minister did not have some experience of dispensary medical work&mdash;he is probably fortunate in that respect&mdash;he will not find it difficult to picture the doctor on a busy dispensary day trying to do his work in connection with the registration of births, marriages and deaths, writing out relief tickets, writing in attendance books, noting the names of patients who come to the dispensary and a host of other secretarial and useless functions.  It is a miracle that, in these circumstances, he finds time to give the patients any medicine at all, and it works out that the examinations of patients in these conditions are very cursory.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJMaguire" hpid="Dr. Maguire Dr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>The facilities in a number of cases are appalling, I admit, even in the new clinics which are physically all right but which are not being kept in a proper state of repair. I do not think I have anything further to say concerning dispensaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1845" /> The Minister mentioned the report from the gastro-enteritis investigation committee and in that regard it is unnecessary for me to appeal to the Minister to ensure as far as possible that food and milk be produced under sanitary conditions.  I almost despair regarding the solution of the problem of gastro-enteritis when I pick up a paper which reports the finding of two milkmen milking cows in a Dublin dairy with their hands soaked in liquid manure.  I know that the production of milk is not the function of the Minister for Health, but I feel that the sanitary production of it should be his function.  Another point I would like to mention is the insanitary system which obtains in public-houses concerning the bottling of beer and stout and the washing of glasses.  I will not go into any details as I hope the majority of us are sufficiently well acquainted with the careless way in which these things are done, but I feel that we will never reach perfection in this regard until the bottling of these commodities is done centrally for certain areas and responsibility removed from the proprietors of the various licensed houses.  With regard to these matters generally I feel that lectures in hygiene, personal and otherwise, should be instituted throughout the country either in the schools for senior children or arranged independently for adults.  I think that the people are badly in need of such information and I feel from my past experience that they appreciate those lectures.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear that the mortality rate in tuberculosis was an improvement. I would like to feel, however, that the lowering of the mortality rate was due to a lowering in the instance of the disease.  From my experience in my county, on the district particularly. I am afraid this is not the case.  I think the instance of tuberculosis in my area is as grave as it has always been since I came there.  I would like to ask the Minister what he proposes to do in connection with the lack of accommodation in County Monaghan Sanatorium, the new sanatorium.  It is quite inadequate, in my opinion, for the needs of the county without our having to devote 30 beds, I think it is, to the use of patients from County <Col N="1846" /> Louth.  It seems incredible that a county like Louth cannot provide itself with a sanatorium.  It certainly should not be because of lack of funds and I really think this is a serious matter. Perhaps the Minister already has it under consideration.  I know I have had complaints only a couple of days ago from the county hospital in Monaghan, which also is very much curtailed from the point of view of beds, that they are cluttered up with patients who are awaiting entry into the sanatorium and this is a condition of affairs which should not exist.  I am glad to hear from the Minister of his contemplated use of St. Kevin's Hospital as a post-graduate school for local government medical officers.  I would be glad to think that a section devoted to the early diagnosis of tuberculosis might be incorporated in the scheme because, in my opinion, therein lies one of the most valuable aids to the eradication of the disease.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Minister for his amendment of Section 44 of the Infectious Diseases Regulations which permits now a female, even though she is a relative, to attend and receive remuneration for looking after the children of a mother who is under treatment in a sanatorium.  It would be appreciated by everybody that in such cases where the services of a female are needed for children of a mother in a sanatorium the most ideal person would be a relative if possible.</P>
    <P>I mentioned to the Minister the last time that I was hoping he would take steps soon to transform Clones Fever Hospital into some type of district hospital, which is very badly needed in the district, if for no other reason than to relieve the congestion in the county hospital in Monaghan.  At the present time, and in fact for some years, I have been using that hospital as other than a fever hospital.  I have had no cases of diphtheria for two years, I am glad to say, with the result that I find myself in the position that I can utilise the hospital for other cases which, had I not the use of beds in the hospital, would have to be sent to the county hospital.  I would impress, therefore, upon the Minister the matter of Clones Fever Hospital and the other two fever <Col N="1847" /> hospitals and ask him to utilise the space and the buildings for anything which he thinks might be useful of helpful to relieve the congestion in either the sanatorium or the county hospital.  I need hardly say to him, of course, as he would probably agree with me, that they would be used mainly for maternity cases, as mothers nowadays are anxious to go, or at least have not an objection to going into hospitals for those occasions as they formerly had.</P>
    <P>Another matter which I mentioned last year in connection with the dispensary system generally was the question of the examination of samples of medicine which, in accordance with the regulations, are supposed to be sent for examination following the receipt of a consignment of drugs.  I would like the Minister at some time to go into the cost to the country generally of the examination of those samples, and he would see, I am sure, that my suggestion of last year would probably save quite a lot of money. It was that a central analyst be appointed to visit the purveyors and suppliers of drugs periodically and when he finds a consignment of drugs en route for a dispensary to take a sample of them and analyse them.  It would save trouble to doctors and expense to the State.</P>
    <P>The eradication of diphtheria, in my opinion&mdash;I am referring to my own district&mdash;has been due to the fact that immunisation clinics were held throughout the district in schools and dispensary buildings.  A new system has cropped up now whereby the county medical officer sends a notice out to the parents of children in certain age groups to bring their children to the clinic for immunisation against diphtheria. I am afraid that the Minister is going to find that system a failure because the parents will pay no more heed to it than they do to the notices concerning vaccination.  I think that, having eradicated diphtheria, every step should be taken to prevent its recurrence.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the Minister will be able to keep track of the actual <Col N="1848" /> number of children being immunised in this manner, because a number of the children will go to their private family doctor, as they are entitled to do, and with one thing and another, I feel the new system is not going to be as successful as the former one.  I assure the Minister that I am not looking for work in connection with the matter, but I feel that this is not a system that will be successful.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which I want to draw the attention of the Minister and that is the anomaly that exists in the committing of mental cases.  Under the present system the dispensary doctor must certify a patient for committal to a mental hospital. A case occurred quite recently where a patient undergoing treatment for a brain tumour in the county hospital in Monaghan had to be transferred to the mental hospital and I had to travel a distance of 12 miles to bring along the county medical officer to commit this patient.</P>
    <P>A further case occurred last week where a girl, who entered as a voluntary patient into the mental hospital in Monaghan, had eventually to be certified and her people were compelled to bring their dispensary medical officer a distance of 60 miles in order to certify that patient.  I feel there is something radically wrong with that system which certainly calls for amendment. I cannot see why any doctor is not in a position to certify any patient if, of course, the patient is insane.</P>
    <P>Some time ago I asked the Minister a question concerning medical officers who, under the provisions of the Local Government Officers Age Limit Order, 1946, are compelled to retire at 65. Admittedly the Minister pointed out at the time that these men were appointed without any conditions such as those attaching to other appointments.  The jobs which they undertook were of a specialised nature requiring certain unusual qualifications and these men had reached a certain age before they could qualify for the appointments.  The result was that having been forced by this Order to retire at 65 they were not in a position to complete the requisite number of years to derive the maximum pension.  At the time the Minister <Col N="1849" /> pointed out that a certain number of years could be added in order to bring up their pension status but my case is that, apart altogether from this grievance, I consider that this arrangement is a breach of contract between the Department and the medical officers.  When one remembers that, when the regulations were made compelling women teachers to retire on marriage, provision was made so that the regulations would not apply to those who had married prior to the introduction of the new regulations, then I consider that these medical officers have a reasonable grouse.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that the Minister mentioned the question of nurses generally and their welfare.  I would like to inform him, however, that nurses in some private homes&mdash;some of them reputable homes&mdash;are being exploited in this country.  I had to bring this matter to his notice some time ago and I would like to think that he will continue to keep the situation in mind and zealously guard the interests of these nurses.  Their periods of duty are in many cases intolerable.  These people are giving a great service to the community and for that reason I would be anxious that any grievances they have would be rectified at the earliest possible moment.</P>

      <P>I wish to join in the tributes paid to the Minister for the success of his Department and to congratulate him on his accomplishments during the year.  In the course of his statement he made reference to hospital buildings and a particularly big programme and then went on to discuss tuberculosis.  In discussing tuberculosis he made reference to the fact that when people are cured an essential to keeping them cured was good housing, but after that he sheered away from the subject and went on to discuss other things.  He had stated that good housing was good medicine for tuberculosis patients.  He has £10,000,000 in the Hospital Fund and if he believes in the theory that good housing is an essential in the cure of tuberculosis surely some of that money should be allocated for the building of houses suited for tuberculosis cases.</P>

      <P>The fact that they are not here to make an attack on the Minister is a tribute to Dr. Browne that they have confidence in his work.  We all feel that the fact that there is nobody here to attack his report is a compliment that he has well deserved.  I shall get away from the subject of housing. The only reason why I mentioned it was because the Minister, in his opening statement, mentioned proper housing conditions as a good follow-up for patients coming from sanatoria. Only last week I came across the case of a young married woman who had been one and a half years in Rialto Hospital.  It cost the rates £400 in one and a half years to improve that young woman's health.  When she came out of the sanatorium as a perfect cure she was sent back to a small miserable single room in a two-roomed cottage where, in the next room, there was also a tuberculosis case with two children with tuberculosis.  Fancy that number of tuberculosis cases in two small rooms.  I hope that some day the Minister will be able to see his way to ask the House to recommend that legislation be passed so that hospital funds will be used for the building of houses for such people.  At the moment the Corporation of Dublin have 30,000 people on the waiting list and amongst those on that waiting list are at least 1,000 tuberculosis cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We wish to congratulate the Minister also in regard to the fall in the death <Col N="1851" /> rate.  He is satisfied that the improvement will continue.  In that connection may I say that one should pay tribute to the Infant Aid Society and to those connected with child welfare and the schools meals scheme whereby milk in very large quantities is made available for children in need of same and those people are anxious to provide more if there should be a demand?  I am not quite clear about what the Minister said in his statement in regard to the death rate in tuberculosis and cancer. I would ask him to give us a little more information on what his Department is doing or is going to do so far as cancer research is concerned.  Are we in Dublin to be told, or are we being told that the death rate in cancer now equals the death rate in tuberculosis&mdash; or are they so close to one another? We do not talk as much about the death rate in cancer as we talk about the death rate in tuberculosis but, because we do not talk about it, that does not mean that we are not to think about it and to do everything possible to get a campaign going that will eventually succeed in creating improvements in the cancer position in the same way as the Minister for Public Health has referred to improvements and the equipment necessary to ease the tuberculosis position.  The House ought to devote more attention now to the problem of cancer and to its remedy.  I would stop at nothing whilst there is £10,000,000 in the Hospitals' Trust Fund lying there waiting to be used in the interests of the public.  I would go to the ends of the earth to get information and to indulge in research in so far as cancer is concerned in the hope that some day we will be able to find a remedy for it.</P>
    <P>I am interested, too, in the treatment of epileptic cases.  I have in mind a report which I read a short while ago in that connection and, indeed, only a few days ago I saw a workman in one of the main streets in the centre of the City of Dublin carrying a boy of about 16 years of age, a sufferer from these fits.  I understand that there are remedies for those fits and, if there are not, there should be <Col N="1852" /> research to try to find remedies for them.</P>
    <P>I do not say that there is neglect, but there are a number of cases in all parts of Ireland that are not getting the attention they should get.  One of the Deputies referred to mental defectives. What about those who are only slightly mentally defective?  What about the young person who is referred to at school as a &ldquo;backward child&rdquo;? We sometimes see a fine boy or a nice little girl of about ten years of age stepping aside from the rest of the children with a little blank look on his or her face.  On inquiry we are told that those children are backward children. Something should be done to see that the backward child is not allowed to drift into becoming a mentally defective child.  I believe that the Minister has all these things at heart and that he is determined to make a success of his job.  That is the reason why I bring these points to his notice.</P>
    <P>I was in a hospital recently and I heard a very eminent lady in the medical profession give the Minister a title&mdash;&ldquo;go-getter Browne&rdquo;.  She said he was a real go-getter, and that he is determined to do things.  I hope that title will stick to him.  It is a title which, I think, anyone of us would like to have.  She said he was a go-getter and that if things were a bit slow that it was not his fault.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputy Derrig to-night first giving slight praise and then telling the Minister that, in respect of most of the things which he is doing now, the foundations were already laid. That may be so and, even if it is so, it is a good thing that we had a go-getter there to resurrect them and to take, as it were, out of the pigeon holes the plans that were in them.</P>
    <P>May I again stress what I said about the mentally defective child?  I know that mental defectives are being dealt with, but my anxiety is that the mentally defective child will not be brushed aside.  There are such children to be found in every town in Ireland and nobody will pay attention to them. As in the case of sightless children, the parents do not want to part with <Col N="1853" /> them until it is too late.  If we could encourage the parents of these children to send them to some place where they would be properly looked after it would be much better.  However, the trouble is that, as yet, no such place has been provided for them&mdash;and that is my reason for mentioning such children.  I have met some of the mothers.  They have asked me, when the child was beginning to get out of hand, about the matter.  Yet, because the children were not a certain age, or because there was not a declaration from some doctor, or because the children were not declared as mental&mdash; just because they were backward&mdash;they were brushed aside.  I implore the Minister to do something about that matter.  Again, I congratulate him on the success of his work.</P>
    <P>I know, A Leas-Chinn Chomhairle, that you do not like to hear the word &ldquo;finally&rdquo; because you think that something is coming which will last for ten minutes and that there will be another final declaration but, in conclusion, I should like to say just one more thing.  Does the Minister know that it is as hard to get a patient into a hospital in Dublin to-day as it was five years ago?  People are coming to me every other day, and I am sure to other Dublin Deputies, asking us how they can get a bed for a patient in a Dublin hospital.</P>
    <P>The Dublin dwellers have a dread of going to one of the best hospital institutions that we have in the country. It was formerly the Dublin Union Hospital and is now known as St. Kevin's Hospital.  It is one of the best-equipped hospitals we have, and the patients who go there get the best medical and nursing attention that it is possible to get.  In spite of all that, Dublin people will not go there.  They would not go even if the entrance gates were made of gold.  They feel that it still has the touch about it that it was the Dublin Union Hospital 25 years ago.  As a Dublin citizen myself I sympathise with them, but they come to me and say: &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Byrne, is the only place for us the Dublin Union Hospital?&rdquo; I am sorry for them.  I suggest to the Minister that he ought to go ahead and do something to provide <Col N="1854" /> a good hospital for Dublin, with plenty of beds, at the earliest possible moment.  If he does, I am satisfied that he will have the prayers and good wishes of all those who are seeking his help.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to go into the tuberculosis question.  I know that I have been a bit of a nuisance to the Minister and to his predecessor in pleading with them for beds for tuberculous patients. In the last few months, I have not got any complaints, and, therefore, I am not going to manufacture any.  I understand there has been an easement of the position so far as beds for tuberculous cases are concerned.  I will say this that it is very hard to get a tuberculous child into any hospital or sanatorium. Parents have to wait for months and months before they can get a child into one.  If the Minister can do anything to improve bed accommodation in our sanatoria which deal with cases of tuberculous children, I hope he will do it quickly and so relieve the minds of the parents of those children.</P>

      <P>The position is, as stated by the last speaker, that there is a shortage of bed accommodation in the Dublin hospitals.  That has been the position over the last number of years.

      <P>We all have had the experience of trying to get people into city hospitals.  Even doctors find a difficulty in getting hospital accommodation for their patients.  The shortage of bed accommodation is certainly acute.  This is a problem which the Minister or some future Minister will have to take up seriously.  There is an urgent necessity for a large central hospital in Dublin to relieve the position as we know it to-day.  I was rather disappointed with the Minister's presentation of his Estimate to the House. I agree, of course, that he went into a lot of detail, but he never said anything about the health of the poor Deputies or that he would look after <Col N="1856" /> them in any way.  However, we will leave that for another day.</P>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that, in the case of doctors who specialise in the treatment of certain diseases, he should provide every opportunity for them to develop their talents and so help to relieve suffering humanity.  While I agree that the Minister has set up a number of consultative bodies to deal with various types of diseases, I still hold that he has not gone far enough in that direction.  I have in mind a number of doctors in Dublin and throughout the country who specialise in the treatment of disease.  In their case, I should like to see the resources of the State utilised to provide them with laboratories and other means to carry on their great work.  I know an eminent Dublin surgeon who, at the moment, is spending a lot of his own money in carrying out research work. The State should take cognisance of work of that character and assist men of that type.  There are other aspects of that question that I hope to deal with when we resume the debate on Tuesday.  I move to report progress.</P>
