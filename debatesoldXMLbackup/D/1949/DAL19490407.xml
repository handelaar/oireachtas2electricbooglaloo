    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Army Service and Appointments.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeanKeane" hpid="Mr. Keane Mr. Keane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if the Local Appointments Commission and the Civil Service Commission allow special marks for Army service to exArmy men applying for positions under local authorities and in the Civil Service; if circulars were issued by the Government directing the commissions to allow these marks and what proportion of marks are allowed for the maximum six years' service and if the commissions have carried out Government policy in this regard in filling positions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the practice of both the Local Appointments Commissioners and the Civil Service Commissioners to award extra marks for full-time, permanent service in the Defence Forces in open competitions, by interview-board procedure, for professional, technical and other posts, and also in open competitive examinations. Such marks are not awarded, however, in competitions for posts of classes for which special competitions, confined to members or former members of the Defence Forces have been held.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I should mention, incidentally, that extra marks are also given, though, of course, at lower rates, for service, during the emergency period, in the various auxiliary defence organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The practice of both commissions in the matter of extra marks for service in the Defence Forces is in accordance with decisions which have been taken by the Government, and communicated to the commissions, from time to <Col N="2518" /> time.  The extra marks are awarded in relation to the length of the fulltime permanent service rendered by the individual candidates in the period from the 2nd September, 1939, to the 31st October, 1946, up to a maximum of six years' service.  I am satisfied that both commissions have carried out Government policy in this regard with scrupulous care.</P>
    <P>It is considered inadvisable to state the precise details of the proportion of marks allowed for service in the Defence Forces, for the reason which I mentioned in the course of my reply to a question by Deputy Sweetman on the 21st July, 1948, namely, that, if an interview board were aware of the effect which such extra marks would have on the final placings of individual candidates, the members of the board might unconsciously be influenced in assessing the relative merits of the candidates in other respects.  As I pointed out on that occasion, the present position is that a board can confine themselves to the relative merits of candidates in regard to their professional or technical qualifications and suitability, and determine their placings solely with regard to these considerations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanKeane" hpid="Mr. Keane Mr. Keane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to inform the Taoiseach that some ex-members of the Army feel that there is a certain prejudice militating against them at interview boards.  I wonder if it would be fair to those people to have on these interview boards one person with Army service?  I am afraid, with regard to the Civil Service Commissioners, that at some time or another the decision of the Government was not implemented&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If the Deputy will give me information about any specific case I will have it inquired into.  I think that the point which is probably pressing on his mind is covered by the <Col N="2519" /> reply.  The reason why the actual amount of preference for Army service is not indicated to the members of the selection board is in order to try and avoid the very thing the Deputy is worried about, namely, prejudice about Army service.  As I say, if the Deputy will give me details in regard to any specific case I will have it looked into.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcCann" hpid="Mr. McCann Mr. McCann">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCann</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether his statement when speaking to the Friends of the National Collection of Ireland, that the artistic conscience of the British is becoming uneasy at the retention of the Lane pictures, is his own opinion or an opinion based on negotiations which have taken place; and whether the Government has made recent representations for the return of the Lane collection; and, if so, with what result.</P>

      <P>The statement to which the Deputy refers was an expression of my own opinion.  Representations of an informal character have, in fact, been made to the British Government, urging the return of the Lane pictures, but, so far, these representations have produced no tangible result.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Social Welfare Act, 1948, made provision whereby the statutory rate of sickness and disablement benefit was increased from 15/- and 7/6 per week to 22/6 and 15/- per week, respectively, and contributions were increased to meet the higher rates of benefit.  The revenue derived from increased contributions to the National Health Insurance Fund in the past financial year is not known, as the returns of stamps sold at post offices in recent months are not yet available. The amount of such increased revenue up to 31st December, 1948, was £66,337.</P>
      <P>The estimated amount of such increased revenue in the current financial year is £475,000, made up of £266,000 from employers and £209,000 from insured persons.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will state the total increase of revenue derived from increased contributions to social insurance funds during the year 1948-49 and estimated for the year 1949-50.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Social Welfare Act, 1948, provision was made for increased payments to beneficiaries under various social services, and in other cases cash supplements formerly paid under an Emergency Powers Order were consolidated with the basic statutory rates of benefit.  The Act also provided for higher contributions but the increased revenue so derived in respect of the 1948-49 year is not yet known as the returns of stamps sold at post offices in recent months are not available.</P>
      <P>The amount of such increased revenue for the quarter ended 31st December, 1948, was £156,191.  The estimated amount of the increased revenue in the year 1949-50 is £1,071,000 made up of £579,000 from employers and £492,000 from insured persons.</P>

      <P>In the case of secondary schools the only increases in examination fees are those which have been made in the case of the entrance fees for the certificate examinations, the fee per candidate having been increased from 2/6 to 4/- for the Intermediate Certificate and from 2/6 to 5/for the Leaving Certificate.  The approximate additional revenue resulting from these increases was £1,250 in the financial year 1948-49, and it is anticipated that the corresponding figure for 1949-50 will be £1,300.</P>
      <P>As regards the technical school examinations for evening students, increases have taken place in examination fees with effect from the commencement of the 1948/49 school session as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The former fee of 1/6 has been increased to 2/6; the 2/3 fee to 5/- and the 3/- fee to 7/6.  In the case of the entrance examinations to courses for training of vocational and technical teachers the former fees of 5/- have been increased to 10/- and the former fees of 10/- have been increased to £1. Fees for other examinations in connection with teaching qualifications have been raised in two cases from 10/- to £1 to bring them into line with the fees for examinations of a similar standard conducted by the Department.</P>
      <P>There was an increase of approximately £1,300 in fees received for technical school examinations for the financial year 1948-49.  It is anticipated that in the current financial year there will be an additional increase in revenue of approximately £200, due to special additional examinations occurring in that year.</P>
      <P>No increase has been made in fees in connection with the primary branch.</P>

      <P>The average attendance at Reengaroga National School fell below seven for the calendar year 1947. There has been correspondence with the reverend manager and with the inspector as to what is the correct figure of average attendance for the calendar year 1948, but the matter has not yet been brought to issue and further inquiries are being made.  If the correct average attendance is found to be less than seven (6.5 being regarded as seven for this purpose) the school will have to be discontinued and it would be necessary that an average attendance of at least ten be maintained before it could again be recognised.</P>

      <P>Had the controls on the acquisition and distribution of farmers' butter not been removed, an additional sum of about £70,000 would have had to be provided for the payment of subsidies in the financial year 1948-49; but they were removed because experience <Col N="2527" /> has shown that the only real beneficiaries under this subsidy arrangement were the producers of grossly inferior butter who, under the provisions of the subsidy scheme, were virtually guaranteed as high a price as was payable for the best farmers' butter on offer.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he will state the estimated subsidy for one year for the purchase of wheat based on prices effective in (a) March, 1948; (b) June, 1948; and (c) in 1949-50 (estimated).</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost of the flour subsidy depends on the prices of imported and native wheats and the proportion of each used in the grist in a particular period.</P>
      <P>The estimated subsidy for one year on the basis of the price of Argentine wheat which was in course of shipment in March, 1948, would be £18,000,000 if no other wheat were used in the grist.  If only native wheat purchased from growers at 55/- per barrel were used the annual cost would be approximately £6,600,000 and at a price of 62/6 per barrel to growers the cost would be approximately £8,380,000.</P>
      <P>On the basis of the price of Australian wheat used in the grist in June, 1948, the annual cost of the subsidy would be approximately £9,850,000 if no other wheat were used.</P>
      <P>If the actual grists used in March, 1948, and June, 1948, were maintained for a full year, the subsidy costs would be approximately £8,000,000 and £13,470,000 respectively.</P>
      <P>The estimated cost of the subsidy for 1949-50 financial year is £6,781,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Customs clearance at Cobh, though expedited as much as possible, is hampered by the limited accommodation available for the work. This difficulty has been added to by the practice of allowing relatives and friends of passengers to go out to the liners and to return on the tender with the disembarking passengers.  An added complication has been the fact that certain detections of smuggling by these relatives and friends have been made in recent months.  As a result of communications between the customs officials at Cobh and the shipping companies it has been agreed, as a matter of mutual interest and to avoid clearance delays, that this traffic should be kept within bounds by the issue of passes limited to people who have definite business to transact, or who have special reasons for visiting the ship.</P>

      <P>I have noted that no statement was made in Dáil Éireann on Thursday, March 31st, that documents had been abstracted from files in the Office of the Commissioners of Public Works.  The Minister for Justice did state on that occasion that documents were missing from the Office of Public Works.</P>
      <P>In September, 1940, the Commissioners of Public Works made a contract with A.J. Fennessy, Limited, for the supply and delivery to Government establishments in Dublin City and district of 4,000 tons of machine-won turf.  In September, 1941, the Commissioners of Public Works made a contract with A.J. Fennessy, Limited, for the haulage of 2,500 tons of turf from Clonsast bog to depôts in Dublin and the storage and ricking of the turf at these depôts.  Delivery dockets in respect of the turf supplied and/or hauled under these contracts are missing, having been destroyed after a standard period had elapsed.  Claim forms and the paid cheques referable thereto in respect of these contracts have not been segregated as between these contracts and others which the firm of A.J. Fennessy had with the commissioners at this time, so that it is not possible to state with certainty whether or not all the above claim forms and associated paid cheques are now available.</P>
      <P>Police inquiries have revealed that while particulars of turf sold to A.J. Fennessy, Limited, by Bord na Móna are available for the periods 10/9/40 to 30/11/40 and 15/3/41 to 11/6/41, they are not available for the period 1/12/40 to 14/3/41.</P>

      <P>Following a detailed examination, increased wages were granted to the operational staff of the Shannon navigation with effect from the 1st January, 1947.  The rates fixed represented considerable improvements on former rates.  In some cases, while hours of duty may be considered long, actual hours worked would be few, dependent, for example, on the arrival and departure of barges.  Most employees on the Shannon navigation occupy houses free of rent (in many cases with plot of ground attached) and, on the whole, their wages and conditions of duty are on the basis generally adopted for employment of the character in question. A further review of the wages has recently taken place, however, as a result of which increases have been <Col N="2535" /> authorised with effect from the 1st January, 1949.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice whether he is aware of the great delay that occurs in the District Court through the requirement that depositions in criminal cases be taken in longhand and then read over to the witness and that this procedure is <Col N="2541" /> responsible for the clogging-up of the machinery of the Dublin District Court, that it causes heavy loss of time to accused persons and witnesses, places a severe mental strain on accused persons, puts them to considerable costs and expenses that could be avoided and increases the cost to the public of the District Court; and, if so, whether he will take the matter up with the appropriate committees and authorities with a view to the early adoption of a procedure by which the depositions could be recorded in shorthand or by approved mechanical means thus obviating the many objections and delays arising from the archaic and unsatisfactory system at present in use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>The present procedure on the preliminary investigation of indictable charges involves the reading over of the evidence, as recorded in the deposition, in the presence of the accused and of the deponent who is then required to sign the deposition. This procedure takes time but I am satisfied that it is time well spent and that there is no case for any radical alteration in the existing procedure.</P>
      <P>There is no requirement which precludes the use of the typewriter for taking depositions and there can be no objection to the use of this method (particularly if a silent typewriter is employed) by a person who is sufficiently skilled both as a typist and as a taker of depositions.  But, apart from the fact that there are few such persons available, it is doubtful whether the use of the typewriter results in any worth-while saving of time in court and there is good authority for the view that the most satisfactory way of ensuring that depositions are properly taken is to record them in longhand.</P>
      <P>For obvious reasons the use of shorthand is not permissible except under conditions which would involve as much delay for all concerned as the present procedure and more inconvenience. Various other mechanical devices that have been suggested and considered from time to time have had to be ruled out as impracticable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister <Col N="2542" /> aware that a very large volume of judicial and legal opinion favours a change in the procedure, and is the Minister further aware that the preliminary investigation of cases in the Dublin District Courts continues now for as long as four to five months?  Is the Minister further aware that in Britain last week the preliminary investigation in a murder trial, in which evidence was taken from 33 witnesses, finished within a day and a half?  In view of those facts would the Minister agree to reconsider the matter in consultation with both Circuit Court judges and district justices?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I will have the matter examined further.  My information is that, while the system has its disadvantages, it has very many advantages for the accused.  Every accused person is entitled to a reasonable chance of defending himself and in the long run the present system is considered one of the best methods of ensuring that.  I agree that the delay is very great.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that, apart from the fact that the charge may be hanging over the head of the accused person for a long period, it is very expensive to have to travel to court week after week or fortnight after fortnight over a period of three or four months?  It involves the State in very heavy expense. Surely, if a more simplified method could be adopted, it would be to the advantage of everybody.</P>

      <P>(i) I cannot trace any statement in Dáil Éireann on Thursday, 31st March, that documents had been abstracted from files in the Department of Defence, but it was stated that certain documents were missing.  (ii) From inquiries, I am satisfied that the custom has been to destroy delivery documents three years after payment.  Hence when documents were sought in January, 1948, with reference to purchases in 1940 and 1941, such documents were not available.  (iii) and (iv) Consequently the question of investigation did not arise.  (v) If any further inquiries are made by the Detective Branch, I will facilitate them in every way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that the Castleblayney boot factory was closed down some weeks ago and is still closed ; that the workers were informed that the factory was closed because the market was flooded with imported footwear; and, if so, whether he will state the extent to which the present condition of this factory is influenced by the importation <Col N="2545" /> of footwear; the conditions under which foreign footwear was admitted to this country and the steps which he is prepared to take where employers shut down plant in such circumstances, thus penalising the workers employed in such plant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised that the factory to which the Deputy refers has been closed for some weeks but that it is hoped to reopen it for short-time working in the near future.  I understand that the factory was closed because of a reduction in orders from distributors.  The owners of this factory, and other producers, have stated that the difficulties of the industry were caused by heavy imports of footwear during 1947 and the first six months of 1948.  The importation of footwear is regulated by quota under the Control of Imports Acts and footwear can be imported only under licence.</P>
      <P>Licences for the importation of 1,250,000 pairs were issued in the year 1947, and the import quota for the period January to June, 1948, which was fixed in November, 1947, was 625,000 pairs.  Since then imports have been very substantially restricted by the quotas determined by the present Government in consultation and agreement with the footwear manufacturers and other sections of the trade.  The quota for the period July to December. 1948, was 150,000 pairs; for the period January to June, 1949, it is 200,000 pairs.  The actual imports in the second half of 1948 were only 105,000 pairs, and in January and February. 1949, 15,500 pairs.</P>
      <P>There is no action I can take to restrain employers from closing down manufacturing plants in circumstances such as those to which the Deputy refers.</P>

When the Garda Síochána were making inquiries about the petrol irregularities to which this and earlier questions referred, they asked to be provided with the petrol record cards in the case of a particular individual for the period from March, 1940, to February, 1943.  It was always the practice in the Department of Supplies and it has been the practice in the Department of Industry and Commerce to destroy petrol record cards 12 months after the period to which they relate.  The petrol record cards in respect of the individual case on which the Garda were inquiring for the period covered by the inquiry had been destroyed in accordance with this practice.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>When we reported progress last night, I was endeavouring to point out to the House the very meagre provision made by the present Minister in this Estimate for the work of the <Col N="2555" /> Land Commission.  I would ask the House to examine the Estimate and to ask what is wrong with the Land Commission. If one takes the figures set out in the Estimate, one will see that on a conservative estimate, practically half of the total figure is going on salaries, wages and expenses so that out of a total expenditure of £1,500,000 for the work of the Land Commission, virtually £750,000 is being eaten up in salaries, wages, allowances, travelling expenses, incidental expenses and expenses of one kind or another that do not bring any relief whatsoever to the people whom the Land Commission are really supposed to benefit.  I would ask Deputies whether administrative expenses of approximately £750,000 are justified in expending a total of, say, another £750,000.  To bring the benefits of the £750,000 that is left, to the people for whom they are intended, the Minister has to incur administrative expenses in official salaries of one kind or another amounting to £750,000.  I wonder what Deputies who are members of local authorities would say if, for instance, it took £50,000 to expend a grant of £100,000 given to a local authority.  If you had a position like that arising in the case of expenditure by a local authority or by any business man, the local authority or the business man would consider the whole system crazy.  Here, at all events, we have the fact that approximately £750,000 of the total Estimate of £1,500,000 is earmarked for salaries, wages and expenses of one kind or another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was comparing last night this Estimate, which can be considered as the first normal Estimate one would expect for the Land Commission since the war, with the Estimate in the last normal year prior to the war, 1936-37, and I was proceeding to examine the respective figures in these Estimates and the results achieved.  In 1936-37, I pointed out to the House, there was £606,550 available for the improvement of estates.  The total Estimate for the Department of that year was £1,578,379.  Taking again the valuation put by the present Minister for Finance on the £ sterling&mdash;he says that on <Col N="2556" /> present-day values the £ sterling is worth only 10/- as compared with prewar&mdash;and taking the amount of work that can be done for the £ sterling at present, we may assume that the amount levied in 1936-37 was equal to an expenditure of £3,000,000 this year and that the results achieved for that expenditure would be correspondingly greater.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated, in introducing the Estimate, that, for the last year, the Land Commission had divided 20,000 acres, but these must be rather optimistic figures because, as I pointed out to the House, up to the 30th September last there were only 6,006 acres divided, while the total expenditure for the year was £1,530,550.  If we compare that with the amount of land divided for £1,578,379 in 1936-37, we find that according to the <i>Statistical Abstract</i> for 1938, there were 77,250 acres divided in that year.  So that for an expenditure of £1,500,000 odd in the last normal year before the war, we had 77,250 acres divided, while for an expenditure of £1,530,550 this year the Minister estimates that we have only 20,000 acres divided and, up to last September, only 6,000 acres were divided.  It is obvious from these figures that there is something radically wrong in the functioning of the Minister's Department, that we are not getting value for the money expended and that it is sheer waste to provide this colossal sum, colossal in proportion to the very small output of work that seems to have been achieved during the past 12 months.</P>
    <P>It is also true to state that the normal work done by Land Commission gangers, from my experience throughout the West at all events, has been discontinued.  Numbers of these gangers and their gangs were laid off some time ago &mdash; approximately two months ago.  Everyone one meets in the congested areas will point out that the work normally done by the Land Commission gangers and their gangs is virtually at a standstill.  In the Minister's astoundingly brief statement on the introduction of the Estimate he does not give any reason for that.  He does not say whether it was due in the main to the lack of finance in his <Col N="2557" /> Department.  At all events, there must be some reason why the work that should be done by the Land Commission in a normal year has been discontinued.</P>
    <P>On the question of salaries, wages and expenses the Minister used to be very loquacious before he became Minister.  He was, as a matter of fact, very critical of what Ministers' salaries and allowances should be and suggested that they were far and away too high.  He has been rather silent on that recently, but it has been disclosed that during the last year increases in salaries in the Civil Service, including the Minister's own Department, have cost £500,000.  I think the Minister for Finance has estimated that these increases will cost £750,000 in a full year.  If the Minister was so concerned, as he appeared to be before he became Minister, for the plight of the congested areas, surely before agreeing to provide £750,000 for increases to civil servants about whose salaries he was so critical before he took office, he could have got portion of that money to add to his Estimate for the relief of congestion and for the normal work of the Land Commission?  Surely that £750,000 would provide some relief for the congested areas ?</P>
    <P>In the Minister's Department alone the increase in salaries, compared with the normal year pre-war, is simply phenomenal.  This year, salaries, wages and allowances amount to £494,398, and if you add the increase in remuneration at the end of this Estimate it brings the figure up to £517,808, as compared with salaries, wages and allowances in 1937-38, £291,181.  That means we have jumped over 50 per cent. from 1937-38 to the Estimate we are now discussing.  At the same time, our output has been lowered from 77,000 acres to the figure the Minister gave.  Evidently, this Irish Land Commission provides a very nice, easy life for a large number of gentlemen who seem to be doing nothing.  That is the situation disclosed by the comparison of these figures.</P>
    <P>We expected from the Minister, particularly in view of the tears he <Col N="2558" /> shed before he became Minister, that there would be some spurt in dealing with congestion and that acquisition and division would be rushed so as to make a major attack on the problem. The contrary appears to be the case, in accordance with the figures before us and the work we know the Land Commission has not been doing over the last 13 months.  If the Minister would state what the position is to be for the future and hold out any hope of a line of action to deal with the problem, if he could hope that in a year or two he would be able to show results, we might not be so critical. But Deputy Killilea, two days ago, asked the following Parliamentary question:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To ask the Minister for Lands if he will state the amount of land acquired in the midland and eastern counties for the provision of migrants' holdings, allotments, etc., since the removal of the close-down Order.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And the Minister's reply was:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The best I can do for the Deputy is to tell him that since restrictions were removed the Land Commission have inspected over 5,000 acres in the five counties which I think he has in mind and have started acquisition proceedings for over 3,000 acres.  Later in the year we shall see the results in the taking of actual possession.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In 15 months, if all the Land Commission is able to offer as a solution for the congestion or land slum problem is that they have inspected 5,000 acres, no reasonable Deputy can see ground for hopes of ending the problem.  With their snail-like progress in acquiring land, if by now they have only reached the stage of inspecting 5,000 acres.  God knows when we will reach the stage when the owners of the 5,000 acres will be before the courts in accordance with the normal procedure.  If that is all the land earmarked to go into the pool, if that 5,000 acres of inspection represents the activity of the Minister and his minions over the past 15 months, there is something definitely wrong.  There is no sign that any real <Col N="2559" /> attempt is being made by the Minister or his officials to face the problem and provide a solution for it.</P>
    <P>The Minister and some of his colleagues were very loud in their condemnation of Deputies interfering with the work of the Land Commission. Time and time again we have heard various complaints laid at the doors of different Deputies, particularly on this side of the House, that they were interfering with the work and that political influence was being brought to bear on the acquisition and distribution of land and the provision of additions of land for allottees.  It may have come as a shock to most Deputies to have the Minister admitting last night that, in one case at all events, he succeeded in preventing the settlement of an estate in the West of Ireland by his interference.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I said I prevented an injustice being done, which is a different thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran </NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister suggests he prevented an injustice being done, the injustice being, presumably, that the Minister was afraid that his own political henchmen were not coming well out of the division.  Therefore, he comes along to the people concerned and stops them from signing the proposed agreement which the Land Commission engineers had prepared for the resettlement of that particular estate.  If the Minister prevented an injustice being done, he waited quite a long time to remedy that injustice and do anything for the people concerned.  So far as I am aware&mdash;and the Minister will correct me if I am wrong&mdash;since he interfered with the rearrangement of the estate I have referred to at Kiltarsechane nothing whatever has been done for the people there, who are left in the same position, with one man's back door opening on to the general man's front door and with general squabbles and trespass, due to the lack of fencing and the lands being mixed up.  Those people have had to put up with that over a great number of years. If the Minister was so interested in the tenants of Kiltarsechane at that time as to stop the scheme which had <Col N="2560" /> been prepared by the Land Commission, and stop this injustice that he now says was the reason for his interference, surely, now that he is in power and in a position to direct the minions of the Land Commission, he could have done something to take those people out of those land slums? If he did stop one division, he at least might suggest one that would be acceptable to those people, still waiting to see the Minister in their midst, and he might provide an alternative scheme to the one the Land Commission were providing at that particular time.</P>
      <P>That, at all events, is an admission from the Minister that he was prepared to interfere with the work of the Land Commission in that particular instance. I am suggesting to the Minister, on this question of interference in the work of the Land Commission, that it is taking place in many other cases&mdash; and not for the very good reason that the Minister now states, for the purpose of preventing injustice.  I want to place on the records of this House and bring to the Minister's mind the question of the estate of Mrs. John Joyce at Errew, outside Castlebar. This estate was left there by an individual who left that part of the country. It was sublet for a number of years. The estate included an addition which was provided for the owner by the Irish Land Commission.  I raised the matter here on a number of occasions and asked the Land Commission to have this estate distributed between the local uneconomic holders, in order to give them additions.  The Minister in reply to a question of mine said that the matter was under consideration. This was not a matter which could have escaped the Minister's attention. The lands were there and I challenge the Minister to deny that his own officials recommended that this particular estate should be acquired for the relief of local congestion.</P>

      <P>The Minister is quite well aware of the place and of the estate.  He could not miss being aware of the full circumstances of the case because they were brought to his attention <Col N="2561" /> not only by Parliamentary question but by letter, because I specifically wrote on different occasions to his Department.  When I heard these rumours that the lands were about to be disposed of by private treaty, I wrote warning the Land Commission that steps should be taken to have these lands acquired for the relief of congestion.  The Minister's consent to the sale of these lands was necessary, and the Minister, having assured the people in the area that these lands would be made available to them for the relief of congestion, suddenly decides to give his consent in respect of the sale of these lands to a Mr. Thomas in the area.  It does seem extraordinary that this Mr. Thomas is a political henchman of the Minister's.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The facts, briefly, are that this estate is there, portion of it being an addition given to this gentleman who went away.  The consent of the Land Commission to the sale of that estate, including this portion given by them, is necessary, according to law. That estate was sold by private treaty to an individual.  The Minister was asked in a public question to acquire that estate for the relief of congestion, and he undertook to the people concerned to have the estate acquired for that purpose.  How was it that notwithstanding the fact that the officials of the Land Commission recommended that these lands be acquired for the <Col N="2562" /> relief of congestion, the consent to the sale of these lands to a private individual was issued by the Land Commission?  That consent was given in spite of the recommendation of the Land Commission officials that the lands should be acquired for the relief of congestion.  I assert that, and I challenge the Minister to deny that his own officials recommended that these lands be acquired by the Land Commission. I want the Minister to say what party in the Land Commission overrode the decision of the Land Commission officials.  I want him to explain how it was that consent to the private sale of these lands was forthcoming in the teeth of the opposition of the officials of the Land Commission.  I want the Minister to say, if he can, who was this mysterious individual who was able to get over the decision of the Land Commission officials and have these lands sold to a private individual.  These are some of the things which we thought the Land Commission would not be a party to.  We thought that when lands were available and when these lands were brought to the notice of the Land Commission and when the officials were prepared to recommend the acquisition of these lands&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is also the question of an estate at Cloonlara, Swinford, which belonged to a Mr. Manus Conway who died a number of years ago and which was sold by private treaty to a Mr. MacAvaddy of Cloonlara, in March, 1948.  These lands were available for acquisition by the Land Commission and the Minister and his colleagues undertook to the people in the area that these lands would be divided amongst them, but, to the amazement of everybody, the consent to the sale of these lands also issued from the Minister's Department to a private individual and their sale has been confirmed to that individual, notwithstanding the fact that they were sorely required for the relief of congestion in the area, where the valuations range from 30/- to £2 10s. 0d.</P>

The rights of the people in the area were completely disregarded and the Land Commission's consent to the sale of these lands was forthcoming.</P>

      <P>It would appear that we have got back to the old matter of the thimbles and the pea.  We do not know which thimble the pea is under because it is suggested on this question of consent, on one side by the Minister, that he is not responsible, that it is the responsibility of the Land Commission : and, on the other hand, that he is responsible and not the Land <Col N="2565" /> Commission.  I do not know where we will get if the Minister is to reject completely his responsibility for the action of the Land Commission or his officials, but if he thinks for a moment that that kind of quibbling is going to acquit him in the eyes of the unfortunate tenants who have been baulked in getting additions to their holdings on these estates, he is fooling nobody but himself.</P>
      <P>As I said last night, the Land Commission officials are going around checking up on the one, three and fouracre plots, but it is extraordinary that, in instances such as those I have given, instances in which holdings were available for acquisition by the Land Commission and even recommended for acquisition by the Land Commission officials, these mysterious letters of consent should suddenly get down to the parties who want to sell them, and particularly if they want to sell them to people who, to say the least of them, are not opposed to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are burning questions in connection with the rundale system, particularly on estates with which the Minister is very familiar, such as the Peyton estate and the famous Cottage Farm that the Minister and his colleagues were so affected about a very short time ago.  I hope Deputy Commons and ex-Deputy Cafferky did not go to jail in vain.  It would appear from the inactivity of the Minister since he became Minister, that these estates about which all the rows were kicked up in this House and outside by himself and his colleagues are still in the same condition and that no progress has been made by the Minister in connection with their acquisition. Month after month, week after week, there were questions on the Order Paper by the present Minister and his colleagues when they were in opposition concerning the relief of congestion and naming various estates and various lands that should be acquired throughout the West of Ireland.  If we wanted to take up the time of the House by reviewing the Order Papers for any session of this Parliament over the last two or three years we would get abundant evidence of the alleged interest of the Minister in the acquisition of these <Col N="2566" /> estates.  It is rather significant that since the Minister had the responsibility placed on him and since he became, at all events, the nominal head of the Land Commission, no progress whatsoever has been made in connection with the acquisition or division of any of these estates.</P>
    <P>As far as the period in which the Minister has been in office has been concerned, the Land Commission's work has been absolutely nil.  It is not necessary for me to stress that in view of the fact that the Minister's own colleague in this House, a few nights ago, made that statement and in view of the fact that every Deputy representing a rural area is aware of it.  It is getting a bit late in the day to suggest that some revolutionary change will take place under the leadership of the present Minister if the most he can produce for his period of office is the result disclosed by Parliamentary question over the last few months.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note the Minister's attitude less than 12 months before his becoming Minister for Lands.  In Volume 105 of the Dáil Debates, column 2184, 6th May, 1947, then Deputy Blowick said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If there is a derelict holding of seven or eight acres or more, the owner of which has been in the United States for many years, what is the difference between acquiring that land and acquiring a farm of 100, 500 or 1,000 acres, the owner of which is actually living on the land?  We must acquire land from somebody, and there is plenty of legislation passed by this House to settle the question.  The whole trouble is that the Minister for Lands does not demand each year a sum adequate to deal with the question.</P>
    <P>It strikes me very forcibly that the Minister for Lands is not as forceful in making his demands as the Minister for Lands each year at the appropriate time, as the Minister for Defence or the Minister for Industry and Commerce in putting forward demands for their Departments. I wonder is the failure to deal with this question with sufficent speed due to that inactivity of  <Col N="2567" /> Minister for Lands?  I wonder is be taking his office in a too lackadaisical fashion, in not demanding sufficient money for his Department ?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These are the words, believe it or not, of the present Minister for Lands less than 12 months before he became Minister.  I wonder would the Minister accept these words of his as applying to him now on his own results.  He has been 15 months in office.  Two people were migrated, 6,000 to 8,000 acres of land have been divided and, according to the Estimate before us, there is £750,000 for wages and £750,000 for work by the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>I would not mind but the Minister is in the strongest position of any Minister that ever occupied that position since the foundation of this State. The whole Government depends on the support of the Minister and his colleagues. If the Minister were sincere in these expressions of view as to the solution of the congest problem and the land slum problem, surely he would be prepared, if he wanted financial assistance from the Government, to be strong enough to say: &ldquo;Unless you give me what I want to deal with these problems in the Land Commission, you will not have my support any further.&rdquo; The Minister has the ball at his feet out he appears to be much too lazy to kick it.  That is the position of the present head of the Irish Land Commission.</P>
    <P>It is amazing that the Minister who shed so many tears over the need for relief in the congested areas should proceed to forget about them completely when he is in a position to deal with them.  The only conclusion we can come to is that his tears were crocodile tears shed for political purposes. Since he became Minister, he has made no contribution whatsoever by way of constructive thought, introduction of legislation or action to spur on the sleepy, cumbrous mass of the Irish Land Commission to do anything for the people with whom they should be concerned.</P>
    <P>Last night, in reply to me, the Minister stated that 250,000 letters were received by his Department during the <Col N="2568" /> past year.  I do not know how many of these letters came from the West of Ireland, but I am sure a large number of them came from County Mayo.  I have seen quite a number of letters from the Minister, particularly in the early stage of his Ministry.  Everybody appeared to have a letter from him, addressing them by their Christian name and assuring them that their problems, particularly land problems, would be dealt with by the Minister. It is poor consolation to those people to have in their houses framed letters from the Minister addressed &ldquo;Dear Tom&rdquo;, &ldquo;Dear Mick&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Dear Pat&rdquo;, &ldquo;I am looking after your question&rdquo;. I suggest to the Minister that the people concerned, even though they never saw him, would think much more of him and would keep him much longer in their memories if they heard that some of the large estates that are there for acquisition were acquired and that they would get a few acres to relieve their absolute poverty and land hunger.</P>
    <P>The Minister's responsibility in this matter is not confined to the question of the division of lands.  The Minister well knows that linked up with the problem of division is the problem of unemployment and the great scourge of emigration which is intense in the congested areas.  The question of emigration from those areas is a great responsibility of the Land Commission.  There is no other State Department whose work has a greater bearing on the congested areas and, consequently, on emigration.  I am sure that the Minister would not like for all time to be described as the Minister for Emigration, but unless he proceeds to have some active steps taken by the Land Commission to solve these problems, unless he is prepared to take his courage in his hands and insist on the Government making sufficient finance available for the work to be done, unless he can inspire the Land Commission to make some attempt even to do half as much as his predecessors did in a normal year, I am afraid the only recommendation I can make to the Minister is to beg somebody else, even his own colleague, Deputy Commons, to come into the Land Commission to <Col N="2569" /> stir them up and to try to solve some of these problems.</P>
    <P>The Minister's policy in connection with lands is, as far as I can gather, to have no policy.  The Minister is side-stepping every issue and failing to face up to these problems which arise in the congested areas as a result of the lack of work on the part of the Land Commission.  I know that it is not an easy matter to get people to agree regarding rearrangement; I know that in some cases you will meet unreasonable people.  If the Minister wanted to introduce legislation &mdash; I know that we may not discuss legislation on this Estimate&mdash;but if the Minister wanted to acquire compulsory powers for re-settlement, there is no reason why he should have waited all these months until this year to do so. No matter what is said about this Dáil in the future, God knows that we have not been rushed by the amount of legislation introduced by the Coalition Government, because any matter that might create division between them has been left in abeyance.  This is a matter, however, on which the Minister could well get help, not alone from the elements composing the Coalition Government, but from all rural Deputies, irrespective of Party, who are concerned with the congestion problem. There is no excuse, therefore, for this lotus-eating attitude of the Minister for Lands.  There is no excuse for him to wait until this time two years, or until Tibb's Eve before introducing legislation.  Prior to his becoming Minister, he stated that the machinery was there ready to do the job and that there was sufficient legal machinery to proceed towards the solution of the problems facing the Irish Land Commission. Why is it that, during the period in which the Minister has been Minister, the results have been so very meagre and so very few, notwithstanding the expenditure of £494,398 for the Minister's civil servants?</P>
    <P>Three-quarters of the total Estimate is to be expended, not on the relief of congestion, not on the acquisition of estates, not on the building of houses and not on the making of drains among the congests, but on a further increase in the salaries of the gentlemen enjoying <Col N="2570" /> sinecures at 24 Upper Merrion Street.  If the Minister will not mend his hand, I am afraid he will find just as much opposition this time next year from his colleagues if they are sincere men as from this side of the House from people who are familiar with the hopeless lack of work from the Land Commission during the past 12 months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan </NameTxt>
      <P>Every Deputy whose outlook is tempered by even a modest ration of Christian charity must feel a deep sympathy with the Minister in the task which he has to face.  Not only is the problem of land settlement and land tenure one of immense complexity and difficulty, but also the Department over which the Minister presides is a complex Department composed, as it is, of direct officials of the Minister, an independent or a semi-independent body and also a judicial body.  Faced with such difficulties, the Minister, I think, requires the sympathy of all Deputies who are prepared to think on those matters seriously and constructively.  In addition to having to face difficulties naturally inherent in those problems, there is no doubt that the Opposition Party will use this problem and this particular Department to the best of their ability to embarrass the Minister and his Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In facing the tasks before him the Minister is closely watched by the pale ghosts of his predecessors whom he ridiculed and criticised when they were in the difficult position of trying to solve those problems.  In a Dáil in which there has been unfortunately a considerable amount of personal odium, ill-feeling and unpleasantness, it is, I think, gratifying to note that the Leader of the Opposition Party set a good headline in this debate.  He at least faced the problem of land settlement, land tenure and the establishment of people on the land in a constructive and thoughtful way and I think his speech does him credit.  The Leader of the Opposition Party referred to that section of the Constitution which sets out that it is the purpose of the State to establish in economic security on the land as many families as possible.  With that Article of <Col N="2571" /> the Constitution every Deputy in this House is in complete agreement.  The more people who live on the land and work on the land, the more people who own a portion of the surface of this country, the stronger our nation will be.  It is essential that those people should not only occupy and own a portion of the land of this country but that they should also be absolutely secure in their ownership, not only secure by way of legal guarantee but also economically secure.  That raises the question that has been raised here year after year: what should be the general policy of the Land Commission and of the Department of Lands with regard to the settlement of the people on the land ?</P>
    <P>Deputy after Deputy in this debate has asked how much land is available to the Land Commission for distribution. The answer to that question is, of course, that no land is available until it is first acquired.  The Land Commission does not create land or make land out of water; it must first acquire land, and there are two ways by which the Land Commission can acquire land: by agreement or by compulsion.  When Deputies ask how much land is available to the Land Commission they must ask themselves how much land can be acquired by agreement and how much by compulsion. As far as the acquisition of land by agreement is concerned, it is not possible accurately to estimate how much land the Land Commission could acquire.  If land is acquired by voluntary agreement the quantity of land the Land Commission will acquire depends mainly on the question of price.  I do not know how much land goes on the market for sale every year. Perhaps the Minister may be able to inform us.  But whatever the amount, I am quite sure a substantial portion of it could be acquired by the Land Commission provided it was prepared to pay a price equivalent to what other purchasers in the market are prepared to pay.</P>
    <P>After having estimated, as far as it is possible to estimate, how much land can be acquired by agreement, the next question is how much land is <Col N="2572" /> available to be acquired by compulsion. Under the powers held by the Land Commission at present all the land in the country is available for acquisition by compulsion, that is, 11,500,000 acres.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know.  But broadly speaking that may be a rough estimate. The Land Commission does not act, as the Minister has pointed out, without laying down certain regulations and also, I suppose, certain statutes governing their operations.  The question then arises of how much of the 11,500,000 acres is really available to the Land Commission under the present system and how much should be available. Under the present system, as I say, we have not had, for the Land Commission, any broad general principles to guide them.  It is impossible for the Land Commission to decide how much land they can acquire or make any estimate of the amount of land they may acquire unless they are guided by certain broad principles. There are some Deputies who suggest that every farm over a certain acreage should be acquired.  If you go on that basis you can make a rough estimate of the amount of land that is available. Others suggest that farms that are not worked properly should be acquired. If you go on that basis you may arrive at an entirely different figure.  Again, it is also suggested that farms which are non-residential should be acquired. There again you can make a rough estimate of the area of land under that heading.  But under each of these headings you have certain disadvantages, certain handicaps, that have to be faced.  If you take as a ceiling an area above which no farmer may be allowed to own land, you come up against problems.  There is the problem of the exceptionally good farmer who gives extensive employment even though his farm may be large and who is obtaining from his land the maximum output.  It would be, I think, antisocial and perhaps uneconomic from a <Col N="2573" /> national point of view to acquire such holdings.  Therefore, it is very hard to lay down a definite limit of area which each individual farmer may hold.  Then there are people who say that farms which are not worked properly should be acquired.  But has the Land Commission at the present time any absolutely efficient machinery to determine whether land is being properly worked or not?</P>
      <P>I think you may take it for granted that the Land Commission has no such machinery.  It is a very difficult matter to decide whether a holding is being worked to the very best advantage or not.  The problem, if it is to be tackled in that way, is that you have to grade all farms, as they are doing in Great Britain, and find out what farms are being efficiently worked and what are not.  There is no use in leaving it to some local politician to decide whether a farm is being worked or not.  It is a matter which must be dealt with in a judicial and absolutely fair and impartial manner.  No greater injustice could be inflicted on an individual farmer than to describe him as inefficient and push him out of his farm when, in fact, he might be as efficient as any of his neighbours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We then come to the third class of farms which might be acquired, non-residential farms.  If you make a hard and fast rule that all non-residential farms should be acquired you come up against the problem of the farmer who is residing on his own farm but who has another farm perhaps only half a mile away, or a reasonably short distance-away, from the farm on which he is residing.  The second farm can, according to any definition which you may set down, be described as non-residential, but it is being worked efficiently by the farmer in conjunction with the farm upon which he resides. Thus I think it will be reasonably acknowledged that, no matter under what scheme you may seek to classify the types of land that ought to be acquired, you come up against exceptions and difficulties.  The problem of the Land Commission and of the <Col N="2574" /> Government and of the Minister must be to try to arrive at some equitable system of deciding what farms may be acquired.  I think that under the three headings I have mentioned, farms over a certain acreage, farms that are not worked properly and farms that are non-residential, you can arrive at a number of holdings which the Land Commission might justly acquire.  But you must recognise that there are exceptions, and definite and clear-cut provision must be made for these exceptions.  The matter of deciding what land is to be acquired and what land is not to be acquired cannot be left to the discretion of local organisations or political organisations.  I have often tried to find out from the Minister, and from his predecessor, who initiates proceedings for the acquisition of land.  Suppose, for example, there is a considerable number of uneconomic holders in a certain parish where there are also two or three fairly large holdings.  Who decides that one of those large holdings ought to be acquired?  In many cases that decision to initiate proceedings is made not by the Land Commission but by some interested individual.  Deputy Commons referred to this matter very forcibly when he said in this House on the 3rd June, 1948, column 353, Official Report:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have been approached by some of these ranchers, with regard to whose lands I have put down questions in this House who said: `Now that you are a supporter of the Government our cheque books will be available to you at the next election. Do not make any move in regard to our lands.  Make as good a thing as you can out of the land question at election time and we will back you, but, when the election is over, do not say anything about our farms.' &rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a fair indication that there are people in this country who, either by experience or otherwise, have discovered that by supporting whatever Government happens to be in power actively and wholeheartedly they may avoid having their holdings acquired. That is a position which must inevitably arise unless there is a fair and <Col N="2575" /> equitable and absolutely just basis upon which land is acquired.  I have indicated that a just and fair basis can be laid down if those who have the responsibility of settling this question are prepared to get down to it and are allowed to get down to it and not interfered with politically.  The whole question of land acquisition, of course, is bound up with the payment of a just price for land.  The Minister has acknowledged that since he came into office the Land Commission have not been in a position to pay a just price for land that is vested.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not since I came into office.  That was existing years before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that it existed long before the Minister came into office, but the position has continued since he came into office.  I urge very strongly that, while the Minister cannot be held responsible for the grievous sins of his predecessor, at least he will make restitution for any injustice done since he came into office.  That is, I think, a fair and reasonable request, and I know the Minister is a fair and reasonable man.  Since I introduced the Land Bill some months ago I have received shoals of letters from every constituency indicating that, in some cases, the price paid for vested land by the Land Commission has been in the region of one-third of its value, that is after the Land Commission annuities have been redeemed.  I have no intention, like Deputy Moran, of dragging these individual cases into the House and asking Deputies to dwell upon them.  I do not think the names of private individuals ought to be paraded in this House.  Our business is to lay down certain just, guiding principles and hope that these principles will be rigidly adhered to in our administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having decided the manner in which land may be acquired, the type of land which may be acquired and the quantity of land which may be available under the various headings which I have suggested, the next question is: Who is to receive the land which the <Col N="2576" /> Land Commission has for distribution? On this question, so many conflicting opinions have been expressed that it is necessary to urge again that some guiding principles should be adhered to.  I think it was Deputy Madden who blamed the Land Commission very strongly for having given new agricultural holdings to a number of people who had proved unworthy, who had used their land inefficiently, and he attributed the blame mainly to the Land Commission.  I do not think that Deputy Madden was altogether fair to the Land Commission because, as I understand it, the main function of the Land Commission in regard to land acquisition and distribution is to relieve congestion.  Therefore, the people who have first priority for land to be distributed are uneconomic holders.  Since the Land Commission are bound, therefore, to give first preference to uneconomic holders, they are not in a position always to select the best possible applicants.</P>
    <P>Let us assume that there are two people applying for land, one is a man who has always been inefficient for one reason or another; it may be through ill-health or through sheer laziness. Suppose that man has a small holding of four or five acres.  Suppose there is a second applicant who is a farmer's son with some capital and perhaps some stock.  He is not an uneconomic holder and he does not come into the class of congests and therefore he must take second place.  The less efficient applicant must receive the land under existing regulations.  I want to know if there is any solution for that problem. because it does seem to indicate that the hands of the Minister and the Land Commission are tied rather firmly in dealing with applicants for land.  Again, there is a rule for the provision of holdings for employees of estates which are acquired.  Some of these people may be good agricultural workers but may not be good managers of stock or land and for that reason not the best possible applicants.  Yet under existing regulations they must receive holdings.</P>
    <P>Another type of people who are classified as eligible for holdings are cottage tenants.  A good case has been made and can be made for giving small <Col N="2577" /> holdings of three or four acres to a cottage tenant.  But that policy is in direct conflict with the general policy of the Land Commission, which is to relieve congestion.  You set out to make uneconomic holdings economic and, at the same time, you give to landless people in cottages what are in effect uneconomic holdings.  Thus you create a new class of uneconomic holders.  If you bring into the category of people entitled to receive land all landless men, that is, agricultural workers, farmers' sons and all people with agricultural experience, you widen the number of applicants to such an extent that under no circumstances would it be possible to meet all the applications that you would receive.</P>
    <P>The then secretary of the Land Commission was asked by the Banking Commission how may eligible applicants for land we have in this country, and he estimated that there were about 500,000.  I suppose he was assuming that there were about 100,000 uneconomic holders, 130,000 agricultural labourers and perhaps the balance would be farmers' sons or manual workers with agricultural experience.  It is quite clear that if you set out to give every uneconomic holder and every landless man in this country an economic holding you have got to go and colonise part of Asia, Africa, or somewhere else in order to satisfy the demand.  The Leader of the Opposition Party said he ascertained that the amount of land available would be between 500,000 and 1,000,000 acres.  If you have over 500,000 applicants it means that you will only be able to give one or two acres to each applicant.  Of course that is an impossible proposition and one which could not be considered.  Therefore, I think the time has come to lay down definitely what type of people are to receive holdings and, having regard to the amount of land at present available, I imagine that the Land Commission should confine the distribution of land to uneconomic holders who can prove that they are worthy to receive land.  That is to say, the division of land should be confined to uneconomic holders who can prove that they are likely to become satisfactory tenants <Col N="2578" /> and, ultimately, satisfactory owners of land.  If the problem is approached in that way it can be kept within manageable proportions, but if you say to everybody who comes along: &ldquo;I will give you a holding if you support me,&rdquo; well, the problem is one that is absolutely incapable of solution.</P>
    <P>I think, as the Leader of the Opposition indicated, that this is a matter which should be dealt with in a non-Party and non-political way.  It is a difficult and a delicate question.  The question of deciding from whom you are to take land and to whom you will give it is one of the most deep-rooted and serious questions which have to be tackled by any Government, and on a solution of it will depend whether this nation is going to make progress in the future or not.  A nation which has the bulk of its population happily and comfortably settled on the land is a nation which cannot be destroyed.  On the other hand, a nation in which there is general insecurity, rancour, hatred and ill-will in regard to land tenure. is a nation in which every political Party is competing to take land from its political opponents and give it to its own supporters, and is a nation doomed to disaster.  For that reason, I think we should all co-operate to bring about a speedy and satisfactory solution of this problem.</P>
    <P>I am quite sure that the legislation which the Minister intends to introduce will be carefully thought out, and I hope that it will not be unduly delayed.  I can assure him that every possible help that can be given to him by the farmer Deputies will be given, because no one appreciates more fully how essential it is to have peace concord and security on the land than the farming community.</P>
    <P>There are a few small matters, apart from general principles, which I have often felt that it is necessary the Minister should give attention to.  I believe that in acquiring land particularly in a mountainous county like the County Wicklow, the question of afforestation and the question of the creation of agricultural holdings come up in the case of almost every estate that is acquired.  I would say to the <Col N="2579" /> Minister that he should endeavour, while extending the area of afforestation to the best of his ability, to ensure that any agricultural land that falls into his hands will be used for agricultural purposes.  I suggest to him that he should confine afforestation to land that is unsuitable for agricultural purposes.  Very often there is a temptation to sacrifice very good agricultural land to afforestation because it is more convenient to do so, but I think that would be a dangerous policy to pursue.  I would strongly urge on the Minister not to allow himself to be tempted, for the sake of convenience in administration, into adopting that policy.</P>
    <P>With regard to the laying out of holdings, I have always felt that the fences provided by the Land Commission have been antiquated and unsuitable. I believe that the best fence at the present time for the division of holdings and the division of fields on holdings, where new fences have to be erected, is a wire whitethorn fence. The old type of earth fence erected by the Land Commission in my own county and in most of the Leinster counties, is hopelessly unsuitable, because it may be, as somebody said to me, that the last ditch builder died about 50 years ago.  It may be that the new earth fences have been erected on land that was unsuitable for their erection, or that they have been erected at the wrong time of the year.  All these things operate against the success of making the fence efficient and suitable &mdash;if erected on the old-fashioned lines of a sod fence.  The Minister, who has often visited my constituency, has seen there fences provided for lands under afforestation.  They are satisfactory. In the same way the Electricity Supply Board, which has acquired very extensive lands in my constituency for its hydro-electric scheme, has found the wire fence with concrete pillars the best and most efficient type of fence that can be erected. I think it is time the Land Commission got away from the antiquated system they have at present.  It is only necessary to visit holdings which have been subdivided to see fences, erected within <Col N="2580" /> the last ten or 12 years, which have now been almost completely demolished by stock to realise how necessary it is to make a change for the better.</P>
    <P>I hope, now that the Minister has listened to all the criticism that has come from every side of the House, that he will get down to a satisfactory solution of this problem by the acceptance of the broad principles which I have outlined.  If he is not prepared to do that he will simply find himself floundering from one blunder into another as the Land Commission have been floundering over the past 25 years. Strong condemnation has been uttered by various Deputies in regard to the administration of the Land Commission. I believe that the Land Commission could not fulfil their obligations under the existing rules and regulations laid down for their guidance. They have had no really sound guiding principles, and because of that guidance they have been, to a large extent, a complete failure.  That is unfortunate but it is true.  The time has come to turn over a new leaf.  This is one of the most important aspects of our national life, and this is one of the most important Departments of State, and it is about time that it was put on a sound footing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to delay the House very long, but there are just a few remarks that I desire to make.  Last year, when speaking on the Estimate, I expressed the hope that the new Minister for Lands would put a great deal of energy into the work of the Department, that he would strike out on new paths and do better work than it was possible to do for many years before.  I must say that looking over his Estimate, and reading his introductory speech.  I am sadly disappointed this year.  I have listened for a considerable time to Deputy Moran and, while I do not agree with everything he said, especially those things which might be regarded as more or less personal, I will agree that there is not very much value being given for all the money that is being spent.  Possibly that applied to a good degree in years before this, but I think <Col N="2581" /> that during the past year there was not value given for the money spent.  I quite agree with Deputy Moran that the proportion of money spent on officials is far in excess of what it ought to be, compared with the amount of work done.</P>
      <P>Taking everything into consideration, I agree that there are some difficulties but, on the other hand, I think a good deal more work could have been done.  How far this lack of work may by attributed to the Minister, to the Land Commission and to other circumstances I cannot say, but I think the Minister should step out a bit and try to improve matters.  He mentions, more or less as a boast, that he has divided 20,000 acres.  Deputy Moran does not think he has, but, even if he has done so, it is a very small acreage to have divided in a year.</P>
      <P>I suppose the Minister has accurate information on a great many things, but I do not agree that there was not a considerable acreage on hands that could have been and should have been divided.  I am aware of some thousands of acres in my own constituency that were on hands for many years, some of them, and they were not distributed during the past year.  I am not exonerating previous Ministers, and I suggest that there might have been more activity even during the war.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielORourke" hpid="Mr. O'Rourke Mr. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not attributing any blame to the present Minister.  I am saying that in quite a number of offices in the country there was still a considerable staff and I do not think there was as much work done as might have been done.  I believe that during last year a good deal more work could have been done.  I have not an intimate knowledge of the whole of the Roscommon constituency, but I am aware that there are thousands of acres in County Roscommon that have been on hands and they were not distributed during the year; there was not even an attempt made to prepare a scheme for them.  I have been <Col N="2582" /> pestered by the inhabitants of some districts in this connection.  In one district alone, the district between Elphin and Carrick-on-Shannon, there are thousands of acres that could usefully be divided.  They were in the possession of a man named Fitzmaurice and a man called Freyne, and the people have been looking across the fences for years, in fact decades, and nothing has been done.  All the lands that have been set were set at very high rents by the Land Commission, and high figures were even charged for the grazing of cattle. There is a difficulty with regard to housing, but even taking that into consideration there are many local people who would be well able to work the lands pending the erection of better houses than they now have.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cogan seems to think there is something wrong with the method of land allocation.  I am not in agreement with that.  The present system of land allocation is the result of many years of experience and examination. I think if the present system is followed, it is as good as any other system that can be devised.  I know there are great difficulties, especially in getting some people to migrate, in getting the right type of people to migrate.  The present system of allocation to the different types of people to whom land is given is as good as any system that could be devised.  No matter what system there is, there will always be some fault found with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to say a few words on behalf of the much abused landless man.  I am not denying that there are some of them who do not use the land as it was intended to be used.  I know some of them who got landless men's holdings and some who got labourers' plots, and they have made very good use of them indeed.  One small estate in my neighbourhood was divided mainly among landless men and the occupants of labourers' cottages.  I do not know of any place where the same area of land has done as much good to any section of the community as it did there.  There is no use in condemning the landless man.  At times there may be a bad tenant, but that is not <Col N="2583" /> true of all of them, or even of the majority.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielORourke" hpid="Mr. O'Rourke Mr. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say you were.  I am not bound to tell you who is condemning them, but it has been wholesale and some of the most vocal, I may say, have been in my own Party.  I am not attributing it to you; I did not hear you say it.  I would be surprised if you did, because you come from an area where, I think, landless men would make good use of the land. I honestly believe they would make good use of it.  There are the same types of people in my own constituency. There is that tendency to criticise and ostracise landless men in the allocation of land.  I know there are exceptions.  I heard Deputy Madden yesterday evening talking about the terrible injustice it was to have houses allotted to these men.  If the case were as bad as Deputy Madden says, it might deserve his condemnation fully, but I do not think that it is.  I am glad the Minister is here, and I hope he will take a careful note of what I say in this matter, because I am particularly serious about it.</P>
      <P>I will refer now to the practice of taking most of the migrants from outside counties to County Roscommon. I have not even a bit of an objection, because I have never considered people on a county basis, but I would like to direct the attention of the Land Commission to the fact that we have some of the worst congested areas in the country in County Roscommon, and I do not think it is fair that migrants should continually be taken in from outside counties while uneconomic holders in County Roscommon are not being placed on lands in their own county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Deputies yesterday referred to the very meagre amount of work done during the past 15 years.  All I can say is that I do not think they travelled County Roscommon or, if they did, they have not kept their eyes open, <Col N="2584" /> because a great deal of work was done there.  There was a good deal of work done under the Cumann na nGaedheal Government, but very much more work was done from 1932 to 1939, so that, in fact, the face of County Roscommon has been greatly altered.  Where there used to be ranches of thousands of acres we now have many small holdings, fairly economic, and the whole area is dotted over with houses.  In these circumstances, I do not think it would be right to say that the Land Commission did not do a valuable lot of work.  That would be a slander on them as far as County Roscommon is concerned.  At the same time, I think a good deal more could have been done there.</P>
    <P>I noticed Deputy Cogan talking about land division as if it were going to remain with us as a serious problem for ever.  My view is that the vast bulk of land division, so far as the West is concerned, is almost finished.  County Roscommon was one of the most notorious ranching counties at one period.  There are now very few estates of any size in County Roscommon. There are some hundreds of acres, perhaps, here and there, but in the main the amount of land available is very small.  With regard to whatever does remain I hope the Minister and the Land Commission will try to settle those people who are natives of County Roscommon in the first instance.  I do not say that there have not been excellent tenants brought in from Galway and Mayo.  Some of these tenants are some of the best holders I know.  To their credit be it said that it is only very rarely one will find a tenant who is not able to pay his way and it is only very rarely that one will find one of them appearing on the arrears list in the Land Commission.  I am sure the Minister has often passed through the congested areas in Roscommon and Galway and Mayo.  It is only fair that the people there should be given a chance of migrating if they are prepared to do so.</P>
    <P>I am somewhat disappointed at the amount of money provided for the improvement of estates.  The amount this year is bigger than last year by £100,000, but it is very much smaller <Col N="2585" /> than that provided in the years 1934, 1935 and 1936.  The money provided under this heading is used for the making of roads, the development of bogs, and so no.  I think a great deal more of that work could be done and should be done.  Apart from providing tenants with certain amenities to which they are entitled, this is one of the ways of providing valuable employment for the small landholders and labourers. I am disappointed that there is not a bigger sum asked for under this head. I think the Minister should have asked for more.  I do not know whether anything can be done about it now.</P>
    <P>Last year I mentioned the necessity for acquiring bogs&mdash;some of them will be needed immediately and some in the near future&mdash;in order to provide fuel for the tenants.  There is a danger that these tenants may be cut out by the operations of Bord na Móna.  I hope the Land Commission is keeping a careful watch on the position.  I do not say that they are not doing that. It would be very undesirable, while providing machine-won fuel which is, no doubt, useful from the national point of view, that the local tenants should go without.  The Land Commission owns most of the bogs now being operated by Bord na Móna.  I hope they will ensure that sufficient turbary will be retained for the tenants.  There is a danger at the moment that that may not be done.</P>
    <P>One Deputy mentioned the necessity for doing something for the Old I.R.A. applicants.  I cannot say that they have been very badly treated because I know a number of cases in which they did get preference.  The number of these Old I.R.A. men grows rapidly less.  It is astonishing how many of them have died in the last few years. I appeal to the Minister and to the Land Commission to deal generously with those who are left.  There may be a few of them here and there getting meagre pensions.  The majority of them got very little for their services.</P>

      <P>Those of us who are familiar with them realise that they made great sacrifices and gave a great deal of their time without any recompense <Col N="2586" /> of any kind. I know that it is not possible in existing circumstances to give land to every Old I.R.A. applicant. Where circumstances permit, however, I think it was laid down in the past that they should get preference, other things being equal.  The number of them is so small now they should be treated as generously as possible, whether they be uneconomic holders, landless men or migrants.</P>
      <P>In the county which I represent there has been more land division than in most other counties.  When I speak on this matter I speak with first-hand knowledge.  On the whole, I think the Land Commission and the Congested Districts Board and the Estates Commissioners did very valuable work in County Roscommon; I hope that work will now be speeded up.  It should not take very long.  Many people are concerned because, while there is a considerable amount of land to be divided, the &ldquo;jog-trot&rdquo; still goes on.  There is a danger that that may continue for years.  I think it was Deputy de Valera who suggested that the Minister should provide a certain number of acres over a certain number of years and thereby bring the work to a conclusion as rapidly as possible.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy O'Rourke and the other Deputies who have expressed dissatisfaction with the rate of progress of land division in this country.  In expressing that dissatisfaction.  I do not place the entire blame on the broad shoulders of the present Minister. Nevertheless, I do think that this is a matter about which neither he nor the Land Commission can afford to be complacent.  The Land Commission as such was originally established to preside over the distribution of land and to bring its activities to an end as quickly as possible.  It has now become apparently accepted as a permanently integral part of the national life of this country.  I think that is regrettable. I think the Land Commission itself calculates action in terms of years rather than in terms of months.  That frame of mind is something which will always cause dissatisfaction in the country until some evidence of speed is given in the work of resettlement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2587" /> Speaking as a Fine Gael Deputy, I expressed the view my Party has always held from the passing of the Land Act of 1923 right down through the years; that is, that there is no justification for having idle land so long as there are people who need land and who are able to work land, but who have not got it.  I regret to say we still have idle acres.  We have idle acres which are not even feeding bullocks. We have idle acres which are merely growing sedge.  The time has come when the problem must be handled with more energy.  Last year, I welcomed the fact that under the present Minister land division was being resumed after a cessation of some three or four years.  I do not think the results in the last year have been entirely satisfactory.  In many cases the estates that have to be worked are very large, it is true.  Nevertheless they represent land that could be made available to deserving cases.  For that reason neither the Land Commission nor the Minister can afford to be complacent. I would suggest to the Minister that the speed at which land division is eventually effected should be attended to during the coming year. I know that in this regard I am merely expressing what would be the Minister's own sentiments and feelings in respect of this particular problem. While I or any other Deputy could reiterate the sentiments I have expressed now <i>ad nauseam</i> I think they represent, nevertheless, the views of all sides of this House.</P>
    <P>There are one or two more detailed matters that I should like to refer to on this Estimate.  One of these also deals with a certain slowness on the part of the Land Commission.  I refer to the slowness with which divided estates are vested eventually in the tenants.  I always understood that a period of seven years would be the period usually allowed before the title of the land eventually became vested in the allottees or the tenants.  If that rule ever existed it is certainly more honoured in the breach than in the observance. There are a considerable number of estates in my constituency where division took place 12 to 15 years <Col N="2588" /> ago.  In respect of those estates the Land Commission is still acting in a judiciary capacity, and I do not think that is satisfactory to the allottees or the tenants.  They have been there for the past 12 or 15 years on a kind of probationary standing with no real security. They are not disposed to tend to their holdings with that real interest with which a proprietor will run his farm.  Apart altogether from that there are other complications that result from delayed vesting of land in tenants.  The idea of land division is a perfectly simple one.  Land is acquired from a man who has more than he needs and is given to those who need it.  That aim should be carried out as quickly as possible, otherwise the entire principle is destroyed.  I am afraid that to-day the Land Commission, which is in place of the old landlord, is still operating as a landlord in many cases.  I would ask the Minister to consider that the question of vesting the title in the tenants is quite as important as the original acquisition of the estate and should be attended to with more energy than has been accorded it in the past.  The Land Commission should and could be more helpful to tenants and proprietors of holdings than they have been in the past or are at present.  They are inclined to forget that many of the proprietors and tenants are not very well-educated people and they often do not know how to manage a book, a pencil or a letter.  One particular problem which often comes before me as a Deputy is the question of houses being required on acquired estates.  If a tenant who has a house which is falling into disrepair or requires a new house wants to get a grant from the DeLand Commission and from the Department of Local Government, the Land Commission will help him provided he does certain things first.  One of the things he must do is to satisfy the Land Commission that he has been sanctioned for a local government grant.  That means quite an unnecessary duplication of efforts by the unfortunate man on the holding.  It is only a small matter and I suggest that there are plenty of officials in the Land Commission who could do more <Col N="2589" /> useful work than they have been doing in the past.  One thing they could do in respect of these housing grants is to get in touch with the Department of Local Government and put through that end of it themselves.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear Deputy O'Rourke refer to the question of the development of estates.  The development of estates which are already divided is a very important side-line activity, if you like, of the Land Commission.  It is, however, one that should never be neglected.  The provision of the necessary amenities in the way of roads, paths and so forth for the proper laying-out of estates is a thing that must always get the most careful attention of the Land Commission.  I welcome the fact that there has been an increase in the amount of money required this year for the development of estates.  That is a step in the right direction, and I hope the money so provided will be spent in a proper way on this particular object.  The proper development of estates is important and should obtain the first attention of the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>I suppose it is scarcely proper on a general Estimate such as this to mention individuals in one's constituency, but I hope that in the coming year the particulars of estates which have already been furnished to the Land Commission will receive proper attention.  In my constituency there are men who have been merely existing on a few acres in years gone by.  They live only a stone's throw from land that is now idle and has been idle for the last seven or eight years and sometimes longer.  There is no justification for the continuance of a situation such as that.  Nobody can convince me that greater speed in tackling that problem cannot be shown by the Land Commission or by the Department of Local Government.  If that cannot be shown there should be a considerable spring cleaning in both the Department and the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>I should like to advert, also, to what Deputy O'Rourke said concerning the problem of the landless man.  I quite agree with what has frequently been said concerning the landless man who <Col N="2590" /> got a free gift of land from the State and who threw that gift away, who made lettings of his land or just closed the gate and went back to holding up the pub wall in the nearest town.  We should not blame the entire class because of the particular failures.  I am afraid there is a danger of that taking place.  I know and, I am sure, every country Deputy knows of the very old farmer's son who makes a living with only a single acre of land, who takes conacre year in and year out and who is obliged to do that because his father is still living and still has the farm. This man knows that his only livelihood is to be obtained from farming.  He has no land but he does take conacre. That is the type of landless man who would be a deserving tenant of any holding and would be a considerable asset to the country, if a holding were given to him.  I trust&mdash;and I am sure it will not be so&mdash;that any condemnation of the claims of landless men will not embrace deserving people like that.  I hold that a man, whether or not he has land, who shows he has a real interest in the working of land by the fact that he has taken conacre or lettings in years gone by is a person who should receive first consideration when land becomes available for division.  I urge the few points I have mentioned on the Minister for his consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief.  I shall refrain entirely from quoting any of the words the Minister used in the far-off happy days before he became Minister.  I am rather resentful of the Minister's brief on this occasion.  I think that the work of preparing the brief might be handed to some senior official of the Land Commission and not entrusted to a clerical officer, because I think this was one of the most inadequate explanations that was ever offered of the Land Commission's work during any year.  I suppose that the Minister decided just to let it go and that he could make up on the round-abouts afterwards what he was losing on the swings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are four items in this brief.  One deals with the question <Col N="2591" /> of the annuities.  We all know that there is a perfectly adequate machine for the collection of annuities in the Land Commission and, by way of explanation of policy on the Estimate, there was no need to bring that matter into it at all.  The question of user is another matter to which the Minister referred, but that was decided by the 1946 Act.  The question of vesting was settled by the creation of a special section of the Land Commission several years ago which is now bearing fruit.</P>
      <P>The only question, therefore, calling for discussion which was raised by the Minister, most briefly, was that of land acquisition.  He told us that there was preliminary inspection of 40,000 acres, detailed inspection of 25,000 acres and the subject of proceedings 45,000 acres but he did not tell us how much was actually acquired.  That would be interesting.  I should like to know what exactly has been done.</P>
      <P>To get down to actual brass tacks as to what the purpose of the Land Commission is, it has always been drilled into my mind that the main purpose of the Land Commission at present is the relief of congestion and any talk about particular attention to landless men, cottage tenants and so on, is a matter of detail in association with the real job of the Land Commission, which is the relief of congestion. The Minister should have told us in his brief, and I hope he will tell us in his reply, how far he has gone this year in affording some relief of congestion even in his own county, how many migrants have been brought out of the county and from the congested area generally, how many holdings have been enlarged, and how much rundale was adjusted in the particular districts where that system obtained. That seems to me to be the real business of the Land Commission and we really should be told what is being done in connection with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assume that the full staff of the Land Commission has now been returned to the Department.  The Minister gives expression to some statements which are unworthy of him, in that connection.  For instance, he asked last night why land could not <Col N="2592" /> be divided during the emergency. Land was divided during the emergency&mdash;not on a large scale, I will admit.  I think the Minister should know very well why it was not divided and why it was not advisable to divide it.</P>
    <P>In the first place, the Minister and the House know very well that the inspectorate staff was not with the Land Commission, that it had been lent to the Department of Agriculture because there was a very crucial time for the people during the war years. Apart from that, I personally think that the distribution of land or any definite intensive engagement in the acquisition and distribution of land during that period, would have so disturbed our farm economy that it would be quite unadvisable.  That is my view as to why land acquisition was not engaged in at any great speed during that time.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the Minister knows that the price of land was such during the war years&mdash;even the price of conacre&mdash; that the burden to be placed on the State by any widespread acquisition of land and its distribution would have been such as to become unbearable. The Minister and his Government are devoted to a policy of economy and he will realise that there was some wisdom in the Fianna Fáil view in relation to that.  If we had engaged in the wholesale acquisition of land at the prices prevailing during that period, we would have put such a burden on the incoming tenant that in a few years, when prices will naturally drop, he would be in a worse position than before he got the land from the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>It has been my intention for the past 12 months on this debate to raise the question of price.  It has been raised by several Deputies and we have had an assurance from the Minister that legislation is to be brought in one of these days which will deal with the question of price.  Therefore there is not, from that point of view, any need for my raising the question of price. I do it only for this reason, that life is uncertain, and even tenure of office is uncertain, and either I may be dead or the Minister may be gone from his <Col N="2593" /> office when this Estimate comes round again.  I want to go specifically on record, and I want to pin my faith on it, that no land should be taken from any man without full compensation. Deputy Commons does not agree with that.  He believes that the man who owns land should pay the State's contribution. I think that is altogether wrong.  I think that land division is of such importance that the State should pay for it and not the private individual.  No land should be taken from any man who owns it, without paying the full value for it.  I doubt very much if legislation is needed for that.  The interpretation put by the Land Commission on &ldquo;fair to the owner&rdquo; might be put in a more generous fashion, without any legislation.  If the Minister designs his policy in that way and instructs the commissioners, as he is entitled to do, what the future price of land shall be, I doubt if there is any need for legislation; but if there is, and if legislation is brought in, I will be prepared fully to back it.</P>
    <P>I was opposed entirely to the Bill or motion brought forward by Deputy Cogan here and the Bill or motion in the Seanad by Senators Sweetman and Counihan, because these Bills and motions associated with the question of price other matters with which I could not agree.  If the question of price solely is raised on its merits, I am prepared to back that and commit my Party to it.  Deputy Commons will find that there is no fairer and more reasonable way of dealing with land acquisition than the present way.  The present way has been successful, in so far as the price of land generally has been within a striking distance of the Land Commission price.</P>
    <P>There have been, time and again, various examples brought up of injustice by the Land Commission.  There are many people, including landowners, who want to have their cake and eat it.  People who owed land annuities or had mortgaged the land to the bank, had a tremendous grievance when the land annuities were collected out of the price they got and when the other mortgages were paid.  They found then that they were getting almost nothing.  The fact was that these <Col N="2594" /> people had nothing and, therefore, lost nothing.  The Land Commission price was not unfair up to now, but it is unfair now because of the changed price of land.  It would make for smoother working, for less injustice and more fair play all round, if the market value were paid.</P>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan spoke about a new outlook in regard to various Departments which should be applied to the Land Commission.  Even the Leader of my own Party was urging speed.  I am very much afraid of speed, now and again.  I think Talleyrand is one of the great diplomats who deprecated zeal. I have seen in the Land Commission a good deal of difficulty created by too great an insistence on speeding up matters.  I am not so concerned with the tremendous speed in land acquisition and division.  I would like to see as much as can possibly be done correctly, done every year, but I have doubts about speed.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to give us some information about the building of houses.  I understood a few years ago that the Land Commission was engaged in building, by way of experiment, open texture concrete houses and that the engineers of the Land Commission devised a chimney or an open fireplace which was guaranteed against smoke.  I want the Minister to tell us about this open texture concrete house.  Have they been successful? One of the great things we want in the country is a dry house and apparently these were intended to overcome all the difficulties of dampness.  Would he also let us know if the smokeless chimney invented by the engineers was entirely successful?  If so, I suggest that he take into account that the Board of Works, and even the Land Commission, had a habit some years ago of hanging maps, graphs and diagrams here in the House for the inspection of Deputies.  I would like to see some graphs, drawings and blue prints of these houses and these chimneys displayed in the House for the edification of Deputies, Senators and the general public.</P>
    <P>The Ceann Comhairle gave a ruling here that the Minister is not responsible for acquisition or division.  It is <Col N="2595" /> a good thing that he gave that ruling. I have urged time and again that the Minister had nothing to do with acquisition and have pointed out that that is the law of the land under Section 6 of the Act of 1933; but I could never persuade the present Minister that way at all.  If he does not accept my word, surely he will take the word of the Ceann Comhairle?  I mention that because Deputy Davin suggested it last night again.  He is here since 1923 and has been listening since 1923, but he is worse than the Bourbons&mdash;he forgets everything and learns nothing. Why did he say again last night that there should not be political interference with the work of the Land Commission?</P>

      <P>He talked last night about political interference.  I will offer certain criticism of the Minister and his policy, but I will say this for him, that he has not interfered, since he became Minister, with questions of acquisition and division.  He could not interfere, as the law of the land prevents him.  There is no political interference by a Minister&mdash;any Minister&mdash;with the inspectors of the Land Commission; and if there has been at any time, the officials of the Land Commission are a worthless crew.  Of course, Deputy Davin did say that he gave information to the Minister on certain estates in his own constituency. What did he expect the Minister to do about them?</P>

      <P>That the Minister <Col N="2596" /> should interfere with the Land Commission in what they are doing?  The Minister interfered once, when he was not a Minister, to the detriment of the work.  It is very unwise to interfere with the law.  Deputy Davin also asked&mdash;after all the years&mdash;what was the order of priority.  Surely that has been given in this House time and time again.  Everyone knows the order of priority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>He spoke about competent building contractors.  One of the reasons I want the Minister to produce the plans of the houses and the chimneys is to give information to men like Deputy Davin to take down to their own districts.  It is very difficult for the Land Commission to get competent builders in rural areas.  Many of the houses built by the Land Commission are built in out-of-the-way places.  It is very difficult to get skilled labour or trade union labour. The Land Commission must put up with the type of work they can get; so if they have made a success of a particular type of house or particular type of chimney, that information should be circulated for general knowledge.</P>
      <P>I always listen with interest to Deputy Davin.  He spoke about cottage tenants.  I have not the least objection to giving land to cottage tenants, but I want to insist on this point of view of my own.  If you give a man land and make him a farmer, do not keep him both a labourer and a farmer.  He is neither fish, flesh nor good red herring.  If there is a cottage tenant who is an industrious man, who takes conacre, who has some stock and who is capable of handling a piece of land, give him land and make him a farmer, but do not give him twopence-halfpenny worth of land and leave him half-labourer and half-farmer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Deputy McQuillan's remarks about forestry, I can picture the Minister's problem in going down to Mayo and taking over a rundale estate, building a forestry village in it and planting the whole place with trees.  I think that, instead of using armoured cars in a parade on Easter <Col N="2597" /> Monday, it would be better to send them down to that rundale estate in County Mayo to protect the Minister.</P>
    <P>There is a particular happening which was raised here about which I should like to question the Minister.  The action of the Land Commission in that respect may be entirely justifiable.  In Dromin, County Limerick, on an estate near the town of Kilmallock, a man had three acres on a temporary convenience letting.  A temporary convenience letting is merely, I take it, a letting which is made pending the vesting eventually of the lessee.  For some reason or other, these three acres were taken from that individual and given to a man who already had 80 acres.  I think that is wrong and I think it needs justification.  I should like the Minister to give us definite particulars of that case.  Finally, I do not think the Minister ought to confine himself completely to the few words a clerical officer of the Land Commission thought it worth while to throw at the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been in this House since 1946 and this is the third debate on the Vote for the Department of Lands to which I have listened. While in opposition, I was naturally very critical of the manner in which the Land Commission set about doing its duty.  Everybody must admit that, last year, I was equally critical of what the Land Commission was doing, and.  If this year there are Deputies who are disappointed that more has not been done in the past year, I can assure the House that I am not disappointed, because, as I have always said, the Land Commission, constituted as it is at present, did nothing last year, will do nothing this year and will do nothing next year or any other year.  There is no use in saying anything else about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You have in the Land Commission an unwieldy, worthless, archaic machine costing an immense amount of money every year.  If we look back over the 27 odd years the Land Commission has been in existence and think that almost £1,500,000 has been voted for that body each year&mdash;a body which was supposed to be temporary and to have completed its job within a certain time <Col N="2598" />&mdash;a total approaching £54,000,000 to a Department which has not yet got within 100 miles of accomplishing the job it set out to do, we must realise that it is time every Deputy spoke out the facts and expressed himself without fear.  If the land question is to be finally settled and brought to a successful conclusion, the first thing that must be removed is the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>I have a certain regard for the Minister as a colleague and as the man responsible in great degree for bringing me into this House, but I can assure him that very grave dissatisfaction exists in our county where congestion is at its highest because of the very futile effort made during the past year by the Land Commission.  The people who are very keen judges, because, after 25 or 30 years of waiting and expecting, they have been taught quite a few things, did not expect any great wonders last year, as they realised that the Estimate the Minister was working on was an Estimate prepared by his predecessor.  They looked forward this year, however, to a big increase in the amount voted for the Land Commission and the prospect of completely new legislation which would speed up its work and make an effort to bring about a settlement of the problem in a short time.  Unfortunately for them and for the Deputies who come from Mayo, there is no sign of any great increase and even less sign of any legislation. It is all very fine to say that legislation will be introduced.  Lord save us from more legislation!  We have more than enough in the Land Commission already without introducing any more until the decks have been cleared and something new started in a way which will do some good.</P>
    <P>I admit, and I have always said it, that nobody in this House is opposed to land division and that the relief of congestion brought about by acquisition and redivision of land is the main object of the Land Commission.  No Deputy is totally opposed to that.  The proof of that lies in the fact that Deputy Cogan, a few months ago. could get only two Deputies to support him in a measure designed to take powers out of the hands of the Land Commission and stop land division altogether and these Deputies, Deputy <Col N="2599" /> Cogan included, I honestly believe, were not totally opposed to the acquisition and division of land.  When we have the entire support of all Parties and wholehearted enthusiasm from every Deputy from both city and country, where are we to lay the blame?  I have always laid it in a certain place and I still lay it there&mdash;in 24 Merrion Street, which is a monument to inefficiency and worthlessness if ever there was one in this country.</P>
    <P>We have been told that 20,000 acres were divided in the past 12 months. Maybe there were and maybe there were not, but I know that very little was divided in the county I come from. Perhaps the Minister has some scheme in mind about which I know nothing and perhaps land is being divided in County Mayo about which I know nothing, but I know that constituency from one end to the other far better than the Minister or any other Deputy who ever represented the county and if land has not been taken over and divided, the waste land in County Mayo, in the heart of the congestion, are we foolish enough to believe that 20,000 acres have been divided elsewhere? No; I can assure the House that that sort of tale is not going to convince me in any way.  We have this Land Commission machine.  The ex-Minister for Lands, Deputy Moylan, tells us that he is not too fond of speed. He is not too fond of speed, or he was not too fond of speed, but he found himself in the Land Commission as tied up and as helpless in the hands of that body as the present Minister for Lands finds himself to-day.  Will either of them, or will any Deputy who is ever elected to the post of Minister for Lands, have the courage to cut the red tape that surrounds that Department and introduce a simple, effective measure which will do the work in a short space of time?  It is unfortunate for this country that we have to say that if the old Congested Districts Board were here we would have this job cleared up and finished long ago. Their object and aim was to have land acquisition, division and resale to the tenants finished by the year 1925.  Now we are wandering again in the same old way that has been pursued since the <Col N="2600" /> Congested Districts Board was incorporated in the Land Commission, and we will continue to ramble on.  I forecast that next year on the Estimate for Lands the position will be the same. I hope sincerely that I am wrong but, from my knowledge of things as they are, I will give a pretty sure guarantee that I am right.</P>
    <P>It is not as easy to resettle land problems as it is to deal with the work of other Departments of State, and if the Minister has not shown the activity that we have seen in certain other Departments of State, I would not be too critical or too severe on him for that but, when we see that an effort is not being made, despite the appeals and encouragement of every Deputy, we know well that something must be done and now is the time to do it. The Minister knows as well as I do that the position is not satisfactory. He must know it, coming from the same constituency.  He must know of the large farms in County Mayo the owners of which have not been disturbed. No effort is being made to disturb them.  He must know the large farms which are derelict, which are non-residential, which are not worked and which are going absolutely waste, growing furze, rushes, having hills and banks which have not been levelled since the people were evicted out of them 500 years ago.  All these lands are in congested Mayo, and no effort is being made to acquire them.</P>
    <P>Last year on the Estimate for Lands I raised a question about a farm on which Captain Boycott was boycotted. The word &ldquo;boycott&rdquo; was introduced into the English language because of the aggressiveness and determination of a group of Mayo tenant farmers. What do we find now?  We find that the Land Commissioners have sat in judgment to acquire 100 acres of the 600 acres owned by the present owner, that they decided to reserve judgment, if you do not mind, rather than give a straight decision and the excuse given was that the present owner's son was a veterinary surgeon and was very anxious to start a stud farm with racehorses and that he was entitled to these 100 acres.  That is the reason given while, outside the fence, there <Col N="2601" /> is a sub-tenant of the owner of this land, a married man with six children, who has two acres of land.  I met that man the other day.  He could get conacre from this landlord while compulsory tillage was in force but he cannot get a single place now to sow a ridge of potatoes or a rood of oats or anything else to feed his wife and children. Our beloved warriors decided that racehorses are more important than the question of putting people on the land.  What is going to be done?  I may be going outside the scope of the Estimate, but I will take a chance on it, Sir.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The latest effort that is being made to relieve congestion is another brain-wave, the acquisition of two, three, four and five-acre derelict holdings in County Mayo.  I have personal knowledge of a holding of ten acres of land which has been acquired because the owner had to go to America 20 years <Col N="2602" /> ago.  He could not live there and the holding has been acquired.  Side by side with it is a farm of 317 acres which is not being worked or tilled.  That has been in the Land Commission Court for 27 years and has not been taken over.  This ten-acre holding has been taken over within the past 18 months or two years.  How long will it take the inspectors of the Land Commission and the commission as a whole to solve congestion by taking over five, six or ten-acre patches all over the country?  They may have bigger schemes for the Midlands.  I do not know.  I am speaking with personal knowledge of what is being done in my own constituency.</P>
    <P>The people are disappointed and I am disappointed that there is not a greater increase in the amount of money given to the Minister for Lands this year, but I can well imagine the present Minister for Finance, a hard Minister whose object is to eliminate waste in every Department saying to the present Minister for Lands: &ldquo;Clean up your Department and explain to me why of the money that is voted for your Department almost one-half goes in administration.  When you can explain that, perhaps I may decide to give you a further increase.&rdquo;  I can imagine that that is something the present Minister for Finance would be very likely to say and, if he said it, I would admire him.</P>

      <P>What can you expect from this archaic, useless machine that has been standing in the way of progress for such a long number of years? The ex-Minister for Lands, Deputy Moylan, talked about the full market value for land.  He, of course, is of the opinion that I am totally opposed to paying the full market value of land to anybody and he would like, I suppose, <Col N="2603" /> to put the brand of Moscow around my neck if he possibly could.  But I can assure him that I am not opposed to paying good reasonable prices for the land acquired, because if you look at it this way, in the long run it is to the benefit of the tenant who gets it and to the country as a whole.  A tenant farmer has to pay £8, £9 or £10 an acre for conacre over a period of 20 years.  Eleven months' title is all he has and after 20 years he may be put out.  He would not begrudge paying a little extra on the annuity or if the terms of purchase were extended to 50 years letting someone who comes after him pay it he would not have any objection because he would be coming in for a very good bargain.  If such a thing is introduced, do not let Deputy Moylan say that I am going to oppose it, but in the case of the aliens who have come into the country over the last seven or eight years and who have bought large tracts of land I would be very slow in giving those boys the full market value.</P>
      <P>I intended to be very short and I will be very short.  I can assure the Minister and the House that my time is too much occupied down the country trying to keep control and peace among constituents and smallholders who are looking for land to spend time standing up here talking about it.  We have been talking, talking, talking for the past 25 years.  The Land Commission have done a little and there is no use in saying that they sat down on their job entirely.</P>

I have a feeling that he has moved into the Six Counties for it because, as far as the County Mayo is concerned at any rate, it looks like that.  The people are getting impatient and they demand an explanation from the Minister as to why things are not moving faster.  I do not blame him because a greater man than he could not succeed in one year where others have failed, not only in <Col N="2604" /> 16 years, but in 25 years, and there is no use in saying that in that time he could unravel all the red tape which exists at the present moment.  However, he should say either that the Land Commission must go and that something new must take its place or else admit frankly, candidly and openly that nothing will be done in the future to satisfy the demands of the smallholders.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MatthewOReilly" hpid="Mr. M. O'Reilly Mr. M. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I am correct in stating that the Land Commission was set up by this House; at least it was accepted when the change of Government took place, and I take it that the officials of the Land Commission simply function under our orders and that we give the orders from here by means of legislation.  I think that it is hardly fair to make an attack on the officials of the Land Commission if what I say is a fact.  I think the remedy is&mdash;and perhaps we should have to advocate legislation for it&mdash;that this House should abolish the Land Commission and pass new Land Acts.  The land question is a very old one.  In fact, by the time the Irish land question left the British House of Commons it was a very old one and it has become a very old question here.  But yet we do not seem to show any signs of a conclusion of this very important matter.  It appears to me to be one which will go on for a great number of years.  Every Act of Parliament which the British passed was to be the last and every Act we passed here&mdash;and we have passed a few&mdash;was to be the last, so that something else is needed if we are to go any faster than we are going with the machinery we have at present. I do not know, but I suppose that what we are suffering from is this question of security of tenure.  We may all be a little shy of admitting that, but it is so.  It was a very good thing and it came from County Mayo.  I think that the Minister will agree with me that in considering any change in legislation that is one of the big difficulties. We might as well face the thing honestly as there is not much use in going down the country and telling those who are looking for land that it is all the fault of the Land Commission or of the Minister.  I think if they <Col N="2605" /> want the land and if it is not given to them that it is the fault of this House that has not passed the necessary legislation to do that.</P>
      <P>When the new Government came into power I noticed that there was very great enthusiasm in the County Meath to get land.  Sunday after Sunday large groups of men met in the different areas to discuss the land question. They even discussed the owners of land in the vicinity and they solemnly proposed deputations to the Minister which the Minister received. Those deputations continued for quite a long time.  Whatever the Minister said to them recently&mdash;he may have explained to them what the difficulties were&mdash;those deputations, as far as I know, ceased to annoy him.  Those deputations were mostly from landless men and by legislation landless men are practically excluded from getting land.  While I am on that point I may say that I think that that is a pity.  I have, of course, experience of where the Land Commission considered certain types of landless men and gave them land, especially land that was not compulsorily acquired.  I think that is a very good idea and I do not think that one of those men turned out to be a failure.  They were married men who lived in rented houses on rented land and each and every one of them who got land turned out to be extremely successful.  There were other types of men who got land and who, for one reason or another, let their land and were caught.  In the case of other types of men to whom the Land Commission gave land it set conditions down and there were one or two instances where the Land Commission laid down the condition that the man in question should get married.  In one instance the man did get married but he still has notice to quit, the Land Commission will not accept any rent, and that has been going on for three years. That man is an excellent farmer but he might have made the mistake of buying an extra bit of land but, be that as it may, the land which the Land Commission gave him is derelict to all intents and purposes.  The man could not be expected to stock it or till it, knowing that before it could be harvested, he could be evicted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2606" /> That is not only one case as there are several and I think that the Land Commission should decide that if a man is not a suitable tenant he will be put out, but if they are wrong and the man is a suitable tenant they should admit it and let him carry on on the land.  That is a serious grievance and I have written several times to the Land Commission but have got the usual reply that &ldquo;the matter is under consideration.&rdquo;  I am quite sure that I am not the only Deputy with such complaints as those and even if no other Deputy should have received these complaints I think such cases as I have mentioned should be looked into and rectified.</P>
    <P>As I said, the function of the Land Commission is the acquisition of the land and, having done that, it is the body that divides the land.  If this House has any grievance in regard to that principle, well it is then a matter for legislation and for the setting up of some other body to do the work.  I have often pondered on the question when travelling over the lands in County Meath when land division started first.  In most estates in parts of the County Meath you will see quite distinctively the remains of small houses and small holdings.  One would come to the conclusion that at some period or another there must have been an intensive scheme of land division and that that was followed by an intensive scheme of the destruction of all the small holdings and the creation of large ones.  We seem now to be repeating that process.  I take it that that is due to the economic conditions of the day.  I take it that certain policies such as grass production and cattle production depopulate the country and that the natural course is larger farms.  Therefore, I think the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Lands should always keep in close and friendly touch with one another.  It might very conceivably happen that a Minister for Agriculture would immediately undo what a Minister for Lands was trying to achieve.  If we accept the fact that the policy of a Government at one period resulted in a number of small farms and the policy of a Government at another period resulted in a number of large farms, the <Col N="2607" /> question would seem to me to be an economic one and one that is largely controlled by the Department of Agriculture. I just wonder now, if the policy proposed to be pursued by the present Minister for Agriculture is developed to its full extent, what the position of all the small holders in the country will be.  I think that policy is going to tend, and must naturally tend, towards larger farms in this country.  In fact, there is a clear indication that that is happening now. Small economic farms, that have recently been vested, the 21 and the 25 acre type of farm, are gradually passing into the hands of larger men. Therefore, I think this House should take serious note of the policy of the Department of Agriculture now and at any time because it must largely influence the position.  If we admit that the destruction of all those small farms which took place years ago was caused by changes in economic conditions here&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is all very well to say: &ldquo;Cromwell did that.&rdquo;  That may be a fairly palatable political statement to make, but if the question is properly analysed it will be found that Cromwell had not everything to do with it.  The economic conditions prevailing had a big influence.  We will also find that perhaps 100 or 120 years ago people gave up their land and walked off it.  We will find that less than 100 years ago people sold comparatively large farms for £200 in order to get to America.  Therefore, the members of this House, no matter on what side we may sit, will need to be extremely careful about the policy to be pursued here, especially as far as the Department of Agriculture is concerned.  I know that at the present time, and there is no use in denying it, there are men on land who are extremely <Col N="2608" /> nervous about their position, especially new farmers who are trying to build up their farms.  We must remember that rates are now three times what they were when these fellows got the land and that it is now a question of rates and not of land annuities.  I think nobody will deny that economic conditions are responsible.  The Minister himself will have to admit that on his farm at home the rates are a big problem on him&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If I were to go into that matter in detail the Leas-Cheann Comhairle would probably pull me up, because I should have to deal with the policy of the Minister for Agriculture.</P>

      <P>However, even in the city one can see the results of the failure of the Land Commission to do its work.  We see that failure in the number of young men and women who, being unable to make a living on the little holdings on which they were reared, have come to Dublin or emigrated. From that point of view the question is not entirely one relating <Col N="2609" /> to the particular districts from which these young people have migrated or emigrated.  It becomes a national difficulty.</P>
      <P>There can be no doubt that the Land Commission has failed and, if a free vote of this House were taken, I am convinced that this Vote would be defeated. Many Deputies have spoken here to-day particularly Deputy Moran and Deputy Commons who advocated the abolition of the Land Commission. I suggest that this should be the last chance which the Land Commission will have to vindicate itself and that if next year, as Deputy Moran has suggested, it has failed in its purpose this House should refuse to vote the Estimate which is made for the purpose of carrying on the Land Commission.</P>
      <P>It seems to be quite evident that the Minister or the ex-Minister or their predecessors have no power whatever and it behoves this House to take steps to eliminate entirely the obstruction to the realisation of the ideals which the Land Commission should have.  A year ago my friend, Deputy Cowan, suggested, I think quite jocosely, that the Land Commission should be taken down to the Bog of Allen and that an atom bomb should be dropped on it. I think that he was really wrong because, since we know very little about the nuclear division of the atom and its radio-active potentialities, it seems to me that until the scientific maximum to the indestructibility of matter will have been disproved, we cannot get rid of the Land Commission and the effect it has on national life.</P>
      <P>I find myself in a difficulty about this Vote.  I cannot even now support the Vote unless I am convinced that a genuine effort will be made to achieve the object for which the Land Commission was established.  I feel, as one trying to obey the Commandments, that I would be violating the Commandments if I supported this motion unless I was convinced that there was a reasonable hope that, during the coming year, at any rate, an effort will be made which would improve the condition of the victims, of those who suffer from congestion in various parts of Ireland and those who want certain divisions of land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2610" /> I think Deputy O'Reilly was wrong when he said that the Land Commission was an institution of any Dáil.  I do not think it was.  I think it was instituted by the British Government in the year 1919 and that it was the sequel to a system under which the Congested Districts Board operated.  I am afraid, however, that since its institution and its adoption by the law which has been accepted in this land it has maintained its original British imperialistic outlook; that the Land Commission is a deterrent to the progress of agricultural life in this country and that its total abolition at once is the only hope of salvation for many an emigrant who, because of the ineptitude of the Land Commission, is forced to leave the country to earn his living in a foreign land.</P>
    <P>Last year at the conclusion of his speech, the Minister threw bouquets to the responsible officers of his Department. I hope he will throw no bouquets this year and that this House will realise its responsibility to the people, give practical effect to what is really the wish of the people and, by its vote and by its expression of opinion, remove from the Governmental Departments of this State this Department which has been responsible for so much trouble, so much emigration and so much unemployment.</P>
    <P>I agree entirely with most of the things that Deputy Moran has said and I think his contribution to this debate was most enlightened, that it was most effective, and that his speech was one which deserves and merits careful consideration.  He spoke with a knowledge of his subject and he certainly convinced me that the abolition of this Department is essential for the development of our social life.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not my intention to quote any of the speeches made by the Minister when in opposition, although I know there is a temptation to a Deputy on this side of the House to do so.  Deputy Moran did it and I must say the Minister seemed to enjoy it.  I suppose one cannot blame the Minister for making these speeches because he could hardly have anticipated that the political roulette would operate so quickly and put him over <Col N="2611" /> there last year.  The very things that he said over a number of years here were said by people who were behind the Fianna Fáil Government for years previously.  The type of speech made on the Land Commission Vote seems to be non-Party and I do not think any Minister for Lands has ever had very many bouquets thrown at him.  I think the Minister, by his admission of having interfered in the settlement of a place in his own constituency, lent colour to the fact that politicians do exercise some influence in the activities of the Land Commission.  The speech of Deputy Moran and the exchanges between him and the Minister on the question of the rearrangement of a holding in a place called Kiltarsaun indicated that some interference took place there.  I was very interested in the discussion about Kiltarsechane.  I am satisfied, from what I heard about it during Deputy Moran's speech, that whatever injustice was attempted there will be remedied or prevented as a result of the attention it got here to-day. In so far as Kiltarsechane can be taken as typical of the problem of congestion in the west, I welcome the attention it has got.  I never had anything to say on this Vote except in so far as it related to congestion, but I am puzzled a good deal&mdash;I have been bewildered year after year&mdash;by the contradictions which I have listened to in the House.  I do not believe that an atomic bomb should be thrown on the Land Commission.  The people who man the Land Commission are no different in their outlook from the people who come in here as members of this House, and if the members of this House were put into the Land Commission, were given the same powers and were subject to the same restrictions, I take it that the Land Commission people would in turn, if they were in this House, subject us to the same sort of criticism that we hurl at them. The Minister asked Deputy Commons what he would put in place of the Land Commission.  I think that was a very pertinent question.  Personally, I can offer no suggestion on that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The two matters of the acquisition and distribution of land are&mdash;every <Col N="2612" /> Deputy knows it, the Minister knows, and he knew it when he went to Kiltarsechane&mdash;reserved matters, and we have no influence as far as they are concerned.  I mentioned here last year &mdash;everyone knows it&mdash;that when Fianna Fáil was in office, what we, the Fianna Fáil Deputies, had to contend against most was the charge that was hurled at us every time we went to the annual meetings of our organisation locally, namely, that if you were a supporter of Fianna Fáil you got nothing from the Land Commission&mdash;that it was the supporters of the Opposition Parties who got anything that was going.  In my opinion that, in any event, answers the charge that the Land Commission was subject to political influence.  The Land Commission officials have their instructions, cut and dried, handed out to them.  I think that the most recent instructions in regard to the division of land were, as far as I can remember, drawn up about 13 or 14 years ago&mdash; that is, in regard to the classes of people who should get land: disemployed persons, congests, migrants, and so forth, with the preference which the I.R.A. men got in each of these categories. These instructions were well-defined; and from what I know of the activities of the Land Commission, they have been followed.</P>
    <P>Personally, I have no criticism to offer in regard to the division of land. I have often gone to places where there was very severe criticism of the manner in which an estate was divided. I always made it a point to meet some people in the locality who had got no land and were not looking for any land, and have asked them for their opinion as to the division.  I was almost always told that the division was quite fair.  I think that the stock joke of <i>Dublin Opinion</i> is fairly apposite in this connection: there is a Land Commission man, having done his job, starting up his car to move off; the local people are watching him go, and one says to the other: &ldquo;Well, he must have done his work very fairly indeed; there is not a man in the whole place satisfied!&rdquo; With regard to the division of land, I think that, usually, is the verdict of the people who have got land, and of those who have been applicants.</P>
    <P>I am all at one with the complaints <Col N="2613" /> that have been made about the slowness of the Land Commission.  I think it is a matter not only for the Minister but for the Government and the Dáil to consider how this problem of the slowness of the Land Commission in acquiring land can be overcome. Rightly or wrongly, the last Government suspended all activities in connection with land acquisition during the emergency.  Whether it was necessary to suspend those activities entirely is a matter on which it is not worth while wasting time now.  The problem is to find out how acquisition can be speeded up.  I would like to say to the Minister that it is not because there has been a change of Government, or because he is now the Minister, or because his own words can be used against him, that we are making criticisms. I would say that Fianna Fáil Deputies, if their own Party were the Government, would continue to make the same type of critical speech that they have been in the habit of making down the years on this Vote.  The Minister cannot take the criticism as being purely the result of Party bias, particularly as we know, and as I have stated, that his powers in the matter of acquisition are practically nil.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of the use of political influence, it seems to me that a lot of the people who have complained about the faults of the Land Commission complained because they have not been allowed to use influence themselves, and to the extent to which that is so, I think their case for a change in the system fails.</P>
    <P>Another question on which I have heard two conflicting views is that of unsuitable tenants and of vesting.  If we have the complaint that the Land Commission have given land to a large number of people who have proved to be unsuitable, then I think the slowness of the Land Commission in vesting people is, possibly, a good thing, because if you vest too soon and vest unsuitable people, then you are really sealing the harm which you have done and you are preventing yourself from making any change.  It seems to me that vesting is not the big cause of any of the complaints that we hear in the country.  It is rather the question of getting the land, getting buildings <Col N="2614" /> on it, and getting down to production on the land.  Personally, I would have the problem in my constituency solved if all the available land outside of it&mdash; all the good land&mdash;were divided, but while speeches are made here that there is land available in those parts east of the Shannon, then so long will you have this problem of congestion in the west coming up on this Vote each year.  So long as that land is available, so long will we, the representatives of the congested areas, put forward that as a solution for our difficulties&mdash;that some of that land should be made available for our congests.</P>
    <P>It is practically on a par with the question of the preservation of the Gaeltacht and of the Irish language. I can say here that the interest of the people of the Gaeltacht in the Irish language is governed very largely by the interest of the people outside the Gaeltacht in the language.  If it is ever borne in on the minds of the Gaeltacht people that the people outside the Gaeltacht do not want the Irish language, then from that time on the people of the Gaeltacht will give up the language, because it is for the nation that they are trying to hold it. The same applies to the land.  So long as the land is there to be divided&mdash; and we are told that there are from 500,000 to 1,000,000 acres to be divided&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have mentioned one matter here year after year and it is not because I am in opposition that I am mentioning it again.  I would like the Minister to produce some sort of <Col N="2615" /> schedule, or perhaps two schedules, of areas, one giving us the list of places where congestion is worst and where he must migrate people before he can rearrange.  That is the urgent problem of the congested areas.  There are places where you must migrate before you can rearrange and I suggest that those should be tackled first, because in those areas the people are not allowed to build a dwellinghouse, as the Minister knows.  They cannot get a local government grant or assistance from the Land Commission and there is no other means whereby these people can give themselves a decent habitation.  It is a damning commentary on any Government&mdash;it does not matter what Party it represents&mdash;that that should be so.</P>
      <P>Possibly there are some places where you can have rearrangement without migration and where these housing grants can usually be made available to the people, but nobody will avail himself of housing facilities until he knows finally where his holding boundaries will be.  If, as the Minister knows, a portion of land is taken from one man and given to another and he builds a house, that will prevent the Land Commission from doing a proper rearrangement job, or he may find his house eventually on somebody else's land. That problem is a very urgent one and I do not think the number of estates where there must be migration before there can be rearrangement is very large.  I ask the Minister to list them first and then to make out a list of the parts of the country generally regarded as ranch areas and give information to the public as to the amount of land which is available in each of these areas for the purpose of relieving congestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard a good deal of talk in the country, particularly from Coalition Deputies, on the necessity for having the Government given the best advice, having advisory councils set up in relation to agriculture, industry and education&mdash;these are the three things that come readily to mind&mdash;but it seems to me there is a more urgent need for some other sort of council in view of the criticisms we have heard about the <Col N="2616" /> inadequacy of the Land Commission for its task.  There should be some sort of council that will advise the Minister, the Government and the Land Commission as to how the relief of congestion can be reconciled with meeting the legitimate demands of people entitled to land in the counties where land is available.  That is the kernel of our problem.  It is not really the inefficiency of the Land Commission or the inadequacy of the machinery provided; it is this eternal conflict between the congested areas and the areas where ranches are located.  It is not a question of Party at all.</P>
    <P>We hear pleas made year after year for landless men and we have been told often by Ministers that if you give land to landless men in any part of the country you will not be able to make any appreciable effort at solving congestion. Could we not set up a council of broadminded, patriotic men who will regard the available land as a national pool and start off on the premise that the relief of congestion should be the first duty of land settlement?  A council of that sort might be able to smooth out a lot of the difficulties arising from these jealousies.  If the representatives of the various constituencies cannot agree to the establishment of such a council and cannot take the big view necessary to enable the Land Commission to solve congestion, I do not see any hope of an ultimate settlement and the quicker the Land Commission draws a line through the ranches and makes holdings for landless men or whoever else is entitled to land, until the time is reached when there is no more land left, the better, and we in the congested areas will have to seek some other solution.</P>
    <P>At the present time we have a form of migration from the congested areas such as we have not had in my memory. There are families migrating from Connemara to America, whole families selling out their bits of land.  If these families have to give up their little holdings, would it not be far better to give them to the Land Commission in return for holdings elsewhere?</P>
    <P>On the question of production, I will refer the Minister to the statement issued some years ago by the Land Commission giving comparative figures <Col N="2617" /> of production on the holding in the West from which the migrants came and on the holdings in County Meath and elsewhere to which they were allocated. The change certainly marks an enormous increase in the standard of living of the people who got the new holdings.  The figures for butter, eggs and bacon, to take three items, were certainly encouraging and were a very definite justification of the policy of transferring these people.  I know that even when you do give them holdings on which they can provide their families with a decent standard of living, you still have need of some industry to employ the extra boys and girls.  That problem is in every holding in Ireland, whether it is 30 or 100 acres.  It can only be met by a general policy of industrialisation.</P>
    <P>If we are not going to have that policy of industrialisation, it seems to me that the making of small holdings of 25 or 30 acres eventually will have to be abandoned.  On the other hand, if we are going to industrialise and provide employment at home, the size of the holding will gradually tend to be less.  That has been demonstrated in the vicinity of large towns.  People have been able to make a fairly good living on small portions of land near a good market town.  It happens in Galway in the Moycullen area, which is in a bad way from the point of view of the class and the amount of land that the people have.  It has been demonstrated that, with the Galway market available, they have been able in a great many cases to give their children a secondary education.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to try in any event to deal as scientifically as possible with this problem of the relief of congestion.  I would like him to tell us the extent to which he can go in the matter of migration.  Could the Minister not take the two counties of Galway and Mayo as a beginning and point out the areas there where there is congestion and say to the people there: &ldquo;We will take so many of you out.&rdquo; If that could be done and if certain land were earmarked for these people, then definite progress could be made.  The other people in the areas would know what to expect.  Those <Col N="2618" /> who could not be migrated should be told that their holdings would be rearranged and that that was the best that could be done for them.  They would then go ahead and take advantage of the housing facilities available to them.  It is work of that kind that we want.  I know that that may cause disappointment but it is better that disappointment should be created now and that the people should know exactly what they may expect.  This dangling of a carrot before their noses indefinitely is a negation of policy.  I would ask the Minister to put an end to it once and for all.  I would ask the Minister to give that information for which I have asked because it will be of advantage to those interested in the affairs of the country, irrespective of whether they be town dwellers or countrymen and irrespective of whether or not they know anything about agriculture.</P>
    <P>Observing how much talk there is about the establishment of councils to advise Ministers, I think the Minister for Lands should seriously consider the setting up of a council to advise him. I am not suggesting anything in the nature of a revival of the old Congested Districts Board.  That board was set up at a time when land was available within the confines of the congested areas.  That board did its job. That board had executive authority and was given money to spend.  I do not suggest that anything like that should be set up now.  The Land Commission has taken over all the functions formerly exercised by the Congested Districts Board.  I want a council representative of the whole country which would reconcile the conflicting viewpoints on the problem of land settlement.  If we can get these conflicts resolved I think it would be an important step towards getting on with the job and bringing it to a satisfactory conclusion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I represent a constituency in which the land problem is not a great one.  The number of small holdings in County Dublin can be said to be great, especially having regard to the fact that a serious land problem does not exist in the area.  From the figures supplied by the Minister there are 5,241 holdings of less than five acres.  I think the question of bringing migrants into County Dublin could not arise when we see the number of small-holders already in the county. There is an inclination on the part of small-holders in the western counties to believe that there are large tracts in the eastern counties which should be acquired and divided amongst them. The figures I have given certainly prove that so far as Dublin is concerned there is scarcely enough land there to divide amongst deserving applicants.  The number of holdings of five to ten acres is 653; of ten to 15 acres 369; between 15 and 30 acres 760.  It can readily be seen from those figures that there are practically 7,000 small-holders in County Dublin.  We have, too, in that area intensive cultivation.  A large volume of the agricultural produce grown in County Dublin is sent to the Dublin market.  In proportion to the area the produce from County Dublin is greater than from any other county in Ireland.  We have small-holders in Rush, Lusk, Skerries, Malahide and <Col N="2620" /> Coolock supplying a ready demand for the produce of their land in the Dublin market at the present time.  Many of these people got holdings.  I have heard speakers say they did not consider a holding of less than 50 acres an economic one.  I can say, however, that these people who have smaller holdings are able to earn a good living. Therefore, I am inclined to believe that the size of the holding depends on the area in which it is located and a uniform size could not be regarded as suitable in any particular area.</P>
      <P>The Land Commission, as it is to-day, is a monument to the old Cumann na nGaedheal Government in that it recognised the importance of land settlement and adopted the principles of the old Congested Districts Board which it was intended to replace.  Some Deputies have complained that the machinery of the Land Commission is slow.  When one's holding is going to be acquired the question of justice arises.  The attitude of the Land Commission in moving carefully and slowly is a very good one to ensure that there will be no injustice imposed on those who must suffer the loss of their land in order to facilitate the creation of these small holdings.  In addition, it is only fair to say that the value of land has been enhanced during the war years with the result that the Land Commission finds it very difficult to pay what could be regarded as a fair price for land when it is considered that, if any of these landowners were permitted to sell in the open market, they could realise a very much better price. I believe that the existing price restrictions hinder more speedy progress so far as the Land Commission is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of allocation of land is one which should have better attention from the State.  When a holding of land is given to a person it must be remembered that it is a gift from the Stateprovided at the expense of the taxpayers. The Land Commission as a Department of the Government should see, therefore, that the land is properly used.  They should supervise the management of those farms which should not be left merely to the discretion of the lucky allottee.  He may have been considered the most deserving <Col N="2621" /> applicant for that particular farm. It is, however, the duty of the Land Commission to see that the man who gets it will show that he was deserving of it inasmuch as he is capable of managing the land.  There are examples of persons who were never connected with land, who never lived on the land, and who never managed or worked it but who got holdings of land.  It is not a fair return to the taxpayers who pay for that holding.  It could not be expected that a man who is not used to the management of land could walk in, take possession and produce the same volume of produce as a farmer or farm worker or farm manager who had been on the land all his life.  I am, therefore, inclined to ask the Minister to consult with his Department in order to see whether it would be possible to prepare statistics to measure the number of units of agricultural production that comes from any particular holding. That, I believe, would be a way of measuring whether the man who received the holding was really entitled to it and was giving a return to the taxpayers who contributed towards its acquisition.</P>
    <P>This question of land acquisition is not merely one of relieving congestion. We must remember that the idea is to contribute to the life of the nation by putting on that land families who will play their part in improving economic conditions for themselves and for the country.  There are many uneconomic holders in County Dublin.  I believe the question cannot be solved for County Dublin according to the amount of available land for suitable holdings that could be acquired and divided.  I hope, therefore, that the Land Commission will consider the claims of natives of County Dublin before they consider the claims of persons from any other area when land which has been acquired is in the process of division.  There is also the question of acquiring land which might be considered suitable but which is already being worked and managed by a farmer. No matter what size the farm is if the farmer is managing and working the land in a proper way that holding should not be acquired from him when there are other large farms in the area belonging to persons who do not reside <Col N="2622" /> in this country.  The Department should first direct their attention towards acquiring land owned by persons not resident in this country.  At a later stage the larger estates could receive the necessary attention.</P>
    <P>There is a scheme whereby the persons who are allotted a holding are provided with a certain amount of equipment and a small wage for the first year during which they are in possession.  We are advancing towards a machine-age and I would be inclined to advocate the provision of a light tractor for a couple of migrants who are together, so that they could till the land intensively by arrangement between themselves.  Nobody will dispute the fact that a 25-acre farm is not capable of feeding two horses all the year round, and perhaps a couple of cows as well, if that farm is expected to be cultivated and managed intensively. I would advocate the use of light machinery on those holdings instead of providing horses which, I believe, the farms are not capable of feeding economically.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that many persons who got these holdings in the past had not used them.  I am afraid the Land Commission up to the present has been far too slow in telling them to get out in order to allow them to hand over that farm to some man who will manage and work the land.  For instance, persons holding public positions and in public employment are away all day at their work and go back at night to live on the Land Commission farm which has been made available to them. That is not a reasonable state of affairs and the question of giving land to such persons should not arise.  If it is considered that they are deserving of a holding and then it is obvious that they do not intend to manage and could not manage that holding they should get a cash gratuity.  The taxpayers should know what they are paying for and what they are going to get.  There is an inclination amongst those people to insist on having the land vested in them and the very minute they get it up go the auction bills.  They then succeed in receiving what they would have preferred to have got in the first instance, a cash gratuity.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2623" /> Last year I advocated that this question of vesting needed attention and that the vesting was not nearly quick enough.  I withdraw every word now I said in that respect and I am going to advocate that, until the Land Commission are quite certain that the man who wants to have his land vested, is a man deserving of having land instead of having it taken from him, it should not be vested.  Unfortunately I have seen land vested in the past year in certain persons and as soon as it was vested, the auctioneer was consulted and the farm in question advertised for sale in the newspapers.  It was not a very good example to people in that locality, some of whom were agitating for some of these lands themselves, to see them being advertised for sale in the newspapers.</P>
    <P>Again we have the example of persons who got these holdings going heavily into debt, some of them to the extent of nearly £1,000, gambling on the hope that the land would be vested in the allottees some day and would be put up for sale and that they could then pay off these debts.  If the Land Commission become aware that a man is going into debt, instead of meeting his ordinary current expenses, I think they should immediately arrive at the conclusion that he is not capable of managing the holding and that they should take steps to recover possession of it so as to enable it to be allocated to a more deserving applicant.</P>
    <P>I do not want to prolong the debate but I should like to say a few words in reference to roads constructed by the Land Commission when these holdings are being parcelled out.  It seems to me, from what I have been told by the tenants, that when a roadway is constructed by the Land Commission at the time the holdings are being divided, they refuse to give any more attention to the roads and suggest that the county council should become responsible for repair.  Unfortunately the attitude of the county council is, if these roadways are culs-de-sac, that they will not carry out repairs.  The result is that the tenants find they have a laneway which is nobody's baby and they cannot use it for the purpose of carrying on ordinary farm work.  There <Col N="2624" /> is an example in my own county where neither the butcher, the baker nor the grocer will drive his van, as the road is in such a bad condition and neither the Land Commission nor the county councll will accept any responsibility for carrying out repairs.  The surrounding landholders are unable to subscribe sufficient money to enable them to avail of the benefits of the rural improvement scheme.  I believe that some arrangement should be come to in such cases between the Land Commission and the county council whereby one or other of them would undertake the repair of these roads at the end of a certain period.</P>
    <P>I think that the time has come when a survey of all holdings that might be acquired by the Land Commission should be carried out.  I should like the Minister to be in a position at an early date to say that there are so many acres in County Dublin and in County Meath which the Land Commission considers suitable for division and which they think they might be able to acquire.</P>
    <P>Another problem confronting a good many tenants is that of water supplies. The Land Commission sometimes provides a pump in the farmyard of one or other of the holdings which have been distributed but when neighbours differ, they find it difficult to go into the other fellow's yard for domestic water supplies.  I think it would be much better if the Land Commission could arrange with the county council for the sinking of a pump on the public road to which all parties would have access.  There is the other case where the well or the pump sunk might not afford a very liberal supply of water and naturally the allottee on whose land it was sunk would be the first to obtain his supplies in the morning. Then when others come along they may find that they can get no water.  These are matters that call for the urgent attention by the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFlynn" hpid="Mr. J. Flynn Mr. J. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief in speaking on this Estimate.  When I came here last year I tabled a question in regard to a holding in Ballin-skellings in Kerry.  A migration scheme had been put into operation in that district at one period and the people <Col N="2625" /> were transferred to the Midlands.  The holding in question was to be apportioned amongst uneconomic holders in that area, but for seven years no action had been taken up to the day that I tabled my question.  The Minister in reply on the last occasion said that the matter would be considered immediately, but up to January of this year no action had been taken.  If the same attitude is adopted by this Government as in the past, it will be another seven years before that little holding is apportioned amongst the four or five uneconomic holders concerned. There could be no question in that case of emergency conditions preventing the Land Commission from taking the necessary action.  If any question were involved of building houses, that might have been some justification for delay but this was simply a question of apportioning a holding already acquired and allocating it to genuine uneconomic holders in that particular area.  I could never understand why a big organisation such as the Land Commission take years to handle a simple problem of that kind. If they fail in simple matters of that kind, what can we expect of them in regard to big problems where the acquisition and division of thousands of acres are concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter which I wish to bring before the Minister.  I do not know whether anything can be done about it but I have been requested time after time to mention it.  People who have land transferred to them and who apply to the Land Commission to have their names registered as owners &mdash;it may be a case of a transfer from a father to a son&mdash;are informed by the Land Commission that they must employ a solicitor.  I suggest that there should be some machinery set up in the Land Commission to deal with that type of case and so save considerable expense to those people who, perhaps, acquired the holdings through a will and wish to have the rental number or Receivable Order transferred to their name.  They are advised to consult a solicitor but a solicitor may charge an exorbitant sum for that work.  I am suggesting to the Minister that he should set up some machinery similar to that set up by the Revenue Commissioners <Col N="2626" /> in regard to administration. In that case a customs officer can, I understand, assist the widow of a deceased person to register in her name the holding formerly registered in her husband's name.  Why is there not some machinery in the Land Commission to avoid expense and accommodate small-holders and large holders? That is not an unreasonable request. There are cases where people are paying rent even in their grandfather's name and there should be some way out of it.  It is easy for the Land Commission to tell them to consult a solicitor, but what about the poor man who cannot pay a solicitor, who might charge him £20 for making out these transfer arrangements, which could be simplified.  Why did the Revenue Commissioners do something like that and accommodate the people in another direction?  I am not saying that is a correct analogy to quote, but at the same time there must be some very good reasons for it.</P>
    <P>In my county there is no land for division, but on occasion we have applications from small-holders, asking the Minister for Lands to acquire a farm that has been offered for sale in the locality.  I have made application to the Minister to acquire such farms and pay the market value, the maximum price that could be obtained by that person, so as to accommodate small-holders in the district.  I had one case last week, where four cottiers have labourers' cottage plots adjacent to a particular farm.  The farm is one of 40 acres, but 40 acres in some of those places is a big thing, where they have only two, three and seven acres.  In its own way, that would be a relief to these people.  They could accommodate four or five people in that immediate area and it would be less expensive to the Land Commission to accommodate them there than to transfer them up the country and try to acquire a fine holding and build houses for them.</P>
    <P>That is a business-like way of looking at it.  I am not suggesting that the Land Commission should interfere with the rights of any man who can obtain a good price for his farm.  The Minister has been asked in this Estimate by several other Deputies to see that <Col N="2627" /> the price of land is a reasonable one. I understand that, at the moment, the Land Commission is not legally able to pay the market value for land, and that is the point I make.  The Minister himself was confronted, when he visited Kerry on several occasions, by people applying for fishing rights.  I am putting this point now on the acquisition of land and of fisheries, and I submit I am entitled to raise it.  These fishery rights were reserved: I will give one case of it, as an example.  A man named Breen, in Glencar, County Kerry, was offered terms by the landlord in 1906 and he refused to purchase, simply because the landlord would not grant him the fishery rights adjacent to his holding.  That man agitated until 1923, when he was compelled to purchase and he paid the full rent for a small holding in a mountainous district. He paid £14 10s. od. per annum and he could have purchased and availed of the purchase annuity for £7 per annum.  He continued to struggle and fight for the fishery, which was valuable to him and to the people in the district.  He was compelled to purchase in 1923 and the fishery was handed over as a reserved function to the Land Commission.  They, in turn, sublet it to a man from outside the country, not living in Ireland at all. He, again, sublet it to a hotel for the purpose of the tourist trade.  I am making the case that it is mere justice to ask the Minister to set up machinery to hand back these fishery rights to these farmers, whose people fought for them and who are entitled to them. They are being trampled on by people who are not even citizens of this country.  That is a glaring case I have cited&mdash;that of Patrick Breen, of Glencar, who is fighting for what his father fought and lost.  We have a native Government here, but they have taken no steps in this matter&mdash;and all the Governments have been the same.  This is a cause of irritation.  Year after year, people roam over these lands. The tourists have obtained the fishing rights from the hotel people and come in and trespass and do everything they like and there is no redress.  There is constant friction and agitation about this matter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2628" /> I asked a question last year about this and the Minister said there was machinery to deal with it, but subsequently, in reply to another question, he said that they had no intention of revesting these fishing rights in these farmers.  I remember the time in Kerry when the present Minister was down there before the farmers' organisations, and was all out to give them every right they demanded.  I here, as their representative, demand that right, that the Minister set up machinery to give them back what has been taken from them.  I have every confidence that the present Government will assist us to do what we were unable to do in the past.  I hope that the Minister will reconsider this matter.  Not alone in that particular district, but all over the southern part of our county, this is a very important matter and the people are agitating for it and are insisting on it.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I hope the Minister will deal with any points I have made in regard to these matters.  Even though we are not vitally concerned with the division of land, we may have people who would apply for land.  I hear a good deal about the West of Ireland.  We sent men from Kerry to the Midlands and they are a credit to the place and when the time comes again I will approach the Minister to get people from my county to the Midlands. For the present, however, we will confine ourselves to finding a system to meet these difficulties with which we are confronted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFagan" hpid="Mr. Fagan Mr. Fagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fagan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the problem of migrants, my opinion is that the people in the area where land is being divided should be satisfied first. There is a great deal of dissatisfaction amongst people in Westmeath and Meath that they have been passed over when these small-holdings were being made available.  I know that it is a difficult problem to define what landless men should get land, because, if the Land Commission gives it to one man, it will be difficult to decide where to stop, but my view is that where a farm is being divided and where around that area are farms of a certain size, <Col N="2629" /> such as those I have in mind in my own county&mdash;farms of 30 to 35 acres&mdash;the sons of these farmers should get the land because they are people who were born, bred and reared beside the estate and they are the best types of people to whom to give land.  In the case of Athboy, the farms given to migrants there were too small, as anyone in the Midlands will agree.  Put a man and his family on a farm of less than 50 acres in the Midlands and you are putting them into dire poverty. The farms there were farms of 25 acres and the records of the Land Commission will show that these people have been clamouring for more land because they maintain that they cannot live on the farms given them.  I know that land and I know that they are migrating out of it.</P>

      <P>Any Deputy who does not believe what I say about farms of <Col N="2630" /> less than 50 acres can go down to Westmeath and see them, and I guarantee that he will agree with me that, where they have no pension from other sources, where they live solely by the land, they are in poverty.  If they try intensive cultivation, they find they cannot get a market for what they produce. I want to stress very strongly that the people in my county are not going to allow migrants into the county until the migrants in Westmeath are satisfied.  It may be said that there are no migrants in Westmeath.  Go up to Rathowen on the Westmeath borders, around Finea, and you will find migrants living there on three, four and five acres, men who were all passed over in the recent land division. These men should be satisfied first. and, after these, I say that the sons of small farmers living near these estates should be entitled to the land.  They are the type of men who know how to work land.  Some of the migrants coming up are quite all right, but they do not understand how to work a farm in Meath.  They are good men and I am not saying a word against them, but that is the position and it is one which should be considered.</P>
      <P>Deputy Rooney spoke about farms being taken away from people, but in the case of many of the people who got these farms, it is not their fault at all. Some herds who got farms had wages coming in every week, but, when they got the farms, they had not got the money to buy stock.  What is the use of giving a farm to a man with no money?  How is he to buy a cow and a few calves?  He will have to pay £40 for a cow and £9 or £10 for a sucking calf, and these are matters which must be considered.  There is no use in throwing a farm to a man who has no hope of making a living from it, unless he sets it.  If he does set portion of it and works the remainder, he should not be condemned for doing so.  If he sets part of it, if he sets an acre for meadow he is immediately pounced on by the Land Commission inspector, but I say that it is useless to give a farm to a man who has not got the wherewithal to work it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of Rathcarne, which was divided amongst migrants, I know of two herds&mdash;I worked that land for 15 <Col N="2631" /> years and know every inch of it&mdash;two of the greatest workers on a farm who got farms there and who are now being threatened with eviction.  These two men got married and they have not the wherewithal to run their farms since they lost their wages.  Give the land to men with the wherewithal to work it&mdash;it is no use giving £2,000 worth of land to people who cannot work it.  Let the migrants be put in a position to work a farm, if they are brought up.</P>

      <P>What security have they? <Col N="2632" /> The land is not vested and they cannot borrow a £5 note on it.  They go in there as paupers.  In the case of the two herds I speak of, they were lucky, when their wages stopped, to have a couple of cows apiece.  With the present price of stock, if you put a man on a farm with nothing to enable him to make a living on it, you are giving him no chance whatever.</P>
      <P>With regard to the type of farm to be divided, the Minister will need to be very careful.  I maintain that, no matter what size the farm is, if it is being properly worked and giving employment, it should not be touched. There is not such a lot of land to be divided at present as people think. There are a certain number of farms owned by people in Dublin, whom I could name, people with farms of 100 acres which they set every year.  There are other types of farms bought up during the war by men who now have five, six and seven farms, as an investment. That matter should be carefully gone into and farming that is an asset to the country should not be done away with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If anyone goes into a parish where there is a number of divided farms, he will find that the labouring man, the man who is depending on a day's work, is the poorest man in the parish.  Where there are four or five big farms in a parish there will be prosperity because a certain number of men will get their wages every Saturday night.  In a parish comprised of divided, small farms no farm will employ a man and there is nothing but poverty.  You will see these small farmers and their sons on a Sunday standing at the toss-pitch and they will not have a penny to wager heads or harps while the man who is employed cutting turf can throw out 10/- or £1.  These small farmers have not a penny in their pockets.  They have not a penny for the priest on a Sunday.  There are, of course, a certain number of farms owned by big business communities, the owners of which live in Dublin or somewhere else and the farms are set every year and are not worked properly.  These should be divided immediately.  If a man has a certain number of farms and is not living in the county, and if he has <Col N="2633" /> another means of living, the farm should be divided into fair-sized holdings.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies have referred to the question of farms being put up for sale and have suggested that the Land Commission should divide them.  I have always advocated that that is a very dangerous policy.  If the Land Commission took over a farm that was up for sale, immediately the value of land would go down.  That may seem a peculiar statement.  If a person puts up a farm for sale, an agitation will immediately commence, and the owner has no hope of selling it.  The Land Commission may give a fair market value but, if that goes on for a while, little by little, as time goes on, the market value will go down.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Brennan said something about abolishing the Land Commission. He appeared to be dissatisfied with the slow progress of the Land Commission. I suggest that there is a big housing problem in the city of Dublin and yet there are people in the city of Dublin who have chains of houses. The argument that could be applied to people who have large farms in the country could be equally applied to people who have chains of houses in Dublin.  Why should people be allowed to buy up houses and take them from people who want houses?</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to take into account the size of farms and the type of people who get them.  In the case of people that they put out of farms I suggest that their history should be considered and some consideration given to the difficulties they had to contend with.  Some of them never had a chance to keep their farms.  In some cases it may be partly their own fault. There may be some wasters but I know some who are not wasters, who try their best and who set parts of it.  For the last two years they were not allowed to set a perch.  The position is that the land is going derelict because things are so dear.  The Minister should look into that and give these people a chance and some financial aid to tide them over and he should get after the farms the owners of which are not living in the county and divide them first.  He should not divide any farm that is being properly worked.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2634" /> I was glad to hear the Minister saying that he would go into the matter of price.  If a man has a big farm, it is his property and he must be fairly compensated if it is taken over.  I am sure the Minister will see that he will get a fair price.</P>

      <P>I do not want to prolong the agony but there are a few matters that I want to refer to before the Minister concludes.  It must be evident to him now that this problem is more troublesome than he thought it was in the halcyon days when he was in opposition.  This debate should be an indication to him that the problems in no two districts or in no two counties are the same as regards the work the Land Commission has to do.  I want to ask the Minister have any changes been made by the Land Commission in the regulations that were in force for the distribution of lands when he became Minister?  My colleague, the former Minister, Deputy Seán Moylan, referred to a case on which I tackled the Minister by way of question and on the Adjournment some months ago.  It may be regarded by the Minister as a very small matter. It is, I suppose, in a way, but it is an indication of a trend.  I want to know what justification there was for the Land Commission doing the thing they did in the Drummond case in County Limerick.  Have the regulations been changed and has the whole basis of the distribution of land altered in such a way that a man with well over 100 statute acres already that were not being worked as the Land Commission would expect them to be worked should get additional land?  That was an outrageous business and when I tackled the Minister on it and raised it on the Adjournment he did not face the issue honestly or straightly and give me the information I asked for.  I invite him now, if he thinks there was anything unsavoury or anything improper in the transfer referred to and in connection with which he invited me to put down a motion, to deal with it in his reply to this debate.  It may be taking the Minister short.  I admit that.  I did not get a chance of getting in earlier this week or last week.  I invite him to deal with that aspect of the situation. <Col N="2635" /> He should deal fairly and squarely with the question I put down to him on the Adjournment and not dodge the issue as he did dodge it when I raised the question.</P>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister a question in regard to gangers on the Land Commission staff who became unemployed, in County Limerick at any rate, about the end of 1948 or the beginning of this year.  What is going to happen with regard to these?  Have they been taken back into the employment of the Land Commission?  I can recall the case of a ganger who started in the employment of the Land Commission in 1928 and who had never been unemployed since until the beginning of this year, or so I understood.  That was the case which was made to me and I understand that when these gangers were laid off, they left work they were engaged in actually unfinished in the various localities.  It is very hard to understand how that could be the case, if it happened, and it was reported to me that it did happen.</P>

      <P>I do not know. That is what the Minister should answer.  That is the question I am putthing to the Minister, not a question he is putting to me.  I should like in any case that these men who are depending on that type of employment, gangers and other people, should definitely know where they stand, if employment is to be made available for them again and if the development work on which they were engaged will be restarted. I know that in the past these men were periodically let go for a short period, but this is, I think, the longest period during which these gangers and others concerned were left unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter to which I should like to refer to before I conclude. As far as I can judge from replies I got to questions, there does not seem to be any big drive in County Limerick with regard to land division during the past 12 months, but I got a reply from the Minister that the Smyth Estate at Craggs was to be divided.  I know the place very well and there are 400 acres in it altogether but there are <Col N="2636" /> only 100 acres of good sound land.  The rest, as its name indicates, is crags, rocks and briars and I suggest that before that place is divided some effort at reclamation and improvement should be made on the land itself.  I suggest that this scheme which has been talked about by the Minister for Agriculture should be put into operation there because the land as it stands at present on that estate will be useless to anyone who gets it.  I believe that the land itself is sound, but it is useless to expect that any allottee who would be selected to get it would be in a position to do the reclamation work that would have to be done on most of that place himself.  The cost entailed could be put on the annuity afterwards to extend over a long period of years and it could be part of this land reclamation scheme sponsored by the Minister for Agriculture. It is no good to give land like that to an allottee who can do nothing with it although there is a big demand in the locality for the division of it.  That is only a suggestion and I invite the Minister to mention what is the position regarding the unemployed gangers and the other matter I raised before in an adjournment debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKinane" hpid="Mr. Kinane Mr. Kinane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kinane</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few points which I should like to raise with regard to the acquisition and distribution of land.  In my opinion, there is greater need to-day for the speeding up of land division than there was when the 1923 Act was passed.  For some time after the passage of that Act land division was speeded up until around 1929 or 1930.  It slowed down then for some time until about 1934, when the tempo increased again, but since 1937 nothing seems to have been done and the whole problem is being shelved.  During the emergency years advantage of that position was taken by aliens to come into this country and buy large tracts of land at fabulous prices, prices far beyond the reach of our own nationals. I think that the Land Commission should now acquire these holdings and have them divided amoung the congests or the landless people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While a small percentage of I.R.A. men were considered and catered for in the past, nothing like the number were considered that should have been <Col N="2637" /> considered.  Many men who were reared on the land with a farming tradition behind them and who had given valuable service to the country were not given the opportunity of having holdings.  They did not possess enough money to buy land but had sufficient to stock land and work it and they had the knowledge.  It has been said&mdash;unjustly, too, for some sinister purpose&mdash;that I.R.A. men to whom land was given did not make a success of it, but according to the Land Commission records it will be seen that at least 90 per cent. of those cases were a success, and I could say that in County Tipperary at least 99 per cent. of them were a success on the land.  There were hardly any failures where I.R.A. men were given land.  In view of the sacrifice those men made in the past, I think that it is very unfair that such men who understand land and who are in a position to work it should be denied an opportunity of acquiring it.</P>
    <P>While I have great sympathy with the Minister and other Deputies in their anxiety to relieve congestion in the West&mdash;and I dare say that the West is the hardest part of Ireland to deal with&mdash;I must refer the Minister to my own county, Tipperary, where 50 per cent. of the agricultural holdings are uneconomic, ranging, in poor law valuation, from £2 to £20.  It is a fact that 50 per cent. of the holdings in County Tipperary are uneconomic, according to the statistics, anyway.  During the reign of previous Governments holdings were dished out of 15, 20 or 22 acres and that left people in an uneconomic position still.  Many had to rent land in conacre for tillage and meadowing and in some cases people had almost to abandon their places altogether because they could not live on that small acreage.  To my mind, at least 35 or 40 acres of good land should be given in any holding if people are to live in fairly comfortable circumstances.</P>
    <P>Such people are, in my opinion, the best asset of the nation.  Medium-sized holders who carry out mixed farming are the most profitable asset of the nation to-day.  There has been too much talk about the mighty bullock and the large ranchers.  That tends to <Col N="2638" /> increase the size of holdings and the importance of the bullock on those holdings tends towards unemployment and decay of population.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of land division of which the Department should take active notice, and to which Deputy J. Flynn has referred, is the farm which is not properly worked, which is in most cases non-residential, which is let on the 11 months' system and which happens to be situated in a congested area.  If such a holding were acquired by the Land Commission it would help to relieve congestion in the area.  If, on the other hand, that type of holding is put on the market it will very likely be purchased by some large landholder and that should be prevented. I do not think the Land Commission has power to intervene in that respect so far, but I think the Minister should be given the power to take over such land.  I know some cases in which that has happened in the past and I am afraid that the same may happen in the near future in my constituency. It may be the only chance the small-holders will ever get of acquiring a bit of land to make their holdings economic. The Minister should be given power to remedy a lot of the defects in the Land Commission machine.  I do not blame him or any previous Land Commission Minister for not having completed the task up to now because I feel they were attempting to work a machine which was designed to move very slowly.  Some Deputies were in favour of scrapping this machine altogether, and I might be in favour of it too, but I think that if the Minister were given certain powers something useful could be done.  I hope that if a time limit is not set to have land division completed in this country the Minister will do all he possibly can to have that job done within the next ten years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilbride" hpid="Mr. Gilbride Mr. Gilbride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilbride</NameTxt>
      <P>Such a strain of goodwill towards the idea of land division and helping the small farmers in the West of Ireland has come from all sides of this House that it is very hard for a new Deputy such as myself to understand why all the land had not been divided years ago.  I do not intend to dwell on whether the Land Commission <Col N="2639" /> has done its work well or otherwise. I shall confine myself to bringing to the notice of the Minister a few of the grievances that exist in the West of Ireland and to suggest a remedy for them.  I have heard different expressions of opinion on how to cure congestion in the West.  One Deputy suggests migration.  Migration is not a cure because, as far as I can see, there is very little welcome in the Midlands for the migrants although they are only going back to the land their forefathers were driven off and although they are the men who stood behind Michael Davitt when he started the Land League which was responsible for leaving all the farmers all over Ireland in their holdings to-day.</P>
      <P>I say again that I do not see much welcome for these migrants on the part of the people in the Midlands or wherever land is available.  I agree with Deputy Kinnane that, in certain areas, any farm of from 30 or 40 acres upwards should not be allowed to be sold but should be taken over by the Land Commission with a view to the relief of congestion.  I have discussed that point with officials of the Land Commission.  Their argument was that if the Land Commission interfered they might possibly stop some other farmer's son from investing his money in that land.  I think it would be a lesser hardship on that man to go to another place where land is more plentiful than to root out the small-holders who have been in the area for generations.</P>
      <P>The question of price was raised.  It will be said that it would not be possible to fix a fair price; that it would be stopping competition, and that the man who had the land to sell would be robbed.  I think there would be no difficulty about that.  The value of land varies according to the locality. A price could be arrived at by referring to the sales of land of that kind over some years before that.  It would then be very easy to fix a fair price for land in any locality.  That would go a long way towards solving the difficulties of the small farmers in the West.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the last week I have received four or five complaints that Land Commission <Col N="2640" /> officials are going around to small farms of from five to ten acres and examining them for the purpose of acquiring them.  These are annuity farms that are vested.  I have one case in mind of a young man who was left a farm of ten acres by his grandfather. Owing to economic conditions and unemployment he was compelled to go to England, and in his absence his father worked the farm.  Land Commission officials have visited the farm in the course of the last month and have given the impression that it is going to be acquired.  I should like the Minister to make a statement to the effect that that policy will not be pursued.  I think it is unfair, if a man is compelled for economic reasons to go to England and when he intends to come back and make a living on the farm, that an official should, in his absence, examine the farm and give the impression that it is going to be acquired.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rooney raised a point about taking back land from men who were not working it.  A lot can be said in regard to that matter but I contend that every farmer is in the same position as the man who got allotments of land.  All the land of this country was bought by public money.  I do not think it is fair that there should be one set of laws for the men who got farms and another set of laws for the man who did not.</P>
    <P>There are a number of sluice-gates in my area under the control of the Land Commission.  Since these have been built the land on the inside has gone down a lot.  I have approached different Government Departments about the matter but no Department seems to want to take responsibility for them.  The Land Commission are paying caretakers to look after them. These sluices now require to be attended to because in some cases a lake is forming inside.  Somebody should take responsibility for them soon because they are getting into a very bad state of repair.  In conclusion I should like to say that Deputy O'Reilly and Deputy Dr. Brennan hit the same note&mdash;that there is no use in dividing land in this country if the policy of this country is to go back to ranching.</P>

      <P>This debate on land is taking a nice, leisurely course, and I suppose that is as it should be in discussing the work of the Land Commission. Last year I made the suggestion that the Land Commission might be removed down to the Bog of Allen and an atom bomb dropped on it.  On reflection, however, I think that was too drastic.  The Land Commission is a very big organisation and nowadays when we are having those big national parades I think it would be a great thing if we could get the Minister to lead the Land Commission through the streets of Dublin as part of the national celebration.  It is a big body controlled by an enormous number of statutes.  The Minister gave us a list of them when moving his Estimate. They go right back to the late lamented Victoria whose statue has disappeared from the front of this building during the past 12 months.  If we could remove the statue in the reasonably expeditious way in which we did for the purpose of providing extra car parking accomodation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>If we could do that, then I suggest that we might start to deal with the statutes of Queen Victoria.  If we could deal with these statutes, probably we would discover that the Land Commission is not the inefficient instrument that so many Deputies consider it is.  After all, a very large body of men governed by those statutes and following the precedents created in leisurely Victorian times cannot possibly face up to the situation that confronts us to-day.  The situation that confronts us is that we have approximately 1,000,000 acres available for distribution.  That is the figure that is generally accepted.  I cannot say whether it is right or wrong but it is generally accepted that there are between 500,000 and 1,000,000 acres available for division.  If we were to proceed at the rate of progress that we have had during the last year, it would take probably 100 years or more to distribute that 1,000,000 acres.  We cannot <Col N="2642" /> afford to wait that length of time.  In the first place, the Dáil as at present constituted would have ceased to exist. Many of the families and even the grandchildren of those families who are clamouring for land would have ceased. to exist.  What can we do?  The Leader of the Opposition suggested that our plan should be 100,000 acres a year.  I agree that that is not unreasonable.  As things are at the moment, while the Land Commission is controlled by these clogging statutes, from 44 and 45 Victoria right down to No. 12 of 1946, it is impossible for the 100,000 acres a year to be realised.</P>
      <P>I understand that they have a method in another country where, if the responsibility is placed on a Minister to divide, say, 100,000 acres of land in the year and he does not do it, he is summarily disposed of.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a lot to be said for that method.  The Minister would have to say to himself at the beginning of the year: &ldquo;It is thumbs down with me if I do not distribute 100,000 acres this year.&rdquo;  That would be much better than all the talk we have had in this long debate and the discussions that took place all over the country in regard to this matter.  If it is the general wish of this House that 100,000 acres of land should be divided in a year, then it is the Minister's job to divide that 100,000 acres and, if he finds that the statutory authority which he has does not permit him to do that, then it would be reasonable for him to come to this House and say &ldquo;You want me to divide 100,000 acres. I will do it as soon as you give me this particular machinery and, if you give me this machinery, I guarantee that the officials I have, who are able and experienced, will do the job.&rdquo;  We must face up to it and the Minister must face up to it that it is easy to blame the officials for not doing the job of work But the blame must be accepted by the political head, the Minister, and it must be accepted by this House, if this House will not provide for the Minister the authority that he needs to do the job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been some discussion in <Col N="2643" /> regard to the persons to whom land, when divided, will be given.  I can understand the points of view expressed by Deputies who are in very close touch with the problem.  If we examine the amount of land divided, say, in the last 25 years by the Land Commission and if we find that out of that division only 1,500 persons have been found who are not doing their work well, I suppose the job has not been done badly. I think that is accepted.  But political considerations have entered into this question of land division.  Although I am a person who would fight for the rights of the Old I.R.A. to get land, I do not think anyone can suggest that, because a man is a member of the Old I.R.A., he should, by virtue of that fact alone, get land.  Quite a number of people who were very fine soldiers in the I.R.A. never had any experience of land, and probably never wanted to get it.</P>
    <P>I made the suggestion before, and I repeat it, that I think on this question of the suitability of applicants for divided land, the Minister ought to be assisted by parish councils of working farmers which would have the responsibility of saying that A, B, C and D in their parish had good experience in the working of land, and that if they got a farm, could be depended on to do their best to make a success of it.  In Denmark they have a system whereby land is not sold on the open market, as it is here.  Instead, if land becomes available for sale, it is given to the best agricultural labourer in the parish who is selected by the farmers of the parish.  Not only does he get the farm but he gets it completely stocked and with a statutory amount of capital to enable him to work it.  I do not say that system would work here, just at the moment.  It is quite possible, however, that it will be able to work here.</P>

      <P>That is part of the plan.  Some Deputies have spoken about a minimum acreage for a farm. I agree with them on that, but I suggest that, in addition, there ought to be a maximum acreage beyond which no individual should be permitted to hold land.  If we had that statutory limitation placed on the ownership of land, the difficulties confronting the Minister and the Government would not be as serious as they are.  We know that, in the last ten years or so, individuals have started to create new ranches by buying 100 acres of land here, 200 acres there, 300 acres in another place and 400 acres elsewhere, apparently without restriction.  As far as I see, if you had enough money you could buy up all the land you wanted in the country.  That is a serious national and social problem.  If we have tackled landlordism and the big ranches in the past, we should be prepared for a new fight on that same front in the future.  The only way of avoiding it is by having a statutory limitation on the amount of land that an individual can own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that in the County Meath, to which migrants have been brought from Donegal, from the West and from Kerry&mdash;my view in regard to them is that they have made good, that they are successful farmers and are very hard workers&mdash;there is undoubtedly the difficulty in their case that the amount of land they got was insufficient.  If they had been given a few more acres it would have made all the difference in the world to them. However, that was an experiment, and the lessons in regard to it have been learned.  I would say that on the whole it has been a successful experiment. One of those men&mdash;he was brought from Mayo&mdash;came to see me.  He worked his land well.  His sons worked around the district, some of them going to England to work during the war.  As a result of his thrift and hard work, that man was in a position to offer to buy a farm of 200 acres adjoining his holding.  His plan was to buy it and divide it into 50-acre holdings between his four sons, and to build a house on each holding.  He was getting the 200 acres at a very reasonable price, in my <Col N="2645" /> view.  The Department of Lands, however, refused to allow him to buy it, saying that they wanted to take it themselves.  If he had been allowed to purchase it he would have done so long ago.  It would long since have been divided, and each of his sons would now have a holding of 50 acres.  But, in consequence of the refusal of the Department that 200-acres farm is still there, and will probably be in the same position that it is in to-day if I am speaking on this Estimate five years hence.  Where that man's sons will be then, I do not know.  There should be a certain amount of common-sense about all this.  That man would have been doing very valuable work and should have been encouraged.</P>
    <P>I mention that case to show that this system of migrants in County Meath has, in general, been a success.  In regard to the migration of large numbers of people to extensive areas of land in Meath, Westmeath or elsewhere, what I think ought to be done is this: we have tried out the old system of putting the man's house on his own farm.  We do not provide him with a water supply, and we leave him to live there in isolation.  I suggest to the Minister that he should try a new plan in the division of land, namely, that of placing these people as a community in a village with all modern amenities&mdash;their own church, their own hall, electric light, sanitary accommodation and running water.  I think the Minister should try that.  The world is trying to get away from the idea of people living in isolation.  Where a community was brought together like that they could have their own medical service, their dispensary doctor, a midwife, teachers, and a school.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister might try to experiment in one or two places and see how it works out.  I believe that, whether we like it or not, we will eventually develop into that condition, with the people living in small communities right through the country instead of in isolation, with a house here, a house there, and a house somewhere else.  The Minister might give a lead in that way.</P>
    <P>I would like to conclude on this note. <Col N="2646" /> During the past year I have had to introduce deputations to the Minister in regard to the division of land.  I have always found the Minister most courteous and considerate.  When deputations arrived here without proper arrangements being made in advance for their reception, he did not disappoint them.  He saw them, he listened to their pleas, he took particulars and put the matter that they raised under way.  I am satisfied that the Minister is genuinely concerned with this tremendous problem, and not only genuinely concerned but genuinely determined to do his part in solving it.</P>
    <P>We all sympathise with him in his difficulties.  I think the majority of Deputies in this House appreciate those difficulties.  As I said at the beginning, if there are statutory obstacles in the way of the Minister doing his job, then the job cannot be done satisfactorily until these statutory obstacles are removed, and whatever statutory authority the Minister requires to do his job it will be given to him by the House.  I ask him to present us with a Bill.</P>

      <P>When I got the Book of Estimates one of the first things I looked for was what increase was given on this particular Estimate.  I was very disappointed to find that sufficient money has not been provided in the Estimate to hold out much hope for relief in the congested districts.  I hoped&mdash;and I expressed the same hope last year when speaking on the Lands Estimate&mdash;that since we got a Minister for Lands who comes from a congested area and who knows the difficulties and <Col N="2647" /> hardships of the people, when he was given the responsible position of Minister for Lands he would use his weight &mdash;which, of course, he has in ample proportions&mdash;with the Minister for Finance in order to procure the money which he suggested, when he was on this side of the House, should be given for this important work.</P>
      <P>I am sorry to observe that the Minister has failed to lead the congests into the promised land.  I expected when I opened the Book of Estimates that I would see much more money provided for this purpose.  I did not expect a miracle to happen, but I certainly did expect there would be more money than what has been provided.</P>
      <P>According to the Land Commission report published last year, from 1923 to 31st March, 1947, there were actually 916,039 acres divided.  According to the Minister, another 20,000 have to be added on, and that brings the total to date 936,039 acres.  According to the general view expressed here in the course of the debate, about the same amount of land is available for acquisition and division; we will have from 500,000 to 1,000,000 acres.  I worked out the average number of acres divided each year from 1923 to 1947 and I find it is 38,000 acres.  That being so, the 20,000 acres divided during the past year and the amount of land he intends to divide this year, 25,000 acres, would be far below the average annual figure in the 25 years or so since the Land Commission became active under a native Government.</P>
      <P>We are all aware of the reason&mdash;it has been expressed here on all sides&mdash;why the Land Commission was inactive during the emergency years, but now we expect that there will be a big step forward, particularly as the Minister comes from a congested area and is familiar with the difficulties there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On page 21 of the Land Commission report there is reference to the Gaeltacht counties.  Over a period of 25 years there was an average of 19,000 acres divided over the Gaeltacht counties-referred to in the report as Galway, Mayo, Donegal, Clare and Kerry. The target aimed at this year does not represent enough effort on the Minister's <Col N="2648" /> behalf or on behalf of the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>The Leader of our Party, speaking on this Estimate, gave what he thought should be divided each year.  He mentioned a 50-acre farm and, with 500,000 to 1,000,000 acres available, that would work out in this way.  If we take 500,000 acres we could settle 10,000 families and if we take 1,000,000 acres we could settle 20,000 families.  I would not put the area of the holding as high as 50 acres.  I come from a congested area and I think if we provided farms of 30 to 40 acres, there are many people who would be delighted to get one and I am sure the Minister knows that as well as I do.  If he continues to divide only 20,000 or 25,000 each year, and if he decides on holdings of 30 to 40 acres, then the division of whatever land remains will take as long as, and perhaps longer than, land division has taken up to the present.  I think a greater effort should be made and more money should be voted for such an important Department as this.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his opening statement said that in the 25 years of activity of the Land Commission there have been approximately 1,500 unsatisfactory allottees.  These were people who were not using their lands according to proper methods of husbandry. In view of the somewhat contradictory policy of the present Administration it is, in my opinion, rather difficult to decide what are proper methods of husbandry. I have here before me statements made by two members of the present Government.  The first is a statement made by Deputy Donnellan at Loughrea when he was addressing the executive of Clann na Talmhan. This statement appeared in the <i>Connacht Tribune</i> of 12th February, 1949:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Any man who farms his land to the advantage of himself, his family and the State will never be interfered with.  But any person using land as a racket or who got it under false pretences from the Land Commission will have to give it up.  We will compensate him and use the land to greater advantage.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the <i>Irish Press</i> on 11th February, 1949, the following statement appears: <Col N="2649" /> the heading is &ldquo;Grass the most valuable crop&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;No farmer could do justice to his land unless he ploughed it and grew in their proper rotation the crops for which his land is best suited including the most valuable crop that can be grown in Ireland&mdash;grass.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a statement made by the Minister for Agriculture.  Which of the two are we to believe?  Is the Government going to subsidise the farmers to grow grass in order to rear bullocks to feed John Bull?  Is the Government going to give the farmers manure and lime and drain their lands with the money we are getting in Marshall Aid&mdash;which is only a loan and will have to be repaid by the tax-payers?  Is that going to be done in order to grow grass?  If that is the proper method of husbandry, then I think it is very wrong indeed.</P>
    <P>At this stage of our existence the Land Commission should be in a position to say whether it is possible and to what extent they can reduce the number of large farms for the relief of congestion.  Looking through the report published by the Electricity Supply Board, at the request of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, on rural electrification I found some rather interesting statistics.  At page 44 of that report there is a tabular statement which gives the size of farms according to counties.  With regard to farms of 200 acres and over, In County Kildare the percentage is 41; in County Meath it is also 41 per cent.; in Dublin 29 per cent.; in Wicklow 28 per cent. ; in Westmeath 18 per cent. ; in Offaly 15 per cent.; and in Louth 23 per cent.  In the remaining counties the number of farms of 200 acres and over is an interesting one. In Mayo we have 7 per cent. of farms of 200 acres and over.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely giving the statistics from the report.  In Monaghan <Col N="2650" /> we have 4 per cent.; in Leitrim 2 per cent.; in Sligo 8 per cent.; Cavan 4 per cent.; Roscommon 10 per cent.; Donegal 8 per cent.; Longford 8 per cent.; and Galway&mdash;the county that I represent&mdash;12 per cent.  I think that the Land Commission ought to be in a position to decide now how far these large farms of 200 acres and upwards could be reduced in order to relieve congestion.  I made a suggestion last year that farmers with 200 acres and over should be compelled to employ labour in proportion to the acreage they hold; for instance, a farmer with 200 acres should be obliged to employ a whole-time labourer for every 20 acres.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Arable land.  I made a suggestion also that that farmer should give four or five acres to each of those labourers and that there should be a cottage built upon that small-holding to house these men.  In that way considerable employment could be given to a much bigger number of people than at present.  These employees would settle down and get married. They would be paid the proper rate of wages by the owner of the farm.  That would have the effect, too, of compelling the large farmers to start subsidiary industries, such as tomato growing, poultry rearing and so on.  With the advantage of rural electrification more rural industries could be established and they, in turn, would stem the tide of emigration and the flight from the land.</P>
      <P>I am glad that the Minister is bringing in a new land Bill.  I hope he will consider these suggestions that I have thrown out when that Bill is in course of preparation and incorporate some of them in the measure he proposes to introduce.  In the meantime, I think the Land Commission should not permit any farm to be sold so long as that farm can be acquired for the relief of congestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a great many undeveloped bogs in my constituency.  I asked the Land Commission to take over the bogs and divide them so as to give turbary to the people of the constituency.  Some of the bogs had been developed by the <Col N="2651" /> county council during the emergency but they were not fully finished.  The roads could still be improved and properly drained and there are still large tracts of turbary in that constituency which are undivided.  There are some estates, too, which I should like to have cleared up.  I had questions down recently about two of these and I should like to know if proceedings are being instituted.  I do not mean estates where a person goes away for a few years and intends to come back.  Some of the owners have been away for years and years and have nearly passed out of existence.  These farms should be taken over by the Department.</P>
    <P>With regard to the provision of pumps and wells, I think the Land Commission should be responsible for the upkeep and maintenance of these. Another aspect I should like to refer to is that there should be more consideration of the laying of roads when an estate is going to be divided.  There should be more co-operation between the Land Commission, the Department of Local Government and the Board of Works.  Each Department seems to work independently of one another.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">

      <P>That is what I should like to see happen, because I can instance a road in Fohenagh, in my constituency, where an estate was divided.  A road was made into one end of the estate and another road into the other end but they did not join up, and there is now one field separating the two ends of that road.</P>

      <P>Just before the war.  I cannot give the exact date.  The tenant who has land in the middle of the estate was and is willing to have a road made through his land which would link up and be a short cut from Fohenagh, Ahascragh, to the village of <Col N="2652" /> Kilconnell.  Representations have been made to the Board of Works by the local authority and to the Land Commission by the parish priest and the tenants.  Nothing has yet been done. I could give other instances like that. There should be more co-operation between these Departments so that such a condition would not be left there causing big hardship amongst the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all I should like to express my regret that the Minister has not yet divided up the Trabolgan estate, Aghada.  It is several months ago now since the inspectors were down there obtaining all the particulars. Something should have been done by now also with regard to the taking over of the Finnure estate and the Foley Turpin estate in my constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some time ago I was with a deputation consisting of some of the Water-ford Deputies and Deputies from my own constituency in connection with the fishery rights in the Blackwater. Those people's holdings are now being vested in them.  The land on the opposite side of the river was purchased under the Ashbourne Act and the tenant now owns the fishing rights in that half of the river.  One of the maiden efforts of this House was to put through an Act in 1923 known as the Land Act, under which, whether a tenant liked it or not, he was compelled to purchase.  There are instances of a tenant with 40 acres of land, five and, in fact, seven and eight acres of which consists of the bank of the river and half the river.  The landlord has a right to come in, march along that bank and fish that part of the river for which those tenants are compelled to pay land annuities to the Land Commission.  Either that land has been purchased by the Land Commission or it has not.  If it has been purchased and that tenant is repaying the principal and interest on that five acres, that five acres is his and he is entitled to have the fishing rights vested in him.  If he is not entitled to the fishing rights he should not be paying land annuities for the bank of that river and half the river.  We put the case to the Minister and pointed out that those estates are now being <Col N="2653" /> vested.  After being compelled to purchase are the tenants going to be compelled to pay for land in which any value is being used by another.  When the floods come they suffer a loss in the crops that are taken by the flooding of that river but apparently they are not going to derive any benefit from the fishing rights of it.  The land has been purchased by them.  If they are paying land annuities to the Land Commission they are entitled to stop trespassing even by an ex-landlord.</P>
    <P>That is the position I am putting to the Minister.  I am appealing to him to vest those fishing rights in the tenants who are paying for the land and the river bed.  I do not think I am asking anything unjust or unfair in that.  If that is not done, those tenants in my opinion should have that land measured and refuse to pay the annuity on it.  I cannot see any sense in having one body of tenants, who purchased voluntarily and made voluntary agreements with their landlords, owning one half of the river and having the other half held away from their neighbours across the river.  I think it is nonsensical and it is a matter to which I should like the Minister to give his attention.  I would suggest that whatever weight it is necessary for him to use on the officials concerned he should use it and that he should also use whatever compulsion is necessary. I know the Minister, as a farmer, realises the rights of those tenants and realises that it is unjust and unfair to ask a man to pay an annuity for what is not his or what another has the right to use.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very serious point for the people affected, forcibly vested as they were compulsorily purchased.  In regard to the Gaskell estate about which I had a question down recently, I would urge that the <Col N="2654" /> Minister should take immediate steps to see that the landlord is held responsible by the Land Commission for the damage done to land which is mortgaged&mdash;I can describe it in no other way&mdash;to the Land Commission for a definite amount which has to be repaid in land annuities.  This landlord is holding a certain acreage of the estate for shooting purposes&mdash;for the shooting of duck.  He lets that shooting every year.  There is a river running through this estate and on the land which the landlord has reserved for himself there is a sluice.  He let the sluice go into disrepair with the result that year by year that land is deteriorating and going back into rushes and marsh.</P>
      <P>Four or five years ago that gentleman came and doubled the rent on the boys to whom he let that duck shooting, on account of the increased area under duck, while the unfortunate-tenant has to repay the Land Commission the land annuity on that land.  I think that is a condition of affairs that should not be allowed to continue.  I would appeal to the Minister to take steps to bring that to an end immediately.</P>
      <P>On the question of the deterioration of land, I also directed the Minister's attention to the position in regard to the Yellow Ford at Ballymacoda, at the mouth of the Womanagh.  This river was cleared, I understand, by the Board of Works as a drainage area some years ago but they left the mouth of it out as being a bit too deep for the boys to get into.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot help the interruptions. It is not my fault.  I put down a question to the Minister in connection with this matter some time ago to ascertain what steps the Land Commission intend to take to prevent deterioration <Col N="2655" /> of this land.  It is a matter that I am anxious that the Minister should deal with&mdash;I do not mean by dealing with it here in a few kind words but to deal with it by getting the embankments put up and in protecting that land from being ruined. After all, the Land Commission have more responsibility than the job of collecting the annuities.  They have got to see that that property is not reduced to the position where the tenants will not be able to pay the annuities.  I had some striking instances of that in my own locality a few years ago.  I called the attention of the Land Commission to a breach at Little Island and I was told it was not their responsibility.  It would then have cost about £600 to rebuild the breach.  Afterwards, when over 100 acres had been left under the tide for nearly 18 months, they came down and spent nearly £3,000 on it. That is not the way I want to see public money expended.  I consider that when the Minister's attention is called to a danger of that description there should be no delay and that the Land Commission should go and do the work if for no other reason than that they should preserve property that is mortgaged to them.  I do not wish to delay the House further at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesKilroy" hpid="Mr. Kilroy Mr. Kilroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kilroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall make a very brief contribution to the debate.  Last year I appealed to the Minister to secure the redress of certain grievances in my area&mdash;and there are quite a few&mdash;but nothing has since been done in regard to them.  I would remind the Minister particularly of the miserable conditions which exist on the Carter and Bingham estates in Erris.  There is a considerable amount of congestion in that area and the rearrangement of the holdings is very much needed.  I know one part of the Carter estate where the holdings have been mapped out for the past two years and the consents of the tenants to the rearrangement of these holdings obtained but nothing has since been done.  It is past the time when this work should have been completed.  I know there is disagreement in a few cases, on account of the rundale system and it is very hard for them to keep quiet.  I think there will be lawsuits <Col N="2656" /> very soon, unless the Land Commission comes in and makes fences between these people.  The rearrangement that these people consent to should be carried out.  It is not a very big job and the Minister should see that it is done. Another estate that needs to be done is the Stanuell estate at Shramore, near Newport.  The Minister has intimate knowledge of it himself.  Maps of the area have been made to have it stripped and fenced, and though the stripping was done two years ago nothing has been done about the fencing.  The same applies to the Dickens estate in Achill, where the conditions are very bad and it is time something was done.  That is also the case regarding other estates in Erris and North Mayo.  The Minister should speed up things in that area.  There are parts of Erris where very little can be done unless people are migrated to some other area.  In those places I have spoken about, I do not think there will be overmuch migration.  I ask that arrangements be made immediately about those estates.</P>
      <P>Regarding migration of some tenants, a good many must be taken out of the area before there will be a chance of livelihood for those who are left.  I brought this up on the last occasion of the Vote here and did not make a long speech.  I am making the same appeal now, but I am afraid that, unless there is a change, I will have to appeal again in a year's time.  I hope not.  Migration of the tenants is the first thing and it would be a blessing if they were taken out of that area.</P>
      <P>There is any amount of turbary in North Mayo, but certain areas are very hard up for turbary and the Minister should do something about it. There are places from which I get complaints about turbary rights.  They should get any amount of bog for their own use, as there is plenty of it there if it were evenly distributed.  I know the Minister wishes to speak and conclude the debate and when he is doing so I hope he will agree with the points I have made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing I should do is to make an explanation or apology for my short opening speech. Unfortunately, I was a bit pressed for <Col N="2657" /> time and could not open with a full explanation, but I hope it is not too late to make amends now.  The debate covered a wide range and I appreciate the attitude taken by most Deputies. On the whole, it has been very helpful, though in some cases Deputies were a little critical, or bitter, perhaps.  Some of the criticism was uninformed and it is a pity the Deputies concerned would not inquire a little bit more into the working of a Department before they take it upon themselves to utter scathing criticism which may, or may not, be well founded and which they are not in a position to defend.  It is a pleasure and of great assistance to any Minister to get helpful criticism, but it is very tiresome to listen to criticism that sometimes is little better than vulgar abuse of the Minister or his officials or the Department in general.</P>
      <P>Many points have been raised and I feel very pleased with the tone of the debate all over the House.  It indicated clearly to me that the general desire now is to tackle a problem which should have been tackled many years ago, that is, to make the principal work of the Land Commission the relief of congestion.  I did not hear anyone from any side of the House condemning that.  I made it quite clear last year, and on a few occasions since last May, that I would like to see the Land Commission go ahead on those lines.  I have directed the policy to that end, that the principal work should be the relief of congestion, in the last 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Deputies have said the Land Commission was formed to relieve congestion and divide land.  That is not the case.  The main function of the Land Commission when it was formed was to make each landholder&mdash;big, middle or small&mdash;owner of his holding. That was the problem they took over. The relief of congestion, rundale, congested holdings, migration of tenants, and so on, was secondary to the big problem of making every tenant farmer in the Twenty-Six Counties the owner of his holding.  That work is proceeding very rapidly at present and I am anxious to see it completed as soon as possible.  It is a work that is little <Col N="2658" /> appreciated, because it is not known. The difficulties of vesting the land in the tenants is not known and, to be fair, it could not be known to Deputies unless they come to the Department and inquire.  Even then, a superficial glance can give no idea of the work the officials are doing.</P>
    <P>I might mention now, that 15,000 holdings or parcels were vested last year.  That in itself was a big task, leaving aside the work of the outdoor staff in inspecting farms for acquisition, preparing rearrangement schemes and dealing with rearrangement of tenants and rundale estates.  The work of revesting means giving a man ownership of his land, which ownership the Land Commission has held up to that moment.  When that tenant has been revested, every outline of his holding is clearly defined.  Every detail of every right of way, of fishing rights and so on, is clearly shown and that is sent to the Land Registry Office.  The inspector's outdoor staff must scrutinise these holdings and sometimes they are held up by objections.  A farmer may want some improvement done or think he has a certain right he wants cleared up.  He generally lodges an objection and that holds the work up. Several Deputies mentioned the fact that vesting was slow.  I intend to go very fully into that matter, because that side of the debate has brought home to me the whole history of the Land Commission since its inception, the work it has been doing since and some of the difficulties it has encountered.</P>
    <P>There were many points raised by Deputies and I propose to deal with these first.  If I did not make it clear last year, or if any Deputy is still in doubt&mdash;the work of the Land Commission is the relief of congestion.  That embodies a lot of things.  It means that the Land Commission has to acquire a sufficient amount of land and on that point a certain amount of doubt has been thrown on the acreage divided last year.  The relief of congestion and the division of land seem to go side by side, but they are, in reality, two different questions.  I see my predecessor in office here, and his Party&mdash;not at the time he was Minister&mdash;went <Col N="2659" /> in for land division on a pretty big scale, as opposed to the relief of congestion.  I repeat what I said last year, that I am sorry that more of that land, when it was available then, was not turned over for the relief of congestion, particularly for the bringing of migrants out of congested areas.</P>
    <P>There is no other way to relieve congestion in many cases, because, where congestion exists, very few large farms now exist.  You could count all the farms worth acquiring in any of the congested areas on the fingers of one hand and these farms, even if we got them, would relieve only a very small amount of congestion.  The nett result is that, if we are to relieve congestion on a big scale, we must bring out a pretty large number of the smaller type of migrants, so that enough land will be left to give middling-sized holdings to those who remain.  I am glad that the House&mdash;both Parties in the Government and in the Opposition&mdash;agrees that the relief of congestion should come first and from my experience both as a Minister for the 12 or 13 months I have been in the post and as one who comes from a congested county, I have not the slightest hesitation in saying that that is the best work being done by any Department of State, even though the particular Department of which I am in charge is the most maligned and abused Department of State.</P>
    <P>Everybody seems to have a blow at it in passing, both in the Dáil and outside it.  Nevertheless, the work the Land Commission is doing, is about to do and, I may say, is anxious to do, is work which is equally as good as the the work done by any other Department at present.</P>
    <P>I told the House last year that congestion and groups of small uneconomic holdings are an evil handed down to us &mdash;no Party or member in the Dáil is responsible for it.  It is something that belongs to the fairly distant past. Now that we have self-government, it is one evil that we cannot afford to overlook and neither I nor the Government has any desire to sidestep it or to evade our responsibilities in the matter.  If we did, we would be a very <Col N="2660" /> worthless lot and would not be worthy of the confidence of the people for one moment.  I expected that some Deputies would be more critical because 12 months have elapsed and the Land Commission has not much to show for its year's work, beyond the 20,000 acres divided, a little of which was in our hands but a good proportion of which was acquired during the past year.  Deputy Moran commented on the fact that there were no migrants brought out of County Mayo.  I regard that as cheap, petty political stuff which was not in the least helpful and contributed nothing to the debate.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows that the acquiring of land is a very slow process.  Sometimes it works our fairly easily, but at present, particularly in view of the high prices of agricultural produce, land-owners contest every inch of the way with the Land Commission and make the acquisition and resumption of land as slow as they possibly can. The blame falls on the Land Commission, but the blame should not, in reality, fall on the Land Commission, because we have to make up our minds whether we are to outrage and violate some of the laws laid down for which Davitt, Dillon and Parnell fought in days gone by, and if we want the Land Commission to go faster, we must make up our minds once and for all whether we will violate and outrage the principles which these men laid down&mdash;free sale, right of private ownership and so on.</P>
    <P>On that question, some Deputies say that they are sick of and fed up with the Land Commission.  I invite any Deputy who sees any flaw in the present legislation governing the Land Commission to put down a motion or to do as Deputy Corry, Deputy Cogan and other Deputies did, that is, to table a private Bill, and I will give them a free vote of the House.  I do not want to claim that I am an expert on land law, or that my word is the last word, that my word is right, whether it is right or wrong.  I want the majority of the House to decide and I am completely in the hands of the House.  If any group of Deputies get together and decide that new legislation is necessary, let them introduce <Col N="2661" /> a private Bill, but I want to utter this word of warning.  I have examined this question from top to bottom, and, before they do so, I advise them to examine it very carefully, and particularly, if they come from rural constituencies, to consult their constituents, the more broad-minded ones.</P>
    <P>I am, as I say, in the hands of the House, and so is the Government, and I do not say that everything I put forward or know about land law, the working of the Land Commission and the various promlems confronting it, is the last word.  I am only a human being like any other Deputy, and any other Deputy's opinion may be as good as, if not better than, mine.  The Chair is available and there is the General Office to help a private Deputy to frame the necessary Bill or motion, and, personally, I would welcome it, but the legislation as it stands, in my opinion, is quite sufficient for the Land Commission to go ahead with its work. I want to say that I am quite satisfied with the progress the Land Commission made from the time when they had their backs to the wall this time last year or a little earlier.  I am very satisfied and pleased with the progress they have made and I want to pay that tribute to the officials, because they started from nothing, with a good proportion of their staff lent to other Departments.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Moran and the Leader of the Opposition who said that the staff is now back.  I did not get back all the good, experienced men who were taken away in the early years of the emergency and lent to the Department of Agriculture to enforce the compulsory tillage regulations which the Minister had to impose, or saw fit to impose, at that time.  I did not get them all back.  I had to try to replace them with new staff and, even though the new staff is the best in the world, they cannot be expected to know all the ropes, to be good officials.</P>
    <P>When they go down the country&mdash; they are mainly outdoor inspectors&mdash; they cannot be expected to know as much as the inspector who has been going around amongst the people for three, four or five years.  The result is that new staff not alone are not a <Col N="2662" /> help for the first six, 12 or 18 months, but they are a drag on the older inspectors who have to go along with them and more or less teach them and direct them in the usages of land law and in meeting people in different counties and becoming acquainted with many things which are perfectly new to them.</P>
    <P>Taking everything into account, I think the Land Commission has done a very good year's work.  In my opening speech, I did not start praising them and I did not give Deputies very much opportunity to say whether we had done a good year's work or a bad year's work, but I suggest that criticism of the type which suggests that the Land Commission should be abolished is foolish, thoughtless talk. If the Land Commission is abolished, is it proposed to leave congestion as it is?  Is it proposed to wipe out the Land Commission and turn the annuity collecting Department over to the Department of Finance and to forget about the congests?  Is that the idea, or is it proposed to give the judicial powers at present enjoyed, and rightly enjoyed, by the Land Commission into the hands of (1) some civil servant; (2) some public person, or (3) the Minister. I, as Minister, will not take these powers&mdash;I do not want them.  I know that my predecessor in office did not want them and would not take them. No one man, and particularly a Minister, could take them because he could not discharge these duties properly.  A permanent official might be able to do it but not a Minister or public representative in this House.  Secondly, in my opinion, it would not be a right thing to do.  Three powers must be given: the power to acquire land, the power to fix the price for that land and the power to allot the land.  You must give these three powers for that particular type of work into the hands of somebody with judicial status, of judicial level; at least, somebody whom we can trust.</P>
    <P>It has been said that sometimes wrong things happen.  They do.  There has been a great deal of talk about the crop of bad user cases coming up now and the Land Commission is <Col N="2663" /> blamed for that.  The Land Commission should not be blamed for that.  The Land Commission are there to implement the policy of whatever Government is in power for the time being. I want that to be clearly understood. The Land Commission are there to carry out whatever policy the Government of the day, through their Minister for Lands, tells them to put into operation and if men who had not proper experience of working land to the fullest got land in the past, the Land Commission are not to blame.  I want to say, without any bitterness and without wishing to score politically, that it was done, perhaps, in a burst of enthusiasm by the last Government in their early days.  Nevertheless it has resulted in the fact that the Land Commission are blamed for what the last Government should be blamed.  If I as Minister for Lands told the Secretary to the Commissioners in the morning that they are to give land only to redheaded men, or to give land only to men with turned-up noses, they would have to give land only to such men and to no other men and they could be immediately dismissed if they deviated from that by one iota.  That is what happened in the past.  The blame leveled at the Land Commission is unfair. It should not have been levelled. It was not their fault.  They were good civil servants and good civil servants' duty, as I understand it, is to put the policy of the Government for the time into operation regardless of whether it is right of wrong.  It is also their duty, if they find a Minister or the Government perhaps going a little bit off the beaten track, to give them the benefit of their past experience.  Otherwise, if a Minister puts his foot down and says &ldquo;You will do a certain job in a certain way,&rdquo; the good civil servant will say no more but will go and do it in that way.</P>
    <P>The Leader of the Opposition, Deputy de Valera, raised a very important matter, the question of the pool of land available for the relief of congestion. He mentioned 500,000 acres at one stage and 1,000,000 acres at the other stage.  I am sorry he is not in the House because I would like to know where that 500,000 acres is.  I <Col N="2664" /> am after it if I can find it.  I want the House, particularly younger Deputies who are perhaps more critical of me than some of the older and more mature members of the House, to tell me where that 500,000 acres is.</P>
    <P>Is it not a fact that, under the present land law, a farm of land that could be taken by the State a year or two or three ago may not be taken now according to the way it is being used? Similarly, a farm that could not be touched by the Land Commission one, two, three or four years ago may become available now for the simple fact that it was well used then and is badly used to-day and the Land Commission can step in and take it over.  The result is that even a very close survey will not reveal what land is available for acquisition or resumption.  The figure for the amount of land available at any one time is always very fluid.  Nevertheless, while men are men there will be farms badly used and while the law of this land is that the Land Commission can take over land that is being badly used or that is non-residental there will always be a pool of land available to the Land Commission for the relief of congestion.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera said, quite correctly, that while the big farms remain &mdash;I think the words he used were, while the few big farms remain&mdash;they should be used for the relief of congestion. I agree fully with him.  On that point I would ask all Deputies. Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Clann na Talmhan, Clann na Poblachta, Labour and Independents to give me assistance. Deputy Giles, Deputy Fagan and, of course, nearly all Deputies from Midland counties, including Deputy O'Rourke of Roscommon, threw out the hint that they do not like to see migrants coming into their counties. Apparently, they would like to see the land given to the landless men and every possible person in their own constituencies. From a political point of view, it is very hard to blame them, but a Minister has responsibility, not for a particular county, area or constituency, but for the Twenty-Six Counties and, if he is to take the interest that he ought to take, every single <Col N="2665" /> person within the Twenty-Six Counties is under his charge.</P>
    <P>The problem of congestion is, perhaps, heaviest in Counties Donegal to Kerry along the West coast, including Leitrim and portion of Sligo.  That is not to say that there is not congestion in other counties.  I would ask the co-operation and assistance of Deputies in this matter.  If they want to see an end to the congestion problem within a reasonable space of time, when a farm is taken up in a county where there is not much congestion in the locality, as soon as the local needs are satisfied, they must, and should leave the rest of the land to the Land Commission to use their own discretion in taking migrants from any part of the country and putting them into that particular place as soon as they build houses for them.  I believe that Deputies from all constituencies are genuinely anxious to see an end to the congestion question and, if they want to assist me, they can do so.  The very moment it is known that the Land Commission is about to bring migrants from a different part of the same county or, perhaps, from a county 50 to 100 miles away, agitation rises up in the locality.  It is there that a Deputy can help me by frowning on it. His duty, then, is to say to these people: &ldquo;Do you know of any local small-holder who has been by-passed and who should have got an addition to his holding out of that farm?&rdquo;  If every small-holder within a reasonable distance has been satisfied and if there are half a dozen holdings left over, the Deputy should say to the people: &ldquo;The needs of the people of the locality have been satisfied and given first priority. and you must leave the rest to the Land Commission for the relief of congestion elsewhere.  If migrants are brought from Donegal, Leitrim, Sligo, Mayo, Galway, Clare or Kerry, they are Irishmen just as we are and it should also be borne in mind that these people are taxpayers just as the people in the particular area are taxpayers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In my opinion, a survey will not reveal the exact amount of land available at any one time, for the reason I have stated, that the present legislation allows the Land Commission to take land if it is non-residential or is <Col N="2666" /> not being worked according to proper methods of husbandry.  The compulsory tillage regulations produced the strangest thing imaginable.  Hundreds of thousands of acres that were available before the war are not available now.  It may be that pressure from inspectors, the fact that the nation was in danger and that all political Parties and all sects joined to ask the farmers to produce the necessary food for the nation when supplies were cut off from abroad, woke the owners to a little sense of their civic duty and they turned out good farmers.  The result is that many farms that were available before the emergency are not available now.  But, on the other hand, many farms that were not available before the emergency are being taken up now. That is the situation as briefly as I can put it.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Grady said that he would like to see drastic measures taken to enforce rearrangement.  I hope to deal with that in a new Bill that is in course of preparation, because I think it is too bad that when the Land Commission inspector has been a month or two or three trying to rearrange a townland or a slice of a badly congested estate, one or two of the extra smart people in the locality want a better slice of whatever is going than their neighbours and decide to be obstinate and obstruct and hold up a scheme.  I know of a case where one man held up a scheme which would affect himself and 15 other neighbours.  Their valuation would be increased from 33/- to £8 and they would have got out-offices, roads and dwellings.  A vast sum of money was to be spent on the estate and yet one man held up the scheme.  I cannot use compulsory powers against such a man, but I hope to be able to deal with that kind of obstructor in a way which I hope to bring into the new Bill.</P>
    <P>There have been demands from very many Deputies regarding cow-parks and plots for small towns.  We would like to meet these people and are anxious to meet them, but experience in the past has shown that where cow-parks or sportsfields have been supplied care has not been taken of them. The rents were not paid after the Land <Col N="2667" /> Commission going to the trouble to provide them.  We take them back when the people of a town or village have got such an amenity and do not appreciate it and that is the best we can do.</P>
    <P>Deputy Captain Giles mentioned the fact that men were getting holdings from the Land Commission because they alleged that they were old I.R.A. men but we are not so easily taken in as that.  We demand that a man have a certificate from the Department of Defence before giving him a holding, but if a genuine I.R.A. man comes along we are only too anxious to give him a helping hand and to appreciate what he had done for his country.  We will not turn him down, but we will not allow any bogus I.R.A. men to walk in and take holdings.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of talk on all sides of the House raising the matter of the implementation of the 1946 Act, particularly that part of it which deals with user cases.  I still stand to-day by what I said when that Bill was going through this House, that when an addition or an enlargement to an uneconomic holding is given it should not be interfered with.  I still hold that idea but such cases are not to be confused with cases of those gentlemen who got holdings from the State, holdings fully equipped with a dwelling-house and out-offices, and did not think it worth their while to use it or did not even think it worth their while to let it to some neighbour who would appreciate it and keep it in trim. Those people will be pursued ruthlessly and will receive no quarter.  In the case of an addition or enlargement to an uneconomic holding I hold, as I held when the 1946 Act was going through this House, that they belong to the parent holding to which they are given rather than to the holder.  In fact I have travelled so far along those lines that I have asked the Land Commission to consider some means of vesting them with the parent holding immediately they are allotted.  That is a serious advance, I know, but it is an advance which we are prepared to make.</P>
    <P>As I said a few moments ago, there <Col N="2668" /> are a number of bad user cases and definitely that fact is the fault of the Government who directed the policy of the Land Commission in those days rather than the fault of the Land Commission itself.  I do not want to whitewash the Land Commission.  Perhaps they have faults, but they are human just like we are ourselves.  Their job however, is to put into action the policy of whatever Government is in power for the time being.  In that regard they are not responsible for the fact that bad men are chosen for land no more than they are responsible for the size of the holdings as that was determined for them.  They are responsible if I tell them to-morrow morning that I do not agree with the size of the holdings which have been given out up to the present time or if I think that holdings of 40 acres should be given instead of holdings of 18 acres, 20 acres or 25 acres.  The Land Commission is not responsible because they must do what I tell them as the mouthpiece of the Government.  If in years to come the idea of 40-acre holdings turns out to be wrong, if they are too big or if they are too small, I do not see why Deputies should come along into this House and blame the Land Commission. I do not say that for the sake of politics or of scoring over the Opposition, but I say it because so much abuse has been levelled at the Land Commission in the wrong that somebody has to stand up here between them and those bricks which have been wrongly thrown at them and turn the bricks in the right direction.</P>
    <P>All that abuse which the Land Commission has got brings me down to the fact that I would like to give the House a short review of what this much maligned Department has done under three different Governments and, I think, 13 different Dáils.  When this State was established and when the Treaty came along in 1921, what was the position of land tenure and land occupation in this country?  The Congested Districts Board was doing its own work in certain well-defined areas while the Estates Commissioners and the Land Commission were doing their work outside the Congested Districts Board's area.  Even on the day that Treaty was signed over 9,000 estates <Col N="2669" /> were held by landlords covering a total area of more than 3,000,000 acres with 107,000 tenants.  Those tenants were still in the position their forefathers were in of paying rent without ever being able to buy out their holdings as a tenant buys them out to-day every gale he pays in June and December.</P>
    <P>The first Irish Government came into operation and tackled the job in a hard and manful way.  They tackled the big task confronting them.  The Land Commission, the Estates Commissioners and the Congested Districts Board had done excellent work in their own day but they had only nibbled at the problem and barely faced up to their work in most areas.  There were at the time over 9,000 landlords, with 107,000 tenants, covering a total area of about 3,000,000 acres or practically a third of the arable land of this country.  The first thing that was done by the new Government was to pass an Act here abolishing by one stroke of the pen the Congested Districts Board, the Estates Commissioners and establishing the Irish Land Commission as we know it now.  They handed over all the powers, all the property and all the moneys of the Estates Commissioners and the Congested Districts Board to the reconstituted Irish Land Commission. Following close on the heels of that famous Act of 1923, which is quoted so often here, an Act was passed in, I think, the fall of that year which swept their estates from those 9,000 landlords into the lap of the Irish Land Commission.  The tenants started paying rent to the Irish Land Commission and the work of vesting the individual holders proceeded.  Years went on and the work was slow because the landlords were sometimes absentee landlords and sometimes an estate agent was left in charge of the estate. by them who did not know the estate. Maps that were handed over to the Land Commission by the agents were sometimes incorrect, and in some cases they furnished lists of tenants which, when they were checked up by inspectors of the Land Commission, were found to be faulty.  When the Survey Branch of the Land Commission tried to get a picture of the estate before paying the landlord they found that there was little truth in them or that <Col N="2670" /> the picture given in them did not convey accurately the boundaries of the estate, the rights of the tenants and sub-tenants, or the boundaries of the individual holdings.  In 1931 it was realised that a new Land Act was necessary to complete the compulsory vesting and the handling over of the ownership in one sweep of all the remaining landlords.</P>
    <P>In 1931, let me tell the House, there were still over 5,000 landlords in possession of these estates or drawing a payment in lieu of rent through the Irish Land Commission and covering about 80,000 tenancies.  From 1923 to 1931 the tenants were paying 75 per cent.  of the former rent they were paying to the landlord.  The 1923 Act reduced by 25 per cent. the rent until each individual estate was vested by the Irish Land Commission.  The 1933 Act was the next big step.  It was passed by the Fianna Fáil Government and it covered a lot of irregularities which arose in the previous ten years. As time goes on, legislation develops flaws and these have to be remedied, which is what we do in this House every month and every year.</P>
    <P>I think that instead of firing uninformed abuse at the heads of the Land Commission we should realise what they have done in the quarter-century period since this State was established. They have not done so badly.  It must be remembered that during that time they have purchased 3,000,000 acres of tenanted land from the landlords and 1,000,000 acres of untenanted land for the purpose of additions, enlargements, accommodation plots and new holdings. They have allotted in all about 62,000 parcels during that time.  They have provided 15,000 absolutely new holdings in that time.  A good deal of these would be migrant holdings and they would not represent an increase in the actual number of holdings that existed in the State at the time when it was handed over.  They provided accommodation and bog plots in another 8,000 cases.  During that time they have vested or placed on an annuity basis all the holdings in this country which remained unpurchased in 1923. The holdings that now remain to be revested in the tenants are, in the <Col N="2671" /> main, those which require rearrangement and revesting.  They have given to the tenants of this country a title which is unique in any country in the world and which is the soundest title to property in any country.</P>
    <P>In other words, the Government of this State, the Irish Republic as it is now, hands over to the farmer on the day the property is vested, a title in which the boundaries and every other details are clearly set out.  All that entails a lot of work which is not realised.  Deputies then come along and say that the Land Commission is slow, that it is lazy, that it is archaic and so forth.  They have done a vast amount of most useful work in this country.  It should not be forgotten that their first and principal object was the handing over of ownership of the land of this country to the people&mdash;in other words, the handing over of ownership of the land of Ireland to the people of Ireland.  That is what the Land Commission have done during the last 25 years; 1,000,000 acres of untenanted land purchased, divided and distributed amongst 62,000 allottees; 15,000 absolutely new holdings created; 38,000 enlargements of uneconomic holdings and some 8,000 accommodation and turbary plots&mdash;small plots to cottiers and to school teachers, etc., so as to enable them to keep a cow.  In the meantime, they have vested and surveyed a great portion of the holdings taken over in 1923.  There are still about 90,000 holdings and allotments to be vested in this country.  This year we vested 15,000.  Next year, I am afraid, the figure will be less, because the easier ones were taken first and the hardest, that is the rundale cases, were left. There are roughly 40,000 of these difficult cases in the Twenty-Six Counties which will need to be rearranged and enlarged.  My rough guess is that it will take 8,000 new holdings yet, along with what has already been provided out of the 15,000 allotted in the last 25 years, before the end of congestion is in sight.  There is no use in minimising or trying to make light of the magnitude of the work.  It will take every bit of 500,000 acres of purchased land even yet to relieve congestion.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2672" /> There has been a bit of fun made of the fact that 20,000 or 25,000 acres per year is very slow and that we should aim at something like 100,000.  I am sure that my predecessor in office, Deputy Moylan, will not ask the Land Commission to take on a 100,000-acre programme after the experience his Government had of that for one or two years&mdash;I think that was as long as it lasted.  If they should, it would be a very bad job for this country.  It would go a long way towards upsetting the smooth working of the Land Commission. I am afraid that if any Government does indulge in the dividing of 100,000 acres per year, as distinct from the amount of land that will be taken up with the relief of congestion, the Land Commission will be set back again and there will be a great deal of grumbling in this House about the slowness of the Land Commission, and so forth.  I say that the Land Commission are working full steam ahead. Perhaps their work is slow.  Nevertheless, I think that we can proceed this year and divide a reasonable amount of land although I shall not make any promise or tie myself to any figure in that respect.  I suppose we have 45,000 acres of land at the present time for which proceedings are instituted but I cannot say nor can the Land Commission say how much of that land will be acquired and resumed. Every case is examined and if an objection is raised the question can be brought before the Land Commission Court.  If the objector can substantiate his objection he is not interfered with but if he cannot do so the Land Commission takes his land. The acquisition of land must go on while the relief of congestion remains to be settled and it will go on while that problem remains.  At the same time we do not want to upset the sound title the Land Commission is giving to those they are vesting every day.</P>
    <P>Deputy Commons is concerned about County Mayo.  So am I.  So is Deputy Moran.  However, I think both Deputy Commons and myself can go easy. Deputy Moran has discovered a new method of coming to the relief of congestion in County Mayo.  He has discovered two estates and this horrible Minister for Lands who is at the wheel <Col N="2673" /> now is a real bad scoundrel.  If Deputy Moran gets his way and can succeed in getting the Land Commission to take over these two estates I can assure Deputy Commons and Deputy R. Walsh that there will no longer be land trouble in County Mayo.  One of these estates is the Mary Conway holding at Cloonlara which comprises 7½ acres. Mind you, when that estate is divided we may have to acquire some of it back again because there may be too much land in it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another estate, the Joyce estate at Errew, close to Castlebar.  The Deputy took care not to mention whether or not these holdings were vested.  With regard to the Conway holding, I would point out that the 1936 Act was passed by the Deputy's Party although the Deputy may not have been a member of this House at the time.  Under that Act, when a holding is vested the Land Commission dare not acquire it within seven years of the date it was vested.  I should not have to tell that to Deputy Moran because he is a solicitor, but the Land Commission could not take those holdings owing to the Act which was passed in 1936.  If the Deputy does not agree with that he has a remedy.  He can put down a motion that such is not the case and that the Land Commission can acquire such land inside seven years or inside seven hours, and have it debated here.  The Deputy has a perfect right to do that.</P>

The fact is that the inspector who visited the place, or the inspector in charge, recommended that the holding be not resumed.  I was just as anxious to see that holding resumed as Deputy Moran was.  I think the highest compliment that can be paid to the Land Commission is that they turned down their own Minister's recommendations.  They cannot be accused of impartiality in this case. Twice I made strenuous recommendations in regard to that holding but my representations were turned down. That shows that whatever abuse may have been hurled at the Land Commission in the past cannot be hurled in this instance.  They were absolutely impartial, and determined to do the right thing in spite of the recommendations of their own Minister.</P>
