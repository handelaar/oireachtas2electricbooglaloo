      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I was addressing myself last night to the problem which would arise in providing a market for fish if we developed our deep-sea fishing potentialities.  There is no doubt that if the State is prepared to invest a large amount of capital in deep-sea fishing the income to the country from that source could be very great.  We then, however, have the problem of marketing that fish and encouraging our people to use it, otherwise it must <Col N="1956" /> be exported.  Any Government deciding to invest large capital sums in organising such a fishing fleet would be faced with the problem of whether or not it would be an economic proposition with a reasonable prospect of success. For one reason or another, our people, in our time at any rate, are not a fish-eating people to any extent.  It is oftentimes difficult to provide them with even the small amount of fish they need.  During the past spring I believe that fresh fish was oftentimes very scarce.  Provincial towns very often failed to get supplies of fresh fish when they needed it.</P>
      <P>The canning industry may hold out great possibilities.  It may be a solution for the problem, provided we develop a trawler fleet; it may be the means of disposing of the resulting catches with advantage to the country. Canning, I believe, is being done in a small way at present and there is no reason why it should not be developed. We import a large amount of canned fish.  I do not know what the value of it is.  We import tinned salmon from the dollar area.  Could we replace those imports with canned fish of our own?  Would it be economical to can our own salmon?  Would it be better business?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon) James M. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon)</NameTxt>
      <P>The fish sold as Canadian salmon is not salmon at all, by the way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is coloured like salmon anyway.  There is a certain type of fish that the Minister was always very interested in and probably he could colour that kind of fish and can it. If he canned all the &ldquo;cod&rdquo; that he called into existence here in the last dozen years we would have a very remunerative export trade for many years.  I suggest that the Minister for the future might can all that cod that he introduced into this House.  The result of canning all that type of fish would be of immense advantage to this nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Minister will consider the question of providing extra grants for those authorities who are anxious to improve our small fishing harbours. That is an important matter.  Very <Col N="1957" /> much good could be done by providing those authorities with substantial grants either through the Department of Fisheries, the Department of Finance or the Office of Public Works. The Department of Fisheries has always been the Cinderella of Government Departments&mdash;a poor, begging Department which could not spend a shilling without the authority of two or three other Departments.  I hope the Minister will change that.  If he will do that he will be doing a lot of good work for inshore fishermen who depend on the small harbours.  They badly need capital improvement and if local authorities were given some encouragement by the Minister to spend some money on the capital improvement of the small harbours around the coast nothing would give better results.  It would help those inshore fishermen very much.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Since we are starting afresh this morning I think it would be no harm to sum up briefly a few points that were made in this debate. I want to underline the fact that this debate has been conducted in a much better spirit than the debate on agriculture. I think the present attitude is due to the manner in which the Minister introduced the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding the fact that in this debate we have not developed much of the Party spirit there has been a very sharp clash of opinion, perhaps, in regard to policy, a much deeper clash than we had on the agricultural policy. The question has been proposed from the outset as to whether we can develop our deep-sea fishing industry and at the same time preserve inshore fishing.  The Minister has come down very definitely on the viewpoint that we cannot develop those two sides of the fishing industry.  I think that it would be well if the Minister gave close attention to the views which were very ably expressed by Deputy Sir John Esmonde and by Deputy Seán Collins who spoke in the Minister's absence.  They made a very sound case for the development of deep-sea fishing and made it very clear that it would not conflict in any way with the preservation of inshore fishing.  I think it will be admitted that if we were to <Col N="1958" /> encourage trawler fishing by private enterprise it would clash very definitely with inshore fishing.  There is, however, the alternative of State enterprise in this connection.  I think it is on the lines of State enterprise that deep-sea fishing will have to be developed. Of course, there are a lot of very serious considerations in this respect and Deputy Allen was inclined to be extremely cautious in expressing an opinion.  I think, however, it cannot seriously be suggested that there is no future for deep-sea fishing for this country.  We are as well placed as any other country which has developed that industry.  It may be said, however, that a State Department is not a very efficient instrument to develop a highly complex industry of this kind.  However, it must be remembered that State enterprise&mdash;if you like to call it enterprise&mdash;had to be responsible in many countries for the building up of fighting fleets which in wartime proved themselves very efficient. If careful consideration is given to this problem, if the best type of trawlers are purchased and if the whole industry is started on firm and sound foundations there is no reason why this industry cannot become a very valuable one.  It is a matter which cannot be lightly dismissed.  I am sure the Minister has no intention of lightly dismissing it, that every aspect of the question will be considered and that no undue time will be lost in coming to a definite decision.  The arguments that are used against the State launching out into trawler fishing were used I think to a great extent against the establishment of a mercantile marine in the pre-war years.  I think the Government then hesitated perhaps a little too long.  They found that it would have been better to have adopted that policy.  I am urging a viewpoint now upon the Minister to take his courage in his hands and see if it is possible to get this industry established.</P>
    <P>In logic there does not seem any reason why any nation situated so favourably as ours should confine itself to the resources of the sea in the immediate vicinity of the coasts.  There is no reason why we should not launch out as far afield as other nations have <Col N="1959" /> done.  It may be said that they have had a considerable advantage over us in being long engaged in this industry but at the same time we will have the advantage of starting afresh with the most modern equipment.  Like Deputy Brennan, I represent a maritime constituency. I have discussed these matters with the various people interested. Being a farmer I have no direct knowledge of the fishing industry, but I have heard the view frequently expressed by people in the industry that the Government should do something about the three-mile limit.  They should take some initiative in the matter to get it extended, if possible.  Another suggestion which I have heard made is that, as far as bays and inlets of the sea are concerned, some modification of the three-mile limit should be secured so that while we might be confined to a three-mile limit as from the headlands or outstanding points of the coast we might be given a more extended limit as regards bays and inlets.  I do not know whether it would be possible to secure that or not.  It might be an advantage which would not affect very much the east coast, in which I am concerned, but it might be a great advantage on the western coast.</P>
    <P>One of the big problems which affect nearly all harbours on the east coast is the silting up of the harbours.  I was in agreement with the Deputy who suggested that this problem should be considered from the point of view of seeing if something could be done to overcome permanently this difficulty. I was told in regard to Arklow that some alteration of the current by the provision of a barrier outside the harbour would prevent silting.  I do not know whether that is possible or not but I think it is a problem that should be seriously considered because an enormous amount of money is being expended in trying to keep the harbours clear.</P>
    <P>There is also a sort of permanent occupation for Deputies and other local representatives in making representations to the different Departments to have these harbours kept clear.  It might deprive them of their employment if this difficulty was overcome, <Col N="1960" /> but at the same time I think it would save a considerable amount of expense, worry and loss.  It is an extraordinary thing that, while you can have any Sunday paper at breakfast on a Sunday morning, it is very difficult to get fish in our inland towns.  Provided you had a fairly regular supply of fish, I think there should be no difficulty in providing a fast fleet of vans to distribute the fish to our most inland towns.  With a speedy distribution system, I think profiteering in fish should be ruthlessly eliminated.  That is to say, the consumer should not have to pay considerably more for his fish than the price secured by the producer.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister should not allow himself to be too strongly influenced by the very conservative opinions that have been expressed as between deep-sea and trawler fishing, and that he should face the matter courageously. If he does, I think he will discover that there is a great opportunity for this country, one which, if he takes advantage of it, will redound to his credit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say a few words on the Estimate in regard to the consumer and the retailer of fish.  That is a matter that has cropped up very often in the City of Cork because of the supply of fish and the price of it.  I understand that the prices of fish are controlled, according to the different varieties, and are 50 per cent. higher than the prices in England.  I think that should not be so, and that the Minister should endeavour to have some regularity as regards supplies of fish.  He will understand that it is very difficult for retailers to keep on staff in view of the fact that one week they have plentiful supplies, and in the next week none at all.  Very often people in Cork would be without fish on Fridays were it not for the fact that some of those foreign trawlers get disabled and have to come into Cork for repairs.  Even when these disabled trawlers do arrive, recurring difficulties seem to arise in the matter of obtaining supplies from them.  I have visited the Department of Fisheries on a couple of occasions and I must say the officials I met there were the most courteous that I have met in any <Col N="1961" /> Department.  They put up to me certain difficulties that they have to get over.  First of all, I believe they have to get the consent of the people across the water, and, secondly, the point was made to me that the demand in Cork would not be sufficient if a whole cargo were taken.  The skippers will not sell part of a cargo, and take the other half of it back to England.  Neither will they go and get a fresh catch and throw out the fish already there. These were some of the points put up to me.</P>
      <P>I think something should be done to increase the cold storage facilities, at least in places near big cities, where the fish could be kept in cases such as I have mentioned, or in cases where you had big catches or a glut of fish. It seems ridiculous to me that fish, which is caught off the coast of Cork by these English trawlers, should be taken to England and then be transported back to Cork for sale.  That is a thing that I cannot understand. Surely, some means should be found whereby we could get the fish ourselves and sell it through the country.</P>
      <P>It seems extraordinary that in an island country like this we are always neglecting this particular industry. The Minister and his predecessors have always made the case that they have to protect the inland fisheries.  I think that the question of the inland fisheries has been exaggerated somewhat.  Even if we suppose that they provide employment for 2,000 men, I think it would be found on investigation that a lot of these men are only employed part-time at fishing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever the number is, I suggest that those men have other occupations besides fishing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>It should not be impossible, I think, to devise some means of protecting them.  Anyway, that is no reason for making the people in cities like Cork and Dublin do without fish for six months of the winter. These people do not get 50 per cent. <Col N="1962" /> of what they require, and they do not get 20 per cent. of a supply of popular fish, such as plaice and hake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is a brave man to say that with Deputy Friel sitting beside him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not a bit afraid of Deputy Friel.  I think I am a bit heavier than he is.  At any rate, we cannot get regular supplies.  You can not educate people to eat fish if you only give it to them once a week or once a fortnight.  I believe, like the last speaker, that, if the fish were sent into our inland towns and were distributed quickly and regularly, there would be a very big market for fish, and we would not have the difficulty that we are experiencing as regards supplies at present.  The Minister should seriously contemplate the position of the deep-sea trawlers which come from Spain, France, England and other places.  We should find some means of canning the fish.  I would make a special appeal to the Minister to try and do something with a view to having regularity in the supplies of fish and of trying to overcome the difficulty of importing fish when there is a likelihood of fish being scarce.  It is generally known, a few days beforehand, that fish will be scarce.  We know that fish cannot be imported except under licence.  When there is a possibility of a scarcity of fish, I think the Minister should take steps to ensure that the people will not have to go without a supply of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Department of Fisheries Estimate was before the House last year, I brought to the notice of the Minister some complaints from my constituency.  My main complaint was the condition of the piers and slips all around the Mayo seaboard. At the time the Minister promised me that he would give the matter consideration subject to this, that it would be raised before the local <Col N="1964" /> authority.  In response to the sympathy that I got from the Minister at the time, I raised this matter with the local authority.  The main trouble, so far as I can see, is with regard to cost.  The maintenance of these piers and slips is a very considerable item.  I am quite satisfied that the initial cost will be substantial and that the maintenance will constitute a big responsibility, whatever authority will have to undertake it.</P>
      <P>So far as the piers and slips on the Mayo seaboard are concerned, the position is such that the fishermen are finding it almost impossible&mdash;as a matter of fact it is positively dangerous&mdash; to carry on fishing.  The suggestions put forward by different speakers with regard to markets are all right in their own way, but unless the fishermen along that seaboard get proper slips or piers, so as to ensure safety for them when they are landing their catches, I cannot see the use of arranging markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The area with which I am concerned covers all around the coast of Achill and the north coast of Mayo until you reach Killala.  In all that area, so far as I know, there are only one or two piers under the control of the council.  Darby's Point is one and the second one is on the northern side. They are the only places out of a total of ten landing points.  If any of those places were inspected by any Deputy here he would see the condition of the slips and piers and he would come to the conclusion that they could be improved.  They were erected years ago at a huge cost.  It would seem that during all those years maintenance work was not carried out and the result is that some of the piers are practically washed away.  I was in Dooega in Achill and you could see the foundation of the beautiful pier there.  It must have been erected at a huge cost.  It is now in such a state that half of it has been washed away.  That is largely due by the lack of some responsible authority in the matter of maintenance. If some authority&mdash;let it be the Department of Fisheries or the local authority&mdash;did maintenance work, the pier would not have deteriorated.  No <Col N="1965" /> maintenance work was carried out, the pier was left derelict, and now a large portion of it is in the Atlantic.</P>
    <P>I realise that the cost of reconstructing these landing places will be a big thing, but nevertheless I think the Minister would be well advised to have them attended to.  This matter could be tackled in the same manner as he is facing the problem of arterial drainage, field drainage and reclamation. All the money provided for these schemes will be in the nature of a full cost grant.  I feel the Minister should introduce some scheme by which all ports, harbours, slips and piers will receive similar attention.  The construction or reconstruction work should be on the same basis of expenditure, and then it will be the responsibility of some authority to undertake the maintenance. That can be arranged, whether it is the local authority or the Department will have the responsibility of maintenance.  Once you get the piers put into a safe condition for the fishermen, the question of maintenance will be only a minor one and we can get some Department, perhaps the Department of Fisheries, or the local authority, to take over the maintenance responsibility.</P>
    <P>So far as the fishing industry is concerned, we will never get anywhere until we give the fishermen piers and slips suitable to allow them to get their boats into the sea, make a safe return journey, and be able to land their fish.  As regards deep-sea fishing and inshore fishing, I believe that deep-sea fishing should not arise for the present.  What the fishermen want is the inshore fishing, because it is from that they derive their livelihood.  Deep-sea fishing is one of the things that I feel the Government can hold over for the present.  They must concentrate on inshore fishing.  The Minister indicated that there are, roughly, 10,000 people engaged in the inshore fishing industry. That is a considerable number and they are all making their living from the sea.  If these people are provided with suitable piers and slips and the other necessary requirements for fishing folk, I believe the industry will reach such a standard that soon there will be no shortage of fish in any part of the country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1966" /> In my constituency the fish coming into the towns come from the City of Dublin.  A small quantity comes from Donegal.  Yet we have plenty of fish in the waters all round our coast.  I believe that if local fishermen had proper equipment they would take advantage of the fishing industry. There would be a ready sale for fish in the towns and there should be no shortage of fish in any town.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the suggestion that the fishing industry should be nationalised.  The same freedom should obtain in the fishing industry as obtains at the present moment in agriculture. I believe that if fish were available fish shops would be established in the towns and the owners of them would make themselves responsible for providing a supply of fish for domestic consumption.  That would provide a good local market and any surplus fish could be transferred to the cities.</P>
    <P>I understand that about 15 years ago a survey was made of the slips and piers on the western seaboard and around Mayo.  That survey was carried out by an engineer from the Office of Public Works.  He was accompanied by the engineer appointed to the Mayo County Council.  Now some recommendations must have been made as a result of that survey but nothing has been done during the past 15 years.  I would ask the Minister to trace that survey now because I think the information it contained would probably be very useful.  These two engineers covered all the ground as far as this area is concerned.</P>
    <P>I have no intention of casting any reflection upon the Department of Fisheries or the officials connected with the fishing industry here.  Both have given good service to the people. Any time grievances were aired steps were taken to remedy them by these officials.  I want to congratulate the people responsible in the Department of Fisheries and elsewhere for the excellent service they have given.</P>

      <P>There are one or two points with which I would like to deal. I did not intend to intervene in this debate but last Friday night I happened to attend a lecture in Sligo Town Hall given by Mr. Carrigan, the man <Col N="1967" /> who is in charge of Marshall Aid here. He told us that he was amazed to learn that our Government wanted dollars to import fish.  I must admit that the people were amazed too.  That is the position however.  Nothing will be gained by either criticising or applauding that situation.  Our approach must be made in an endeavour to find a remedy for it.</P>

      <P>Both sorts of fish.  That is the position.  We should set our minds to finding a remedy for it.  In my opinion as far as the west coast is concerned the remedy lies in two directions.  The fishermen want both boats and gear.  The men are not inclined now to go out in the little boats that they used in the past.  They are not prepared to risk their lives in these boats.  I think steps should be taken to supply them with proper boats.  The second remedy arises in relation to piers.  In Sligo alone there are upwards of 30 small piers.  What they were built for is a mystery because they are absolutely useless.  I will give you one instance.  At Enniscrone 20 or 25 boats used to come into the pier there at one time.  When the fishermen came in for their dinner they had to haul the boats up 100 yards from the water.  Despite the fact that there was a pier there, there was no place where the men could leave their boats while they were at their dinner.</P>

      <P>The people of Enniscrone formed a town development committee. They are now excavating the rock and selling that rock to the county council.  When that is done they will have between £3,000 and £4,000 worth of work done.  Deputy Roddy and I approached the Department of Fisheries and the Board of Works with a view to getting a loan in order to finish the job.  I ask the Minister, in appreciation of the work these men are doing and in order that other people along the coast may be encouraged by their example, to consider this scheme and give a loan to these people.  On Saturday last the Sligo County Council passed a resolution expressing the opinion that it would be far more useful to spend dollars on the development of piers and in supplying boats and gear to fishermen than to spend money in importing fish.  These are the only points I wish to make.  I would again ask the Minister to give the development scheme at Enniscrone favourable consideration in appreciation of the work these men have done and as an example to other people along the coast.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to say a few words on behalf of the consuming public in Dublin City.  The position, as I understand it, is that the seas surrounding the country are teeming with fish but we have considerable unemployment amongst fishermen all around our coasts.  Supplies of fish to Dublin City are inadequate and irregular and fish offered for sale in Dublin to the consumer is too dear.  That is the problem that confronts the City of <Col N="1969" /> Dublin, that supplies are inadequate, irregular and too dear.  In actual fact, fish is not within the purchasing capacity of the ordinary person at all. I am not in a position to analyse the disparity between what the fishermen get and what the consumer has to pay but complaint is made that the fishermen are not being paid a sufficient price for their catches.  The fact would then appear to be that somewhere in between the fishermen and the consumer, excess profits are being made. I want to see the fishing industry made a success and, as far as Dublin is concerned, that success can be brought about by the provision of adequate supplies of fish at reasonable cost but supplies to the shopkeepers must be regular.  Fish is an important item of food and as fishing is such an important industry, I think it is the business of the section of the Department dealing with fisheries to endeavour to improve the supply and the distribution of fish.</P>
      <P>I was very pleased to hear the Minister refer to canning and I hope that his efforts in that direction will be a success.  Some time ago it was usual to get a very nice kipper but in recent years the quality and the taste of the kipper have changed and the complaint in regard to it is that instead of being properly kippered, smoked or dried, whatever the process is, it is dyed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it has anything to do with what he had the night before; in fact he might not notice the taste the following morning if he had a bad night.  I think that is something that might be inquired into by the Minister and if it can be remedied, as I think it can, then it <Col N="1970" /> should be remedied.  On the vexed question of inshore fishermen and deep-sea fishing, I can see the problem that confronts the Minister and the sense of the case that has been made by the Minister.  If there are 10,000 people along our coasts who live mainly or to a large extent by fishing, if their livelihood were affected by the establishment of a deep-sea fishing industry. I think it would be a disaster.  For that reason, I think the two conflicting points of view should be examined further before any step is taken that may lead to further unemployment along the coasts and to a very serious problem in regard to the maintenance of those people who will be denied whatever profits they now get from inshore fishing.  I think it is a problem that must be approached in a sensible way.  Probably the correct thing to do is to develop inshore fishing first to its full capacity, to provide all the boats and equipment that are needed, to ensure that a livelihood will be afforded these inshore fishermen, to provide proper means of rapid distribution of the fish and proper freezing facilities&mdash;in other words, to ensure proper marketing and proper distribution.</P>
      <P>When I was a young lad, every Friday I used to see a cart coming to my part of the country&mdash;it went to every part of the country&mdash;in which there was fresh fish or a barrel of salted herring. Even in those days, over 30 or 40 years ago, there appeared to be a more satisfactory distribution of fish than at the moment.  It is impossible to get fish now except in cities or in a few villages or towns throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister should concentrate, as he appears to be doing, on the provision of better fishing facilities and a proper system of distribution. If the Minister is successful in that, it will mean, as far as Dublin City and other cities are concerned, that there will be adequate and regular supplies of fish, and it should be possible, with a proper system of distribution and marketing, to bring down the price of fish so that it will be within the purchasing capacity of the ordinary person.  Beyond that, I do not want to say anything further in <Col N="1971" /> this debate.  Like all other problems that face the Minister and that face other Ministers, these are problems not of to-day or yesterday but problems of long standing.  They just cannot be solved by a stroke of the pen, nor can they be solved by a debate in this House; it will take hard and continuous work.  While the Minister and his Department are proceeding on the right lines towards the solution of that problem, we all should encourage them in every way we can.  I think we can say that there has been some slight improvement since we discussed this Estimate last year and the very hopeful speech made by the Minister in moving his Estimate indicates that there will be a substantial improvement in the present year.  I hope that that progress will continue and that this great fishing industry will be made a success.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Every speech I have listened to yesterday and this morning is a repetition of what I have heard during the past ten or 12 years.  I am rather disappointed to hear the Minister talking about safeguarding the inland fishermen.  In view of his idea of mechanising agriculture, he will have to change his mind in regard to fishing in that direction, too.  I can well understand the difficulties of fishing, and I do not suggest that we should start on a very big scale, but hearing all the complaints about foreign trawlers coming into our waters, I suggest that there is no reason why we should not have at least a dozen deep-sea trawlers to give the people of this country a supply of fish.  I intended to send the Minister some letters from the <i>Cork Examiner</i> over the past few months complaining that the people of Cork have not a supply of fish.  Ballycotton, Kinsale and Crosshaven have not a supply of fish for them and when the people of Cork cannot get a proper supply of fish I can imagine what the position is like in inland towns like Fermoy, Mallow, Castletownroche and other towns around the County Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fishing industry has been hidebound and if we were serious about it a very substantial sum would be set <Col N="1972" /> aside each year for the industry. I am not going to waste the time of the House, as the Minister must be fairly tired now of listening to speeches which are only a repetition of what he has heard during the past ten, 12 or 14 years, but I cannot see why we could not safeguard to a very great extent the livelihood of the inland fishermen.  I should like to hear from the Minister when he is replying how far out the inland fisherman can go to get fish for the people of the country. I am not going to waste the time of the Minister or this House as there has been so much repetition, but I hope that the Minister in replying will give us some encouragement to think that there will be a decent supply of fish for the coming year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not that I am any authority or have any knowledge of inland, inshore or deep-sea fishing, but, like Deputy Cowan and others.  I believe that there is a home market for fish that has not up to now been fully catered for.  It is very difficult to understand, despite the fact that we have had a native Government, the Sea Fisheries Association and all the rest, why it is that it is so hard to obtain fish now in the inland towns and rural areas, besides what it was 45 years ago.  Like Deputy Cowan, I remember that fish, both fresh and salt, was available then on at least three days a week, while for the past 35 years&mdash;of course, two wars intervened&mdash;it is much more difficult to obtain it.  That is one of the things of which I should like the Minister to give us some ex-plantation, particularly in view of the fact that transport has advanced to such a very great degree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps part of the explanation is, as Deputy Gilbride and some of the other speakers mentioned, that fishermen have not had proper gear, but I believe that for a number of years past, anyway, fairly modern gear was made available in parts of the country and, seemingly, the results have not shown any great measure of success. I believe that in regard to agriculture our first duty is to supply as far as possible the home market and the same is true as far as fishing is concerned. While the Sea Fisheries Association <Col N="1973" /> may have done a considerable amount to help the fishing industry, I do not see that there has been any great advance in regard to distribution since the days of the old Congested Districts Board.</P>
    <P>Piers and harbours have been mentioned and, as other speakers have said, three Departments of State have a certain responsibility.  I do not think that should be so; I think it should all be confined to one Department.</P>
    <P>As I stated at the outset, I know very little about inland, inshore or deep-sea fishing, but yesterday evening I listened to the speech made by Deputy Sir John Esmonde which, to my mind, was a very impressive speech. Seemingly he had gone into this matter very thoroughly and had gone to the trouble of getting figures and statistics regarding the fishing industry in other countries and comparing them with our own.  He mentioned Belgium, where the fish tonnage in 1945 was eleven thousand and some hundreds, and by 1946&mdash;I think it was the deep-sea fishing business he had in mind&mdash;Belgium had more than doubled its tonnage despite the fact that it has, he said, 75 miles of shore as compared with thousands of miles here. He advocated, and I think rightly so if his figures are correct&mdash;and his ideas seem to be very sound&mdash;that a special separate Ministry be set up.  I think there was nothing whatsoever wrong with that.  I could never understand why the Fisheries Department was taken from Lands and put in with Agriculture.  It may be that there is no very great difference between the Departments of Lands, Agriculture and Fisheries and that they all hang together, but if the possibilities are there to improve the industry to the extent set out by Deputy Esmonde, there should be a separate Ministry to deal with it.</P>
    <P>As I stated on the Vote for Lands on various occasions, and also on the Vote for Agriculture, whatever may be the opinions of people regarding the relief of congestion, the division of land alone will not settle it.  The proper thing is to try to establish industries in the congested sea-coast areas and for that purpose a separate <Col N="1974" /> Ministry would do a lot of good.  It might be remarked that I am advocating an additional Minister.  I am not doing any such thing.</P>

      <P>I am not advocating a separate Minister.  I believe that, with the groundwork which has been carried out, both Health and Social Services could now be under one Minister and the other Minister could take over what is now regarded by all sides of the House as a very important industry, that of fisheries.  I would like that point to be given consideration. If there is one thing no one can understand in rural Ireland, it is why, despite all the money that has been expended and despite the great advance in transport, it is so difficult now to procure either fresh or salt fish in the towns of rural Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>We never get fish in Sligo except when there is a surplus catch in Dublin or Donegal and by the time it arrives in Sligo sometimes it is not fit for human consumption.  There are many fishing villages in the county where, up to a few years ago, a number of families derived a nice income from fishing.  All that has practically ceased now, owing to the shortage of boats and gear.  I make a special plea to the Minister for one little village in particular, quite near Sligo town, Mullaghmore. Up to ten years ago there were 20 families in this village engaged in fishing.  They had a ready market for their fish in Bundoran seaside resort and in Sligo.  Now that is all knocked on the head, owing to the lack of equipment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the Minister as regards deep-sea fishing.  It would be a mistake to develop it, as it would exterminate the inshore fishermen, on whose behalf I am speaking.  They alternate between farming and fishing and must carry on both in order to exist.  My colleague, Deputy Gilbride, mentioned Enniscrone.  In this seaside place, fishing has been carried on for many years, but now the approach to the sea has become more difficult.  At the moment, the development committee there are trying to provide a new harbour <Col N="1975" /> and have already made representations to the Fisheries Department, and I expect there will be good results.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I come from a place where the people, in my town down the Slaney, are dependent for their living on fishing.  We have heard plain language in the speeches from the Opposition, that this industry has been let down.  I think it has been let down in previous years by the previous Government.  Deputy Esmonde and others were called to meet the fishermen of the Slaney some months ago and the request was that they be allowed out a month earlier to fish on the Slaney.  The old fishermen of long experience impressed us all by the statement that the fish are running earlier to the rivers now than ten years ago.  That is their contention.  I remember, as far back as 1932, when Fianna Fáil were clamouring for power, Deputy Dr. Ryan promised that if Fianna Fáil were elected they would grant this concession.  They were sadly dismayed and are still waiting for some Minister to grant the concession to let them in on the Slaney a month earlier.  I understand that the privileged few are still holding the rails.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy McQuillan and others with regard to people having the right to the river.  I was down in Galway some months ago and a friend of mine brought me over to the Weir bridge.  I looked down over the bridge and saw an abundance of fish in the river.  I happened to try to go around and see a man who was fishing and playing a salmon.  When I went to the bank, a man stopped me and told me it was private property and I could not even walk on the bank of the river. My friend told me I would have to pay £2 for a day's fishing and, if I caught three, I would have to give back two. I said: &ldquo;Who gets the two?&rdquo;  He said: &ldquo;Colonel &mdash;&mdash;.&rdquo;  It is about time that all that was changed.  Deputy Allen asked the Minister to can all the cod.  I reverse it: I think the Fianna Fáil people have been trying to cod all they can as far as fishing is concerned. I live in a town where fish is a novelty.  We never hear of it except <Col N="1976" /> occasionally when there might be a herring passing round in a car.  There are several fishing villages around&mdash; Cahore, Courtown Harbour, Rosslare and Blackwater.  These people are in a very bad way at the moment and I would like the Minister, in his reply, to give some information as to what his Department and his engineers have done on the inspection of Cahore, where the county council, as Deputy Allen said, have agreed to put up a certain amount of money.  These are things which should be looked into, and I hope something will be done for this industry.</P>
    <P>Surely, if we have £40,000,000 for land reclamation, we should have another few millions for fishing, to guard the lives of the people round the coast?  I appeal again to the Minister to grant a concession to the fishermen on the Slaney, who have been agitating for a long time for it.  I am told that it is not a matter of what the trawlers take, but what they kill, and the damage they do with their big gear.  The Minister for Defence ought to protect the industry in some way, such as the provision of faster boats to chase these people away.  Many small farmers along our coast are almost solely dependent on fishing and I trust the Minister will be able to give me some information with regard to the deputation and the progress made in the constituency I represent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is peculiarly appropriate that Deputy Dillon should be Minister for Fisheries.  Surely he is a most appropriate Minister for cod.  I support Deputy McQuillan and Deputy O'Leary in the argument they have put up.  I object to public money being expended on the protection of fisheries for the advantage of gentlemen from abroad who want to fish here.  We have a rather peculiar situation in that respect in portion of my constituency, and if Deputy McQuillan and Deputy O'Leary, now that they are members of a Government, would bring their weight to bear on the Minister for Lands they might get a little further ahead.  I do not think it will help fisheries and the quantity of fish to be obtained if the men who should be the natural owners of these fish, namely, <Col N="1977" /> the men who pay rates and annuities for the river bank and river bed, have no right whatever to the fish in the rivers which flow through land for which they pay this money.  How can you expect any attempt to preserve the fish in these rivers?  If it happened on my land, I would take good care that, if I could not have them, they would not have any fish, either.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to go any further.  That there should be imported into this island £500,000 worth of fish in 1947 and almost £300,000 worth in 1948 is, to use the Minister's words, all cod.  That should not be and there is something wrong with a Department of Fisheries in an island which cannot provide enough fish for our own people. That is something which I want to see remedied.  I admit that the exports are rather high, but I wonder who is getting the money for the exports and how much of it is going to the owners of certain old-time rights.  These are the gentlemen who are getting the income out of those fish and not the fishermen in whom Deputies take an interest.  The whole position with regard to fisheries requires immediate revision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had an argument here as between inshore fishermen and deep-sea trawlers. I was down in Bantry last Sunday and I suggest that, if the Minister took an excursion down there, his eyes would be opened and he would be rather surprised to see the number of foreign <Col N="1978" /> trawlers which I saw at the quayside in Bantry.</P>

      <P>These people must be getting a livelihood somewhere around our coast, and, if they can get a livelihood there, there should be a livelihood there for our own people, and that is where I lock horns with the people who say that there should not be a deep-sea fishing industry.  There is undoubtedly a very great opening for deep-sea fishing all around our coast, and, if it is necessary for us to import almost £500,000 worth of fish every year, there surely is an opportunity which the people in the Department should develop by finding out what classes of fish are coming in and by seeing to what extent that demand can be met here.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the protection afforded for boats, particularly in Ballycotton.  I have been approached in this matter by the Ballycotton Development Association on a few occasions and I have been informed that the man in charge there is not prepared to recommend the purchase of any extra boats in the district until the pier there is extended and protection afforded to these boats.  The county council are prepared to do their part&mdash;as a matter of fact, the matter is before the county council at present &mdash;and I want to see the Department of Fisheries and the Sea Fisheries Association doing their part, so that we can get extra boats there and provide a livelihood for nine or ten more young Irishmen, who, if they are not provided for, will have to get a livelihood elsewhere across the sea.  If they get the opportunity, they will be able to reduce imports of fish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is rather new in this job, and I do not intend any criticism of this Vote, beyond suggesting what I think should be done.  Provision must be made for the proper protection of boats that are purchased.  The whole fishery position requires recasting and remodelling, and the time has arrived when foreigners should not be allowed to get the income that should properly go to the ordinary people of this <Col N="1979" /> country.  If you take a boat in Youghal Harbour, you have to pay licence money to some earl or duke or somebody else.  That position should not obtain to-day.  It should end and end quickly.  I understand that practically the same position prevails on the Blackwater.  Yet one sees laws introduced by which a man can have a net only of a certain length and can fish only between certain times, while, at the same time, there are laws preserved by which a lord or duke or earl can walk in every morning to a trap and fork out of that trap anything up to 200 or 300 salmon.</P>

      <P>The inshore fishermen have found a new friend in the Minister for Agriculture.  The debate has shown general agreement on all sides of the House that the fisheries industry was sadly neglected since the days when Mr. Fionán Lynch was in charge of the Department.  It is a welcome change to see the Minister for Agriculture about to pursue the policy of Mr. Fionán Lynch in trying to put the inshore fishing industry on its feet.  It is notable that the Estimate this year of £151,000 is higher than it ever was before.  The inshore fishermen will feel the benefit of that and, when we consider that, last year, when these people were subscribing tax for the purpose of providing a Constellation air force and were only given half that figure for <Col N="1980" /> their own industry, the change is very obvious.  The Minister in introducing the Estimate has shown that he will be helpful so far as he can in putting the industry on its feet again.  More fish were marketed in 1948 than in any previous year and more money was received for fish sold in 1948 than in any previous year.  As the Minister has decided to make £88,000 available for the purpose of providing boats and gear, I feel that the quantity of fish caught and the income therefrom will be higher than in the peak year of 1948.</P>
      <P>I was surprised to hear my colleague, Deputy Burke, agitating for all this equipment and help for the inshore fishermen.  He was there for several years and his Party were there still longer, and each year that passed found the industry further declining. We can see from the records that very little was done for the inshore fishermen since Fianna Fáil came into power. Now Deputy Burke wants to give them everything and to get everything for them.  I will be only too glad to see Deputy Burke distributing Coalition boats amongst these needy fishermen which will enable them to earn a proper living.  Deputy Burke boasted here that, as a result of representations which he made to the Minister for Agriculture, he succeeded in getting the Minister to do something for the fishermen.  Everybody will know from the Minister's attitude towards fishermen that there is no need for Deputy Burke to force him to do something for them.  He is ready to do all he can.</P>
      <P>I regret that Deputy Burke left out the Skerries fishermen when he tried to cover all the groups of fishermen along the east coast of County Dublin and mentioned the various places.  The Skerries fishermen depend on a certain amount of assistance from the Sea Fisheries Association and I hope the Minister will not neglect them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that there is no room for the two industries, deep-sea trawling and inshore fishing, because I know a small fleet of trawlers efficiently managed could provide enough fish for the people of this country and would deprive the inshore fishermen of a living. I would like the Minister to consider <Col N="1981" /> the possibility of advocating fish days in Ireland just as there used to be meat days in Britain.  Fish days in Ireland would be for the purpose of popularising the consumption of fish. It would be a way of improving the health of the people because fish is a healthy food and there is not half enough of it consumed here.  The question of distribution, of course, would have to be carefully considered by the Minister, because in villages and towns 20 to 30 miles from the coast people can get only imported canned fish.  That brings me to the suggestion that, although we have a canning industry, we ought to try to establish machinery which will enable us to can all the fish which could be consumed in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I have very little to say on this Estimate, as the whole field has been covered by previous speakers. Every Deputy seemed to cover his own district and to look for grants for the repair of piers, and so on.  All I have to say is that we are very grateful to the Minister for his decision to establish a boat building shed in Dingle.  I know this will be of great benefit to the district and the fishermen there will appreciate the gesture very much.  As the Minister mentioned in his opening statement, the establishment of this boat shed will supply the boats needed in the district.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter which coincides with the boat shed at Dingle and which is more important to the fishermen of the district at present is a dredger for Dingle Harbour.  We have been agitating for that a number of years. The piles at Dingle Harbour appeared in Dingle at a vision of 15 feet about 15 or 16 years ago.  I went back there this year at the request of the fishermen, and the vision there now is only about two feet from the silt to the top of the pier.  I have been asked to ask the Minister to get a dredger to dredge Dingle Harbour.  There is no use in giving boats to the people unless the harbour is dredged, because at certain times they cannot get out to fish.  I understand that there are only two boats in Dingle that can rise at certain tides to get fish.  I would, therefore, ask the Minister to provide a <Col N="1982" /> dredger for Dingle Harbour and to do a good and successful job there.</P>

      <P>I have listened to this very exhaustive and instructive debate. I am very grateful to all the Deputies who have contributed to it.  I hope to demonstrate by the conduct of the Department during the coming 12 months that the suggestions they have been good enough to make have not been forgotten.  However, I think it is fair to mention again a matter which was first referred to by Deputy Rooney.  It is that the money appropriated in this House for the Department of Fisheries is the largest sum that has ever been appropriated for this service since the State was founded, with the exception of one year, when the Estimate contained an item of £50,000 which was required to liquidate the liabilities of a bankrupt deep-sea trawling project that had been initiated by the Department of Fisheries.  I think it is a chastening thought to recall that interesting landmark in the Department's career.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Not in the least.  If I believed to-morrow that it was consistent with the survival of the inshore fishermen to establish a deep-sea trawling company in this country on a large or on a small scale I would recommend to the Government forthwith that whatever sum of money was necessary should forthwith be appropriated for that purpose.  It is because I am profoundly convinced that the permanent employment of 2,000 men and the part-time employment of 8,000 men would be irretrievably destroyed by the volume of fish delivered into this country by a competent trawling company that I have refused four proposals in the last 12 months to establish deep-sea trawling industries based in this country. I would value the considered judgement of the House on that matter.  My policy is to reserve for the inshore fishermen in this country the exclusive enjoyment of the entire domestic market for fish.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I can explain that to the Deputy.  My policy has not yet been fully realised because the plans are now in the process of execution. Heretofore, we had a situation in this country in which we had a kind of quasi-trawling company here in Dublin&mdash;a respectable trading body that had been there for a long time.  It was not, in the real sense, a deep-sea trawling company, but it was a kind of quasi-company.  You had the Sea Fisheries Association and you had the ordinary fish wholesalers.  My proposal, under the new dispensation, is to constitute the Sea Fisheries Association a co-operative of all the inshore fishermen in Ireland.  Having so constitued it, nobody will be entitled to land fish in this country except the Sea Fisheries Association acting on behalf of the inshore fishermen.  The Sea Fisheries Association will look primarily to the boats of its own members to land the fish the domestic market requires.  Its policy will be to pay a fixed price which will be known to the fishermen before they go out fishing for demersal fish.  I have told the House already that the problem of marketing pelagic fish is not so simple.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJosephTimoney" hpid="Mr. Timoney Mr. Timoney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timoney</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that apply both to canned and to fresh fish?  Would there be an exclusive market for our own fishermen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Absolutely, but let me follow the thing out if I may.  The Sea Fisheries Association, as reconstituted, will look first to their own members but, inevitably, there will be a period of perhaps two or three days when the inshore fishermen, for one reason or another, are unable to land the fish which the market requires.  It will then be the duty of the Sea Fisheries Association either to purchase the cargo of a foreign trawler which is sheltering in one of our bays and to distribute that to the consumer pending the arrival of further supplies in their own members' boats, <Col N="1984" /> or to go to Grimsby or Hull, or whereever fish is to be found, and fill the gap for two or three days until such time as the normal stream of fish from our own members' boats will supply the market.  There is no use pretending that that represents the most highly efficient or economic method of supplying the Irish fish market.  If we give the Norwegians or the Icelanders or the Dutch or the French or the British a concession to operate a trawling company from this country, the cause of efficiency and economy will be much better served.  In the full knowledge of that fact, I have turned down four separate proposals of that character.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the Deputy's point. He is hoping that we could create a situation in which the inshore fishermen would supply the domestic market and that there then should be located in Ireland a trawling company trawling fish into our harbours, with this restriction upon them&mdash;that they must export their entire catch, except so much as would be bespoken by the Sea Fisheries Association to fill gaps. I put it to the House that you have a supply of fish brought in by a powerful, wealthy trawling combine who continually make the case: &ldquo;We must take the fish out of Ireland; that is our agreement.&rdquo;  But, outside of <i>Alice in Wonderland,</i> was there ever heard of such a situation where a fleet of trawlers bring all their fish into Ireland and then ship it all out again?  I am a long time in public life&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want Deputy Collins to misunderstand me.  Does he not anticipate that the trawling company will distort the thing because they will want to get the domestic market?  They will say: &ldquo;We are going to abide by our agreement most meticulously&rdquo;, but they will covet the domestic market.  We can put restrictions on them, but we cannot censor them.  They are entitled to argue their case and make their representations and say: &ldquo;So long as the restrictions are upon us we will observe them, but why not take the restrictions off?&rdquo;  I cannot see myself or any other Minister for Fisheriés in the long run being able to sustain the proposition that a trawling company should operate from Ireland on the condition that it does not sell a herring's tail in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister considered the possibility that such a trawling company can be made to supply our raw material for a canning industry and a fish meal industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course I have.  I do not want Deputy Collins to create the impression that he and I are at loggerheads on this particular issue, because <Col N="1986" /> I am perfectly certain that he and I are aiming at precisely the same objective. Our only difference is the best way of arriving at it.  If I believed that you could build up an industry based on the catches of a trawling company; if I believed that I could preserve for the inshore fishermen the domestic market and, at the same time, have a trawling company furnishing factories and providing employment, I would be all for it.  It is because I am as certain as I am standing here that, whatever restrictions you impose on a trawling company based on Ireland, no sooner will they be firmly established than they will make the case, as they are entitled to make the case: &ldquo;We acknowledge our obligation and submit to the restriction imposed on us when we were set up, but we are entitled to argue that this restriction should be removed and that the anomaly of the only efficient unit in Ireland not being allowed to sell a single fish in Ireland should be brought to an end.&rdquo;  As certainly as you permit a trawling company based on Ireland to get into the position of making that claim, no Minister for Fisheries will be able long to withstand it.  The moment he gives way and permits a trawling company to sell their catch on the domestic market you can close the boatyard at Meevagh and the boatyard at Killybegs and the boatyard at Dingle, and you can close up the employment of 2,000 men who are permanently employed and about 8,000 more who are fishing instead of engaging in migratory labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that there are many people who have given much thought to this matter and who are fascinated by the prospect that, quite apart from the consumption of fish, the produce of a trawler's catch could be used for the manufacture of fish meal, fish manures, canneries, etc.  There could be no greater illusion, because you cannot afford to use fish for the baser purposes, such as animal feeding and manure, except on the assumption that you have a profitable market in which to dispose of your prime fish and pay your expenses with your prime fish, and then convert the dross into manure and fertilisers and feeding stuffs and so forth, and treat it on the <Col N="1987" /> basis that it costs nothing at all, because your prime fish has carried the cost of your trawling operation and you are only charged with the preparation of fish feed or fish manure in the process.</P>

He would be a fool if he did not listen to rational advice from wherever it may come; then, having taken the precaution to which I have referred, to make up his mind.  Some people expect the Minister to abstain from a decision until he is in a position to make a godlike one.  Until he believes himself to have the omniscience of God, what is he to do?  All I can do is to make up the mind that God gave me and recommend a certain course of action to the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be very glad to furnish the particulars of that survey to any Deputy.  It is one thing to direct the attention of the House to the amount of money allocated to this Department since this State was established.  There would be little cause for self-congratulation in that if I were not in a position to add that the landing of wet fish, excluding salmon, in the 12 months of 1948 represents the greatest weight of wet fish that ever was landed since the Sea Fisheries Association was founded in 1930, and that the value of the 385,243 cwts. of fish landed was £595,647, a higher value than has ever <Col N="1989" /> been recorded for wet fish landed on the coasts of this country by the Sea Fisheries Association.  In the course of the first 12 months&mdash;to give a man his due&mdash;that is not bad going.  If the truth were told, microscopic credit is due to me, but the convention is that the Minister takes the kicks.  On this occasion he proposes to accept the ha'pence as well.</P>
      <P>Shell fish have been very good too, with one interesting exception&mdash; scallops.  It apparently is true that the American soldiers had a fancy for the scallops; so long as the number of American soldiers continued to arrive in Great Britain we sold lots of scallops.  As the American soldiers went back to America the demand for scallops proceeded to disappear. Whether that was a coincidence or whether they were the principal consumers of that fish is not yet certain but it looks very much as if they were the principal people who consumed them.  However, my plan is that when the Sea Fisheries Association is reconstituted it will have three divisions: (1)  for the provision of boats and equipment for the fishermen; (2) for the marketing of fish on the domestic market and (3) for the marketing of fish on the industrial and foreign market and for the research requisite to find new markets for shell fish and the like which we have not as yet had an opportunity to supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been asked about the three-mile limit.  This, so far as I know, is the fruit of a discussion which took place about 1930 at the Hague between a very large assembly of nations who were gathered for the purpose of trying to reach common agreement.  Some people wanted a three-mile, some a six and some a 12-mile limit.  They all came round to accepting three miles.  When it came to six miles some wanted it and some did not.  When it came to 12 miles few wanted it and many did not.  Finally the party broke up with everybody accepting the desirability of three miles, some of the tough kind who had means of making their wishes effective saying: &ldquo;Whatever they mean, we mean six.&rdquo;  There is the outstanding example of that stout defender of national sovereignty&mdash;the <Col N="1990" /> U.S.S.R.&mdash;setting 12 miles or as far further as they can reach.</P>
    <P>That is the present position.  It is very generally accepted to be piracy if you start upheavals outside the three-mile limit.  There are some nations which have made bilateral agreements that if A will keep so many miles from the shores of B, B will keep the same number of miles from the shores of A, but there is no universal rule.  In the last analysis, when you get on the high seas, I ask Deputies to remember that you cannot blow a whistle and call a Civic Guard.  When you get on the high seas, international law is enforced by no international police and unless you are in a position to establish your rights under international law <i>vi et armis</i>, what are you going to do?  The seagulls will not come down and the dolphins will not help.  When we talk about clearing the seas adjoining our shores, 12 miles out, we have to ask ourselves what we have to clear them with.  I am a great believer in sticking my chin out just as far as I know I will be able to draw it in again.</P>
    <P>I know that some of my poetic friends on the Opposition Benches and, indeed, some who are not on the Opposition Benches, are inclined to describe some of our inlets and bays as having fleets of trawlers resting on the shimmering bosom of their waters.  I do not think any Deputy would agree that we would not receive, as every other nation in the world has always done, distressed vessels at sea into the safety of our inlets, bays and harbours in times of stormy weather.  It is perfectly true that in Bantry, Killala and Galway, you will occasionally see large groups of foreign trawlers which enter the bays for protection in stormy weather.  It is quite a different proposition if you see trawlers in the process of trawling within our domestic waters.</P>
    <P>Mind you, everybody seems to think that, if we were to equip ourselves with trawlers, all our troubles would be over.  That is not the experience of Great Britain.  I understand that at present Great Britain finds it extremely difficult to supply her domestic market and has to depend to no small extent on the inshore fishermen of <Col N="1991" /> Denmark.  She sends out her trawlers, but by the time they bring the fish back to port, even though it is carefully distributed and refrigerated, it is not always first-class fish.  One of the reasons why there have been a kind of lacunæ in the supply in Cork, to which Deputy Hickey referred, is not for the want of any largesse on the part of anyone or because the Sea Fisheries Association will not buy fish in Grimsby or in one of the other recognised fishing centres.  The reason is that there was not any fish.  Remember, the shortage of meat in England has greatly stimulated the demand for every kind of fish.  Added to that, the customary trawlers which bring in supplies of fish to Great Britain have repeatedly failed recently to do so and so they have had to fall back on catches made by Danish inshore fishermen. Fish at the moment is a relatively scarce commodity.</P>

Since 95 per cent. of us are good, pious Roman Catholics, we have to eat fish on Friday, but we are damned if we will eat it any other day.  I would not eat fish if I could get out of it.  I detest fish.  Why anyone should feel bound to eat fish I do not know.  I detest the stuff and I always did.  I eat it with profound reluctance on a Friday.  I may say that I much prefer an egg. It is not high treason to say that, and it is not treason to our fishermen.  It is the way that God made me.  I do not think there is any duty on the Irish people to eat fish.  I do not think that we should start building a sort of religion in this country that you must eat fish or else that you are a bad Irishman and a traitor to the national cause.  I do not think that is so.</P>

      <P>My business is to see that if people want fish on their table, it shall be made available to them at a fair price through the agency of the inshore fishermen organised in a co-operative society, and that the Sea Fisheries Association will be the sole authority charged with the responsibility of furnishing the Irish domestic market with fish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the detailed inquiries that were made by Deputies, they will be answered where an answer is required.  I think the time of the House demands that I should undertake to do that as between the Deputies and myself.  There is one suggestion which I should like to make.  There must be a number of Deputies on the Fianna Fáil side of the House and in other parts of the House who can lay aside politics for some fragment of their lives. There must be Deputies on all sides who are interested in fishing and, when I say fishing, I mean fishing with a rod and line.  If there are such, and if they constitute themselves into an anglers' committee of this House, they might perhaps from time to time consider problems that they have personal knowledge of and make suggestions to me to improve our inland fisheries.  I should be very grateful if they would do that.  I may not be able to give effect to everything that they propose, but I can assure them of this, that whatever proposals they put before me will be most carefully considered, and if it is humanly possible to try out any proposal they have to make, then tried out it most certainly will be.  That is a matter in which I would prefer the members of the House would take the <Col N="1993" /> initiative themselves rather than that I should try to institute the formulation of such a committee.  I believe that would help us all materially and it might, in addition, tend to dissipate the asperities that sometimes emerge from the less restrained of our members.</P>
    <P>Were I to pursue this matter further, I must speak for an hour, but, as I have every hope of this Estimate being conceded before 1 o'clock, I am not going to say very much more.  But I will say this, that as far as the Department of Fisheries is concerned, we are very anxious for suggestions from Deputies who know of particular problems in their own areas, and it is very often helpful to us to have our attention directed to them.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear Deputy McGrath say that he had found by experience that he was always made heartily welcome in the Department when he had any inquiry to raise or business to transact.  That is as I would expect it to be.  Deputy Allen was very much upset that more prompt and vigorous action had not been taken about Poulduff and Cahore Point and, lest Deputies should take scandal and fear that Deputy Allen and the people of Wexford are labouring under some extraordinary difficulty, I would like to inform the House that in a report published by my Department in 1907 they had to state that&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The extension of Poulduff pier has been completed and the works have been taken over by the county council.  It has been reported that the pier is giving much satisfaction locally.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was 42 years ago and since then Poulduff has turned up at regular intervals. When we completed this pier in 1906 we left half way down a gap through which the tide was to flow and which we hoped would prevent silting and erosion.  Subsequently some local genius determined that this gap had been left because the Department of Agriculture was too lazy to build the pier all in one piece and he decided to repair their error.  So he filled the gap, with the result that the silt, instead of passing out through the gap, ricochetted and has gradually worn <Col N="1994" /> away the spending beach.  It was to avoid that that we left the gap 42 years ago.  The wiseacre has now succeeded in sweeping the beach away.</P>
    <P>In 1933 the matter was carefully examined and it was decided that nothing could be done.  In 1939 it came forward for further review.  In 1946 the county council in Wexford put up proposals which would cost a very substantial sum.  I will not say more than that.  I met a deputation from Wexford, led by Deputy Allen and Deputy Sir John Esmonde, and Deputy O'Leary was, I think, on it.  We discussed the whole business and the position now is that the Board of Works are preparing an alternative plan to that submitted by the optimistic, expansive and to me entirely sympathetic junior engineer on the staff of the Wexford County Council.  I confess that if I were in his position I, too, would plan glory for Poulduff, but the modest resources of this State cannot aspire to granting a harbour for every Poulduff along our shores.</P>
    <P>I could follow all these fascinating rainbows down through their long history and most of them would prove to go back into the early part of this century; but, instead, I will reserve that for some other occasion and now I will ask the House to approve the Estimate.</P>

      <P>As regards the question of providing time for the discussion of the motion to which the Deputy refers, I would draw his attention to the long-standing practice of this House that time is not made available for Private Deputies' Business until the financial business has been disposed of.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if, in view of the slowness of the present policy of those charged with the responsibility of providing houses for the people, he will consider the desirability of appointing a Minister for Housing with full powers to deal with the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the housing programme, as planned and operated by the existing central and local authorities, is proceeding with all possible speed.  Housing output by local authorities has been more than doubled in the past year, and the number of local-authority houses at present in course of construction is greater than that at any previous <Col N="1996" /> period, including the peak pre-war period.  The erection of houses by private persons and public utility societies with the aid of State grants has advanced from practically nil returns in April, 1948, to activities now involving disbursements of State grants totalling over £60,000 a month.</P>
      <P>The carrying out of the housing programme is dependent on and furthered by ancillary services provided through the Department of Local Government and the local authorities, so that its detachment from the administrative scope of either or both of these organisations would have a retarding rather than an accelerating effect on housing output.  It would lead to dispersal of effort, new sources of delay, and unnecessary and expensive duplication of administrative and technical staffs.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that no effort is being spared to increase, so far as possible, the efficiency of the existing organisations, both national and local, which are concerned with the housing of the people.  I am satisfied that the maximum progress can be most expeditiously and effectively attained within the framework of these organisations, and that the appointment of a separate Minister for Housing would not accelerate the work of providing houses for the people.</P>

Last week 800 of them were declared to be tuberculosis cases; 2,000 are newly-weds and these have not been dealt with at all.

      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs whether, in view of his statement at the O'Connell Street meeting that it was made clear to the British Government that it was the intention of the Government to repeal the External Relations Act long before the decision was formally announced, and long before the Republic of Ireland Bill was introduced in the Dáil, and the apparently complete contradiction of that statement by the British Secretary of State for the Home Department in columns 390 and 391 of the Official Report of the British House of Commons of the 17th May, 1949, to the effect that no documents had passed between the Irish and British Governments and no conversation took place between them indicating that any pronouncement was going to be made by the Irish Government regarding the repeal of the External Relations Act before Mr. Costello made his statement in Canada and that this announcement had come as a complete surprise to the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations who was in Dublin when the <Col N="1998" /> report came out in the papers, he will (1) give the Dáil the date upon which the British Government was first informed of the Government's intention to introduce proposals for legislation for the repeal of the External Relations Act; and (2) state the method by which that information was conveyed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. MacBride)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I can best reply to the question by recalling, first, some facts which will be within the recollection of most Deputies.</P>
      <P>In introducing the Estimates of my Department on the 20th July, 1948, I outlined the Government's attitude towards the &ldquo;last remaining link with the British Crown&rdquo; (Dáil Reports, Volume 112, columns 909-910).</P>
      <P>On the 6th August, 1948, the Tánaiste intimated to the Dáil in the clearest terms that our self-respect demanded the repeal of the External Relations Act without delay.  On the same day, the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy de Valera, indicated that he would support the repeal of the Act.</P>
      <P>In addition to these facts, which are a matter of public knowledge, I pointed out to the British representative, in informal conversations, that most of my colleagues in the Government had opposed the passing of the External Relations Act or had criticised it since it was enacted, and that the Act was likely to be repealed. Subsequent to the Dáil references which I have mentioned, the repeal of the Act was confidently forecast in several newspaper articles.</P>
      <P>All these indications of the Government's policy and intention were given before the Taoiseach's Press Conference in Ottawa on the 7th September, 1948, in the course of which, confirming the reports which had already appeared in the Press, he stated that, the External Relations Act being full of inaccuracies and infirmities, the Irish Government were preparing to repeal it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as the Deputy's question may, by design or otherwise, be construed as justification for the action of the British Government in including <Col N="1999" /> the provisions relating to the six-county area in the &ldquo;Ireland Bill&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I should point out that a number of communications were exchanged between the British and Irish Governments, and two conferences were held, at Chequers and Paris, respectively, prior to the introduction of the Bill to repeal the External Relations Act; that full and frank discussion took place concerning every aspect of the proposed repeal; that agreement was reached as to the consequential steps to be taken by the Governments involved; and, finally, that there was a clear understanding that both Governments would maintain close consultation concerning such consequential steps.  Consultations actually took place between the two Governments in pursuance of this understanding. At no stage, however, did the <Col N="2002" /> British Government inform or consult the Irish Government about Clause 1(1) (b) of the &ldquo;Ireland Bill&rdquo;, nor was the text of the Bill made available to the Irish Government until it was introduced.</P>
      <P>I might avail of this occasion to correct what appears to be a misunderstanding in the Deputy's mind, as well as in the mind of the British Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. Chuter Ede).  At columns 390 and 391 to which the Deputy refers, the British Minister purports to reply to a question asked by the Member for Platting (Mr. Delargy), but, no doubt through a misunderstanding, does not reply to the question asked but replies to some question which had not been asked. If the Deputy will turn to column 357, he will find that, in effect, what the Member for Platting, Mr. Delargy, asked was whether any communications had passed between the two Governments before the repeal of the External Relations Act, and, if so, whether the British Government would consider publishing these as a White Paper. Written communications, in fact, did pass between the two Governments on the following dates:&mdash;7th October, 1948; 12th October, 1948; 14th October, 1948; 16th October, 1948; 20th October, 1948; 13th November, 1948; 14th November, 1948; 13th December, 1948. In addition, of course, there were conferences held at Chequers and Paris.</P>
      <P>In so far as the British Home Secretary replied to a hypothetical question, which he was not asked, he was strictly correct in his answer.  No written communication passed between the two Governments before the 7th October, 1948.  But, having regard to the facts enumerated by me in the first portion of my answer, I am astonished that the reference made by the Taoiseach at a Press Conference in Ottawa on the 7th September, 1948, should have come as a &ldquo;complete surprise&rdquo; to members of the British Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, be that as it may, there was ample time, as a period of well over two months elapsed before the introduction of the Republic of Ireland Bill, during which time discussions and <Col N="2003" /> consultations, in fact, took place, in contradistinction to which the Irish Government received 24 hours' notice of the introduction of the &ldquo;Ireland Bill&rdquo; and no discussion or consultation took place.</P>

It would not be practicable without communicating with individual local authorities and, consequently, without an undue expenditure of time and labour, to ascertain with any reasonable degree of approximation the probable expenditure of such authorities over the wide range of services covered by the question.  I may, however, say that, so far as health and certain of the social welfare services <Col N="2009" /> are concerned, it is estimated that corresponding local authority expenditure will be of the order of £2,400,000. These figures do not include expenditure on contributory insurance services, such as national health and unemployment insurance, nor do they include some items of a capital nature or loan charges.  It must be appreciated that the figures are to a substantial degree based on assumptions, and that they must be regarded as subject to many qualifications.  The records available do not permit of ready classification as between farming and non-farming communities and, broadly speaking, it is only practicable to distinguish as between urban areas and the rest of the country, and the rest of the country may include, for example, road workers and workers in provincial factories.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of any regulation to the effect mentioned, but as the letting agreements with the corporation prohibit subletting, the corporation cannot be held responsible for overcrowding when the terms of the agreements are departed from without their consent.  In the allocation of new tenancies the corporation is bound by Section 29 of the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1948, in which classes of priorities are prescribed.  The question of providing accommodation for slum-dwellers and cases of tuberculosis in the corporation's present programme is of paramount importance, and it is therefore, in the public interest that there should be strict adherence to the existing order of priorities.</P>

      <P>Before proceeding with the business, a Chinn Comhairle, I desire, with the permission of the House, to refer to a statement made about me by the Minister for Agriculture which I consider a breach of privilege.  In the course of the debate on the agricultural Estimate on Friday last, as reported in Volume 115, column 1730 of the Official Debates, the Minister for Agriculture referred to me in the following terms:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;... he whispered the oatmeal millers into plucking up courage to form a ring against me.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I want to say that that statement is completely untrue.  I had at no time any contact with any of the oatmeal millers, nor did I suggest to any of them to act in the manner indicated by the Minister, nor had the Minister any foundation whatsoever for his allegation.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>All I am asking for, and am entitled to ask, is that the usual practice be followed.</P>
      <P>In introducing the Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce, I want to refer to the circumstances in which a reprint of the Estimate was issued to Deputies after they had been presented with the printed volume of Estimates for the year ending on the 31st March, 1950.  The Government, after consideration, decided it would be appropriate that the administrative responsibility for matters connected with the procurement of wheat supplies from abroad should be exercised by the Minister for Agriculture, who is, of course, the administrative authority in connection with the home production of wheat. It was a natural consequence of this decision that the Government should also decide that the administration of the subsidy on flour and wheatenmeal should be transferred to the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The transfers took effect as from the 1st April last and the sum of £6,871,000 for the payment of flour and wheatenmeal subsidy in the current financial year was taken out of sub-head J in the Industry and Commerce Estimate and put into the Estimate for Agriculture. There are other changes in the Industry and Commerce Estimate for the current financial year as compared with that for the previous year.  It was decided during 1948 to transfer the service for the issue of health embarkation certificates to the Department of Social Welfare, to which it is appropriate, and the Estimate for that Department contains the provision for this service in the current year.  The provision for certain services formerly conducted by Bord na Móna has been <Col N="2017" /> discontinued and I will mention later the reasons for this discontinuance.</P>
    <P>In the column showing the provision made for various services in the financial year 1948-49, there has been an addition of £26,980 in respect of increase in Civil Service remuneration which has been transferred from the separate Vote for that purpose which was passed last year by the Dáil. Excluding the provision for flour and wheatenmeal subsidy, and taking account of the other changes affecting not only the current year, but last year, the Estimate which I am now presenting to the Dáil shows a net decrease of £3,735,965 as compared with last year.  There are decreases in practically every sub-head of the Vote, and, in the course of my remarks.  I will deal with the principal items.</P>
    <P>The Estimate includes provision, mainly under sub-head A, for the salaries and expenses of the Statistics Branch of my Department.  The Government have decided that, as from the 1st June, a central statistics office is to be set up which will be attached to the Department of the Taoiseach; and they have made an Order transferring my functions in regard to statistics to the Taoiseach as from that date. Deputies will have an opportunity to discuss the matter on an Estimate for the new office which will be introduced shortly.  For accounting convenience, it has been decided that the Department of Industry and Commerce will pay the salaries and certain other expenses provided in the Estimate for Industry and Commerce for the current financial year and will account for that expenditure.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the increases in Civil Service remuneration which were authorised last year, the Estimate this year shows a small decrease in the provision for salaries, wages and allowances.  Though the permanent activities of the Department tend to increase, there has been a reduction in the staffs due in the main to a curtailment of those services of a temporary nature which were introduced to cope with emergency conditions. The emergency necessitated the introduction of special measures of control over the importation, exportation <Col N="2018" /> and distribution of essential commodities.  I share to the full the desire of those who wish to see these emergency controls removed, and I have arranged that those controls which still remain will be subject to a continuous process of examination so that they will be removed immediately the need for them has passed.</P>
    <P>As a result of this examination, a number of controls has been either removed or substantially modified in the past 12 months.  I will mention only the abolition of soap rationing, the relaxation of export control, and the easement in the arrangements for the distribution of petroleum products. Unfortunately, many controls must necessarily be retained for the time being, at any rate.  Many essential goods which were scarce during the emergency are once more freely available. But in some instances, such as petroleum products, and certain building materials, shortages still persist or the position of supplies has not yet reached that degree of stability which would justify the complete abolition of controls.  The main limiting factor in the building industry is the shortage of skilled workers.  The changes which have been made either by removal or easement of controls have permitted reductions in staffs and the numbers shown in the Estimate for this year are less by nearly 100 than they were last year.  Since the Estimate was printed further reductions in staff have been found possible, and I anticipate still greater reductions will be made before the end of this year.  The staffs released from my Department will be transferred to meet the requirements of other Departments, whose services are expanding.</P>
    <P>During the past year, there has been a steady and continuous increase in industrial activity, notwithstanding the difficulties which arise from the fact that machinery and equipment still continue to be difficult to obtain. It is the policy of the Government to give every encouragement in their power to sound proposals for the establishment of new industries or the expansion and development of existing industries.  In giving effect to this policy, the Government will be prepared, <Col N="2019" /> where necessary, to provide for industry any reasonable measure of protection that may be required and that will not be detrimental to the interests of the community as a whole. The Government have been concerned to ensure that there will be the fullest examination of every relevant factor arising in connection with applications for protection, and that special attention should be given to measures for promoting the well-being and expansion of Irish industry.  They consider that their policy in these respects can best be furthered by setting up a special body who will have the fullest possible independence and who will be charged with special functions of an advisory nature in relation to industry and its development.  They, accordingly, decided to set up an industrial development authority with functions which have already been announced. The preliminary steps for the establishment of the authority have been taken and, at an early date, I will introduce proposals for legislation, so that statutory effect will be given to the Government's decision and that the legal position of the authority, as well as the powers to be conferred on the members, will be determined.  As there are many urgent matters awaiting examination by the industrial development authority, it has been decided that the members should make a start with their duties in advance of the enactment of the legislation.</P>
    <P>During the past year many proposals have been before me for the establishment of new industries or the expansion of existing industries.  Some of these proposals were indefinite and tentative in nature.  It is likely that some of them will not be pursued, but the prospective promoters have been afforded all the information and help which it was practicable to give.  In the past year I have notified my approval in 90 cases of new industrial proposals and in 14 of these cases the production stage has been reached and appreciable employment has already been given.  The numbers employed will expand when these new industries advance beyond the development stage through which they are now passing. <Col N="2020" /> There are some 70 proposals for new industries which are in process of advancement towards completion.  The volume of production in the industries producing transportable goods was, in the year 1948, 15 per cent. above the volume in the year 1947 and 36 per cent. above the volume in the year 1938.  For the last quarter of 1948, the volume of production in these industries showed an increase of nearly 9½ per cent. over the volume in the last quarter of 1947.  In industry as a whole, that is, including building and construction, public works of the State and local authorities, transport and public utilities, the provisional figures of production show an increase in 1948 of 16? per cent over 1947 and of 28 per cent. over 1938.  In 1948, as compared with 1947, the most notable increases in output occurred in the production of bricks, glass and cement, pottery, wood furniture and upholstery, vehicles, metals, engineering and certain branches of the textile industry. There was a decline in the clothing industry and a more marked decline in the fellmongery, leather and footwear industries.</P>
    <P>I have given special attention during the past year to the position of the clothing, leather and footwear industries. In the case of the clothing industry, the manufacturers made representations to me on a number of occasions, that they were being seriously affected by the substantial volume of imports which the effective rate of duty of 25 per cent. <i>ad valorem,</i> reimposed in January, 1948, was doing nothing to stop.  They urged that unless action was taken to stem the flow of imports they would be forced to close down their factories, and they produced evidence to indicate that goods were being landed here at prices with which, having regard to their costs of materials and wages, they could not possibly hope to compete.  I had several meetings with the clothing manufacturers and, having been satisfied as to the strength of their case, it was decided by the Government, on my recommendation, to double the effective rate of import duty.  I was assured by the manufacturers that this increased protection would not lead to <Col N="2021" /> increased prices and, indeed, they went further in stating that the extra production which would result from getting the bulk of our market reserved to them should so reduce their costs as to enable them to reduce prices.  I have warned the manufacturers that, if there is any attempt by them to take advantage of the higher rate of protection now afforded to them by increasing prices, I will take steps to withdraw the protection entirely.</P>
    <P>The footwear industry presents a specially difficult problem.  On account of the volume of publicity which conditions in this industry have had recently it might not be inappropriate to set out the facts of the situation. The pre-war market for leather footwear was in the region of 4,750,000 pairs annually.  In 1938 it was 4,697,000 pairs, made up a home production of 4,442,000 pairs and imports amounting to 255,000 pairs.  Though rationing had to be adopted, the market was reasonably supplied throughout the whole period of the emergency.  In 1946, although home production at 5,254,000 pairs showed a substantial improvement on the previous year. imports amounting to 1,068,000 pairs were permitted, making a total quantity of 6,322,000 pairs available in that year.  In the following year home production increased still further to 5,491,776 pairs.  Although the output of Irish factories in that year was substantially greater than the total annual pre-war demand, imports amounting to 2,145,948 pairs were authorised under the Control of Imports Acts.  An import quota of 625,000 pairs of leather footwear was appointed in November, 1947, for the first six months of 1948, and when I took office as Minister I found that substantial advantage was being taken of this quota for the importation of such footwear.  That, briefly, was the situation when I first met representatives of the manufacturers over a year ago and when they claimed that the industry was in a perilous condition because of extensive imports.  After reviewing the matter at that time I took steps to reduce the imports drastically.  A quota of 150,000 pairs was fixed for the second half of 1948, and, in fact, only 105,000 <Col N="2022" /> pairs were imported in that period.  It was also provided at that time that boots, as distinct from shoes, would not be imported and this provision continues to apply.  In agreement with the manufacturers a quota of 200,000 pairs was fixed for the first half of 1949 but imports from January to March, 1949, amounted to less than 28,000 pairs, i.e., less than 2 per cent. of the market.  I hope that the figures which I have quoted will refute finally the assertion that the difficulties of the footwear industry have been caused by competition from current imports, or that I have neglected the interests of this important industry.  Despite the measures to which I have referred I regret to say that there has been little or no improvement in the position of the industry and because of this fact I again met a fully representative meeting of the manufacturers recently. Though some of them were still inclined to the view that their difficulties were being accentuated, if not indeed caused, by current imports, it was agreed generally, after discussion, that such imports were of little or no consequence. At my suggestion the manufacturers agreed to set up a small committee which would make a comprehensive examination of the industry and submit proposals for action that would put it on a sound basis for the future. The committee are still working and I expect that their proposals will come before me in the near future.  In the meantime, I am taking action in an endeavour to secure improved export outlets for footwear.</P>
    <P>Numbers of protective measures which were in operation before the war and which were suspended owing to supply difficulties continue to be suspended.  Each case is separately examined from time to time so that it may be ascertained if any action is necessary to safeguard our own producers.</P>
    <P>In the many meetings which I myself and officers of my Department have had with representative of the industrial community frequent references have been made to the widespread prejudice existing in the home market against Irish-manufactured goods.  It was, perhaps, understandable <Col N="2023" /> that some such prejudice should exist when industrial development was first initiated by a native Government, but now that Irish enterprises are firmly established and their promoters have attained more experience in productive methods, there can be no reason for the continuance of such mistaken ideas.  I immediately decided to take such action as was open to me to ensure that the products of our industries would get a fair trial on the home market, and that the mind of the buying public would not be unduly influenced by high-pressure advertising of imported commodities. As Deputies are aware, I had a meeting recently with representatives of manufacturers, distributors and trade unions to discuss this whole question. At that meeting I indicated measures which would, in my opinion, popularise Irish goods and suggested that the various interests present should establish a representative committee which would not merely start, but sustain over a long period, a publicity and advertising campaign to popularise Irish products.  I am glad to be able to say that my suggestions were unanimously accepted, and I am confident that if the committee acts vigorously and wholeheartedly on the lines proposed they will be doing very good work for Ireland and, incidentally, for themselves.  If our manufacturers cannot find sale for their products here they must curtail production, thus depriving workers at home of the means of livelihood.  This situation will immediately react on distributors by contributing to the improverishment of their customers and the contraction of their market.</P>
    <P>The products of many of our industries are in demand in the markets of the world by virtue of their excellent quality.  Our industrialists, however, would be well advised to devote continuous attention to improvements in quality and design as there can be no finality in these matters.  If the efforts we are now making to remove the anti-Irish prejudice are successful our producers can compete on equal terms with the manufacturers abroad, but they can continue to do so effectively <Col N="2024" /> only by concentrating continuously on turning out articles which will be more satisfactory to the Irish consumer than those available from outside sources.</P>
    <P>Employment in those industries covered by the Census of Industrial Production, including building and other industries of the service type, as well as manufacturing industries, increased during the year 1948 by 11 per cent. over the figure for 1938 and by 4 per cent. over the figure for 1947.</P>
    <P>The provisional estimates show that the number engaged in industrial production increased from 177,000 in 1947 to 184,000 in 1948.  For purposes of comparison it might be mentioned that in 1938 the number engaged in industry was 166,107.  It is worthy of note that the preliminary returns for 1948 show that that year has seen the highest level of industrial production and of industrial employment ever recorded in the annals of the State.  I might mention in that connection that industrial exports for 1948 exceeded by £2,000,000, or 20 per cent., industrial exports for the previous year.</P>
    <P>There are some disquieting features about the employment position in rural areas.  Attractive employment on public works with Bord na Móna and with the Electricity Supply Board is available, but these bodies have experienced great difficulty in obtaining workers in rural areas for the important undertakings in which they are interested.</P>
    <P>Our external trade showed an improvement during the year 1948 in comparison with 1947.  Imports in 1948 amounted to almost £137,000,000 in value an increase of almost £6,000,000 over the value of our imports in 1947. The value of our exports and reexports in 1948 was £47,500,000, which represented an increase of £8,000,000 over the value of the exports and reexports in 1947.  The trade deficit in 1948 was £89,000,000 as compared with £92,000,000 in 1947.  On invisible account, which represents net earnings from tourists, dividends from abroad, emigrants' remittances and so on, there was a balance in the country's favour in 1948 of £74,000,000 as compared with <Col N="2025" /> £62,000,000 in 1947.  The overall net deficit in our external transactions was, therefore, £15,000,000 in 1948 as against £30,000,000 in 1947.</P>
    <P>Since July, 1948, imports have shown a marked fall and exports have expanded. The balance of trade for the last six months of 1948 averaged £5,750,000 a month as compared with an average of £9,000,000 a month during the 12 months ended on the 30th June, 1948.  I have taken every practicable step to increase the flow of industrial exports.  Our exporters have, however, been handicapped in their efforts by the import restrictions imposed in other countries, and there have been discussions with representatives of many of these countries with a view to enabling our manufacturers to obtain markets for their goods.  We have concluded agreements with Great Britain, France and the Netherlands and discussions are proceeding or are about to begin with some 12 or 13 other countries.</P>
    <P>The importance of the tourist industry in our economy is reflected in the fact that the net earnings of the industry in 1948 represented at about £30,000,000 almost one-half of our total credit balance in that year on invisible account.  The net receipts of the industry in 1947 have been estimated at £28,000,000 and in 1946 at £18,000,000. The peak was probably reached last year and I fear that it is unlikely that net receipts will again be so high, but it is very essential in the national interest that every effort should be made to ensure that the industry will be conducted efficiently by those engaged in it.  The hotel business is the centre of the industry and I am of opinion that this business can best be conducted by private enterprise.  Consequently, I have decided, with the approval of the Government, that the hotels acquired by the Tourist Board and operated on their behalf by Failte, Teoranta, should be sold.  Action to give effect to this decision is at present proceeding.  One of the most effective ways, in my opinion, of advancing the tourist industry is by a carefully prepared publicity campaign in those countries from which it is most likely that tourists can be attracted to this <Col N="2026" /> country.  Funds are being made available for the purpose to the Irish Tourist Association, and I have every confidence that beneficial results will be obtained.  The question as to the future action to be taken in relation to properties, other than hotels, acquired by the Tourist Board for development is under consideration and an announcement of policy will be made on a suitable occasion when this question has been fully examined.</P>
    <P>Under the sub-head for food subsidies the provision for 1949-50 of £2,279,000 covers only the subsidies on tea and sugar.  The provision made for 1948-49 covered subsidies on flour and wheatenmeal, oatmeal and margarine, as well as tea and sugar, and the amount provided, adjusted to take account of the transfer of the flour and wheatenmeal subsidy, was £3,047,805.  There is a decrease of £768,805.  Subsidy is no longer payable on oatmeal and margarine.  In the case of sugar, modifications have been made in the scheme for distribution, and subsidy is paid only on sugar supplied to meet the domestic ration at the rate of ¾lb. a head per week.  In the result, a substantial saving of subsidy will be effected.  In the case of tea, distribution since rationing was introduced was on a quota basis which had to be adopted at the time when the bulk of our tea supplies came to us through the British Ministry of Food.  This quota basis has resulted in payment of subsidy on excess quantities of tea, and it is proposed, when the necessary arrangements have been completed, to apply similar rationing arrangements to tea as those which apply in the case of the domestic sugar ration.  The result will be a saving in the tea subsidy payments.  All the measures which I have mentioned account for the decrease in the provision shown in the Estimate.</P>
    <P>The prices charged for practically all commodities were subjected to a constant examination by the Prices Branch of my Department and the profits being taken by manufacturers were also closely examined.  In the result, numerous price reductions were secured.  The goods in which reductions were effected included margarine, <Col N="2027" /> cornflour, rice, jam, dried fruits, soap, timber, bicycles, petrol, building materials, certain articles of clothing, motor cars, wrapping-paper, paper bags and cardboard boxes.  These reductions were effected and other prices kept stable notwithstanding the fact that, during the year, the upward trend in the cost of raw materials continued.</P>
    <P>Deputies will observe that only a token provision is made in the Estimate for the fuel subsidy.  The circumstances in which substantial reserves of fuel were purchased some years ago are well known, and heavy losses will of necessity have to be incurred in disposing of this fuel.  Since the reserves were acquired and stored to meet emergency conditions and the fuel cannot be put into immediate consumption, it is the view of the Minister for Finance that the losses should not be charged in the accounts for the years in which they are incurred but should be refunded and spread over a term of years. The stocks of fuel held at the 14th May, 1949 were turf 149,306 tons, firewood 14,036 tons and coal 381,849 tons.  The figures at a corresponding date in May, 1948 were turf 271,376 tons, firewood 399,403 tons and coal 457,720 tons.</P>
    <P>I come now to the operations of Bord na Móna.  The major development schemes on which the board are at present engaged are financed direct from the Central Fund by advances made under the Turf Development Act of 1946.  The board are pressing forward energetically with the first scheme of development.  Originally it was intended that a period of ten years would be required for its completion, but the work is being expedited so as to bring it to completion in a period of five years.  The shortening of the period for completion will involve additional expenditure, and provision to meet that expenditure out of the Central Fund will be made in a Bill which will be presented to the Dáil at the earliest practicable moment.  That Bill will also contain provision to cover a second scheme of development which the board have drawn up and which the Government have accepted.  Work on the first scheme is proceeding with all haste. In the case of some areas under the <Col N="2028" /> second scheme further survey is necessary before final decisions can be taken and these surveys are being pushed ahead rapidly towards completion.</P>
    <P>The Estimate now before the Dáil contains provision in sub-heads O (1) and O (2) for certain other activities of Bord na Móna.  By the terms of the Act of 1946 provision for experiment and research falls to be made in the annual Estimate.  The fact that this year the provision for this service shows a reduction of £40,000 as compared with last year does not reflect any diminution of interest in experiment and research either by the Government or by Bord na Móna.  The reduction simply results from a realistic approach to the amount of experiment and research on which it will be practicable to embark in the current year.  Deputy Larkin put a question to me on this subject some weeks ago, when I informed him that at the present time the board consider they can best advance the interests of turf development by concentrating their research activities on work which aims to obtain the production of turf in large quantities at reasonable cost.  At the same time experiments are continuing in producing wax from peat, and there is investigation regarding the use of peat in the manufacture of wallboard and insulating material and in gas turbines.</P>
    <P>In sub-head O (2) a provision of £384,000 has been made to meet the cost in the financial year of the turf production scheme which was formerly carried out by county councils.  The provision for this service set out in the Book of Estimates for last year was £1,900,000.  Deputies are already familiar with the circumstances in which the scheme was revised last year and the activities of Bord na Móna on this service confined to the production of turf by semi-automatic machines. Last year 100,000 tons of turf were produced and the expenditure incurred amounted to approximately £222,000. This year the aim is to produce 180,000 tons with an expenditure of £384,000, and it is expected that from the sale of the turf a sum of £355,500 will be realised and brought to account as an <Col N="2029" /> Appropriation-in-Aid.  The net deficit on the scheme this year is, therefore, estimated at £28,500.  In the early part of my statement I mentioned that no provision was being made this year for certain services previously operated by Bord na Móna.  These are production of turf for use in non-turf areas, administration and general development; these items being set out in italics in the appropriate section of the Estimate.  The provision formerly made for the production of turf for use in non-turf areas was in respect of the Kildare scheme for the hand-winning of turf operated directly by the board.  The discontinuance of this scheme was decided upon early in 1948 and only a token provision in respect of it was made in the Estimates for last year.  The provision for cost of administration of £12,000 made last year covered expenditure on a turf marketing section which was engaged in the inspection of hand-won turf and in supervising distribution and allocation. This service is no longer needed with the cessation of hand-won production and has been discontinued.  The general development, for which £3,500 was provided last year, also related to the sale of hand-won turf and to the promotion of its production, the grant being expended almost entirely on publicity.  Here, again, this service has ceased and no further provision is necessary.</P>
    <P>There is an increase of £100,000 in the amount provided this year for the repayment of advances for rural electrification. These advances are made in the first instance from the Central Fund and the statute under which they are made requires that one-half of the amount advanced in any year will be met as a subsidy from State funds and repaid from the Vote to the Central Fund in the year succeeding that in which the advances were made.  The increase this year shows the progress made during last year in the development of the rural electrification scheme.  At the 31st March, 1949, work had been completed in 37 areas, and, of these, 30 had been completed in the year to the 31st March, 1949.  In that year the number of consumers receiving supply under the rural scheme increased <Col N="2030" /> from 2,227 to 11,580.  The Electricity Supply Board aim during the present financial year to complete 60 additional areas, and I consider that, generally, progress on the scheme can be regarded as satisfactory.</P>
    <P>Provision has been made to cover the operations of Mianraí, Teoranta, at Slievardagh and Avoca.  In the Slievardagh coalfield area, production from the Ballynunty and Lickfinn mines ceased during the year.  I have on a previous occasion informed the House that the production in these mines was found to be completely uneconomic and it had been continued during the emergency only because of the acute fuel shortage which prevailed.  Mianraí, Teoranta, have not, however, suspended operations in the Slievardagh district.  During 1948 exploration work was concentrated on the copper area and further drilling was done in nine bore holes and 15 trial pits sunk. I have been informed by the company that the prospecting work has proved an area of coal of which samples are of good quality, and it is expected that production will begin before the end of the present calender year.</P>
    <P>The Government have decided that exploration in the Avoca mineral area should proceed and they have agreed that on this work a sum of £120,000 may be expended.  The Government have received expert opinion to the effect that for this sum of £120,000 it should be possible to get full information about the extent and quality of the mineral deposits in the area, so that the question as to whether further development should proceed can be decided.  There have been delays in starting on the work at Avoca due to certain difficulties about title, but a commencement will be made in the very near future.  Exploration work, for which a further sum of £13,000 is being provided separately under sub-head N (4) is proceeding on the gypsum and anhydrite mine in the Carrick-macross/Kingscourt area.  The objects of this exploration are to get further information regarding the nature and extent of the deposits, to determine how the minerals can be worked most efficiently on a commercial basis and <Col N="2031" /> to test for salt, coal and other minerals.  The work is being carried out under contract by a Swedish firm and the total cost will be about £44,000.  There were delays in the initial stages due to difficulties in obtaining equipment but satisfactory progress is now being made and it is expected that the greater part of the exploration will be completed this year.  This is an important mineral area and I anticipate that its subsequent development will prove of substantial economic advantage.</P>
    <P>The provision in Vote 58 for transport and marine services is £262,600 as against £217,280 for last year.  Deputies are aware that the Government, immediately on taking office, considered it advisable that there should be an immediate investigation of the whole field of transport and they entrusted this task to Sir James Milne, who brought into the inquiry experts in various branches of transport.  I want again to acknowledge my indebtedness, and that of the Government, to Sir James Milne and his colleagues for the very valuable and comprehensive report which they submitted in such a remarkably short space of time.  The decisions of the Government on the main issues have already been announced and legislation will shortly be introduced to set up a public transport authority and to give effect to the other decisions taken by the Government.  The Estimate now before the Dáil contains no financial provision in respect of the services conducted by Córas Iompair Eireann, but opportunity for discussion of those services, and of the proposals of the Government, will be afforded when the Bill to which I have referred is introduced. I do not propose, at this stage, to deal with these aspects of the transport question, but I think that I should inform the House that, because of the critical state of the finances of Córas Iompair Eireann, it was necessary, in accordance with the State guarantee given under Section 18 of the Transport Act, 1944, to issue moneys from the Central Fund in July, 1948, and again in January, 1949, to enable Córas Iompair Eireann to meet the <Col N="2032" /> interest charges falling due in the months mentioned on the State-guaranteed Debentures.  The sum so advanced from the Central Fund amounted in all to £360,145.  The Transport Act of 1944 provides in Section 18 (6) that such advances, with interest, shall be repaid to the Central Fund by the company within 12 months from the dates on which the advances were made.  It seems unlikely that the company will be in a position to repay the advances made in July, 1948, and in January, 1949.  The Transport Act, 1944, provides that, failing repayment by the company the advances must be repaid to the Central Fund out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.  It may be necessary to take a Supplementary Estimate to enable repayment to be made to the Central Fund.</P>
    <P>For grants in respect of harbours the provision for this year at £235,010 shows an increase of £43,010 over the amount voted last year.  Grants will be paid during this year in respect of works which are either in progress or about to be started at Dublin, Cork, Arklow, Tralee and Fenit, Burtonport, Killybegs, Rathmullan and Westport. There are applications before my Department for financial assistance for the development and improvement of 12 other harbours.  The general question of aid in these other cases is at present being considered by the Government. The matter is one of major importance and has to be examined closely, not only by reference to the merits of each individual case, but also in conjunction with other problems concerning transport as a whole. I should point out to the Dáil that even if unlimited funds were made available, progress with harbour development and improvement would be slow.  Equipment and materials, as well as professional and technical personnel, are scarce, and the available resources are taxed to the utmost in connection with the works that are in hand or in train.</P>
    <P>The amount required for aviation and meteorological services for the current year is estimated at £1,142,310 as against a Vote of £1,693,390 taken in the year 1948-49&mdash;a decrease of £551,080 <Col N="2033" /> A substantial part of the decrease is accounted for by a reduction in the provision made for constructional works at the Shannon and Dublin Airports. No necessary work of construction is, however, being neglected and it is the policy to develop these airports so that operations will be facilitated in every possible way.  The major works at the two airports have almost all been completed, but there are some items of which mention should be made.  A third hangar is being constructed at the Dublin Airport and will meet a long-felt need.  The work was held up through difficulty in obtaining the substantial quantity of structural steel which is required, but this difficulty has now been overcome and the work is going ahead.  A new radio building at Ballygirreen, County Clare, near the Shannon Airport is in course of construction and at the airport itself work is proceeding on the erection of a fire station and in the replacement of the control tower which was destroyed by fire a year ago.  From now onwards, the amount required for construction work for airports should be diminishing.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus continue to operate our air services with the efficiency, regularity and regard for safety which have characterised the activities of the company since it was inaugurated.  The company are making every effort to reduce the demands on the Exchequer for subsidy and, in an endeavour to increase traffic, fares have been reduced and special mid-week excursion rates introduced.  Because of a falling-off in traffic, due in large part to exchange restrictions, the service from Dublin to Brussels was suspended in June 1948, and, because of an insufficiency of traffic, the direct Aer Lingus service from Shannon to London was suspended last April.  An Aer Lingus link between Shannon and London is provided through Dublin.  The company have started a service from Dublin to Birmingham and another new service from Dublin to the Channel Islands will be operated during the summer months.  Notwithstanding the economies which the company have introduced, losses are still being incurred and the Estimate for this year included a sum <Col N="2034" /> in respect of subsidy for the year of £69,000.  The amount actually provided in the Estimate this year for subsidy is £300,000, but this includes arrears of subsidy in respect of earlier years.  By Section 19 of the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1946, the subsidies payable were limited to a total of £750,000. The limit was reached in March 1948, and though provision for further subsidy payments was made in the Votes for each of the last two years, the full payments could not be made because the legal limit had been passed.  I propose, during the course of this financial year, to introduce a Bill which will provide, among other matters, for an extension in the amount which may be paid in subsidy, so that issues may be made from the Vote not only in respect of the current year, but also in respect of arrears due for earlier years.</P>
    <P>There are many services administered by my Department of which I have made no mention, not because they are unimportant, but merely for the reason that a reference to them all would entail an unduly long opening statement.  I will, however, be prepared when replying to the debate to give any information which Deputies may require and to supplement, if necessary, the information given about those services which I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, my Department is in intimate touch with the industrial and trading life of the country and indeed to no small extent with the every-day affairs of the public generally.  I believe that it enjoys the confidence of all with whom it has dealings. During the year just past it had to contend with many formidable problems.  Some of these have now been solved; that those which still remain have not also been brought to solution is not the fault of the officers of my Department who continue to give very considerable help and guidance to our people in tackling the difficulties which still beset us.</P>
    <P>Although emergency conditions are gradually disappearing, I have no doubt that the year on which we have entered will call for sustained effort by all sections of our people if we are to see the early return of normality in our daily life.  While very substantial <Col N="2035" /> progress has been made during the year, a reading of the economic chart shows that there is no reason for complacency.  Only by the wholehearted co-operation of all groups, manufacturers, traders, workers in every sphere of activity, can we hope to raise the country's output to a degree sufficient to redress our unfavourable trade and payments balances and to enable our people to enjoy at home that standard of living to which they aspire.  Each individual can further his own and the country's interests by working harder.  The services administered by the Department of Industry and Commerce will be at the disposal of everyone to whom they may be of assistance in devising and operating schemes for increasing output and ensuring the betterment of our people.</P>
    <P>Ireland has now, in my opinion, the greatest opportunity it ever had of material advancement.  There is, however, no time to waste, and I would ask the Dáil to approach the consideration of the Estimate in the realisation that although much has been done to improve the conditions of our people, much still remains to be done&mdash;and done urgently.  It is in this spirit that I come to the House for the funds necessary to defray, up to the 31st March, 1950, the cost of the various services for which I have responsibility.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that the Minister's reaction to criticism will be less hysterical than that of his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture.  It is a comfort to realise, when proceeding to criticise the work of the Department of Industry and Commerce, that one is dealing with a Minister who does not regard himself as the greatest man in the world.  The normal functioning of democracy is based on the theory that no man is perfect, and that the work of any Minister or of any Department of <Col N="2036" /> Government can be improved by criticism.  We propose to exercise our right and to discharge our function here by criticising the Department of Industry and Commerce as last week we criticised the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister and his Department are open to a great deal of criticism.  I am sure he must be aware of the fact that there is a common complaint amongst the business community that the policy of his Department has been inadequately defined, and that when it is applied, if at all, it is in a dilatory and hesitant manner. No Department of Government can function effectively unless there is a clearly defined policy and prompt and clear Ministerial decisions in accordance with that policy on specific matters as they arise.  The absence of a clearly defined policy, or difficulty in getting prompt and clear decisions, leads to futility.</P>
    <P>There was some time ago a popular song about a musical instrument that, I think, is called the tuba which referred to the music going around and around and coming out through the horn.  The impression that one gets of the Department of Industry and Commerce is of an organisation in which ideas, suggestions and proposals are going around and around continuously and coming out nowhere.  I am anxious to try and get from the Minister to-day some more specific indication as to when all the things which he has announced his intention of doing will be executed.  Up to the present we have had vague and general statements of future intentions and no action.  The Minister has made an extraordinarily large number of speeches during the year at various functions, social and otherwise, and with the sentiments expressed in these speeches very little objection can be taken.  The work of the Department of Industry and Commerce, however, will not be executed by good intentions.  Our main criticism of the Department is that these declarations and intentions, these general sentiments with which we agree, have not been followed by effective action.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2037" /> The Minister, in the concluding portion of his remarks in introducing the Estimate to-day said that there is &ldquo;no time to waste&rdquo;.  I wish he could order that a notice containing these words, &ldquo;No time to waste&rdquo;, could be printed and posted in every office of the Department, and that he might be able to spare a few for other Departments as well.  I think it would help them and the Dáil to realise the situation with which the country is dealing and the work which the Department of Industry and Commerce has to do in relation to that situation if we made these four words our slogan, &ldquo;No time to waste.&rdquo;  A great deal of time has been wasted.  That is our main complaint. These announcements of the Minister concerning decisions of the Government or of himself to do particular things have not been followed by action, and, because they have not been followed by action, they have themselves been the cause of a waste of time and of missed opportunities.</P>
    <P>I have referred repeatedly to the announcement made last February of the intention to establish an industrial advisory authority.  If the Minister was not in a position to proceed at once with the constitution of that authority and with a delimitation of its powers and functions, the announcement of the intention to set it up should not have been made.  He informed us here to-day that this authority will have the fullest possible independence of his Department. The fact that it is to be independent of his Department, and that apparently the Department will act generally in accordance with its advice, while no intimation has yet been given as to what its powers are to be, means that no one will take a chance in industrial development until that position has been clarified.  It may be that, by contact with officers of the Department or with the Minister, particular industrial promoters may get positive assurances of co-operative action, but over the whole field of industry the tendency will be to mark time because it is known that this authority is to be set up, but it is not known what its powers are going to be since the statute defining its powers has not been forthcoming.</P>
    <P>The Minister said just now that he <Col N="2038" /> is going to set up the authority in advance of legislation.  For the life of me I cannot see what good that will do.  The public know that the authority is going to be set up, and they know the members to be appointed to it, unless there has been any change since the announcement was made, but they do not know what its powers are going to be.  It seems to me that that body functioning without defined powers and without the public having knowledge of its intended powers can achieve no results whatever. I want to be quite clear in expressing my opinion that it was a mistake to decide to set it up at all.  I think that it will constitute merely a fifth wheel of the coach, a wheel with a permanent brake on it, or another twist in the tuba in which everything will keep on going round and round.  It is open to the Minister, if he wants to do it, to shift responsibility from his own shoulders on to the advisory body and to place himself in the position <i>vis a vis</i> the advisory body that he will act on their advice and fail to act if their advice is not forthcoming.  I think that our circumstances are such that the work which it is contemplated this advisory authority should do could be far more efficiently and expeditiously done by the Department of Industry and Commerce, which has been discharging it up to the present.</P>
    <P>Whatever criticism the Minister or his colleagues may have to make about the administration of that Department before, or about the policy of the previous Government, the very figures which he read out here to-day established beyond all doubt that we were working in the right direction.  Industrial development had ceased completely when the Fianna Fáil Government came into office in 1932.  We got it going.  We had many controversies here as to the practicability or desirability of doing it, but there is no doubt that by 1939 such progress had been made that everyone had become converted to the idea of stimulating industrial development by Government action, and when the difficulties caused by the war passed it went ahead by leaps and bounds.</P>
    <P>Long before the shortages of fuel and <Col N="2039" /> materials caused by the war had disappeared, our industrial production had risen above pre-war level, and it is still rising.  I hope it is not rising because of the operation of the law of inertia, the law that bodies in motion tend to remain in motion, and that there is some other motive power behind the present progress.  Whatever was done to promote and encourage industrial progress before was done in the Department of Industry and Commerce, was done without any national industrial advisory authority, and even though some mistakes may have been made and precipitate action may have been taken, in my view it was far more desirable that we should encourage precipitate action rather than have a delaying organisation for the investigation of everything before a decision would be made.</P>
    <P>My experience has been&mdash;and I think there has been no case which would tend to cast doubt upon the conclusion I arrived at&mdash;that the setting up of committees or investigating authorities to inquire fully into particular industrial propositions is no more an insurance against error, or an assurance of sound planning than the ordinary investigation carried out by Departmental officials.  In fact, in relation to particular matters like the development of sulphate of ammonia, where there was an inter-Departmental committee, we lost a number of years, missed the tide completely, and were no wiser as a result of the work of the committee than if we went ahead with the establishment of the industry without the aid of such committee.</P>
    <P>The Minister has, however, decided to set up an industrial authority.  My advice to him is to go ahead with it as quickly as possible; even though it may be an impediment or, at best, of no value, the present position is completely unsatisfactory.  Months have elapsed since he announced his intention to create it and there is yet no sign of that authority coming into existence.  The same criticism applies to the other matters to which the Minister referred.  In connection with plans for the activities of Bord na Móna, plans matured by the board in 1947, <Col N="2040" /> the original adverse reaction of the Minister last year meant that the whole of last year was lost in the execution of these plans.  Later in the year, after the Minister had investigated the position and visited the works of Bord na Móna, he became, as I knew he would, enthusiastic about its prospects and he announced that not merely was the original development plan being proceeded with, but that the present Government had decided to approve the extension of that plan which had been approved by the previous Government in the previous year.</P>
    <P>That decision was welcomed.  It was made six months ago.  If action had been taken then the necessary legislation could have been passed and the board could have been proceeding to some extent with the preparations for the execution of that plan this year. I am warning the Minister that if he does not introduce legislation within the next few weeks he will miss next year also.  The turf production season is a limited one, beginning about March and ending in July.  Turf can only be won satisfactorily in that period.  It may be saved at other periods of the year, but turf cut later than July or August is of poor quality, even where machines are involved.  If the Minister is not to miss next year as well as this year he must introduce his legislation soon.  The board requires legislation even to proceed with its first limited development plan, apart from getting the necessary authority and the finances to proceed with the second plan.</P>
    <P>I was relieved to hear the Minister's announcement concerning mineral development. It was one of the matters to which I had intended to refer as apparently indicating unnecessary delay in the Department.  The first decision of the present Government was to stop mineral development. Re-examination of the position showed that that decision was wrong and the announcement came that they are going to go ahead with the exploration of the Avoca area on a limited scale.  Nothing, however, has been done.  The Minister said there was some delay about title, and work would start soon.  I am not satisfied <Col N="2041" /> with the intimation that the work is based upon expert advice.  I doubt if there was competent expert advice that a thoroughly satisfactory exploration of the mineral resources can be done within the financial limit of £120,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Will it relieve the Deputy's mind if I tell him that I satisfied myself by consulting the experts that he himself consulted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That relieves my mind to some extent, but my experience has been this, that every geologist is so enthusiastic about getting investigation work done that he will settle for anything if he cannot get more and nobody will ever be satisfied with the result of work done in any area so long as there is anything left undone.  That is particularly true if the investigation has a negative result.  There will always be the interested party who says: &ldquo;You did not go far enough; you stopped a yard or 100 yards short&rdquo;.  I doubt if the Minister will succeed in limiting the cost of investigation to the £120,000 be mentioned, unless he hits what the old-time miners would call pay dirt very early in his investigation.</P>
      <P>We were informed that there was to be a national industrial advisory authority set up by legislation to be introduced soon; that Bord na Móna is to be authorised to proceed with an enlargement of its production activities by legislation which would come soon, and that the mineral investigation is to proceed as soon as certain legal difficulties are cleared up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will turn now to transport.  The Minister said that the decisions of the Government on the main issues had already been announced.  They have not&mdash;at least, in my view they have not.  There may be a difference of opinion as to what constitutes the main issues.  May I remind the Minister in that regard of the position as it is known to the public?  In the course of 1947 the wages cost of operating the transport services of Córas Iompair Eireann were increased and the fuel costs also increased, so that in 1948 it was quite obvious that, apart altogether from the possibility of a repetition of the exceptional difficulties <Col N="2042" /> which had affected the company in 1947, the revenue which would be earned in 1948 on the basis of carrying the same traffic at the same rates of charge would be inadequate to defray its cost.  The Minister was informed of that fact by the board of the company early in 1948.  He said that he was not prepared then to take any decisions affecting the company or the charges of the company until he had an expert report on the situation generally; and, later in the year, Sir James Milne was appointed and his report was published shortly before Christmas. Nothing was done by the Minister pending the production of Sir James Milne's report.  Subsequent to the publication of that report, certain announcements were made.</P>
    <P>It was announced that Córas Iompair Eireann would be acquired by the Government on the basis of buying out the private shareholders and that legislation, having other consequences for Córas Iompair Eireann, would be introduced. So far as the public know, the only decisions which the Government have taken are to nationalise the undertaking, which has, in relation to Córas Iompair Éireann, no other consequence except an alteration in the method of electing directors, and to announce the terms of the compensation to be paid to the stockholders.  These matters do not affect the transport problem of this country at all and, if the Government has proposals to make relating to that transport problem, they have not yet been announced.  Again, I emphasise that the delay in coming to decisions and announcing these decisions is having very serious consequences.</P>
    <P>There are many necessary developments of our transport system which could be taking place now, or could, at least, be commenced now, which are being delayed because everybody knows there is going to be a change; legislation is to be forthcoming and, subsequent to legislation, there is to be a new type of board of directors.</P>
    <P>Let me give an illustration of what I have in mind.  I was in Limerick on last Saturday.  My previous visit to Limerick, apart from a lightning raid during the general election, was in <Col N="2043" /> 1947.  On that occasion I was concerned with two specific things: one was&mdash;I will refer to it later&mdash;an extension to the cement factory there and the other was an extension of railway facilities to Limerick Port.  I do not know whether the Minister shares my view that it is desirable that we should expand the secondary ports and harbours of the country and endeavour, if possible, to develop trade to them. In the case of Limerick, the main impediment to the development of that port, apart from the deepening of the channel, is the lack of a railway connection. In 1947 it seemed that that port was going to be facilitated by the need for the construction of railway facilities for the cement factory, which is on the same side of Limerick Port as the railway connection would obviously have to be located.  Nothing has been done since, and the Limerick harbour authorities have been told that nothing can be done until legislation is introduced.  It may be that there are other difficulties.  I do not know.  The specific reason given to Limerick harbour authorities why work on the construction of that railway extension &mdash; which I had hoped to see inaugurated last year&mdash;has not begun is because of the pending changes in the system of control of our transport organisation. May I ask if the Minister would give us information as to the specific projects which were under way when he acquired responsibility?  I notice, in the course of a speech delivered to a Fine Gael convention in County Donegal last week, the Minister for Finance said in relation to this matter:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We decided to cut out the extravagance in the main transport concern of the country, but in that we were certainly put into office a year too late.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I do not know what the Minister for Finance meant there.  So far as the public is aware, no alteration has been made in the methods of management of Córas Iompair Éireann which could possibly be described as the cutting out of extravagance.  In fact, it is well known that during the course of last year the Minister directly and specifically instructed the company that they were not to make any changes affecting staff or the extent of their operations until the Milne report was available.  The specific matters dealt with in the Milne report related to capital expenditure and it is in regard to these matters that I am anxious to get information. There appears to be some misunderstanding in this regard.  The Minister for External Affairs intervened in an earlier debate this year to refer to the construction of the central offices and bus station at Store Street and he did so in a manner which appeared to convey that he thought that the cost of that building was a charge upon the company's revenue.  It is a charge upon its capital and, according to the company itself, the effect of the construction of these central offices will be to reduce its outgoings and consequently contribute to reducing the gap between its revenue and expenditure.  What is the position in regard to that station?  Apparently, work has stopped on it.  Is that so?  If that is so, I am satisfied because&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a matter for the transport authority.  So far as Córas Iompair Éireann is concerned, they got full authority for the present location from the Dublin Corporation, the Garda Síochána and the Department of Local Government.  They were, so far as I know, prepared to locate the station anywhere the traffic authorities approved, and they approved of that site.  The location of central offices there is not merely likely to result in considerable decreases in the administration cost of the company's organisation, but will, according to their constitution, make other substantial savings because the interest upon the capital invested in that building will be less than they are now paying in rent, rates and taxes upon five premises throughout the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>That, of course, was the opinion under the original estimate. The capital cost is now going to be at least double that original estimate.</P>

    <Col N="2046" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I still think that statement is true.  Let us take some of the other matters mentioned in the Milne report, apart from that central bus-station. There is the new chassis factory at Inchicore, the new body building shop and the new spring shop, plus a new wharf at Waterford.  There was a reference to a plan for the reconstruction of Limerick Junction Station, which is certainly necessary, but it appears that the particular plan which Sir James Milne saw had never been seen by the Córas Iompair Éireann Board, much less approved of by them.  What is the position concerning this factory?  May I say this is a project in which I am personally very interested.  I have always felt-that any industrial plan of this country ought to have somewhere in it the establishment of a properly-equipped general engineering shop.  I have always felt that, in the circumstances of our State. We could not get that done unless we could relate it to the railway undertaking.  The development of road services seems to make possible the establishment of the manufacture of chassis for omnibuses and lorries but, clearly, if that manufacture is to be undertaken, it must be in some way related to Córas Iompair Éireann, because by far the biggest purchaser of chassis from any such manufacturer will be Córas Iompair Éireann, and if it could be related to Córas Iompair Éireann it could be used as the basis of a general engineering industry. Again I ask : is there any truth in the report that work on that particular project has been suspended?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>It certainly has.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter on which differences of opinion will exist, but may I say that even Sir James Milne did not recommend that?  He did argue that we could possibly buy chassis cheaper from Britain because the wages to be paid to the works staff were higher here than in Great Britain.  He said that the scheme could not be regarded as an essential adjunct to an efficient transport system.  He was thinking, of course, with the mind of a man who has gained all his experience <Col N="2047" /> in Britain, which is a great industrial State and which, naturally, does not have to consider the problems which arise for a small country like this, which cannot establish these industries at all except by methods which would be regarded as unnecessary in Britain.  His recommendation is based on a theoretical objection to associating it with Córas Iompair Éireann rather than setting it up as a separate organisation.  If that project has been dropped I think our industrial progress has suffered a major reverse. The same remarks apply to the new spring shop and the new bodybuilding shop.</P>
      <P>May I express one view which I think it is important should be expressed in relation to the matter of transport?  The primary obligation of Córas Iompair Éireann, and it should be our primary concern also, is to ensure that our country is properly equipped with a thoroughly efficient transport system, one which is designed to assist and encourage the nation's economic progress.  There is no doubt that we have not that yet.  These aims are more important than devising patchwork methods to keep the existing organisation running on some basis which will avoid imposing a charge on the Exchequer.  Certainly if I had thought that the management of Córas Iompair Éireann was planning the future development of that undertaking, upon the patchwork basis which Sir James Milne had in mind, I would have tried to have ensured some alteration in the position which would have taken into account these wider aims of transport policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister intends to make any pronouncement on the subject of branch lines.  It is a matter which was frequently discussed here in the past and most Deputies opposite had entered into specific commitments with constituents regarding particular lines.  There are, in Sir James Milne's report, some ambiguous references to this matter and a statement of policy with which I do not disagree.  He did, however, go further than I would have thought wise regarding some branch lines, where it might be decided, following a public inquiry, <Col N="2048" /> that it was undesirable to keep them open.  In paragraph 231 of the report he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In all the circumstances, it is considered that any proposal to close branch lines solely on the grounds that they are at present unprofitable should be rejected.  It is recommended that before any branch line is closed there should be a public inquiry and that the governing consideration should be whether the retention of the branch as part of the country's highways system is necessary or desirable in the public interest.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is my view and it is a view which I repeatedly expressed here.  I hold that view for the reason which Sir James Milne expressed in an earlier paragraph, paragraph 225, where he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is also important to remember that railway charges are not fixed on the economic cost of providing the services required on each different section of line.  They are uniform charges which apply over the whole system and are fixed at a level which, as far as practicable will yield, together with other sources of revenue, sufficient income to cover all expenditure and provide a reasonable return on the capital invested in the undertaking.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Later on he recommended that where a public inquiry had shown that there was no case for keeping a branch line open, nevertheless, it should be kept open, subject to the adoption of his proposal concerning the establishment of a highways authority, if local interests demanded it and if the local county council was prepared to contribute to the cost.  I think it would be a tremendous mistake to get back under any circumstances to anything like the old baronial guarantee system. The position concerning these branch lines is one on which it is desirable that some pronouncement of policy should be made because many of the lines which are now closed were operating in 1946 and were closed in 1947 because of the fuel scarcity.  They have been kept closed since.  It is impossible to explain to local interests concerned <Col N="2049" /> about those lines why that should be so, except that they are being kept closed in accordance with some definite policy.  It may be that the Minister is awaiting the new legislation before making any pronouncement in regard to the branch lines but if, as some declarations by the Minister's supporters would suggest, it has been decided to reopen and keep open these branch lines or the majority of them, then there seems to be no reason why it should not be done now.</P>
    <P>I have a few observations to make regarding industry in general and I shall try to make them as brief as I can.  We have to consider whether we are going to allow industry to develop on the basis that the Department of Industry and Commerce or this new industrial advisory authority will sit down and wait until some interested parties come to them with proposals for particular industrial projects which they are prepared to finance and out of which they want to make a profit, or whether we are going to plan industrial development upon desirable lines and then vigorously proceed to get that plan carried into effect.  At the present time we can, if we desire it, get under the E.C.A. plan, not merely American capital if it is needed, but also American technical advice and help and that possibility created in my mind the idea of examining whether we should not now definitely undertake the integration here of a linen industry. Frankly, this idea came into my mind from certain political discussions which have been proceeding in this country for some weeks past.  Last week we had a discussion on the problem of the flax growers.  I do not propose to deal with that question now except to point out that there is a problem because the flax growers have not a market in this country as there is no linen-spinning plant here and the only possible buyers of the produce of the native flax crop are the gentlemen with the Oxford accents whom Deputy Dillon dislikes so much.  We cannot hope to establish a flax-spinning industry on an economic basis unless we extend the linen-weaving industry.  It is a big task.  I am not denying the magnitude of that task.  It would take a great deal of capital and require <Col N="2050" /> expert technical advice.  It would not only have the advantage, however, of providing a market for the Irish flax, but it would also create the possibility of extending our dollar-earning capacity as the main market for linen goods from the North of Ireland is in the dollar areas.  Taking that particular case, will the industrial advisory authority be enabled to get down to seeing what the problems are and proceed upon that plan and, subject to a decision that the problems can be surmounted, get the work done without waiting for somebody to come along with a proposition?  Will they be able to get after the person with the knowledge, the capital and the resources?</P>

    <P>I should like to refer to a reply given yesterday to a Dáil question with regard to the extension of cement manufacture here.  It is a ridiculous situation.  It was stated discussions are proceeding.  These discussions were started in my time and, as I mentioned, my visit to Limerick in 1947 was partly for the purpose of inspecting the cement factory, which was designed and laid out for double its present capacity.  It may be that the cement company are trying to drive too hard a bargain, but if they are, <Col N="2051" /> you are not tied to them.  It may be true that the most economic method of increasing output is to double the output of the Limerick factory, but if for any reason the company are holding out on that for some advantages, then there should be an investigation of the possibilities of having another cement company.  There is no reason why discussions should go on indefinitely if there is no sign of their leading to a result.</P>

      <P>Next I wish to refer to ship building because in the course of a speech I made some time ago in Dublin I referred to the ship-building industry in Dublin in a way which suggested that the company managements were less interested in developing building activities than they should be.  I want to withdraw that statement without qualification because since I made it I have had contacts with the managements of these concerns and they have convinced me, whatever the difficulties may be, that they were very definitely interested in reviving the ship-building industry in Dublin.  The activities of these companies were directed mainly towards ship repairing during the war.  There were many practical difficulties in undertaking ship building during that period, the main difficulty being the impossibility of procuring importation of engines and similar equipment, apart altogether from the probability that the British authorities would not release steel for that purpose, although they did release steel on Government representations quite generously for ship-repairing work.  In one of the main Dublin yards they assure me that they are not merely anxious to undertake ship-building work, but are confident of their capacity to do it on a competitive basis.  They made it clear that they are not asking at the present time for Government assistance except in the specific matter of making representations to the British authorities for the release of the steel required and they are confident that if these representations are made the steel will be forthcoming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2052" /> We cannot develop&mdash;and I do not think we should try to develop&mdash;a ship-building industry on the Belfast scale. I say that in case my reference to linen should suggest that I had it in mind, but it is important from our point of view to develop a ship-building industry and keep it going, and I have no hesitation in recommending Government assistance for that purpose.  I intimated in public in 1946 or 1947 that the Government of which I was a member was quite prepared to assist it even in the form of a tonnage subsidy. In most countries ship building has been developed with Government assistance. It has been very largely a matter in recent years of breaking in on the monopoly of the British industry and in America, Australia and elsewhere ship-building industries have been established only as a result of positive Government action often involving a direct subsidy, and even at the present time the American Government subsidises various forms of ship building there.  The advantage, apart altogether from having an old industry revived here, is that the skilled workers who are so necessary for ship repairing work and so vital for it during an emergency cannot be retained in the country except the continued employment which ship building involves is assured to them.  The main reason for the excessive anxiety of the managers of the ship-building yards to get orders for ships is because of the fact they are losing their skilled workers without them and I would ask the Minister to direct his attention to that question. It is not merely a matter of getting orders placed by Irish Shipping, Limited. I am anxious to know if Irish Shipping Limited has placed orders for ships apart from those ordered in 1946. If there is to be an extension of the fleet of Irish Shipping, Limited there should be a definite policy to direct orders to Irish shipyards.  In one Dublin yard a ship of 5,000 tons was built in the past&mdash;I think that was the largest built there&mdash;and many of the ships in the development programme of Irish Shipping Limited are of that tonnage or less and could be constructed here.  I am not anxious to penalise Irish Shipping by imposing upon them an additional cost which a <Col N="2053" /> competitor would not have to meet and if it is a case of additional cost it is a matter for the Government to decide whether they should take action to relieve it.  It has, however, been asserted to me by the people who are in the best position to do so that they can construct the ships here on a competitive basis with the British yards provided the same facilities for supplies of steel are made available to them by the British authorities.  A rumour is circulating that Irish Shipping are beginning to lose money.  I hope that the Minister will be able to contradict that rumour.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the tourist industry.  I think it is desirable that the Government's attitude to that industry should be clarified.  The Minister's references to it appear to indicate that he recognises its importance to our economic welfare, but the last occasion he referred to it was, if my memory serves me aright, on the debate here on the motion relating to the curtailment of the road grant, where the Minister said they were not going to provide money to build roads for tourists.  The Minister for Finance, in this Donegal speech of his, also made certain scathing references to the tourist industry.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We decided not to allow the Tourist Board to go ahead with any more purchases of magnificent hotels for which the people were being taxed to provide accommodation below the cost price for strangers who were well enough able to pay for it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That statement, on the face of it, is so obviously untrue that it can be explained only on the basis of prejudice.</P>
    <P>There have been many indications that the minds of Ministers have been prejudiced against this industry.  I read here, in the course of the debate on the Vote on Account, an extract from the broadcast speech by Mr. Taft of the E.C.A. Advisory Mission.  He apparently thought it necessary to speak strongly to the Government, to emphasise to the Government that the Americans regarded it as part of the conditions under which they were getting Marshall Aid that they should take positive action to increase the <Col N="2054" /> country's dollar-earning capacity&mdash;and the most obvious method was the development of facilities for American tourists, concerning which the Government is not merely doing nothing but appears to be moving in the opposite direction.</P>
    <P>So far as I can make out, the Tourist Board as at present constituted, is merely a worm under the Departmental stone: it can do nothing unless the Minister decides to lift the stone once in a while to let it see the daylight. I tried, during my time, to make that board independent both of the Department of Industry and Commerce and of the Department of Finance.  I felt that, if we set up a body of men and gave them responsibility, we should let them get on with the job, holding them responsible only for the results, sacking them if the results were unsatisfactory, but not interfering with day to day administration.  That position does not exist now.  I want to say that I was very much dissatisfied with the failure or inability of the Tourist Board to do what was its main job&mdash;not the running of hotels but the development of amenities at tourist resorts.  They excused their failure to get results in that regard on the ground of inability to get co-operation from local authorities, or the impracticability of proceeding with plans that had been agreed with local authorities, because of scarcity of supplies.</P>
    <P>I feel that a great deal has to be done, and must be done fairly quickly, in the development of our tourist resorts, both for the benefit of our own people as well as for the encouragement of the tourist trade.  Let me say this to the Minister: It is a reasonable assumption that recent political developments, and the comments which those developments have caused in English newspapers, will have a serious effect on our tourist income this year. I do not think there is much we can do about that, but we can hope to make up for the loss in income from one source by trying to increase the income from another.  That can be done only if it is made quite obvious by the Government here and by everybody else here, as it is made obvious by the Governments in Great Britain, Belgium, France and other countries, <Col N="2055" /> that we are aware of the importance of the tourist business and are anxious to develop it and that the whole mind of the country is being directed towards making conditions here such that tourists will want to visit us and spend dollars amongst us.</P>
    <P>I am not going to cover all the matters to which the Minister referred, but there is one more special item with which I wish to deal.  The Minister said yesterday, at a function he attended in Dun Laoghaire, that he was aware of the importance of industrial research.  I wish the replies I had from the Parliamentary Secretary, to certain Dáil questions I put, indicated that that awareness of the importance of industrial research was resulting in some action.  So far as I can see, this Industrial Research Council must be nearly moribund.  Not merely has very little been done, but even the progress in the construction of the laboratory of the institute has been extraordinarily slow.  That may not be the Minister's fault.  Perhaps it is the fault of the Industrial Research Committee itself, or perhaps it is the fault of the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>We cannot develop here industrially on sound lines merely by imitating what somebody has done somewhere else.  We must have a scientific investigation of the possibilities, and particularly of the possibility of adapting processes which have been successfully tried elsewhere to the particular circumstances of this country. That is what the Industrial Research Committee is supposed to do.  I see that they have not even got the laboratory built yet, much less equipped, and that they gave no scholarship last year and spent no <Col N="2056" /> money in helping people who are equipped with laboratories to carry out specific examinations as used to be done before.</P>

      <P>I want to say a few words about hand-won turf.  It is all very well to develop and proceed with plans for machine-won turf, but just right now and for many years ahead, hand-won turf will be an important source of employment and prosperity.  I have been visiting various parts of the country recently and meeting representatives of the hand-won turf producers, all of whom were hoping to get a market for their turf from local authorities and who find that many of those local authorities are turning over to coal or fuel oil, even in the heart of the turf area.  The most recent deputation I met was in Edenderry and they referred to the hospital at Portlaoighise, which formerly took many thousands of tons of hand-won turf from the turf producers' society in the Edenderry area.  The hospital is now working on fuel oil.  I would not allow it.  I think we learned during the war the enormous benefits which hand-won turf meant to many parts of the country, sufficiently to justify us now in imposing restrictions upon local authorities and others charged with the management of institutions in the turf areas, to prohibit them from using anything else but turf.</P>

      <P>They may have some problem of adapting present equipment so as to use turf economically and efficiently.  Give them help to do that. Part of the money devoted to Bord na Móna is to provide technical assistance to those who want to change over their equipment to make it use turf more efficiently.  Also, I think we should keep definitely in mind, as a national objective, an extension of the use of turf as a domestic fuel.  I know&mdash;and everybody else in the House knows&mdash; that the citizens of Dublin and of most of our towns became strongly prejudiced against turf because of the bad turf we got during the emergency.  I met representatives of the Kerry turf producers last year and they were deploring the loss to that county through the decline in the demand.  I felt that I had to tell them it was largely their own fault, because in the production of turf for the national pool many of them had cheated, producing bad turf and very frequently turning a hose upon it in order to get a higher price by increasing its weight.  That prejudice will disappear in time.  It is a natural prejudice, however, and because it exists there can be no suggestion of any measures of compulsion to make people use turf.  Not merely would the public not accept compulsion, but the mere existence of compulsory measures would, I am afraid, encourage producers to think again of resorting to those methods they used during the scarcity years of the war.</P>
      <P>We should have positive propaganda, directed to showing our people the benefit they can confer on themselves if this great natural resource can be developed and we should direct the utilisation of public funds in house building so as to create a market for turf, including hand-won turf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the taxpayers are to be asked to provide money to subsidise houses, it is not unreasonable to suggest that into these houses should go grates and ranges which are designed to use turf efficiently.  It may be that these grates and ranges can be so designed as to use either coal or turf efficiently, but, in many of the households in Dublin <Col N="2058" /> and in most of the towns, the grates and ranges existing now are quite unsuitable for turf usage.  There should also be included in the plans for the erection of these houses proper storage accommodation for turf, which is one of the difficulties in the way of the extension of its use, particularly in Dublin.  I do not want to make more specific suggestions than these, but I urge upon the Government and the Dáil the importance of taking notice of the fact that the disappearance or curtailment of turf production has had an immediate and obvious effect upon the prosperity of a large part of the country.  If we could by any means revive it, whether by propaganda or any other methods, we would be contributing not merely to the welfare of these areas but to the welfare of the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister could give me any indication as to when the Commission on Youth Unemployment is likely to report.  It is rather disappointing that that commission has found it necessary to take so long to prepare its recommendations.  There is a problem there which is becoming more, and not less, acute.  Personally, I am of opinion that our existing legislation for the regulation of apprenticeships is unsatisfactory.  It would be obviously difficult to examine that legislation with a view to its amendment, with the knowledge that a commission is sitting, and the absence of its valuable report is delaying useful action which could be taken in a number of directions.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the statistics branch is to go over to the Department of the Taoiseach.  That means nothing, unless it will involve in due course the giving of more money and more staff to the statistics branch.  I do not know what has happened to that branch in the past year, because, even though it was slow and unsatisfactory before that, it has become still slower and more unsatisfactory since. The 1946 census has not yet resulted, so far as I remember, in any report, except the preliminary report, and the next census will be due, so far as one can judge at present, before the report of the 1946 census is available.  We are <Col N="2059" /> obviously handicapped by the inadequacy of our statistical services.</P>
    <P>In other countries, public policy is being based upon economic surveys and that is possible because economic surveys are not merely reliable but are executed promptly.  I know that, in the United States of America, they were able to publish the economic survey of 1948 within a few weeks of the end of the year.  American economic journals and banks were reporting upon the 1948 position as revealed by public statistics before the end of January.  The British Government had their economic survey for 1948 available in March.  A great many of the statistics contained in these American and British surveys are not available for this country for a year later than 1944.  It is obviously difficult to attempt to frame economic policy, much less seriously discuss it, in view of that dearth of information.</P>
    <P>It does not seem to me to matter whether the statistics branch is located in the Department of Industry and Commerce or the Department of the Taoiseach.  What does matter is the resources made available to the branch and if the change is an indication that it is to get more money and more staff and greater authority to do its work more expeditiously, it is a good change. It could have been done perhaps just as well in the Department of Industry and Commerce, but I agree fully that there are obvious reasons why it should be located in the Department of the Taoiseach.  It has happened in the past that other Ministers felt that the Minister for Industry and Commerce was getting more expeditious service from that branch than they were getting.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister has any intention of promoting legislation in regard to price control.  It is obviously unsatisfactory that the price control administration of the Department should continue to be based upon an emergency Act continued from year to year.  The Minister said that he has warned clothing manufacturers that, if their prices rise following the increase in the duty, he will withdraw their protection entirely.  Do not let him <Col N="2060" /> fool himself&mdash;he is not fooling them. Does he not realise that that is the whole problem of price control?  There was many a time I felt that some manufacturer enjoying the benefit of protection from the State was not giving the service, in quality or price, which the public were entitled to expect; but a decision to withdraw that protection entirely was one which would hit not merely the manufacturer concerned but several hundred or thousand workers as well.  The Minister may make that declaration now and even intend to carry it out now, but, when the time comes, if there is an increase in clothing prices and he has to face this decision to withdraw protection entirely, and he learns that 5,000 or 6,000 workers are going to be disemployed, he will hesitate about doing it.  The whole problem of price control is that the one weapon the Minister has to use now, of withdrawing protection, is so disastrous in its effect that it cannot be used at all, except in extraordinary circumstances.</P>
    <P>The problem I was trying to solve in that Industrial Prices and Efficiency Act was that of finding some method by which sanctions could be applied to manufacturers enjoying protection but not acting fairly by the community which did not involve the withdrawal of protection entirely, the stoppage of work in the industry and the disemployment of its workers.  The Minister in fact gave an illustration of the futility of that method of control when he referred to the boot and shoe industry.  Deputies will readily forget now that, all during 1946 and 1947, there was a continuous wail of complaint by Opposition Deputies that the price of boots was altogether too high, and I am quite sure that if many of the Deputies opposite who are even now discussing the effect upon the boot and shoe industry of quota imports in 1947 look back on their speeches in 1947, they will find that one of their main topics was the unduly high price of boots.  We tried to remedy that situation by ensuring that there would be no scarcity.</P>
    <P>The particular system of protection which applies to the boot and shoe industry permits of the quantitative regulation of imports and consequently <Col N="2061" /> it was possible to operate it so as to prevent any artificial inflation of prices by making sure that there would be no scarcity.  That was the policy which led to the high quota figures of those two years.  It is quite obvious from the complaints which resulted, of disemployment or disorganised conditions in the industry, that even that partial application of the principle with which the Minister is now threatening the clothing industry is bound to create difficulties, and I mean political difficulties, for the Government in office.</P>
    <P>The system of price control which operated during the war and before the war was by no means perfect.  I do not pretend it was, but we learned a great deal from our experience in these periods, and I would strongly advise the Minister to re-examine that industrial prices and efficiency legislation because we will find in its provisions the result of much of that experience and some useful suggestions as to how an effective system of price control can be established, one which depends upon sanctions which can be used and not upon sanctions which can only be threatened and never used.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister can get rid of that.  He can go back to the Bill which passed its Second Reading in 1947, take out of it the portions relating to price control which appear to him to be effective and bring it forward again.  We promise a quick passage for the measure.  I do not believe that there is amongst the ordinary public a prejudice against Irish manufactured goods.  I think there is a prejudice amongst traders and traders' buying representatives&mdash;a prejudice which may <Col N="2062" /> not be based upon anything else except the desire of each firm to have on sale in its store something that no other store has.  The whole problem of Irish industry is that the varieties of quality and design available to traders are necessarily restricted and the desire to have something exclusive, something purchased from an English manufacturer in the knowledge that no other Irish trader will have it, explains the hostility to industrial development which is sometimes to be found amongst the representatives of traders and their buyers.</P>
      <P>The Minister will get, perhaps, a false picture from these people when discussing the problem with them because I do not think that any Deputy can say that there is, beyond that class, amongst the general public a prejudice against Irish goods as such.  There will be criticism of Irish goods if quality is defective but there certainly does not exist a prejudice in the true meaning of that term which will deter people from buying Irish goods even when quality is satisfactory.</P>

      <P>Certainly, it has been the lesson of all the years since 1922 that you can do nothing in expanding the market for Irish products by reliance upon propaganda of that kind. That propaganda must be backed by action by the State to restrict imports, quantitatively or otherwise, in order to create the market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a number of other matters that I will not refer to.  I have spoken too long.  I hope the Minister will deal with these matters when he is replying. I hope he will realise that the suggestions I have put forward here are put forward in the knowledge that time is important, that there is truth in his assertion that we have no time to waste and that, so long as political conditions are as they are, and he is there and I am here, I can only get results in the direction that I want to see them by urging action by him along what I think to be the right lines. Every course of action that I have recommended <Col N="2063" /> here has sound arguments behind it but, whether we are to proceed as I have indicated or not, depends entirely upon the Minister.  I hope I have convinced him that it is worth doing and worth doing soon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Frankly, I am somewhat disappointed at the Minister's speech in moving the Vote because on the occasion last year that we met for a similar purpose there was a great deal of justification in the sense that the Minister, as he explained at that time, had to pick up a number of problems that had been left to him and try to clear away the debris.  Nearly 12 months have passed since that time and by now we should be in a position to expect from the Minister and the Government a somewhat clearer and, if I may use the word, a more planned programme for the kind of problems that we have.  I feel that the Minister's speech has been mainly recapitulation of matters which are largely departmental and in no sense have we had an all-round approach to the problems facing us at the moment.</P>
      <P>I find some difficulty in following Deputy Lemass along his particular line.  On the one hand he does not seem to like the suggestion for the establishment of an industrial authority.  A few moments later he spoke of planning and he said that, the plans having been decided, they should be pursued vigorously.  I am quite aware that to many members of his own Party and his colleagues on the Front Bench the word &ldquo;plan&rdquo; is unpalatable. They do not like it.  That seems to me an indication of their complete lack of ordinary common-sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know that any man or woman can go through life without a plan.  Even the housewife has to plan to deal with the day-to-day domestic problems.  It is time that we got rid of this folly that there is something sinister attached to the words &ldquo;plan&rdquo; and &ldquo;planning.&rdquo;  It reminds me of another famous gentleman who said that when the word &ldquo;culture&rdquo; was used somebody wanted to draw a gun. There is nothing wrong with the idea of planning.  It is an ordinary sensible thing to do.  My difference, if there is <Col N="2064" /> a difference, at the moment with the Minister and the Cabinet is that they are failing to plan or to sit down and try to plan.  I know the difficulties of doing it under existing circumstances and in view of the fact that Deputy Lemass indicated that there is a great lack of up-to-date information in the country.  Whether we like it or not, we have either to plan or to put up with the consequences of not planning. Not planning means failure to use our ordinary common-sense and apply it to our problems.  That is why I was particularly glad when I heard the announcement of the establishment of the industrial development authority, and I do not take the view that Deputy Lemass takes that it is merely a question of passing over part of the responsibility to a committee which, like many other committees, will be buried and never see the light of day. I personally believe that the Department of Industry and Commerce in the minds of most people in this country is the linchpin in the whole of Government activity.  Government activity related to economic, industrial and social progress is such that it is not only unfair but it is impossible to expect one individual to be able to carry that responsibility and to meet the day-to-day problems.  Deputy Lemass says that no man knows all the answers.  I do not believe that Deputy Lemass knew all the answers when he was Minister.  I do not believe that the present Minister knows all the answers. Part of our difficulty is in one or two individuals trying to supply the answers instead of trying to collect as far as possible the general store of wisdom on the particular problems.</P>
    <P>I am sorry the industrial development authority is not in existence to-day. It is nearly three months since we had the announcement in the daily Press that a certain number of individuals were invited and had accepted membership of this authority.  Three months have passed.  We still do not know when they are going to take office or to take up their duties.  I do not know what the delay is.  There may be some explanation of the difficulty, if any, that has arisen.  Quite clearly, if we are going to deal with the kind of problems that have been <Col N="2065" /> raised by the Minister and by Deputy Lemass, somebody must be able to sit down, free from the ordinary cares, worries and responsibilities of a very large Department, and consider the picture from an all-round point of view and try to see where the various pieces fit together and, having regard to the available resources, the natural resources, manpower, financial resources and the particular needs that we decide are the proper needs to meet in relation to our community, to try to plan a little of the road ahead that we are to follow.  I do not believe an individual Minister can do that and at the same time discharge, as Ministers must, the ordinary day-to-day routine responsibility of a large Department. At the same time I welcome the idea of the industrial authority.  I feel there is a great lack of clarity and, to some extent, it is being diverted from its main purpose.  It is quite a sound suggestion that, in so far as we have utilised the method of protective tariffs that will protect our industries, we should have some means of reviewing the effectiveness of these tariffs and, more particularly, the use made by industrialists of that protection. Further, as new tariffs are sought or as from time to time we feel old tariffs require reconsideration and revision there should be a body to give thought to these particular subjects. However, tariffs in themselves, in so far as they are a day-to-day piece of machinery, are not the important thing at the moment.</P>
    <P>The important thing is to see to the weaknesses in our economic set-up.  We should study them not only in relation to our own needs and not only in relation to a share in an export market which may be rapidly dwindling and which, in the Minister's words, may be a question of time, but to try to deal with our economic problems in a situation where, possibly, every day we are coming nearer to a general world economic slump.  Nobody yet seems to have made up his mind that we are on the verge of retrogression or a slump or a crisis, but everybody is agreed that this question is going to become keener and more intense.  If we are to base our future economic welfare on our ability to get into that market in <Col N="2066" /> present conditions, and are not in a position to meet the repercussions of any economic retrogression that takes place internationally, then we are going to find ourselves in very difficult circumstances in this country.  I believe a great deal of our salvation is to be found in our own country.  While I want to pay a tribute to Deputy Lemass and to his Party in so far as they did initiate an industrial drive that brought us certain advantages and certain progress I differ from him fundamentally in the sense that that drive was to a large extent lop-sided. We overlooked one important factor. There is no use in building up industries and in producing goods unless we provide our people with the wherewithal to buy them.  The difficulty was that, alongside that industrial drive which we witnessed in 1932, we had another set of circumstances operating which left a great deal of those industries on a low wage basis&mdash;a basis that was related to the most backward of our industries, agriculture, which enjoyed the lowest standard of life among our people&mdash;and that we failed to realise that, as we built up those industries, we must of necessity provide consumers for the products.  They must be in a position to buy the goods produced and always to have a little more buying power than the industries are immediately able to take up.  We do not seem to be able to strike that happy balance.  We have seen the results in the difficulties to-day in the boot and shoe industry and also, I think, in the clothing trade and other industries set up in that period.  It is for these reasons that I think the proposal to set up an industrial development authority is a sound idea.  I have not and I do not think I have ever had any occasion to get up in this House and criticise civil servants merely because they are civil servants.  We make the conditions under which those people have to carry out their work. We determine the responsibilities to be placed on Ministers and those over whom we exercise authority.  If we are not satisfied with the results we should change the system.  I think it is clear that it is an impossible feat to expect civil servants, within the environment in which they are expected <Col N="2067" /> to work, to take on the problem that lies to hand and that can only be dealt with by men with a fairly broad experience. They need not be technical experts on our economic and social life but they must be men with a broad experience of the different aspects who will look at the picture from an all-round point of view.  If they want expert advice they can get it.  Experts can be picked up for two a penny if you are prepared to ask for their advice.  I think, however, that experts have never been able to give a complete answer.  They can answer on a particular subject but there is always the difficulty of relating their expert knowledge and fitting it into the picture. That is why I think that men and women with a broad approach to this problem would be better equipped to deal with it and to tackle it on a broad national basis.</P>
    <P>I would press the Minister, therefore, to tell the House when he is replying why it is that even now, after three months, we have not the authority in operation.  He should also let us know a little more clearly the particular powers it is hoped to give that authority, even if it does mean waiting some time to give it statutory effect, and the manner in which the authority is going to work in so far as his Ministerial authority and his Department are concerned. Quite clearly it would be absolutely useless to have an authority of this kind if it is going to be an expansion of the Department of Industry and Commerce or if it is going to be, even in the slightest degree, subject to the Department of Finance.  That is one shackle we shall have to get rid of if it is going to make progress.  Even if it is going to mean a political crisis amongst those who support the inter-Party Government, it should be made quite clear that in so far as the welfare of our people is concerned this policy has to be decided and given effect to by those who represent the people and not by those who are paid to carry out the orders.  I feel that, on this question, we are entitled to some further enlightenment by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Shortly before the setting up of the authority was announced, and speaking <Col N="2068" /> in another place, I referred to the fact that our unemployed had reached a figure of 80,000.  I said then and I think most Deputies will agree with me that 80,000 unemployed in our country is a red light&mdash;a warning signal.  Since then the figure has gone up to 84,000.  Three months ago, realising the problems that faced us, we decided to set up this authority.  We have now allowed three months to elapse and we have another 4,000 unemployed on the list.  The problem is all the keener and the need for getting this new machinery operating is more urgent than ever.  I would press the Minister to tell us if he has any difficulties.  I am quite sure that even though Deputy Lemass, speaking for his Party, is not quite convinced of the soundness of a particular policy leading to the establishment of this authority, all sections of the House will support the Minister in taking any steps which he may consider necessary&mdash;even though we may not believe it is the best way of getting something done.</P>
    <P>One big thing that I think does call for comment is that we are having a continuous spate of speeches by public representatives, spokesmen of employers and other interests, urging the need for increased production.  Everybody seems to enjoy that particular form of diversion at the present time. At the same time they forget, as the figures read by the Minister show, that we are getting increased production. The latest advice we have from the Minister is that the only salvation for our people is to work hard.  I personally feel that if that is the only advice we have to give to our people to get us out of our present difficulties we will not make much headway.  I have fairly good knowledge of the working classes in this country and I think that, on the whole, they are worked fairly hard.  At least if they do not work as hard as they should they have to be pretty good in getting by.  It is not their job to lay down standards in an industry&mdash;either in regard to their work or to the output of the industry.  There are gentlemen who claim that privilege.</P>
    <P>Only a short while ago we were told by some spokesmen that in so far as the workers are concerned they had <Col N="2069" /> better keep their noses out of the Board of Management of industry&mdash; that it was no concern of theirs and that they are not to be allowed in. We cannot make appeals to workers in industry to work hard, to increase production and output, and at the same time tell them that they have no right to recommend or decide policy in regard to the management of the industries&mdash;either in regard to the running of the industries or in regard to the division of the proceeds of the industries.  We have to make up our minds one way or the other.  If we are to have private enterprise and every man for himself and the devil take the hindmost, let us have it and know where we are.  Let us not at the same time, however, make patriotic appeals to certain sections of our people who will get the least advantage from it and ask them to make the biggest sacrifice.</P>
    <P>The Trade Union Congress discussed this question of increased productivity some time ago and what organised workers could do in the matter.  Let me say immediately that, so far as the trade union movement and the masses of the working classes of the people are concerned, we have no desire to shirk responsibility.  We want to assume more responsibility and we cannot assume responsibility unless we are given access to the facts and the utilisation of these facts.  From the Trade Union Congress certain proposals were put to the Government which may be good or bad&mdash;I do not know; it is a matter for discussion. We made certain proposals suggesting certain types of tribunal which could bring the workers and the management together from the workshop level to the national level and make it possible to associate the workers, with their practical experience, skill and knowledge, with the day-to-day problems which arise in equipping and adapting Irish industry to give greater output in the mass and an increase of output per worker.  Some months have passed since that memorandum was put before the Government and we are still awaiting some reply.  Yet we get advice from the spokesmen of the Government that we should increase production. <Col N="2070" /> I do not know how you can increase production by merely asking for it.  It is a process of applying human labour and machinery and the brains that God gave us to industrial problems and doing it in the most efficient way in order to get the best out of it. You cannot replace modern methods and machinery just by hard labour, by getting large masses of people to sweat a little harder.</P>
    <P>Part of the difficulty I see, so far as Irish industry is concerned, is that a great many of those who claim, not merely the ownership of industry but the sole right to decide how it is to be run, feel that the only way the problem of increased production can be solved is by the ordinary worker sweating harder and turning out a little more profit for those who claim the ownership of industry.  If that is the line of progress to be pursued, it will be very slow and laborious.</P>
    <P>On this matter of Irish industry, I feel there is a good deal in what Deputy Lemass said when he spoke of the alleged prejudices in the minds of the public against Irish manufactured goods.  It is true that there is a prejudice. The responsibility for that, however, is not with the public.  It is with some of the very gentlemen who are to-day asking our support for Irish manufactured goods because, while they want support for the goods they manufacture themselves, they will not support the goods manufactured by other people.  They exercise a preference for imported goods in their own process of manufacture.</P>
    <P>I recall a story about one very prominent individual who was always lecturing everyone as to what they should do for Irish industry.  He was asked to buy a particular solution made in Ireland which was contained in a tube stamped &ldquo;Irish manufacture&rdquo;. He would not have it.  He said it was not suitable or effective for the particular job he wanted to do.  A fortnight later another tube was produced to him stamped &ldquo;Made in England&rdquo; and he bought the article.  There was no difference between them.  It was the same solution except that it was in a different tube.  That is typical of a great many of our so-called Irish <Col N="2071" /> manufacturers, distributors, wholesalers, and retailers.  They are guilty of fostering and creating this prejudice. It is a bit too much to expect from ordinary members of the public who go into a shop to buy an article that they will be able to withstand the inducements and the expert advice given to them in one form and another to take one particular article rather than another.  They generally end up by buying the imported article as they have the feeling that there is something wrong with the Irish article because of what is told them.</P>
    <P>Frankly, that is my own feeling in the matter.  I do not claim to be an expert on clothes, boots or other things you buy.  You find yourself in an awkward position when you go into a shop and ask for an Irish article and are told that the other article is much more suitable, cheaper and more durable.  Part of it is tied up with the question of the rates of profit, discount, advertising, etc.  I feel that if that prejudice is to be tackled it will have to be tackled at the root source, namely, those who are out to create that atmosphere because of being associated with the manufacture or distribution of many of these articles and, therefore, able to create this particular atmosphere.</P>
    <P>It is not sufficient for Irish manufacturers to ask members of the public to buy Irish manufactured goods.  The articles they use themselves in their own industrial processes should also be of Irish manufacture as far as possible and they should not explain away their failure to do that on the ground that they have to get the best article, the most effective article and the cheapest article.  The public is equally entitled to make the same claim.  What is expected of the public should also be expected of those who are being given protection at the expense of the public.</P>
    <P>There are one or two items I want to touch upon.  As Deputy Lemass is here, I want to speak about ship building.  I am particularly glad that Deputy Lemass did make the correction he made in regard to the Dublin ship-building industry.  I was aware at the time he made the statement <Col N="2072" /> in Dublin that it must have been due either to lack of information or to his being misinformed.  It is only fitting that he should make the retraction of the statement, as he did to-day. While I have a great deal of criticism to make of his failure at the time to obtain vessels for the Irish mercantile marine when they were available at a reasonable cost, it is also true to say that the assistance he gave and the efforts he made in connection with the reopening of the ship-building centre were of tremendous value.  Having given that assistance, it would be most regrettable that he would be guilty of doing a grave disservice by allowing a statement to go uncorrected which he made in public so far as the ship-building yard is concerned.</P>
    <P>I want, however, to make the very definite statement that, not only were they able to build any one of the ships ordered abroad by Irish Shipping, Limited, but I am also convinced that if there is a public inquiry it can be shown that they could have built any one of these ships at a less cost than Irish Shipping, Limited, paid and turn out a better ship.  I suggest that, as the Irish mercantile marine is something in which we have all got a deep interest and is not the personal property of Irish Shipping, Limited, there should be an inquiry, either publicly or privately, as to whether the Irish ship-building yard was permitted to tender for the building of a ship for a semi-State shipping line, whether on a particular Sunday&mdash;I want to mark the time&mdash;the manager of that yard was called back by telegram from Killarney to go into figures with the marine superintendent of that line and spent the whole Sunday going over figures, checking the various items, making certain allowances, and, when he went into his office on the Monday morning to get the figures that had been requested of him, was then informed that the particular contract for which he was making a tender had already been given away on the Sunday.  You do not give out contracts on a Sunday. Without going further into the matter, I believe there is sufficient justification for digging up that file and seeing what went on.</P>
    <P>The Liffey Dockyard was first <Col N="2073" /> interested in this matter in 1946.  They wrote to Irish Shipping, Limited, suggesting that if Irish Shipping, Limited, were building any new ships they would be glad of an opportunity to tender.  Sometime later they received a reply stating that if and when Irish Shipping, Limited, were going to have new vessels built the Liffey Dockyard would be afforded an opportunity to tender.  Irish Shipping, Limited, made the decision and the Liffey Dockyard had to make an approach themselves when they learned that the tender would be called off.</P>
    <P>As far as the tenders were concerned, I had not and cannot have the intimate knowledge of the actual figures.  But I am satisfied that the proper inquiry may produce this peculiar fact, that if the same form of tender and the same conditions were made available to the Dublin yard as were made to the yard across the Channel, allowing for the fact that our wage rate is slightly higher and that we have to pay additional transport charges, the Dublin yard could have built any one of those ships at the same figure or a lower figure than they were built outside this country.  They could have handed over the ships in at least the same period or even a shorter period.  More than that, I think they would have done a better job.  I do not want to criticise any firm not able to defend itself in this House but I do want to say that I know the Dublin ship-building works and I, personally, would not like to feel that even on direct orders they would carry out work on any ship like some of the work carried out on some of our new ships.</P>
    <P>The interesting thing is that two further ships were to be built.  Tenders were asked for by Irish Shipping from a dockyard across the Channel in 1947. They submitted their tenders and revised them at the request of Irish Shipping.  In February they were told not to go ahead with these two ships. In the report of Irish Shipping it is indicated that one of the reasons for the considerable loss last year was the necessity of keeping men idle; yet they did not proceed with the building of two more ships.  I do not know why but it would be interesting to know why <Col N="2074" /> even now it is not possible to get one of these ships built here in Dublin. You cannot keep a ship-building industry going only on the basis of repair work.  Repair work is casual, it represents broken time and men who have responsibility and who can obtain constant and unbroken work across Channel are not going to remain working in Dublin on a basis either from week to week, or month to month, or two or three months at a time, mainly because those who have the possibility of providing actual building work will not go to the trouble of giving assistance to our Irishmen who are depending on casual repair work.  Even that repair work has got to be carried out under great difficulty.  We have only the one graving dock which at least a couple of months in the year has to be used by the Dublin dockyard for its own repair work.  We have only the one dock there for anything coming in and a second ship has got to go somewhere else or lie up for a period of weeks until the first ship comes out of dock.  The Dublin Port and Docks Board has expended some considerable time on the proposal of a new dock. Until we get that new graving dock and until we get the actual building of ships in Dublin we will not have secured and made safe the revived ship-building industry that we tried to bring back here some years ago.  During the years of the last emergency even then we could not have maintained our own Irish ships in service if we had not that yard in Dublin to carry out repairs.  I want to say that it is somewhat ungrateful on the part of Irish Shipping that in return for the services given to them during the emergency they did not give somewhat more friendly treatment to the dockyard when new ships came along.  I think that is a very mild way of putting it.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to go on inquiring into the matter.  I do not think a public enquiry would be profitable. We do not want to create too many difficulties and I, therefore, think it should be made in private.  Those responsible for these serious mistakes should be made to recognise that they did make mistakes.  I am surprised, to some extent, that a great many of these things happened while Deputy Lemass <Col N="2075" /> was Minister.  Whether he was aware of them or not, I do not know.  I cannot reconcile his interest in Irish ship building and the way he spoke to-day with the things that, as far as I know, did go on during the years 1947 and the early part of 1948.  From the point of view of clearing the good name of Dublin ship building, of placing the Irish shipping line on a sound basis and, I think, satisfying us that we are getting value for money, these particular inquiries should be made.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass talked about hand-won turf.  I want to see hand-won turf utilised as far as possible from the point of view of the contribution it can make in the areas where it is produced to the general economy of the people in those areas.  I hope, however, that we will be very slow and only after very careful consideration adopt Deputy Lemass's idea of trying to induce, either by compulsion or persuasion&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I made it quite clear that I am not in favour of compulsion at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is compulsion in this way; if we put a fire into a house that will only burn turf&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I said there would have to be a duel-purpose range.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a difficulty with regard to the range itself.  There are other factors not connected with the actual burning of the turf at all.  I do not know whether Deputy Lemass has ever sat beside a fire in an ordinary Dublin house and tried to keep that fire going.  It is a pretty big job.  You do not sit in front of the fire very long because you are running in and out all the time.  We have to look at it not from the point of view of using in industry a product that is produced in parts of our own country but also from the point of view of the woman who is going to use that product, unless we can do something to the turf itself and erase the problem of the machine-won turf.  However, I want to deal now with the ordinary hand-won turf from the point of view of the amount <Col N="2076" /> of additional labour it makes for the housewife and the difficulties she experiences in cooking, especially if she is not experienced in keeping a turf fire going, and also from the point of view of the additional dirt in the house, not merely physical dirt but in the form of earth.  That is the situation we had during the years of the emergency and we have not forgotten it.  I think it would be much better if we could concentrate on seeing that our public institutions, especially in the hand-won turf areas, would be compelled to use this turf and, if necessary, adapt machinery and furnaces for its utilisation.  While it is a fairly difficult job to keep steam up with turf, at least they can be given additional assistance and if necessary be paid a bit more; but the woman at home does not get more assistance and she will have a lot of extra labour and work in using turf.</P>
      <P>There is the question of burning turf in the farmhouse grate that may not be built for turf.  The burning of turf in such a place and the burning of turf in a small kitchen in an ordinary working house in Dublin are two entirely different things.  We might almost have a revolt if we tried puting ranges into corporation houses in the big towns of such a nature that while they would burn coal they would burn turf a lot better.  That is the kind of problem we have.  We should think along those lines and for the moment give our people a little period in which to forget the unhappy experiences of the emergency, and they were very unhappy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am still not convinced as to the reasons why we are going to build a second power station.  When reference was made to this in the House some time ago I gathered that it was a question that the Electricity Supply Board required a second station as a stand-by. I do not understand why we cannot get the stand-by, or additional power stations, in the form of turf-burning stations and why they must be coal-burning stations Reference was also made to the security problem of building a second station at the Port of Dublin.  That is a defence problem. We now have the atomic bomb, and I do not know where we can put a station <Col N="2077" /> in this little country that will be safe from attack.  If the Clonsast station is technically justified from the point of view of using hand-won turf, why should we not duplicate our turf-burning stations rather than spend money on importing coal?  I gathered that one of our concerns is our unfavourable trade balance.  It was reduced somewhat last year, but it still is very considerable. Why, then, should we spend money bringing in coal if we can get the same power developed from our native fuel?  I am still waiting for a satisfactory answer to that question.</P>
    <P>I came across another peculiar problem in regard to the use of turf some time ago.  I understand that Bord na Móna has to supply turf to the Clonsast station at a certain price fixed by the Electricity Supply Board.  On one occasion I was on a deputation to Bord na Móna looking for more wages for the employees.  I was told the increase could not be given because they were concerned with getting their costs of production down to a certain figure. We were given to understand that a figure was fixed by the Electricity Supply Board at so much per ton for the supply of turf to the Clonsast station.  It seemed to be the view of Bord na Móna that, if they did not reach that figure, they were told that the Electricity Supply Board might change over to coal.  I do not know whether that is correct or not.</P>
    <P>It seems to me to be a rather peculiar position that we should go to the trouble and cost of building a power station at Clonsast and then leave it to a body like the Electricity Supply Board to decide as to whether we should change over to coal or not. What I was concerned with was that the difference between Bord na Móna and the Electricity Supply Board in regard to the supply of fuel to the station appeared to be a matter of some pence per ton.  When I suggested that surely it was sound, nationally and economically, to pay a little more for turf to fire the station rather than to import coal, I was told that was a problem that was completely outside the range of consideration of Bord na Móna and would have to be taken up somewhere else.</P>
    <P>This seems to be the place to take it <Col N="2078" /> up.  I am satisfied from inquiries that Bord na Móna is up against some technical problems, one of which relates to the footing of turf, which are very difficult of solution.  The board finally arrived at a figure for the delivery of machine-won turf to the Clonsast station.  It was somewhat higher than the figure that the Electricity Supply Board thought it should be.  The Electricity Supply Board seemed to think that they should get the turf on a comparative basis as against coal.  I think is is for somebody to come to a decision and say that we will continue to use turf, that we will spread the additional cost by way of a national contribution and thus continue to utilise our own fuel resources rather than import coal.  I understand that the figure set down by the Electricity Supply Board is a figure that is not based on the cost of importing coal, and that no allowance is made for the fact that in this instance we are dealing with a national industry which is in its initial stages of development.  It is an industry which has to face very grave technical problems and therefore I submit it is entitled to encouragement not only from the Government but from all parts of our economic structure, including the Electricity Supply Board.</P>
    <P>One problem that we are up against at the moment is that of trying to see what particular gaps exist in our economic structure so far as industries of various types are concerned.  This is not a matter, I agree, which can be dealt with in an offhand way across the floor of the House.  It is one that requires careful and systematic study. I have already referred to ship building. There are two other units that I want to deal with.  One is the electric bulb factory at Bray, and the other is Irish Steel holdings at Cobh.  These seem to me to be fundamental types of industrial units that we require in the country.  The bulb, or glass, factory at Bray has now been shut down for some six months.  I do not want to go into details as to why it shut down.  I am concerned with the fact that it is shut down.  If the factory does not reopen, then, I think, we have lost a valuable part of our industrial equipment. <Col N="2079" /> When an industrial unit like this gets into difficulties and is possibly not able to overcome them, I think we should concern ourselves about it and give thought to the gaps that may exist at present in our industrial set-up, or that may be created by allowing some of our existing industries to be forced out.</P>
    <P>The other unit is Irish Steel holdings. That has had an unfortunate and chequered history.  It is still labouring under great difficulties.  Personally, I cannot see how we are going to have anything in the way of effective productive industry in the country&mdash;even if we confine it to light industry and consumer goods&mdash;unless we have some extension and development of capital goods: something in the way of a steel works producing certain types of steel to be available for machine building, the building trade and other light industry of that kind.  Deputy Lemass referred to the general engineering industry.  I agree with him that we should associate a general engineering industry with our transport system. That is the only effective basis for it, because it affords the largest and most effective basis on which to build up an engineering industry.</P>
    <P>I disagree violently with the Deputy's remarks about Córas Iompair Éireann. I think I am entitled to disagree with him as he was entitled to disagree with the findings of Sir James Milne.  I remember that, as far back as 1929, a suggestion was made to spend £225,000 in re-equipping and establishing the engineering works at Inchicore, not merely as engineering workshops there for the railway system, but as a national engineering works.  It is regrettable that that particular development was never proceeded with, because sooner or later we shall have to face that problem if we are going to establish and maintain industry here.  We shall need to have an engineering industry that will be capable not only of carrying out day-to-day repairs but major overhauls and even the building of particular types of machinery that we may require. Bord na Móna, for example, had to face the problem of actually inventing and devising machines to <Col N="2080" /> suit their particular form of production. They had to build machines and try to keep men to do running repairs.  One can see how difficult it must be for an organisation of the type of Bord na Móna to do that.  It would be much easier for the board if they had readily available the resources of a modern well-equipped large-scale engineering works.</P>
    <P>I want to make a few passing references to a matter that has occasioned some thought in the last few days.  I understand there is some responsibility on the Minister for Industry and Commerce to deal with the problem of the provision of work, and that it is the responsibility of another Minister to deal with other aspects of that problem. Lately, there have been a number of pieces of advice directed to some of those men and women who are out of work, and the feeling that they do not want to take up work because they do not like work.  I am speaking now in regard to the Minister for Industry and Commerce because I want to keep my remarks within the rules of order.  I want to say that there are two different problems here.  There is the problem of unemployed men and women living in Dublin and in other large urban centres.  There is no use in offering these men and women work out in a rural area.  That is no solution at all.  They have been brought up in a particular area: they have their homes and their families there, and possibly all their relations.  They are used to a certain standard of living, a certain custom of life.</P>
    <P>The provision of work for these men and women has to be related also to their particular experience in industry, in transport or in trade, and to their family associations and their home environment.  It is no solution of the problem to give a man in Dublin work in the country and then expect him to maintain himself and his family, the family perhaps, being 30, 40 or 50 miles away.  For such a scheme to be successful, the work has to be adjacent to where that man's family is.  Anybody who suggests that because large numbers of unemployed in Dublin are not prepared to take up work in various parts of the country&mdash;hydro-electric work or bog work&mdash;there is something <Col N="2081" /> radically wrong, and that these men deserve to be castigated in public, held up to ridicule, and that that sort of criticism will be allowed without anyone objecting, is making a very serious mistake.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to speak equally on behalf of the single man who is criticised because he is not taking up work on the Ballyshannon scheme.  I have some knowledge of the Ballyshannon scheme and I suggest that before men are criticised for failing to take work on that scheme, there should be a very detailed examination of the scheme and not merely the rates of wages should be investigated.  There is something more than the rates of wages to be considered in order to determine whether a job is good or bad.  Word passes along very quickly when a job gets a bad name.  That can apply to many types of employment. Bord na Móna made very great improvements within the last 12 or 18 months, but before that it got a bad name.  Bord na Móna was told that and it was urged to try to remedy certain grievances.  Certain improvements were made.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that working men are not prepared to do things which they regard as outrageous either from the point of view of value for the work they do, the conditions under which they live or the treatment they expect as ordinary human beings.  I suggest to every public man that when he addresses himself to the question of unemployment he must realise he is speaking of fellow Irishmen and women.  We have to get away from the point of regarding every unemployed person as a drone, a person who, if he is provided with work, will not accept it.  If the average unemployed man does not take work, there is often a very good explanation and the sooner we all realise that the better.</P>
    <P>There is that section of our community that has never, so far as I know, got things very easily in this life; if they have not had to work hard, at least they have not lived very well. On the other hand, we have quite a lot of people who seem to live very well and, as far as I know, they do little <Col N="2082" /> or no work.  I suggest that some of our Ministers might address the criticisms that they now address to working-class people to those who live in the higher strata of society and who, although they live so well, make little or no contribution towards the wealth they accumulate.  I am not going to be associated with any Government or Party or individual who feels that the unemployed are to be the subject of open rebuke, strong criticism and scornful references because they are in the unfortunate position of being denied reasonable opportunities of earning a living under decent conditions.</P>
    <P>I have asked questions from time to time with regard to factory inspections. I feel there is some need for legislation in this connection.  Definitely there should be an improvement in the methods of our inspectorial branch. The standard and percentage of factory inspections is very much below what it was pre-war.  Our expectations have altered in this respect.  We have a great many people nowadays coming back from working abroad.  They have knowledge of higher and better standards of factory conditions and industrial hygiene and they expect that we will try to improve and build up our standards.  We should at least enforce the existing standards that we have determined by law.  Our inspectorial staff is little more than half what it was pre-war.  They have other duties added and it is quite clear that the standard of inspections must, in these circumstances, go down considerably. I ask the Minister to bring the number in that branch to even a greater level than it was in pre-war days and adjust the branch to the additional duties we have set up.  A considerable amount of extra work devolves on them because of the additional regulations that we have made.</P>
    <P>I come now to the cost of living.  I am one of those who has stated repeatedly that the cost of living can be brought down.  It is no use asking me how, because I do not know.  I feel just as the Minister did when he was in opposition; I feel that something more effective can be done and that a greater drive can be made in connection <Col N="2083" /> with this matter.  We have achieved one important thing, and that is that we have been able to peg the figure to some extent.  I know that in the present Opposition and outside there is a feeling that underneath the surface there are changes taking place. So far as the Fianna Fáil Party are concerned, we had somewhat the same feeling with regard to their cost-of-living index figure.</P>
    <P>You will never satisfy the public that the index figure for the cost of living is a true reflection of the actual cost of living.  The public do not know how that figure is made up.  They believe it is designed to fool and delude them and every time there is a change in the price of a commodity, no matter how small it may be, they feel that the cost to them still goes up.  There is a feeling that it is not sufficient for us to have held the cost of living as we have done since the beginning of 1948. There is a feeling that we should be able to secure some reduction in the cost of living, even though it is a small reduction and it may take some time to have real effect.</P>
    <P>I think I should again press what I pressed already on many occasions&mdash; that no matter how effective the machinery for price control is, it will not receive the confidence of the public so long as it is being operated by Departmental machinery behind the doors of Government Departments.  I am not casting any reflection on the officers who exercise that machinery, but it stands to reason, from our experience since 1939, that not one member of the public in every 10,000 believes that price control machinery operates effectively and efficiently in the interests of the public.  They have had too bitter a dose, and if we are to try to get a proper appreciation among our people, and especially those in the working class sections, of what the cost of living actually is, then we must adopt ways and means of having a price control machinery operating in a manner that the public will understand.</P>
    <P>It is not always possible to get people in business to submit to public examination all their private books and papers, but I suggest that there <Col N="2084" /> are methods by which various price increases can be investigated.  During the emergency, when the ordinary working man or woman looked for an increase in wages, he or she had to go before a public tribunal and, where it was necessary, submit, through organisations or as individuals, to the most minute inquiry in order that the tribunal might decide whether or not the applicant would be entitled to 5/-, 10/- or 15/- of an increase.  They were not getting anything from the community; they were making a contribution towards the wealth of the nation by way of labour and they were getting wages in return.</P>
    <P>A great many of our manufacturers are being maintained by the community at the cost of higher prices.  If they want a subsidy, because it is a subsidy, from the community in the form of a protective tariff then they should be prepared to submit themselves to a public examination of their costings and the structure of the price of the commodity they produce.  With all the limitations and with all the defects that may flow from trying to operate price control machinery in public, I still urge upon the Minister that he should examine the problem. Even if it is only in a limited form and subject to many qualifications, he should try from time to time to evolve machinery of that type which would operate particularly in regard to some of our tariff industries in order to assure the public that there is a careful control and examination of all the factors that enter into the cost of living.  If that is not done there will never be any confidence in the manner in which this machinery operates and there will never be any acceptance of the cost-of-living index.  When you do not have acceptance of that figure as to the real cost of living for the average working class family, naturally you will have the corollary that the great mass of the workers will place their own estimation on what it costs them to live; and, if that estimate is above what they are receiving in weekly income, then they are going to take immediate steps to increase that income.</P>
    <P>For a period of 12 months we have had comparative stability in so far as wage levels are concerned.  I am not <Col N="2085" /> one of those who believe that there must be an even balance between wages and the cost of living.  I am satisfied that wages must always keep going up because of the fact that increased wages will inevitably give us a higher standard of living.  If the workers cannot buy the same quantity of goods for the same amount of money then they are going to ask for more money in order to buy the same goods. I do not think there can be any argument for any limitation upon the standard of living of our people any more than one can limit the march of our people as a nation.  I realise at the same time that there are periods when stability is required for a readjustment of our forces and a rapproachement to our whole problem.  We have had that over the last 12 months.  But it is quite possible that that stability may be upset, and the easiest way in the world to upset it is to get it accepted by the great mass of workers that there is an unfair relationship between the cost-of-living index and their wages.  They will set out immediately to adjust that relationship.  Sometimes they adjust it by means of discussion and conciliation, as is done in the Labour Court.  They have, however, got one remedy which we shall insist on retaining.  That is the withdrawal of their labour.  When one comes to that particular pass difficulties and complications arise for everybody.  It is because I am concerned with a great mass of workers that I press upon the Minister now reconsideration of this problem of price control and an acceptance of the principle that, whatever measures may be used, whether it be direct pressure by examination and investigation of costings or whether it be by Draconian enforcement, we must make up our minds that we must break the present figure.  I feel that if we once do that we shall get a steady downward trend in costs.  Once we reach that stage we have rid ourselves of the danger of an upward trend again.</P>
    <P>There is an understandable feeling on the part of the public that the stability we have had in the cost of living over the past year is merely a passing phase and that at any moment an upward movement my start again. If there is the slightest indication of <Col N="2086" /> that the results will be, though possibly not tragic, very serious indeed as far as our whole economy is concerned. I would urge upon the Minister that he should go back and read some of the speeches he made when he was in Opposition and, as I am doing to-day, repeat the advice he gave then and consider that advice good; and he has now got not merely the desire, as I have, but also the power and the technical knowledge and detail available to him as head of his Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I know it is my privilege and I shall avail of it on every possible occasion.  I wish to direct my remarks mainly to unemployment which has recently manifested itself in the woollen and worsted industries in the City and County of Cork.  The proprietors of mills in my constituency and outside it have for some time been advocating for increased protection for their output and production.  They say that, due to excessive dumping in this country by firms who manufacture knitting-wools and woollen and worsted materials, they are not able to compete with the imported article and so cannot keep <Col N="2087" /> their workers employed on the scale they would desire.  As regards the woollen industry, I have here what I might term a &ldquo;brief&rdquo; from one of the biggest manufacturers in the country. I have been asked to express their views and I do not think I can do better than to refer fairly exhaustively to the material that has been supplied to me.</P>
      <P>They say, in the first instance, that dumping is due to inadequate protection. It builds up surplus stocks in this country with the result that firms manufacturing worsted woollens in the country cannot dispose of their stocks. Admitting that competition stimulates trade, on the other hand, for whatever reason I do not know, foreign firms manufacturing woollens elsewhere are able to export some of these materials to this country and sell them, even after paying the cost of transport, at a lower price than they can be produced and sold here with a reasonable profit. That this dumping is increasing seems to be incontroversible from the the facts.  In 1947 Britain exported to the United States of America more woollens than they did to this country. Nobody can put the consumption of these goods in Ireland and in the United States of America on an equal footing but, nevertheless, as the result of inadequate protection, the British last year exported to this country more than they did to the United States of America.  That in itself is positive proof that England finds a ready market here for goods for which they could get dollars in the United States of America.  They seem to be able to make a much greater profit by sending their exports here into a non-dollar area.  That in itself should be an indication to the Minister that the woollen industry here requires more protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One big snag is the problem of quotas.  When you come to the fixing of a quota, the Minister or his responsible officers have to give a description of the goods which are imported under quota.  At present there is a quota applied to worsted yarns over a certain weight per square yard. The quota at present does not affect cloths which are under seven ounces <Col N="2088" /> per square yard.  Therefore, if an exporting firm in England can manufacture cloth under seven ounces per square yard, they can send here all they can supply of it and all that we can take.</P>
    <P>As a general rule, cloths under seven ounces per square yard are supposed not to be suitable for manufacture into suits but, nevertheless, at the present time there is being dumped here cloth like gabardine.  This material is intended, I believe, for the manufacture of raincoats and other such articles but at present, as I think most people can see for themselves, gabardine cloth is being made up in gents' suits, ladies' suits and even children's suits.  These particular cloths are coming unrestrictedly into the country and undercutting worsted woollens, the product of our own factories. These loopholes, which were apparent in the year 1947, allowed an excess of 3,500,000 square yards of these kinds of cloths over the quota. Even in 1948, the quota was exceeded by 3,000,000 square yards in unmade-up form and 1,500,000 square yards in made-up form&mdash;that is, in ready-made suits and overcoats.  As a result of that, this country had a surplus stock of 4,851,000 square yards in 1947 over the estimated consumption of 10,500,000 square yards.  In 1948 the surplus was 2,784,000 square yards.  I leave it to the Minister to judge what effect this surplus of 3,000,000 as against a consumption of 10,500,000 had on home production.</P>
    <P>The suggested remedies for this dumping and the consequent unemployment is, first, to reduce the import quota by at least 650,000 square yards because it can be proved that Irish manufacturers can supply to the full limit of home consumption&mdash;not only that but they can also supply a fairly large proportion for export, if an export market can be found.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Since that interjection has been made, may I say that I am speaking, not on behalf of the employers but on behalf of the employees? There are many hundreds, even thousands employed by that firm.  Many hundreds of them are personal friends of my own and I know that several of them have been in that employment constantly for a period of several years. Many of these are now unemployed and many more are in danger of dismissal due to slackness, and slackness cannot be attributed to anything else but dumping from England and elsewhere. One of the remedies suggested is to reduce the weight limit of seven ounces per square yard to a lower figure.  That would be a means of combating the import of gabardine and of preventing gabardine, which is primarily intended for raincoats, being utilised for ordinary suitings as is being done at present.  As a result of a lack of a proper description of the goods which can be imported under quota, this importation of gabardine, under the guise of ordinary worsted woollens, has been taking place and therefore I would impress on the Minister that, in fixing a quota in future, the particular commodity permitted to come in under quota should be more clearly defined in order to overcome this method which exporters in Britain have adopted of by-passing this particular Order in respect of quotas.  It has also been suggested that the Government has not adequately exploited the export market in places like America or Holland.  I believe that some form of trade agreement is in existence between this country and Holland but that exports under that agreement of worsted and woollens to Holland are practically nil.  That is something which should be capable of being remedied, and if the people in Holland were willing to enter into an agreement for exports and we have not exported <Col N="2090" /> anything to them although the stocks are there, it is something that must be remedied and I would ask the Minister to look into it.</P>
      <P>To come to the hand-knitting wool industry, there are three mills which primarily produce hand-knitting wool, Blarney, Cork and Athlone.  The production of these three mills is about 1,000,000 lbs. per annum which is considered to be equal to the country's total consumption.  The quality and price of the Irish article compare more than favourably with those of the imported article.  The Irish wool is sold at approximately 1/2d. to 1/3d. an ounce while the imported article is sold at from 1/2½d. to 1/5d.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think there can be no gainsaying the fact that Irish hand-knitting wool is as good as, if not better than, the imported article at the same price, but the crux of the matter seems to be that the imported stuff comes in in a cheaper form which they call crossbred which they can sell at 8½d. an ounce here while in England, I am told, they can get as high as 10½d. The Minister should look that matter up and, if he cannot restrict the import of crossbred, he should at least ensure that our 1,000,000 lbs. of hand-knitting wool can be sold at home or alternatively exported.  I have stated that the estimated consumption and potential production of this country is 1,000,000 lbs. a year.  In April, 1948, there were some 31,800 odd lbs. on hands in the mills unsold and last month there were approximately 124,000 lbs. unsold in the mills and that naturally means unemployment.  In Cork alone 144 men and women have recently been disemployed as a result of the surplus stocks in the mills. Therefore, even if the Minister did not want to aid the manufacturers there, I consider in this case that it is his duty, when Irish manufacturers can compete in quality and price with English manufacturers, to look to these 144 people who are unemployed and the many more who are in danger of being unemployed as a result of the lack of protection to the hand-knitting wool industry.  The manufacturers of these worsteds and hand-knitting wools do not ask for any special monopolies. They are performing a very useful <Col N="2091" /> function in providing employment for our own people at home.  I always had a theory&mdash;I am expressing my own view&mdash;that even if we have to charge a little more for an article made in this country than the imported article can be sold at and if in doing so we can give employment at home, prevent people from being unemployed or on the dole in this country or from going abroad for employment, then it is good economy in the long run, even if the consumer has to pay a little more on the home-produced article.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy allow me to intervene for a moment? He has dealt fairly fully with the woollen and worsted position and also with hand-knitting wools.  The Deputy apparently is not informed that I had interviews with the manufacturers concerned on two occasions when they made application for certain protections.  I asked on each occasion to be supplied with certain additional information.  I have not received it yet, either from the manufacturers of woollens and worsteds or from the manufacturers of thread.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that I am not being premature in addressing these remarks to the Minister.  I understand that negotiations are taking place but surely I am entitled to make representations, if not on behalf of the employers, then on behalf of the employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting for a moment that the Deputy is not entitled to make his case, but I do respectfully suggest that the Deputy is not entitled to put on my shoulders blame that must rest on the shoulders of the manufacturers until they give me the additional information I require in order to make up my mind on the matter. If there is delay in this matter I want to put the blame for that delay where it rightfully belongs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the Minister may not have all the material he wants in order to come to a decision and I also appreciate that this is a very complex matter.  As a matter of fact, without the material that has been supplied to me I would not be <Col N="2092" /> able to make any case and I am sure that very few Deputies, unless they had some experience of these trades from the administrative side, would be able to make a case.  Nevertheless, as soon as the Minister gets the information he requires I would ask him to bear in mind that our own people are finding useful employment in these factories. I was over one of them recently and frankly I was amazed at the conditions under which the people work there.  They are ideal from every point of view&mdash;clean work rooms, airconditioning, good canteens and, I am told, in many cases, excellent weekly salaries.  If there is any antidote to the evil of emigration, that is it; and I repeat, even if we are asked to pay a little more in order to keep these factories in production it would be good economy and I would ask the Minister to examine the question from that point of view.  We hear a lot about reducing the cost of living.  I know that is essential, but if the cost of living goes up to the extent, perhaps, of £1 or £2 on a suit in the year, or 10/- or 15/- on socks and woollen underwear in the year for the average individual, I think it would be far better in the long run that we should be prepared as a nation to sacrifice these few extra pounds or shillings in order to keep people at home in gainful work and happy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to tourism, before the election which gave us this Government took place, a lot of attacks on the tourist industry were made by various Parties.  Some of the Parties which now support the Government made a particularly strong line of attack on the tourist trade.  One Clann na Poblachta election address had bold headlines with the slogan: &ldquo;Butter, bacon and eggs in hotels for English spivs, foreign tourists, and monied aliens.&rdquo;  The present Taoiseach advocated that the tourist trade should be taxed in order to reduce the cost of living, and the present Minister for External Affairs, in one of his earlier speeches before this Government came in, also advocated taxing the tourist trade.  All these opinions were expressed, possibly from conviction, but, I suspect, largely as a means of vote-catching, opinions they really did not feel but which <Col N="2093" /> would, they felt, go down well with the electorate.  We find, however, in recent months a change in the point of view which was held prior to the 18th February.  When the Tánaiste opened Mosney Village Holiday Camp last July he described the tourist industry in the following terms:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The tourist industry is a valuable asset.  It helped the country to balance imports and exports in a manner that could not be done were it not for the influx of visitors.  There were over 1,000,000 visitors last year &mdash;1947&mdash;and they brought £35,000,000 into the country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister himself, at an Irish Tourist Association luncheon last October, praised the tourist industry for its dollar earning capacity and said that was now being realised by many people for the first time.  I wonder did he include many of his own supporters in the people who were now realising it for the first time.  However, I think it is generally accepted now on all sides of the House, and even amongst people who were bitterly opposed to tourists coming in and eating butter and eggs during the war years, that the tourist industry is very valuable to this country.</P>
    <P>What I am leading up to is that the Minister has very definite views which he has often expressed as regards the development of the tourist industry. These views can be summed up by saying: &ldquo;Let the people who reap the most benefit out of the tourist industry finance it and make their hotels and their restaurants more attractive.&rdquo; Last year, the Minister will remember that he received a deputation advocating the claims of Cóbh for special attention, from the point of view of increasing its attractiveness as a port of call for American liners.  The Minister gave it as his very definite opinion that he would have no part in it, that the people of Cóbh, either by private enterprise or through their own urban council, should make their own port attractive.  However, since the tourist trade is so valuable to the general economy of the country, I think it is the duty of the Government to take action in making Cóbh&mdash;and other <Col N="2094" /> ports of call, if there are any, such as Dún Laoghaire for English tourists&mdash; more attractive and better places to come to.  I believe that the scences in Cóbh when an American liner calls are frankly disgraceful to this country. People have to sit on upturned trunks while they are awaiting customs clearance. If a boat is due to leave about 8 o'clock in the evening and for some reason or another it cannot leave until the following morning, very often the streets of Cóbh are being walked by people who are waiting to board the liner, without any hope of securing hotel accommodation.  That is a state of affairs that should not be allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>An urban district council such as that in Cóbh cannot possibly hope to get the revenue capable of putting Cóbh on the basis of a port of call suitable for the kind of trade we want to get from America and elsewhere.  The customs sheds in Cóbh could be made at least a comfortable place for incoming Americans and people of other nationalities, for a comparatively small sum of money.  That sum, however, would be far beyond the means of private enterprise or of a small urban council. I appeal again to the Minister, if my appeal can carry any weight, to examine the situation and take the long view of the value of the tourist industry to the country, as he has expressed it himself, and see if he cannot provide some adequate facilities there.  I do not want a luxurious port such as we have in Collinstown, but reasonable facilities to make these American people feel that they are being well catered for in this way.  I know it has been said often that people who have had to pass through Cóbh&mdash;either incoming or outgoing tourists&mdash;have expressed the opinion that they will never come again, as they thought it was not really worth it.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider seriously his expressed opinion on this particular aspect and, if he can possibly see his way at all to do it, to give some financial aid to Cóbh in the matter of providing better facilities for incoming tourists.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lynch had certain animadversions to make upon the attitude which he alleged was adopted by Clann na Poblachta and other Parties in the inter-Party Government to the question of tourists, before the last general election.  Before proceeding to a consideration of the Estimate proper, I would like briefly to refer to Deputy Lynch's remarks. Many of us did undoubtedly express the view that a tourist industry, to the extent that it resulted in our surrendering food, clothing and accommodation to cross-Channel visitors &mdash;and perhaps the recent visit of Mr. Maximoe was not absent from our minds&mdash;in return for pieces of paper with &ldquo;£1 sterling&rdquo; printed on them, was not an industry which was of paramount importance to the country.  The only reason I refer to Deputy Lynch's remarks is lest anything he said should lead people in this House or elsewhere to believe that the people on this side of the House do not realise the value in dollar-earning capacity of a properly run and directed tourist industry.</P>
      <P>Having said so much, let me proceed to a consideration of the matters involved in this Estimate.  The Minister, in his conclusion, requested Deputies to approach this Estimate and the cognate Estimates in the spirit that, although much has been done, much remains to be done, and, in that spirit and with that constructive approach, I hope to place certain considerations before the House.  We are fortunate that so far, at any rate, in this debate we have had, in the main, a constructive approach by those who spoke.  In any criticism I make of the administration of the Minister's Department, I should like him to realise that these criticisms are addressed to him in a constructive spirit and, as I told his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, are not criticisms merely for criticism's sake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that between some of us who sit on this side of the House and the Minister there is a pretty deep philosophical chasm.  The Minister and two or three of his colleagues make a fetish of free enterprise, of doing away with controls and a policy generally that, in the long run, if things are left <Col N="2096" /> to work out for themselves, they will work out for the best.  That is a policy to which I do not subscribe and a policy to which the members of Clann na Poblachta do not subscribe.  We believe in intelligent planning.  I think it was Deputy Larkin who regretted the absence, or apparent absence, of any unified industrial and economic plan for the whole country.  I may be told, and probably will be told, that it is premature to expect the emergence of such a plan.  At the back of my mind, speaking perfectly frankly, is the fear that the Minister and his Department are afraid of being accused of following too closely in the steps of their predecessor.  I am no apologist, and would never like to be taken as an apologist, for the Fianna Fáil Party, but I would say this to the Minister, that merely because, at some stage in their political evolution, the Fianna Fáil Ministry did entertain briefly, or embark upon or complete a particular line of action it would be wrong, in my estimation, to put it to one side purely for that reason.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister was able to tell us&mdash;it was a heartening thing which will give heart to our people as a whole &mdash;that there is a trend towards a reduction in our adverse trade balance. Our people will be heartened to know that there has been an increase in exports and a fall in imports.  I am not going to be so mean or so niggardly of appreciation as to attempt to ascribe that to factors outside the Minister's control.  In so far as he can report to us that progress has been made in that direction, the Minister is deserving of congratulation, and I for one will not withhold it from him.</P>
    <P>One matter to which no reference was made by the Minister&mdash;it is a matter which I think can be fairly described as relevant to the Estimate&mdash;is the position of these semi-State or statutory companies.  On two or three occasions, by way of Parliamentary Questions to the Minister and also to the Taoiseach, I and some of my colleagues sought to elicit some indication of what future Government policy was to be in relation to these bodies.  There is a rather impressive list of them, a rather impressive list <Col N="2097" /> of statutory, semi-State corporations receiving support out of public moneys and over which this House has no control.  Every Deputy has from time to time been faced with the situation that, on behalf of a constituent or some body or group, he has been requested to redress a grievance in connection with conditions of employment or other matters in Córas Iompair Eireann, in the Electricity Supply Board, in Bord na Móna, in Aer Lingus, in Aer Línte, in Irish Shipping, in Mianraí Teoranta and all these companies which come under the designation of semi-State concerns.</P>

Obviously, then, if the Minister is to be held responsible, legislation will have to be introduced in order to give the Minister control and the Deputy is not entitled to advocate legislation on an Estimate.</P>

      <P>In the course of a fairly lengthy speech, Deputy Lemass referred to certain schemes and projected schemes which had formed the <Col N="2098" /> subject matter of his observations on this Estimate last year.  Much of what he said is worthy of endorsement. There were some matters to which he did not refer and I would like to suggest to the Minister that they should receive the consideration of the officers of his Department.  Reference was made to the Erne and Clonsast schemes.  I would like to have from the Minister when he is replying some indication that the Government has plans for proceeding with the oil refinery project.  I would like to hear from the Minister when he is replying what the position is about the provision of further ships for Irish Shipping, Limited.  Last year we were promised that within the 12 months there would be five additional ships under the control of that company. Some of those ships are already in commission and in service.  I would like to hear from the Minister when the people may expect the remainder.</P>
      <P>Deputy Larkin spoke at some length concerning the necessity for an additional graving dock and for better facilities for the repairing and refitting of ships in the Dublin port.  No mention was made by either Deputy Larkin or Deputy Lemass of a project which, I understand, received a considerable amount of support from the Minister when he was in opposition, that is, the setting up of a factory for the production of sulphate of ammonia so that nitrogenous manures could be manufactured at home for use in the country. No mention has been made so far by any Deputy of the necessity for proceeding with another project that was also mentioned here in previous years, namely, the setting up of a wool combing plant.  Nor was there any mention of the necessity for the initiation and establishment of a newsprint industry.  A newsprint industry is a project which we on these benches would view with considerable approval because it would be a very necessary adjunct to the proper use of products from afforestation, when an afforestation scheme would come to fruition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I merely mention these various projects to the Minister as matters which should receive the consideration of the officials of his Department.  The Minister may not know it but his <Col N="2099" /> Department, more perhaps than any other, comes in for public criticism. I say that as having an urban background and an urban experience.  Perhaps if I lived in a rural area, I might speak differently.  But one is no worse a friend of the Minister's because one employs terms of candour when one is speaking to him.  I want to be candid and frank with the Minister and to tell him that in the mind of the public there is the impression that delay&mdash; and inexcusable delay&mdash;is inseparable from the Department of Industry and Commerce.  There is worse than that in the minds of some members of the commercial community.  There is the feeling not so much that the policy the Minister is pursuing is a wrong policy as that the Minister's Department has not got a definite policy.  There is the feeling that there is uncertainty&mdash;and there is nothing worse than uncertainty. Any business man will tell you that he will meet any type of conditions rather than uncertain conditions. It is no part of my function to apportion the blame as between the Minister and his officials.</P>

      <P>There are three particular headings under which I wish to <Col N="2100" /> make criticism.  The first is in connection with the paper and stationery industry.  Before the present Minister took office an application was made to his predecessor&mdash;the blame cannot be thrown on the present Minister&mdash;for the reimposition of a duty which had been taken off in 1942 on imported stationery.  That application, as far as I can ascertain, was made in November, 1947.  A questionnaire was sent out by the Minister's Department and was replied to.  Repeated requests were made to the Minister's Department to have this duty reimposed.  I am briefed that the matter was pursued by a number of people.  I know I pursued it with the Minister's Department. Not until the 1st April, 1949, was a 25 per cent. duty on stationery, which had been in existence up to 1942, reimposed. During that period over £700,000 worth of imported stationery was dumped in this country.  It is doubtful&mdash;even with the reimposition of the duty on the 1st April, 1949&mdash; whether the industry will be able to recover from the dumping that went on during that period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so. The ready-made clothing industry has now got portion of the protection they asked for.  However, I am creditably informed that, during the period that they were literally beseeching the Department of Industry and Commerce for the imposition of some protective tariff, dumping took place in this country which has now left them in the position that forward sales&mdash; they would now be making them for the autumn trade&mdash;are impossible to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The claim was also made to me that the Minister's Department was requested to give a clear indication of their attitude to the establishment in this country of an industry for the assembling of bicycles.  In so far as I <Col N="2101" /> am briefed on that matter, I understand &mdash;and I await hearing the Minister's reply&mdash;that it has been impossible to get from the Minister's Department a satisfactory answer as to their attitude.  Generally speaking, I would urge on the Minister that, while a certain degree of caution may be necessary before protective tariffs or duties are imposed, this House and the people as a whole would be more indulgent in respect of a mistake made in the direction of giving too much protection or premature protection or unneeded protection rather than that overcaution and overcarefulness should result in workers in any industry being thrown out into the street to join the ranks of the unemployed.  I should like to make it clear, without room for any doubt, that I am not making these observations as a spokesman or as a protagonist of any small group or of any self-styled federation of industrialists, or otherwise.  I am making these observations to the Minister in the interests of the people with whose welfare I am most concerned, namely, the workers employed in industry.  In that connection I should like to say to the Minister that it is useless for him or for any other Minister or for any Deputy or any public representative to appeal for greater production&mdash;to appeal to the workers to bend their backs to the task&mdash;unless, at the same time, he appeals to the employers to give the workers a share in the management and control of industry. Until such time as the Minister's Department takes that line, until such time as that attitude is endorsed by an Irish Government, then it is idle and unreasonable to expect an increased effort from the workers.</P>
    <P>I should like to endorse what was already said in this House in connection with the use of native fuel.  It is the Minister's duty, I think, to ensure that in all public and Government institutions the use of turf is made compulsory.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">

    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand it is not.  I would go further and ask the Minister make such Order as is necessary to prohibit the sale in turf-producing <Col N="2102" /> areas of imported coal.  I will be told that there are all sorts of difficulties in the way.  I know it is not a popular line for the Minister to take. I know it is not a popular line for me to advocate in this House.  But, if we are to have real concern for the many people who are depending for their livelihood on the production of turf, if we are to make any real progress towards getting the idea of even limited self-sufficiency into the minds of the people, it is a step that it is necessary we should take.</P>
      <P>I have only one final observation.  At the risk of being repetitious, let me say this.  Let the Minister realise, let his officials realise, that precipitate action may result in mistakes, but it is better than delay and overcaution.  The people of the country will excuse mistakes made through over-enthusiasm, mistakes made through a desire to get a job of work done.  They will not excuse overcaution, overcarefulness, which to them may appear to be mere inertia and carelessness.</P>

      <P>Up to the previous speaker, Deputy C. Lehane, rising, this Estimate had been in the nature practically of a non-contentious one.  I think those who listened to Deputy Lehane will agree that his was the first real indictment of the Department of Industry and Commerce which has been made on this Estimate.  Deputy Lehane is as interested as I am in the unemployed, particularly as he represents the same constituency as I do&mdash; the unemployed of the country in the first place, and the unemployed of Dublin City, which approximate 15,000 at the moment.  He knows, as I do, that the old policy, the policy of Fianna Fáil, the policy of Griffith, the policy of every Irish economist of any note or worth noting was to develop an industrial arm.  He knows also that that policy is not being pursued, that it has not been accelerated in the last year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCann</NameTxt>
      <P>It has not been accelerated in the last year at the rate it should have been.  Deputy Lehane indicted the Minister on three or four points, particularly in relation to the paper and stationery industry and two other manufacturing industries.  He said that protection was sought in one instance, that a licence was sought to establish an industry in another instance and that neither was granted. He indicted the Minister for being so dilatory in respect to the paper industry that the market was now flooded to such a degree that for years to come, I think he said, it will have an effect on the industry here.</P>
      <P>I am very glad to see that the Minister, whom I have listened to for ten years now in this House, has accepted the position that the strongest possible industrial arm is absolutely necessary to the economy of the country.  Deputy Lehane forgot to say that, while undoubtedly our cattle exports&mdash;and they are the bulk of our exports&mdash;have been increasing, the other export, the export of human beings, has also been increased during the last year and that the business of the Department of Industry and Commerce is to see that industries are created here which will absorb the unemployed of Dublin and the country.</P>

Deputy Lehane is not too <Col N="2104" /> certain, but I can assure the Minister that I am absolutely certain about that, because many plans have passed through the planning department of the Dublin Corporation.  The town planning authority of which I am a member passed many plans for factories and to my knowledge tenders have been accepted for them, but the work is not going on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcCann" hpid="Mr. McCann Mr. McCann">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCann</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not make a statement without having the facts.  What I did not hear from Deputy Lehane and what I was hoping to hear from him was some comment on the reduction under the various heads of this Estimate.  I agree that he did mention the two principal ones, but he did not mention mineral exploration.  I heard enough from Deputy Lehane and his Party during the last election on mineral exploration to expect that he and his Party would be the first to object to any reduction under that sub-head in this Estimate. Surely, if we are ever going to develop anything in this country a miserable £100,000 or £200,000 extra annually to mineral exploration would not be thrown away.  Deputy Lehane would be the first individual in this House to stand up and advocate it.  He mentioned that he would like to see turf being used in Government office and in all offices of the local and general authorities.  I should like to see in the future in connection with electricity, the development of turf <Col N="2105" /> burning stations only.  There has been a mentality in this country&mdash;I know it, having been an engineer many years ago&mdash;that you could not use turf because it was not an economic fuel, in relation to electricity development. There has always been the coal mind in certain engineers associated with the Electricity Supply Board.  That coal mind should be broken down because it is not a question of the price at which you can generate electricity with coal or with turf but a question of what is the cheaper in the long run&mdash;paying for English coal or employing Irish labour to cut the turf and use it for generating electricity. That, to my mind, should be one of the things we should concentrate on. The late Sir John Purser Griffith worked for years and years on peat and water resources.  Anyone can read his writings.  He was a prophet in his country over 30 years ago but a prophet is never listened to in his own country and I am sorry to say only too seldom in this.</P>
      <P>The question was raised of the market here being flooded with footwear and clothing.  Deputy Lehane says they have an insufficient protective tariff&mdash;50 per cent. <i>ad valorem.</i></P>

    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">

      <P>He attacked the then Minister for failing to do certain things.  Surely if there is a glut of footwear and clothing on the market the obvious thing to do is not to fix any sort of duty but to put an embargo on immediately and keep English footwear and clothing from coming into the country.  There is a great deal of unrest amongst the footwear and clothing workers in this city.  I can assure you of that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCann</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made this speech consistently.  So far as Córas Iompair Eireann is concerned Mr. Lemass dealt briefly with the Milne Report.  There is only one item which he touched upon and that is the bus station, one of the items of capital expenditure.  I can assure the Minister that that was actually a decision of the town planning authority.  The idea is that there will be a second bus station in the neighbourhood of Christ Church.  That will be the pivot of the city under the town plan.  There will be two bus stations. For years before the new bus station was in the course of erection I heard Deputy Byrne, both senior and junior, and various other members putting down resolutions night after night in the Dublin Corporation demanding that a bus station be erected for the benefit of the long journey passengers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcCann" hpid="Mr. McCann Mr. McCann">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCann</NameTxt>
      <P>There was nothing in that wrong except that the building was started under Fianna Fáil.  I should like the Minister to urge Córas <Col N="2107" /> Iompair Éireann to go ahead with the extension of the body-building programme. I can assure him that the buses which have come into this country and are in operation, particularly on the 15 route, do not compare with the buses made by Irish workmen. They are an inferior article.  I ask him to go ahead and implement that section of the programme, at any rate.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether the extension at the North Wall is mentioned in the Milne Report.  I refer to the piece of ground that was taken over from the Electricity Supply Board by Córas Iompair Éireann.  I understand that over £30,000 was spent on that and now it is lying derelict.  Something upwards of 60 men were employed there and I was informed that they only got one day's notice.  The grass is now growing through the concrete.</P>
      <P>I do not want to revert to what I said about tourists but I have heard the Minister and members of his Party at Irish Tourist Association luncheons and so forth talking about tourists being our greatest invisible export. Deputy Lehane talked here about people coming into the country and consuming our food.  That is the best possible way of exporting the food, getting them to come here and eat and leave their dollars for it instead of going to the trouble of having it transported across the sea.</P>

I am very glad that there is not, in my opinion, a philosophical chasm after all between the Minister and us on these benches as Deputy Lehane said.  Apart from three or four substantial reductions on the sub-head, I am very glad to see that, in the main the Minister for Industry and Commerce is implementing Fianna Fáil policy although not at the rate which I should like it.</P>

      <P>Can I say Deputy McCann is a sort of perpetual wonder to me?  There was a time when <Col N="2108" /> I had the impression that Deputy McCann was one of these quiet men, plain spoken, blunt, in fact possibly well qualified for the definition which the Deputies opposite appropriate to themselves&mdash;politicians by accident and by accident only.  Deputy McCann to-day, however, has shattered the illusions which I had concerning him. I think he is the only Deputy who has approached this debate in what I might term the typical Fianna Fáil manner.  He spent about ten minutes attacking the Minister from every angle.  He finished up by saying that the Minister&mdash;and he congratulated him on this&mdash;was merely pursuing Fianna Fáil policy.</P>
      <P>One of the matters which worried Deputy McCann very much was this question of the importation of foreign footwear to the detriment of the footwear factories in this country and the employees.  I think it is a great pity that Deputy McCann maintained his monastic silence for 16 years when on this side of the House, because I am sure that the remarks which he made to-day were remarks which could have eased the position considerably if even one back-bencher of the Fianna Fáil Party had stood up when on this side of the House in the year 1946 or the year 1947 and gave tongue to the same feelings that Deputy McCann did to-day. I wonder did Deputy McCann bother listening to the statement made by the Minister here earlier this afternoon?</P>

      <P>The figures the Minister gave in his statement this afternoon regarding the footwear industry should, at any rate, have made Deputies on the Fianna Fáil Benches feel thoroughly ashamed of themselves, <Col N="2109" /> and certainly ashamed of making the remarks which Deputy McCann made a few minutes ago.</P>

      <P>There was a footwear industry in 1946 when Fianna Fáil was in office with an over-all majority.  Deputy McCann was in the House when there were imports of footwear. We had imports of footwear in 1947, and a quota for the import of footwear for the first months in 1948 was fixed by Deputy Lemass when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce and before he went out of office. I am going to give Deputy McCann these figures.</P>

      <P>The Minister said all that himself, but despite the fact that he did we had Deputy McCann making a typically vindictive Fianna Fáil speech of misrepresentation here a few minutes ago.  Now, this much is certain, that wherever the blame lies with regard to the position of the footwear industry in this country, it certainly does not lie on the shoulders of the present Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The Minister has made a statement and it is perfectly obvious that he has endeavoured, in the best way he could, to face up to the problem created for him by Deputy Lemass before he went out of office.  I will go back as far as the Minister did, to the year 1938.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McCann is most uncharitable to himself by perpetually calling attention to himself.  In the year 1938, the total home production for all footwear was in round numbers, 4,400,000 pairs; imports were about 250,000 pairs.  In the year 1946, when Deputy McCann conceived <Col N="2110" /> his duty, as a Deputy supporting the Government, to be merely that of voting &ldquo;yes&rdquo; every time that Deputy Lemass nodded his head&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrady" hpid="Mr. S. Brady Mr. S. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an old one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the home production in that year was about 5,250,000 pairs; it had increased by nearly 1,000,000 pairs despite the imports, which amounted to over 1,000,000 pairs of footwear.  In the year 1947, the home production had increased by 200,000 pairs over and above the 1946 level, but Deputy Lemass had also increased the imports by over 1,000,000 pairs, over and above the 1946 level. Because of the fact that Deputy Lemass was not at that time getting the type of assistance that Deputy McCann proceeded to tender to the present Minister&mdash;perhaps when he was not getting that assistance&mdash;we had the problem created which the present Minister is endeavouring to solve.  I wonder is it because that problem exists, and because a minute quantity of footwear, as compared with what Deputy Lemass had allowed in, was allowed in by the present Minister, that Deputy McCann says the present Minister is merely following Fianna Fáil policy?</P>
      <P>During the Adjournment Debate last year I called attention to the position of the footwear industry and to the problems created in it by the efforts of Deputy Lemass.  I do not know what has stirred up Deputy McCann at all. He is only nine or ten months too late. We were all saying those sort of things last year and we were quite right.  The only thing is that we put the blame where it was due; we put it on the shoulders of Deputy Lemass.  I had not intended dealing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am you may go.  There are some other matters that I want to deal with.  When this Government was formed, and when Deputy Morrissey, as a member of the Fine Gael Party, was nominated Minister for Industry and Commerce, we had a number of Deputies opposite quite untruthfully suggesting throughout the country that the traditional <Col N="2111" /> policy of Fine Gael was prejudicial to Irish industry, and that the fact that a Fine Gael Deputy was Minister for Industry and Commerce meant that, in the coming years, there was going to be a clamping down on industrial development.</P>

      <P>Yes, but it does not at the moment.  However, that was the type of speeches that was being made by Deputy Vivion de Valera.  It was, perhaps, harmless.  It certainly was not quite as harmful as some of the later speeches he made, and particularly some of his more recent speeches.  I think, however, that the report presented by the Minister this afternoon is perhaps the most effective way of giving the lie to that type of speech and that type of rumour.  I feel that every Deputy in the House should have a great deal of sympathy with the Minister for Industry and Commerce. I think Deputies should have a great deal of sympathy with any Minister for Industry and Commerce, and particularly with the present Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think myself that the Department over which the Minister presides must be the most difficult and complicated one in the country.  When the natural difficulties and complexities which must confront any Minister for Industry in this country are further complicated by the number of problems which this Minister was faced with when he took over, it will be realised that it must render his task exceedingly difficult, and when the Government and the Minister are doing their utmost to bring down the cost of living, to prevent the cost of living soaring as it did soar year by year under the Fianna Fáil Government, and at the same time are endeavouring as best they can to promote industrial developments and foster new industries, I think it will be <Col N="2112" /> seen that the problem that is facing the Minister is really a difficult one.  He must look at both sides of the picture. He must think of the ordinary consuming public; he must think of the industrial and economic future of the nation.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn to the first aspect of the Minister's work.  It is an aspect which I feel has not been appreciated by Deputies on the Government side of the House and which has been, to a great extent, misrepresented by Deputies on the Opposition side.  It is an aspect of his work which I feel has not been properly appreciated outside this House either.  I refer to the fact that Deputy Morrissey, since he became Minister, has certainly done his best as one individual to prevent the cost of living rising.  We had a position last year where he withstood very powerful pressure from one section of our producers&mdash;that is, the butchers&mdash; for an increase in price and we had the position where Fianna Fáil Deputies &mdash;I think Deputy Brady was one of them&mdash;were pressing the Minister as to why the price of meat should not be increased.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to talk about sheep and beef in my own way.  At any rate, there were a great number of Parliamentary Questions asked by Fianna Fáil Deputies regarding the Minister's attitude towards butchers.  It was not until the Minister put it bluntly to the Deputies opposite what their position was and did they want to see the price of cattle going down for the farmers, or did they want to see the price of meat raised on the consumers in Dublin, that those very Deputies decided that possibly the best thing they could do would be to revert to the tactics they employed when they were supporting their own Government, and so they remained silent..</P>
      <P>I merely raised this matter in order to point out to Deputies on all sides of the House that big pressure was put on the Minister by an influential section of the people, who felt that they had been able to get on very well when Deputy Lemass was Minister for Industry and Commerce.  These people made no secret to any Deputy on this side of the House of the fact that they had met Deputy Lemass prior to the general election which resulted in Fianna Fáil Deputies occupying the benches on the opposite side and he had promised them an increase, but told them it would not be convenient for him to announce it for the present. It was because that promise was given to them by Deputy Lemass that the present Minister felt that he had to honour it and an increase of, I think, ld. per lb. was given shortly after the present Minister took office.</P>
      <P>The butchers certainly were not content with that.  They overlooked the fact that they were not now dealing with Deputy Lemass and I think inside a fortnight or so they were back looking for more.  After months of effort, and supported in the manner which I have indicated by Fianna Fáil Deputies, eventually they decided that they were dealing with a different type of proposition and a new Minister and they were not going to get the increase in the price of meat.  They realised that this Minister conceived it to be one of his duties to protect the interests of the consumers in Dublin and throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not alone has the Minister for <Col N="2114" /> Industry and Commerce waged that fight on behalf of the consumers, but he has also devoted a great deal of his time and attention to other articles and commodities.  He has effected by his intervention reductions in the prices of a great number of commodities. Some of them may be small, but others are fairly considerable and the reductions have a big effect on the weekly budget of the ordinary breadwinner. Reductions have been made in the price of ready-made garments ranging from 2½ to 9 per cent.  The figures I am quoting were made available last January and it is possible that since then further reductions have been made.  No doubt the Minister will be able to tell us about that later. Waterproofed garments were reduced by different amounts ranging from 2½ to 12 per cent.; ties were reduced from 5 to 10 per cent.; braids and elastics from 4 to 20 per cent.; woollen piece goods by 5 per cent.; different types of household goods by amounts ranging from 7½ to 18 per cent.  Certain types of building materials were also reduced in price.</P>

      <P>The price of gas was reduced in Dublin by 3d. per therm and in Cork by 4d. per therm. Motor car prices were considerably reduced and bicycle prices were reduced by 7½ per cent.  As Deputy Lemass commented in his speech to-day. the Minister is still waging that battle on behalf of the consumer and is still endeavouring to get prices down.  There was a certain amount of criticism when the Minister effected a reduction in the price of motor cars. He was told by Fianna Fáil Deputies, with typical ingratitude, that he would be better employed if he devoted his attention to some other articles.  The <Col N="2115" /> number of motorists in this country has increased enormously in recent years.  The necessity for motor cars has also increased.  Many people feel that they require motors, as a means of transport, as a necessity when some years ago they might have been considered a luxury.  I think the consumers in this country should be very grateful to the Minister for the considerable reductions he has had effected in the price of all these commodities I have mentioned and, in particular, in the price of motor cars and bicycles.  I was glad to note from the Minister's speech that in the last year 90 proposals&mdash;I think that was the figure mentioned&mdash;for the establishment of new industries were actually approved by him, that 14 were at the moment in course of production and that another 70 were certainly under the examination stage at present.  I am glad to note, too, that the volume of transportable goods has shown an increase of 15 per cent. over that of 1947.</P>
      <P>Some Deputies referred to the fuel situation.  I think both Deputy Lemass and Deputy Lehane adverted to it.  Deputy McCann showed unaccustomed wisdom in steering clear of it.  I would like to know from the Minister what exactly is the position with regard to State institutions and local authority institutions using turf. I agree with both Deputy Lemass and Deputy Lehane that fuel should be used by such institutions, and I must confess that I was under the impression that local authority institutions at any rate were under compulsion from the Department of Local Government to use turf.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In the debate on this Estimate last year, at column 1236 of Volume 112, Deputy Lehane, in reference to turf, said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I think it is the Minister's duty, in consultation with the Minister for Local Government, to ensure that all local institutions throughout the country will, where feasible, use turf.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2116" /> The late Minister for Local Government, Mr. Murphy, said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That has been done.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Lehane replied:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am very glad to hear the Minister say so.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And then we have Deputy MacEntee intervening:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It was done before.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Yet Deputy Lemass appeals to the Minister to-day to have it done.  Deputy MacEntee thought last year that not alone was it being done last year but that it had been done for years before that.  I do not know what the position is.  I hope that turf is being used.  If it is not being used I hope that the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Local Government will get together and see that it will be used in the future.  Generally speaking, I think one of the biggest headaches which the Minister for Industry and Commerce had when he came into office and which lingered on into this year must have been the problem of fuel.  I think it is probably unnecessary to reiterate what the position was when he came into office except to say that, despite the vast quantities of fuel&mdash;turf, wood and coal&mdash;which were stored in the Phoenix Park when the Fianna Fáil Government went out of office Fianna Fáil had continued to allow that fuel to be delivered to the Phoenix Park at a cost of something in the region of £40,000 per week to the taxpayer.  That was only stopped when the new Government took over.</P>
    <P>The position was reached where enormous stocks lay piled up in the Phoenix Park.  The Minister made every effort to induce people to take them off his hands.  He was unable to do so until he eventually reduced the price to something which can only be described as ridiculous.  He has managed, judging by the figures he gave earlier this afternoon, by doing that to get fairly considerable quantities purchased at a price of £1 per ton. Fianna Fáil policy resulted in a situation where people who sold green logs to the Fianna Fáil Government at prices ranging from £3 10s. 0d. to £4 10s. 0d. a ton were able during the present year to purchase <Col N="2117" /> those logs back from this Government at £1 per ton, not in their raw and green state but as good seasoned timber.  I do not think any of the Opposition Deputies can deny that that situation has arisen.  I do not think they will deny that it came about as a result of their policy and because of the fact that they seemed to be so utterly careless and callous about taxation that they did not worry one bit about all this fuel pouring in to the Phoenix Park at a cost of £40,000 per week to the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>Last year the Minister for Industry and Commerce forecast that it might be necessary to take some such decision as he has since taken in order to get rid of this fuel.  He foresaw also that when that decision was taken the public memory might have forgotten that Fianna Fáil were responsible for that situation having arisen and that Fianna Fáil Deputies would take advantage of the shortness of the public memory.  At column 1283 of Volume 112, the Minister for Industry and Commerce said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I want to warn Deputies of this also, because I know I will be accused and attacked later on, that if I reduce the price of the fuel in the dumps to such an attractive figure that people in Dublin and people throughout the country convenient to the other dumps take full advantage of it and stock up, everybody who produces a sod of turf this year, or has a clamp of turf left over from last year, will immediately attack me and say: &lsquo;You encouraged us to cut turf and now you swamp the market at a price at which we could not possibly produce it.&rsquo;  I am telling the House in time so that, if it is decided to make this fuel available at a price at which people will buy it and if people stock up, Deputies will not come in here later to denounce me because I deprived people in the turf areas of the market they are supposed to be looking forward to.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was on 22nd July, 1949.  How well the Minister knew the Deputies opposite!  How well he knew the paper they have under their control.  On the 14th January of this year the <i>Irish <Col N="2118" /> Press</i> produced an article dealing with the fuel muddle.  It is headed &ldquo;The Fuel-Dump Scramble&rdquo;.  They point out that the taxpayers of the country were going to lose over £1,000,000 by reason of the Government decision and they produce a touching photograph under the caption: &ldquo;Mass loading: A typical scene at the Dublin dump&rdquo;, showing six or eight lorries drawing out fuel from the Phoenix Park.  They draw attention to the matter to which I have already referred and they state:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;At times as many as 20 lorries were loading at the one time.  Purchasers were coming from all over Leinster.  Not only were some purchasers having it &lsquo;both ways&rsquo; inasmuch as many of them were buying back at £1 timber which they originally sold to Messrs.  Fuel Importers, Limited, at from £3 10s. 0d. to £4 per ton but they were getting a better fuel as well. When supplied by them during the emergency, the timber was in many cases freshly cut or &lsquo;green&rsquo;; now they were getting back perfectly seasoned blocks.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This was intended to convince the people of the country that the fuel muddle was a muddle created by the present Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I am referring to the matter at length because I want to assure Deputies opposite that however short their memories may be, my memory is certainly long enough to remember who created the muddle and it is my firm intention to enlighten the people at every meeting I address outside the House as to the facts of the matter.</P>
    <P>I have already dealt with the question of footwear.  I am glad that the Minister in his statement was able to report that there was an increase in the number of people engaged in industrial production.  He stated that the question of employment in rural areas was a matter which caused some anxiety.  The reason for that anxiety, as Deputies are aware, is not so much, or is not at any rate entirely, the numbers of people on the register registering as unemployed available for work.  One of the causes of anxiety is the fact that when work is made <Col N="2119" /> available in some of these areas, that work is not accepted.  The Minister for Finance dealt fairly fully with that when he was replying to the debate on the general Financial Resolution.  At col. 1058, Volume 115, he referred to certain work which had been offered to people in different areas.  He showed that in one area 54 men were interviewed and offered work and that out of that 54 only one man accepted work. In the next area 90 were interviewed and none of them accepted.  In the third area 80 were interviewed and six accepted work.  In the fourth area 95 were interviewed and offered work and one accepted.  In other words out of a total of 319 who were interviewed and offered work, eight men accepted it.</P>
    <P>I do not think that any Deputies opposite have endeavoured to make the case that the type of work being offered was not good work, that the wages offered were not good wages or that the general amenities and facilities in connection with the work were not as they should be.  Nevertheless in the areas which the Minister for Finance named, mainly around Sligo and Donegal, although these people had registered as people willing to accept employment, out of a total of 319 who were interviewed, when the work was handed to them on a plate as it were, when they were offered transport from their homes to the work and offered hostels to board and lodge in on the site, only eight accepted the offer.  I think that does disclose a situation which requires thorough examination.  I am certainly not prepared to advocate that people of that sort should be allowed to continue to draw unemployment assistance.  I believe firmly that it is the duty of the Government to offer and to provide assistance by State aid for people who are unemployed and cannot get employment or else provide employment for these people, but I do not think it is the duty of the Government to do both.  If the Government is able to, and does in fact provide employment, the Government cannot be blamed if people will not accept that employment. I could understand that if Deputies stood up here and made an <Col N="2120" /> argument against the wages or conditions of employment but that has not been done and I do not believe it can be done.  I think we are driven to the conclusion that there is something there to be examined and I think many of us will be willing to accept the conclusion which the Minister for Finance drew from that particular situation, that a number of people in different areas have been, for political reasons, by supporters if not actually by Deputies of the Party opposite, urged to register although they do not require work and have no intention of accepting work and that that was done purely and simply to inflate the register of unemployment in this country.  I recommend to the Minister that that matter should receive his earnest consideration and that if it is established that anything of that sort has happened, very drastic action should be taken, not only against people who put their names on the register falsely and fraudulently but against anyone who has been found to urge them into that course.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say in the first instance that my experience has not been the experience of Deputy Con Lehane in regard to the Minister's Department.  I have at all times met with the utmost courtesy and anything which I sought in that Department was very speedily looked after.  I should like to say that straight off the reel. It has been my experience in that Department for a number of years.  I would like to know from the Minister what steps he intends taking to see that proper facilities are provided in Cobh, customs facilities in the first instance. It is his job.  He has stated, I think, that the harbour authority is responsible.  I do not mind who does it, whether the harbour authority does <Col N="2121" /> it or the Minister's Department, but the Minister is responsible for seeing that it is done and I want the Minister to get it done through his Department or through the harbour board.  We hear a lot about tourists coming into this country and the conditions under which they come.  There was some excuse certainly during the emergency but there is no excuse now that the liner service has resumed.  I raised the matter in this House before by question. I put down the question again and I was told that the six months were not up so that the question could be repeated, but I take the opportunity of the Minister's own Estimate to ask him to say definitely what he intends to do in this matter.  The statement of my colleague, Deputy Lynch, in connection with facilities at Cobh for people going out and coming in was correct.  This condition of affairs does exist and it is very hard to know how to meet it.  For instance, Deputy Lynch pointed out that a liner due at 4 o'clock or 5 o'clock or 6 o'clock in the evening would not sail until next morning and another liner might be coming in so that there would be a double quota of passengers.  No one could expect an ordinary hotel anywhere to cater for that class of traffic when 25 or 30 rooms would be occupied on one night in the week and have nobody in them for the rest of the week.  That hotel in Cobh which was recently put up for auction by the Minister was started to meet that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next thing I would like to deal with is the anxiety which always prevails. I am afraid the Minister is getting a touch of the disease called &ldquo;Dublinitis&rdquo;.  It means that everything must be brought to Dublin so that there can be some show of prosperity in the capital city, employment and so on, to the detriment of other cities and towns throughout the country. People have been coming to me with a complaint about mastheads which were being made by the Electricity Supply Board in Cork at Kilbarry. The employment that was given there has now stopped and those mastheads are now being made in Dublin.  In fact an order for 55 of them which was given to the Kilbarry people has been taken from them.  The stuff is being <Col N="2122" /> prepared in Dublin and sent from Dublin by rail to Bantry and I suppose we will be told to-morrow or after that the price of the current must go up and that this is the most economical way to deal with the question.  The same thing applies in Charleville, in my own constituency in Ballycotton, and practically all over the country. Whether this is done to help out the Electricity Supply Board in freight charges or not I do not know.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Some time ago I sent a sample of iron ore to the Minister in his Department.  I was told that it was dumped stuff but I am informed that that statement is not correct.  I want that quarry in Araglen surveyed <Col N="2123" /> by the Department and investigated. On analysis the ore is very high.  I know they dumped stuff because they tried to sell dumped stuff on behalf of the owner but this is not dumped stuff.  It was taken out of a mine.  I would like the Minister's officials to go down because if we have iron ore in the country as the analysis turns out it would be a great asset and if it were properly investigated it would provide employment for our people, a thing we are looking for.</P>
      <P>I had occasion here during the year also to deal with dumping which undoubtedly causes unemployment.  I am one of those who hold that once we have established an industry here that will give employment to our people, once we have established the machinery, the mill or the factory for that industry, no foreign stuff should be brought in which that factory is capable of producing.</P>
      <P>I say that the dumping of goods here is unfair and unjust, unjust to the people who started the factory and unjust to the Irishmen and Irish women employed in it.  I know that the Minister is not anxious that that condition of affairs should be created, but it is a condition of affairs which has been found in Youghal and Midleton recently and in Glanmire some time ago.  It is a condition of affairs that leads to an uncertainty that is unjust and unfair.  I am asking the Minister now to devote particular attention to this side of the picture. These industries were started here at very great trouble and expense and caused many headaches, I am sure, to his predecessor.  We do not want to see them wiped out by dumping over here by the authors of the Ireland Bill</P>
      <P>Deputy Lehane alluded to the £700,000 worth of imported publications. The same has occurred in regard to a large number of articles in the textile line and also in boots and shoes.  I want the Minister to see that dumping ceases, now that there is no occasion for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no dumping of footwear now.  Less than 2 per cent. of the entire footwear came in in the <Col N="2124" /> last three months.  There was dumping in 1947 and in the first part of 1948. There is no dumping now&mdash;good, bad or indifferent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>If I take over any job in the morning and find that my predecessor, under different circumstances, had fixed a certain quota, it is my duty to keep my eye on that quota and its effects and to stop it when necessary. There was a fresh quota given&mdash; if the Parliamentary Secretary will allow me to make the point&mdash;as I found in his reply.  I have not got it here with me.  A second quota was given by his Minister, which was the cause of my complaint.  If the Parliamentary Secretary will go down and have a look in the Library at the reply he gave and will brush up his memory in that respect, he will find that is so.  His memory ought to be good.  It is practically the same as regards material manufactured by Dwyer's factory in Youghal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to hear the Deputy developing that, but the factory people might not be anxious to hear it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not care who is anxious.  I do not give a hang about the factory or anybody else.  I am concerned with £500 a week being paid in wages in a town in my constituency for the work done in that factory and the fact that, according to the argument used by the owner, the factory had to be closed because of the dumping and those people were disemployed. I am not concerned as to whether it was the Minister or his Department that was responsible, or whether it was any move on the part of the factory owner.  I am concerned only with these boys and girls who were getting employment in my constituency and who were thrown out on the dole&mdash;and I am gravely concerned with them.  The Minister need not think I am briefed here by anybody.  I am not.  It is my <Col N="2125" /> duty, when factories were established in rural towns by the efforts and inducements of the Minister's predecessor, to see that that employment at least is continued.  Even if we do not get any more employment while the Minister is in charge, we will see that what we have we hold.</P>
      <P>The Minister also paid a few visits to Irish Steel during the period he has been in office.  I am sure he was pleased with the satisfactory manner in which Irish Steel is doing its job. Seeing that production went up by practically 100 per cent., I want to know from him now what hopes there are of an extension of that factory. The employment of able-bodied men in the towns is something we all desire. I am not a believer in the factories where you see a crowd of little girls going into work, or see women going in while the men are at home drawing the dole.  I am a believer in factories where able-bodied men can find good decent employment at decent wages. That industry is providing all three.  I have been informed that it can be expanded so as to find employment for 250 or 300 more men.  I want to know if the Minister has investigated that side of the problem.  If so, what does he intend doing about it?  What steps does he intend to take to provide that employment?  I hope he will be sympathetic, though he may have difficulties with his colleague, the Minister for Finance.  After all, if he can, by the expenditure of a certain amount of capital, find employment in our own country, in one Irish town, for 250 or 300 extra men, he will be doing something that will stand as a monument after he is gone.  The Minister might say he might make mistakes, but let him remember that the man who never made mistakes never made anything. Let the Minister take courage in this respect and I am sure he will have satisfactory results.  I am concerned about the young men, many of whom have received technical training in that district.  I want to see employment provided for them.  I do not want to see them having to scoot off on the emigrant ship.  Whatever may be said about others, we can hardly make them postulants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2126" /> I would also ask the Minister to use his good offices and efforts towards finding some industries for the town of Fermoy and the town of Youghal. Anybody going into those two towns to-day cannot but be saddened by the condition of affairs there.  In my travels through the town of Youghal, in practically every house I visited I heard the same story&mdash;there was a mother and two or three little children &mdash;&ldquo;Where is himself?&rdquo; and the reply &ldquo;Gone to England, sir, looking for work.&rdquo;  That was the condition of affairs there.  I understand that the Minister has got one proposal in connection with a heavy industry for that town and I wonder if his Department has investigated it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The particulars have been printed and published over and over again in every newspaper in the country and given over the radio.  The labour exchange branch managers have been informed and given full particulars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister will take a suggestion from me, it is that he should put the particulars in poster form and display one in every labour exchange and let these people, when they come in to draw the dole, see where the employment is available.  I mean that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important matter.  We need these men for very important work.  The wages and the conditions are admitted to be good in the case of both employments.  The contractors for the Electricity Supply Board and Bord na Móna itself have circularised every branch labour exchange or employment exchange and over the radio they have appealed for men.  They have advertised in every daily and weekly paper in the country. They have actually put lorries on the road to bring men who have to come a distance to the work, and, in the case of the Erne, they put a Diesel railcar to bring men to Ballyshannon and to bring them back at night.  Five men responded to the railcar.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The suggestion I make is made in all good faith and it may help far more than the Minister thinks, because, when a woman passes the door of the exchange and sees advertised there a job for Mike, she might spur him into going there.  I am anxious to get employment for my people as best I can and I want to see nobody idle in my constituency, if I can avoid it. I want to see nobody going to England from my constituency.  That is my concern and that is why I make that suggestion to the Minister.  As I say, it is made in all good faith.</P>
      <P>I suggest that there are great openings for industries in this country. Many of our needs have still to be supplied from abroad, and, even though we may get something cheaper from abroad, if we can get it produced here, even at a little extra cost, I believe the people will have no great objection to paying that little more, and the Minister knows that as well as I know it.  We want an industry in Fermoy and another in Youghal.  There are openings in both towns, particularly for heavy industries which will give employment to men.  That is my main object in raising the matter here.</P>
      <P>The Minister knows, as everybody in the country knows, that during the emergency there was a scarcity of iron. Blacksmiths had great difficulty in getting even material to shoe horses and we farmers also had difficulty in getting iron for carrying out ordinary repairs to our farm machinery.  I suggest that we now have an opportunity to extend Irish Steel, Limited, to supply all our needs in that respect. The minimum wage paid there is over £5 per week and I am sure that, even though the work is hard, the men in my constituency, at any rate, would prefer to take employment there than to take a rail trip to the Erne, even though it would be free.  These were the main points with which I wish to deal with on this Vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other matter.  We heard a great deal about the Minister's <Col N="2129" /> reduction of the cost of living and the Minister's anxiety about employment. Was it for the purpose of providing further employment and of keeping our industries going that the Minister extracted from the Irish Sugar Company something like £380,000 last year? I maintain that it was for the purpose of depriving the agricultural community of an economic price for their beet and that it had a reaction on employment in four sugar factories.  I endeavoured to get information on this matter out of the Minister here by question and by raising the question on the Adjournment.</P>

If he had no authority to interfere with the Electricity Supply Board, where is his authority to extract from the Irish Sugar Company £380,000 that belonged to the farmers of this country to pay them for their crop?  That action meant a reduction of 20,000 or 30,000 acres of beet this year and unemployment in our sugar factories.  The argument that I had with the Minister on that occasion was very short.  I had only a quarter of an hour on it.  His argument was that his predecessor had charged the amount.  When his predecessor charged the amount, the cash was there to meet the extra cost of production the following November.  This year the cash is not there to meet the extra cost of production because the Minister has <Col N="2130" /> extracted it for the purpose of reducing the cost of living for the £10 week boys here.</P>

      <P>That is a different thing from taking it from the sugar company.  Is the Deputy suggesting that I should have given it to him as a beet grower?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>When we went down last November to get what the old farmer was entitled to, we found that the cupboard was bare, that the Minister had extracted the money and that we could not get any increased price because the Minister or the Government was not prepared to increase the price of sugar, having made their haul <Col N="2131" /> the other way.  Frankly, I am against this manoeuvre entirely.  This action of the Minister's will mean unemployment in the factories and in the fields. It will mean unemployment all round. It is all very well to talk of the present day when you can get cane sugar that is produced by the nigger but you may find yourselves in another emergency depending on the Irish farmer to produce beet.  It will be very little use then for the Minister to tell the farmer that that is a fine price or that the Fianna Fáil Government were so gentle to the farmer during their term of office that they could live on the fat until the Fianna Fáil Government returned.  I am entirely opposed to this manoeuvre of continuing the rationing system that had to be imposed during a period of shortage now that the period of shortage is over.  What was the purpose? It was for the purpose of enabling what I call a legalised black market to be established by the Government both in white flour, sugar and, I think, in tea.  You can get so much at the rationed price and if you want any more than what you got during the war, when it was practically impossible to provide these commodities here, you can get it at a black-market price established by this Government.  I object to that.</P>
      <P>It is all very well for the rich who have plenty of money to pay the extra price but it is not so well for the unfortunate people in Youghal whose breadwinners are in England trying to provide bread for them.  I know cases of large families for whom the ration would not be sufficient and I know husbands and wives who were doing without sugar so that it would be available for the children.  Now they can get it all right&mdash;call it sugar for jam&mdash;at 7½d. a lb. which is 1? pence more than the economic price of sugar.</P>

At the same time I do not think that it is anything that he could feel very honoured or glad about.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said, it has led and it will lead to unemployment in all the sugar factories.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Why?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>It will lead to further unemployment in the rural districts where an enormous amount of employment was given in connection with beet. It will lead to a drop in the Córas Iompair Eireann exchequer&mdash;which might concern the Minister&mdash;because every ton of beet produced has to be conveyed to the factory by Córas Iompair Eireann.  So now the Minister sees all the repercussions of that slick raid he made on the coffers of the sugar company and I hope he is pleased with it.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to delay this House.  I wish to deal with those matters which concern my constituents or which concern the association which I have had the honour to represent for a long number of years.  I can say this much. This association is the only farmers' organisation in this country elected by democratic rule&mdash;the man must be a farmer and he must be a grower of beet to be a member of it.  Their representatives are elected by their postal vote.  Speaking for them, I want to say that we have not been accustomed to such slick methods from the Minister's predecessor in office.  During the two years previous to the Minister's advent on the scene as the Minister for Industry and Commerce our just demands were met each year by the sugar company fairly and squarely.  The cash was there.  Now this game of selling the furniture of the house as a means of carrying on is being tried.  We have got about enough of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard complaints by Deputy O'Higgins a while ago about the ricks of turf and the piles of coal and other fuel.  They were all got by the previous Government and, I take it, paid for in the previous Government's administration. I know that I would be a very thankful man to go into a house in the morning as a new tenant and, on going out into the yard, to see a ton of coal there.  I would be quite happy indeed about it.  If the previous Government, <Col N="2135" /> in their wisdom, did provide stacks of fuel, I see no reason why any Deputy in this House should cavil at it.  After all, Deputies should go back to the Dáil Debates for 1942, 1943, 1944, 1945 and 1946 and read what even the Minister had to say about the scarcity of fuel and the necessity for providing fuel.  He was a very wise man then who would be able to judge on what day war No. 1 was going to end and on what day war No. 2 was going to start.  If war No. 2 started in the morning, the people of this country would find themselves with a very bare cupboard.</P>
    <P>I am not sure whether the matter I am about to deal with now comes under the Minister's Department or not.  If it does, well and good; if it does not, he can stop me.  I am alluding to the increase in the price of maize.  I want to know who bought the maize and who brought it across?</P>

      <P>I hope the Minister will take heed of the few little things I have put to him and carefully consider the question whether it is wise policy to deprive the producers of this country of what they are entitled to, namely, the cost of production plus a fair profit and, at the same time, be looking for more production.  It was an old game with the British Government to keep the farmer about one jump ahead of the bailiff.  They said that he worked harder and produced more in that condition than in any other.  I do not know if it is a wise policy for this Government to try that game.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HarryColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister when listening to Deputy O'Higgins to-night must have said to himself: &ldquo;Heaven save me from my friends.&rdquo;  The Deputy complained that Deputies on this side of the House were ignoring the facts and figures given by the Minister in his opening statement.  But he himself, unfortunately for the Minister, not alone ignored the Minister but also the ex-Minister and other Ministers of the present day.  I am referring to <Col N="2137" /> what he said about the fuel dumps.  I thought we were finished with them. He said that it was all the result of Fianna Fáil policy.  The Minister himself in the Dáil on 17th April, 1947, as reported in Volume 105, column 850, of the Official Reports said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister in so far as he can, side by side with the maximum effort to produce the greatest amount of turf, is just taking the ordinary precautions to build up over this summer.  I know it is not the most suitable time for cutting timber.  I know that timber from now on to October will not be the best for burning, but it is vital, in my opinion, that a big reserve of timber should be built up in the large centres of population.  Otherwise I am afraid that the situation next winter will be infinitely worse&mdash;and that is, God knows, bad enough&mdash; infinitely worse than it was in the winter just passed.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Then we had the Minister for Lands, then Deputy Blowick, on the 2nd July, 1947, as reported in Volume 107, columns 696-7 of the Official Reports saying:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I therefore take this opportunity to point out to the Taoiseach that we are faced with at least as bad a fuel famine in the city as last year, because turf production does not seem to be going on with the same swing as in other years.  We will scarcely have as severe a winter this year so far as cold and snow are concerned, but there definitely will not be sufficient fuel for this city during the coming winter unless active steps are taken now.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When one reads these extracts from the speeches of the Minister and his colleague, the Minister for Lands, one feels that it is a pity that Deputy O'Higgins did not follow the advice that he was giving to members on this side of the House and try to find out what were the views at that time.  If he did he could not have said that it was a legacy as the result of Fianna Fáil policy.  It was the view of most members of this House because of the position that we found during the previous winter.  I think that if Deputy O'Higgins had been here then <Col N="2138" /> he would also have agreed that it was wise to try and get in what fuel we could in view of the position we had in the previous winter.  If it is true that losses have happened it was far wiser to provide for it not knowing what the future was going to bring, even if it meant the loss it did.  The Minister himself, I am sure, will not repudiate his share of responsibility for what happened.  Most of the members of the House agreed with it at the time.  I think it is time that that sort of thing was ended, trying to make out that it was just the result of Fianna Fáil policy.  It was the result of the united wisdom of this House at the time and it is time that suggestion was dropped.</P>
    <P>He told us about the price reductions that the Minister had effected. Most of them are just the result of our returning to normal times following the scarcity of the war.  Those of us who had experience of the previous war know that things gradually adjusted themselves without any price control.  The same thing is happening to-day.  He mentioned the reduction in the price of ready-mades.  I think the ready-mades are dearer than ever they were.  There may be a reduction in the rate of profit but the price to the consumer is dearer than it was some years ago.  That may not be the Minister's fault.  I am not blaming him for that. He has tried to take what steps he could to save the consumer.  What I want to know is what he has done about all the allegations that came from the people on the Government Benches when they were in opposition about the gross profiteering in the drapery trade.  It was dinned into our ears day in and day out about the gross profiteering in the drapery trade. The Minister has now been 16 months in office and, as far as I can see, he has not be able to alter the system of controlled prices by one iota.  He has acted as he thought fit in that but he has not produced to us one sample of gross profiteering in the drapery trade that we heard so much about.  I wonder when those statements are going to be justified or when they are going to be withdrawn.  On a previous occasion here Deputy O'Higgins preached to us about decency in that respect.  Well, <Col N="2139" /> let us have the decency.  If they cannot be justified, let them be withdrawn.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Higgins also referred to his action about the butchers.  I gave my views here on that last year.  I am not going to go into them all again, but I want to say that, as far as I can see, the only thing that was wrong with the butchers was that they were not strong enough to cause trouble.  The Minister told us that the bakers had no case for an increase. However, he gave them their increase after three weeks' strike.  There were several cases during the year of people who had applied for tariffs and did not get them; the paper mills, for instance. But when they started to take action they immediately got the tariff.  We had another case in Cork and we had, only a few weeks ago, the threatened strike in the Electricity Supply Board of the clerical and technical staffs. They had been agitating for a tribunal for years and nothing was done, although the ex-Minister announced here that he had agreed to it before he left office.  When they threatened to strike the Bill was brought in although it had been months on the Order Paper.  From what I see of the Minister's policy the only thing that was wrong about the butchers was that they were not strong enough.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Another thing Deputy O'Higgins referred to is the Fine Gael attitude to industry.  We know what happened to industry in this country when Fine Gael were in power before.  We know the net result of their period in office was that 117 factories closed up in this country.  I <Col N="2140" /> know it happened in my own constituency with factories established over 100 years.  They were let go out of it while they were deciding whether they would or whether they would not give them a tariff, and hundreds of people were thrown out of work.  You ought to be very slow indeed in referring to the Fine Gael industrial policy. I know that the Minister was not reared in that school.  He has had, perhaps, a hard time, considering the position he is in with his colleagues, with the reference about the profiteering manufacturers and so forth.  He has had a job, probably, to try and get industrial development going as he would like it.  I must say, however, I felt disappointed when I heard his statement to-day.  There was certain development shown in it but it seemed to be only the natural development that has been occurring over the few years since the war ended and since materials became available and the natural result of the industrial policy that had been got going by Fianna Fáil.  He had nothing, unfortunately, to show us of some major development during the past year in industry.  I am particularly concerned here about the City of Dublin and the 15,000 unemployed in it at the moment.  There is nothing to offer any one of those for employment in the statement we got to-day&mdash;nothing new.  Apparently some efforts are to be made&mdash;we have to wait to see with what success&mdash;to provide for the rural unemployed under the land reclamation scheme and the rivers scheme and so forth, but there is nothing on earth being offered to provide anything extra for the 15,000 unemployed in Dublin.  Nobody need come along and tell us that these people will not work even if they can get it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had an answer from the Minister for Social Welfare in reply to Deputy McCann only last week and only 26 men out of that number have refused employment over some certain period. So that is not the case in Dublin but there is nothing held out by the Minister's statement to-day to provide work for them.  I hope the Minister will give attention to that fact.  After all, the people in Dublin, the unemployed particularly, have to depend on the Minister <Col N="2141" /> to take them out of their difficulties. They have to depend on his activity in developing industry to try and find the work for them that will give them a means of livelihood.  I hope that he will realise, as he said himself when winding up his statement, that he has the greatest opportunity for advancement at the moment and during the last year that we ever had in our history since this Dáil was founded.  I hope he will take advantage of it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass to-day said that the industrial development policy was not properly defined.  I think that is correct. When one considers the statements that were made by Ministers up to some months ago&mdash;I am glad I have not seen any of them in the last few months and I hope we are at an end of them&mdash; one could not blame industrialists for not wanting to undertake further development. I hope we are now at the stage when efforts will be made to continue the drive for industrial development, and that no attempts will be made to decry it by making accusations against the body of men who have been doing the job.</P>
    <P>There is an industrial advisory authority to be set up.  We do not yet know what its powers will be.  I think the Minister said to-day that it would be fully independent of his Department. I do not know whether that means that it is going to get absolute powers.  I suppose we shall have to wait for information on that until we see the Bill.  Deputy Lemass said that he thought it was a mistake&mdash;and also I think Deputy Larkin&mdash;to have announced the setting up of this body as far back as February when, apparently, the Department was not ready to introduce the necessary legislation.  I am afraid that announcement will result in a &ldquo;wait and see&rdquo; policy on the part of industrialists because they are not going to put more money into enterprise until they know what the position is to be.  For that reason I suggest to the Minister that the Bill should be introduced as early as possible.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy O'Higgins on one point&mdash;I think we are all in agreement <Col N="2142" /> on it now&mdash;and that is in regard to turf development.  Deputy O'Higgins told us that Deputy Lehane referred to this last year.  That is quite correct.  But the Deputies could have read in the turf development programme that was prepared by Fianna Fáil in 1945 or 1946 all the things that were advocated by Deputy Lemass to-day.  Turf development is no new thing on our part.  Even though we got a lot of sneers and jibes from the people opposite we tried turf development in 1934.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HarryColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>But all are agreed to-day that turf development is good national policy.  The emergency showed that to be so.  It is good from the point of view of employment, and it is good to have your own fuel to depend on.  I hope, therefore, that the Minister will give his attention to it and will try to develop it further.  Apparently we are all pretty well united on turf development now.</P>
      <P>As far as I could gather from the Minister's statement about the quantity of machine-won turf that is to be produced within the next five years, the estimated amount is not likely to be anything like sufficient to meet the needs of the people.  Therefore, I suggest to him that he should try and develop the production of hand-won turf.  Turf societies might be able to help in that way.  There were some in existence before the emergency which proved very useful and gave very good value.  Away back in 1934 and 1935 I bought turf through some of those societies and I had no complaint to make about the quality of it.  I admit that we got bad turf during the emergency.  It was that, I think, which put people against turf.  We will have to break down that prejudice, and the producers will have to realise that it was a very wrong thing for them to send to Dublin some of the stuff that they did send.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>And that is what the people in Dublin are concerned with. I think we should all unite to try and get the work done properly on the bogs and have the turf brought in good condition to the consumer.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to-day to the tourist traffic.  When he was speaking, I could not help recalling what we heard some years ago about the tourists&mdash;that they were eating us out of house and home&mdash;though at that time we were getting from the tourists the money which actually enabled us to pay for our food imports.  I am glad that the people opposite seem to have learned something since they went into office.  I hope the Minister will use his best endeavours to develop the tourist industry further. We may have reached the peak in regard to it now, so that I think more organisation will be required in the future to keep up the tourist trade.  I probably will not agree with some of the steps the Minister will take, but I hope that he will do his best.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently, when I listened to the statement that was broadcast here by the representative of E.C.A. about the development of our tourist traffic and the earning of more dollars, I could not help thinking what a pity it was that the Government, as they have done in so many other things, did not reconsider their attitude towards the Atlantic air service which, if in operation, would have earned us more dollars.  Some few weeks ago, I read a statement made by a representative of one of the air lines&mdash;I think it was TWA&mdash;in which he said that they had made a profit of £250,000 on their North Atlantic air route in 1948.  We <Col N="2144" /> were told that if we had started the Atlantic air service, there were bound to be losses, and that we could not afford them.  From the point of view of earning dollars, I think it is a terrible pity that the Government did not reconsider their attitude towards that service as they have done in the case of other things.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to try and use his influence with Córas Iompair Éireann.  I do not suppose he can interfere directly with Córas Iompair Éireann any more than he can with the Electricity Supply Board.  In fact, I do not know what his powers are.  I trust that the Minister will use whatever influence he has so that we can have reconsidered the completion of that engineering shop that was actually being set up to build chassis.  I understand that it has been abandoned under the new régime.  Taken in conjunction with the repairing works for aeroplanes that were contemplated at Collinstown, and that were abandoned last year, the two projects would have provided considerable new employment for craftsmen and would have been a most useful thing to us from the point of view of national defence.  We will have to think of those things in those terms apart from cost until we become a more developed country.  We cannot continue depending on foreigners for what are essentials to us in time of emergency.  We shall have to learn a lessen from the recent emergency and try to provide these things for ourselves. Naturally, they will cost a considerable amount at first, but ultimately those things will pay us well. I appeal to the Minister to examine that matter still further and perhaps he may feel inclined to revise his views on it.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister tell us why petrol is still rationed?  So far as I can see, there is plenty of petrol for all purposes. What is the idea of keeping it rationed?</P>
    <P>He mentioned to-day that the chief trouble in the building industry was a shortage of craftsmen.  I am told that there are as many craftsmen employed in the building trade around Dublin now as were employed before the emergency. <Col N="2145" /> Maybe I am wrong, but that is what I am told.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a very definite shortage.  The real shortage in connection with building is the shortage of skilled workmen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Before dealing in detail with some of the matters arising on this Estimate, I must say I am a little confused as to the relevancy of some matters, notably the cost of living.  It has been customary to deal with that on this Estimate, but I understand there has been a threatened transfer of some functions to other Departments.  I take it, however, that I may discuss on this Estimate what has been customarily discussed on it heretofore, notwithstanding the change in the forms of the Estimate now presented.</P>
      <P>On that basis, then, the first preliminary, I suppose&mdash;and it goes to administration more directly than anything else&mdash;we will raise, is the question of the actual cost of the Minister's Department.  One of the things expected by the country from the Fine Gael Party, whatever about other Parties, was that there would be a reduction in administrative costs, and it is apparent over all the Estimates for this year that such a reduction in cost is not possible.  In fact, for reasons which we dealt with on the Vote on Account and the Budget, it is apparent that administration will cost more than ever, but in this regard there are some matters touching this particular Estimate where we can ask more specific questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One question I would like to ask is, how far administration costs are affected by the machinery for maintaining rationed commodities on the present rationing system, and similar matters, and whether the Minister for Industry and Commerce cannot, the emergency having passed, secure a reorganisation within his own Department with a view to economising in mere administrative tasks.  I purposely put that as a question to the Minister, a question on which I am prepared to take a reasoned answer.  I <Col N="2146" /> am not putting it as an argument, but as a question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>May I draw attention to the fact that we have made very drastic reductions in staff and cost? The Deputy has chosen the worst Estimate he could have chosen to make his point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>On purpose, but I want to approach it from this point of view.  It seems to me the transfers effected in the Supplementary Estimate amount only to some of the savings; they really amount only to a book-keeping device to some extent. But, quite apart from that, I am asking that question as no other speaker has asked it, for this reason, that obviously this is the Department that represents the Department of Supplies as well as the Department of Industry and Commerce.  I am right in that, I take it.  Taking these two Departments as being represented by the Department of Industry and Commerce, it was inevitable that during the war there should have been a greater expansion in that Department rather than in any other Department&mdash;possibly only the Department of Defence would have a comparable expansion in personnel.  The emergency having passed, it should be possible to effect certain substantial reductions here, and one of two things would be expected.</P>
      <P>Normally, one would expect that that reduction in administrative costs should be reflected in the net on the total balance sheet for the State.  On the other hand, as against that, one can readily understand that increased costs in regard to salaries and so forth, and the changes following the war, will largely negative that, and perhaps it would be unreasonable to look for a completely net saving.  The Minister will appreciate that I am trying to be eminently reasonable in this.  I could take the unreasonable attitude that some of his supporters took before the election, namely, that we had a certain cost in a certain year before the war and we should be back to that.  I am not trying to tie the Minister to that, but I will ask him if he can amplify on that point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps if I quoted for the Deputy's information on that point just a short passage from the statement I made when introducing the Estimate it may help him:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Excluding the provision for flour and wheaten meal subsidies and taking account of the other changes effected not only in the current year but last year, the Estimate which I am now presenting to the Dáil shows a net decrease of £3,735,965 as compared with last year.  There are decreases in practically every sub-head of the Vote and in the course of my remarks I will deal with them.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There are decreases in practically every sub-head.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.  I quite appreciate that point.  But the question is whether the decreases shown really reduce the net administrative cost for the State or in how far do they represent something that has merely been taken out of this Vote and transferred into another Vote?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy realises that at the moment I am only answering for this Vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that I could very easily go outside the scope of this debate and be very properly pulled up by the Chair for doing so.  I am interested in finding out how far this represents a net saving to the State. If the Minister can make a net saving of that nature within the Department, he is obviously then working the Department more efficiently and, if that is so, I am as anxious as anybody else to congratulate him.  But my congratulations would be premature if this saving really represents a transfer and if there is some increased expenditure under some other Vote.  I know the Minister can say very quickly that I am quite competent to study the Estimates. The fact is, however, that no matter how deeply one studies these Estimates one finds it difficult to appreciate fully the exact figures.  Perhaps between now and the time the debate concludes the Minister will tell us how much liability exactly has been transferred on the purely administrative side and <Col N="2148" /> how much has been completely eliminated and how much of that survives under some other head.</P>
      <P>From the Minister's opening remarks I understand that we had a subsidy on wheat and the general control over the import of wheat has now been transferred to the Minister for Agriculture. I am perfectly sure that on that particular activity there is a certain saving as far as the Minister for Industry and Commerce is concerned. I am also equally satisfied that there must have been some staff engaged on that particular work because of the complexity of the import of that commodity, apart altogether from the distribution of it and the attaching to it of a subsidy with special emphasis on the adjustment made by the present Government to differentiate between one type of flour and another.  I feel that all that involved a considerable staff.  In view of the transfer of that particular section to the Department of Agriculture that staff I take it either has or has not been taken out of this Vote.  I question that again because the Minister said that he would allow this to be accounted for in his Vote in the present financial year.  I may be wrong in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The reference I made was with relation to the transfer of the Statistics Branch to the Taoiseach. So far as the transfer of flour and wheatmeal is concerned, when these functions were transferred to the Department of Agriculture there was, at the same time, a transfer of personnel necessary to operate that scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister.  To that extent, then, we must have some doubt as to the reliability of the apparent saving shown on this Vote.  I simply want to know from the Minister if he can explicitly show that there is an actual net saving in administration without any loss of efficiency.  Can he also show, at the same time, that that net saving does not merely represent a transfer into another Vote?  If the position really is that there has been no change, but merely a transfer, I think we should be told on some other <Col N="2149" /> Vote as to what that actually represents. It is questionable if good service can be reduced under administrative costs.  We must be reasonable in our approach to that.  The trouble is that in the past people were not always reasonable about the expenditure involved in giving good service and in running the schemes for which so many people clamoured.  It is no harm to point out that when these schemes are put into operation at the instigation of those who clamour for them they involve a certain cost. Perhaps the Minister would give us some specific information on this?  I do not expect him to give us that information to-night, but perhaps he he would have it available before the end of the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of other matters which arise on this Estimate.  I could follow Deputy Michael O'Higgins by giving the debate an unpleasant turn, but I do not want to do that.  I do not want to go back on what was done or was not done.  I think I could start with a more favourable handicap than Deputy O'Higgins in that respect.  I do not make these remarks for the purpose of scoring debating points at the expense of Deputy O'Higgins.  I merely want to divert what I have to say into the proper channel.  Two large problems, amongst others, loom up for the Minister for Industry and Commerce. Briefly, they are two problems <Col N="2150" /> of which the ordinary citizen is acutely aware.  One is the problem of finding the wherewithal to live, or earning a sufficient wage which will enable the ordinary worker to live, and the other is the problem of ensuring that that wage can purchase the wherewithal to live.  More succinctly, they are the problems of the cost of living and unemployment. These two problems are in urgent need of attention.  Though the Minister can possibly show a favourable trend in certain respects, the fact is that the repercussions of such a favourable trend are not felt amongst the rank and file.  The important step then is to hasten the beneficial results of that favourable trend so that the ordinary people may benefit and benefit immediately.  Now, in order to do that one is compelled to trace back the history of some of this problem and the history of statistics in relation to it.  I think the only fair statistics on which to work are a consistent set, and the only consistent set that I can find available are those published in our own <i>Trade Journal and Statistical Bulletin.</i></P>
