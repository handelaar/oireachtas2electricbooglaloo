      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will consider introducing proposals for legislation to <Col N="966" /> increase the salaries of clerks to old age pension committees, having regard to their present totally inadequate remuneration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Revision of the salaries of clerks to old age pension committees does not require the introduction of legislation.  In February, 1948, a decision to increase by 33? per cent., with retrospective effect to 1st April, 1947, the amount available for such salaries in each pension committee area was conveyed to the clerk of each old age pension committee and sub-committee. The question of a further adjustment is at present under review.</P>

    <P>From 7th April, 1947, non-manual workers whose remuneration exceeded in annual value a rate of £250, but not a rate of £500 became insurable under the Acts.  In the foregoing calculation there has been added to the income for 1947 the estimated amount that would have been paid by these persons if they had been insurable in the first quarter of that year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>As from the 4th October, 1948, the rates of contributions under the Unemployment Insurance Acts were raised and non-manual workers employed at a rate of remuneration exceeding in annual value £250 but not exceeding £500 became insurable under these Acts for the first time.  In consequence, the unemployment insurance contribution income in 1948 does not provide a basis of comparison with 1947 as an index of <Col N="968" /> employment unless allowance is made for these changes.  An investigation is in progress at the moment with a view to estimating their effect and so enabling a proper comparison to be made, and if the Deputy will repeat his question in a few weeks from now I hope to be in a position to give a fuller reply.</P>

    <P>Thirty of these appeals have been received since the beginning of this year, the balance of 11 having been received during 1948.  In the latter cases difficulty has been experienced in obtaining all the facts necessary for the proper determination of the appeals.  Special steps are being taken to expedite clearance of these cases and I expect they will be cleared in the next month or so.</P>

      <P>Separate figures for persons leaving the State to take up employment are not available, but the number of travel identity cards and passports granted during the year 1948 to persons intending to go abroad for employment or permanent residence was 40,075, of whom 12,759 were from urban and 27,316 from rural areas.  The 1948 figures include, for the first time, persons going abroad for permanent residence, as well as those going abroad for employment.</P>
      <P>As has frequently been pointed out before, statistics of this kind do not reflect accurately the volume of emigration, as they do not take account of returning workers, of seasonal migratory workers or of persons who, after obtaining travel documents, do not leave the country.</P>
      <P>The net emigration is more clearly reflected by the statistics of passengers entering and leaving the State by rail, road, ship and aircraft.  For the year 1948, these figures show a net balance outwards of 12,793.</P>

      <P>Yes, my attention has been drawn to a series of articles and photographs which have been published in the <i>Irish Press,</i> and I did have inquiries made regarding the particulars that were given.  It is rather extraordinary that out of 17 names and nine photographs, without names, there were only three genuine cases of emigrants.  The position, in relation to a number of the persons whose names and photographs were published, was that they were people who had actually emigrated to Britain some years before and were returning here on their way <Col N="970" /> to America.  In the case of a photograph of nine girls, these were postulants from a convent who had come from France and were on their way to the United States.</P>

On the contrary, I deplore the fact that there is emigration, but I do think that propaganda of that kind is not helpful, and that it is also sometimes damaging and hurtful to the people who are concerned. There were also, among the names and photographs, some names and photographs of persons who were not even citizens, and of persons who were going to America for business, not as emigrants.</P>

      <P>The period for repayment of advances made to tenants for the purchase of their holdings under the Purchase of Land (Ireland) Act, 1885, commonly called the &ldquo;Ashbourne Act&rdquo;, was 49 years from the date of the advance.</P>
      <P>Under the provisions of Section 25 of the Land Act of 1896 tenant purchasers became entitled to three decadal revisions of the land purchase annuity.  On each revision the advance was reduced by the amount of sinking fund accumulated during the previous decade and the annuity was recalculated on the balance of the advance then outstanding.  In this way the annuity was reduced but the period of repayment began afresh from the date of each decadal revision.</P>
      <P>These revisions were carried out automatically unless the tenant made application to the Land Commission that the annuity be not reduced.</P>
      <P>The great majority of tenants accepted all three decadal reductions and in such cases the period of repayment was extended to 79 years from the date of the advance.</P>

      <P>Am I to take it that in the event of farmers in the flax-growing areas growing flax they will do so without any assurance whatever of their being able to obtain the prices offered by the Northern spinners?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only say to the Deputy that in the statement to which I have referred him, having set out the facts, I went on to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The proposal to raise the price of flax to the Northern Ireland farmers by 4/- a stone at the same time as the price for Irish flax is to be reduced by 2/6 a stone is so obviously and offensively inequitable that the Minister for Agriculture cannot accept any responsibility for such an arrangement.</P>
      <P>Farmers, accordingly, are strongly advised to employ land reserved for flax to sow other crops.</P>
      <P>Anyone who wishes to grow flax for sale on the terms proposed, that is, 32/- per stone for grade 5 dam retted hand scutched flax, is, of course, perfectly free to do so and take his chance of being able to sell after the harvest but, if anyone does so, he does it at his own risk and in the full knowledge that the Department of Agriculture does not recommend it and can give no assurance whatever of a satisfactory market for it.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That advice, I can assure the Deputy, is given only after the most careful reflection, and with the desire to ensure that no farmer to whom we are responsible will be left to the tender mercies of the flax spinners with whom every conceivable effort has been made to reach a reasonable agreement, but with whom, as far as I can see, it is quite impossible to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>How can the Minister justify his failure to effect an agreement with the Northern Ireland spinners on the grounds of a discrepancy as between the price offered here and that paid to the Six-County growers, in view of the fact that other <Col N="981" /> agricultural produce is disposed of by us on foot of an agreement made by him providing for prices less than those obtainable by Northern Ireland and British farmers, say in the case of eggs, beef and other farm produce?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy probably has not appreciated the significance of the fact that the Northern Ireland spinners raised the price of flax for their own growers and at the same time reduced the price of flax here.  The Northern Ireland spinners, for the first time, sought to introduce the principle of a limited market on our farmers while, in collaboration with the Stormont Government, there was to be an unlimited market for the growers of Northern Ireland.  I cannot see that the Government of this country should collaborate in an arrangement of that character, which appears to me to be obviously and offensively inequitable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to introduce a scheme of the kind mentioned by the Deputy, but, as the Deputy is aware, extensive credit facilities for this <Col N="982" /> purpose are readily available from the Agricultural Credit Corporation, where adequate evidence of solvency and intention to repay is available on behalf of the would-be borrower.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that a considerable amount of capital is necessary to enable a farmer to change over from the growing of crops to the production of live stock and that, at the present time, there is no source of wealth available to the ordinary average farmer to finance such an operation?  I have personal knowledge that the Agricultural Credit Corporation turned down applicants who offered a first charge on their farms as security.  Surely, if a farm is worth £1,000 or £2,000 it ought to be sufficient security for a loan of £200 or £300.</P>

That is all, I think, it is fair to ask me to do at this stage.  I am certain that if that evidence is forthcoming the credit will be readily available.

As it will take some months to secure the additional staff required to apply the scheme to the whole of the country, I propose to have it operated at first in as many counties as can be covered by the staff who can be obtained at short notice.  As more staff becomes available, the scheme will be extended until it embraces the entire country, but, subject to the limitations likely to arise as a consequence of difficulty in securing the necessary manpower, it is intended to make a start in eight counties, namely, Carlow, Sligo, Kilkenny, Leitrim, Louth, Wexford, Wicklow, Monaghan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if, having regard to the disparity in price between this country and England for limestone flour and to the big demand amongst farmers for this fertiliser, he will restore the subsidy which was in operation up to 1948 in order to enable farmers to purchase this commodity at an economic price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to recommend any subsidy on ground limestone because as a result of encouragement given to private enterprise we have succeeded in creating supplies of ground limestone in Ireland at a price <Col N="984" /> per ton lower than in any other country in Europe.</P>
      <P>Ground limestone is available at 15/per ton at the quarry from some suppliers and at 16/- per ton at the quarry from other suppliers at the present time.  The corresponding price in Great Britain is certainly no lower if it is not higher.</P>
      <P>Ground limestone delivered and spread at the rate of two tons per acre costs 26/- per ton within ten miles of the quarry in Ireland and 1/- per ton for each additional five miles up to 40 miles.  The corresponding rate in Great Britain is 29/4 and I believe that in addition a very large subsidy is payable to the distributor.  Ground limestone delivered in 20 ton lots in bulk by road is available at 30/- per ton up to 100 miles from the quarry in Ireland and proportionately less for shorter distances.  In Great Britain the charge is at least 36/6 80 miles from the quarry and the vendor also receives a substantial subsidy.</P>
      <P>It will be therefore seen, particularly in view of our past experience in subsidising ground limestone, that far from reducing the cost to the farmer the giving of subsidies on this product has invariably tended to increase the farmer's cost.</P>

      <P>(a) The number of glasshouses planted in the Connemara unit of the Gaeltacht Glasshouse Scheme in 1948 was 63; (b) the average weight of tomatoes produced per house was 17½ cwts.; (c) it is not possible to give a figure which would accurately represent the &ldquo;average cost of administration&rdquo; of a Connemara glasshouse. These houses constitute one of the units of the Gaeltacht Glasshouse Scheme and the overhead administrative costs are charged to the scheme as a whole.  Moreover, while a number of the central and local officers of my Department have to devote their whole time to the scheme, others give only part of their time to it, and there are certain general services in my Department which are common to all divisions of the Department's work.  It is quite impossible to apportion these on any sort of costing basis.  The growers do not have to bear any of the overhead administrative costs of the scheme, which are considerable.  They refund only part of the prime costs, or running charges.  The amounts recoverable from the growers are at present being worked out from the accounting records so that a final settlement may be made with each grower in respect of last year's operations.  It is estimated that about £16 will be recoverable from each grower; (d) the average value of tomatoes per house after deduction of agent's commission was £110.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but I want to give the experiment the fullest possible opportunity of success.  As the Deputy probably knows, I have already directed that the full horticultural direction and assistance which was to terminate at the end of this financial year is to be extended for a further financial year so that no possibility of lack of skill or foresight could imperil the success of the experiment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.D. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether he will arrange to give preference to unemployed tillage inspectors when recruiting staff for the farm buildings improvement scheme and the new land reclamation scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No tillage inspectors have become unemployed and none are now unemployed.</P>
      <P>Since the institution of compulsory tillage a considerable number of temporary tillage supervisors were employed every year.  It was the practice prior to 1948 to declare most of these supervisors redundant about July each year and to re-employ such of their number as were suitable when the next tillage season opened.</P>
      <P>In 1948, however, when they became redundant in the ordinary course of events, measures were initiated to procure alternative employment for them and instructions given that in future vacancies in the Department of Agriculture's unestablished service, they were to receive preferential consideration where they proved suitable for the available employment.  This instruction remains in force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister tell the House how many of these temporary supervisors secured employment other than employment in his Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I could not.  We make it a strict rule not to inquire into the personal affairs of these men when they are not in the employment of the Department, but a record is kept of their names, and, when temporary employment which may prove suitable to them is available, they will be communicated with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that many of these supervisors are known to have emigrated since he dismissed them last August?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not get that impression, but, if it is so, perhaps they will come home again when we have work to give them, which, I expect, will be in the course of the present financial year.</P>

      <P>The yields per acre for wheat harvested in 1946 and 1947 were 14.4 hundredweights and 10.8 hundredweights, respectively.  The yield for 1948 has not yet been ascertained.  The quantities delivered to the mills in each of the years mentioned were as follows: 1946, 2,524,514 barrels; 1947, 1,463,207 barrels; 1948, 2,463,613 barrels, and, taking 4 per cent. of the deliveries up to the 26th February as probable delivery between the 26th February and the end of the cereal year, we may expect total deliveries in respect of the 1948 crop to be 2,560,000 barrels, which would be the highest of any of the three years mentioned in the Deputy's question, and the highest of the last 15 years, with the exception of 1945-46.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The replies to the several parts of this question are as follows: (a) all netting in freshwater is prohibited under the Fisheries Act, 1939, the relevant provision of which (Section 35) came into operation on 1st January, 1948.  It is not feasible to state precisely the number of fisheries affected, but it is probably about 70; (b) in some cases, net fisheries, rod fisheries and/or weir fisheries in the same ownership had been combined for purposes of valuation and separate assessments have not yet been announced; (c) and (d) actual disbursement of compensation has not yet been made in any case, but negotiations are in progress with several claimants; (e) the basis of compensation must of necessity be related to the particular circumstances of each case.</P>

    <P>(The figures for 1948/49 include estimates or the month of March, 1949).</P>
    <P>I should point out that the bulk of employment schemes are carried out during the months November to March, more particularly in the rural areas, in which the Employment Period Orders operate during the remainder of the year.  For this reason, an average figure for the whole year might convey a wrong impression.  Also, I should say that as each workman for the most part gets a spell of only six to 12 weeks' employment, the total number of individual workmen engaged on employment schemes during the course of the year would be probably four times as many as the average numbers shown above.</P>

The employees in question are among a number of general classes in the Kildare area whose wages are not directly affected by agreements governing the wages of outside employees in the building industry.

As bearing generally on the subject of the inquiry I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to circulate in the Official Report a statement giving the numbers, classified by sex and county of residence, of new travel permits and passports granted in 1947 to persons to go abroad to take up employment and for the year 1948 the numbers of new travel identity cards and passports <Col N="1000" /> granted to persons to go abroad to take up employment or permanent residence.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The following table shows the numbers, classified by sex and county of residence, of new travel permits and passports granted in the year 1947 to persons to go abroad to take up employment and for the year 1948 the numbers of new travel identity cards and passports granted to persons to go abroad to take up employment or permanent residence.</P>

      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £5,250 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1949, for Payments under the Vocational Education Acts, 1930 to 1947, and for other purposes connected with Technical Instruction and Continuation Education.</P>
      <P>The increased cost arises under sub-head B&mdash;Annual Grant to Vocational Education Committees&mdash;and under sub-head G&mdash;Payments under certain Acts that deal with superannuation and marriage gratuities to officers of vocational education committees. Under sub-head B an additional £5,800 will be required.  This is required in connection with increases of salaries and wages from the 1st November, 1948, by reason of the increased payments based on a cost-of-living bonus of 290 as against 270.  The additional moneys that will have to be paid by the State to the vocational committees will be £5,800.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under sub-head G an additional sum of £2,200 will be required.  Death gratuities became payable for the first time on the coming into operation on the 14th January, 1948, of the Local Government (Superannuation) Act of <Col N="1006" /> 1948.  No provision had been made in the Estimate for this contingency, as the Bill was not law when the Estimate was being prepared.  It is estimated that something like three death gratuities will have to be paid before the end of this year, at a cost of £1,416. An additional sum of about £800 will be required because the number of marriage gratuities that will be paid this year is higher than the normal number.  The average number of marriage gratuities paid to officers leaving the service on marriage over the last five years was 18 per annum.  It is estimated this year that marriage gratuities will have to be paid in 38 cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (General Mulcahy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the National School Teachers' Superannuation (Amendment) Scheme, 1948, made by the Minister for Education, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, be confirmed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal provisions of these regulations are contained in paragraphs 5 to 10.  Paragraph 5 deals with the matter discussed here when the 1947 <Col N="1007" /> amendment of the superannuation scheme was being dealt with.  Briefly, the position is that primary schools conducted by the Irish Christian Brothers did not become national schools until the years 1925-26.  Some of the lay teachers in these schools had given service previously which cannot at present be counted for pension as the schools were not national schools. It has since been felt that these teachers had a strong claim for recognition of that service and the paragraph now gives them two-thirds credit for pension purposes for such service, as in the case of lay teachers at that time in national schools.  Something similar was done for the teachers in industrial schools when the 1942 amendment was being passed.</P>
    <P>The teachers who were on strike in 1946 received no salary for that period and, consequently, as the existing schemes stand, have lost the time for pension purposes.  This paragraph provides that in the case of those teachers who resumed duty at the conclusion of the strike the period of absence shall be reckonable as pensionable service for the purposes of the superannuation schemes.  Incremental credit, for which authority of the Oireachtas is not required, has already been allowed and the present scheme gives the teachers pensionable credit for that period.  The cost of this concession is inconsiderable and I am sure that, at this hour of the day, the House will agree with the proposal.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 7 prescribes that service after the age of 65 years shall not be pensionable.  Normally, all teachers retire not later than 65, but there are cases from time to time where permission to serve beyond that age, or to re-employ those who had retired at 65 has to be given owing to a shortage of teachers in perhaps a particular area or at a particular time of the year.  The teacher who is continued after 65 will, of course, draw his appropriate salary for such service but it is a rounding off of the pension scheme that is being arranged here, that is, that service after 65 will not be reckonable for pension purposes.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 8 is an &ldquo;abatement&rdquo;<Col N="1008" /> clause.  It is customary in official superannuation schemes to provide that, where a pensioner is re-employed in some other capacity and remunerated out of State moneys, the remuneration of the new post shall not raise his income from the two sources beyond that on which the pension was based.  A provision of this kind has operated for secondary teachers since 1929 and this paragraph now brings it into force for national school teachers. Existing pensions will not, however, be affected by its terms.  Lest there should be any misunderstanding from the insertion of the words in brackets &ldquo;otherwise than as a teacher,&rdquo; I should like to make it clear that these words do not mean that a pensioner who becomes a teacher may draw his pension pay without reference to the restrictions which the paragraph imposes.</P>
    <P>The fact is that these restrictions are already imposed by existing schemes on a teacher pensioner who resumes duty as a teacher in a national school and what the paragraph does is to extend the restriction which already applies to them if they were teaching in a national school to other State employment.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 9 brings the pension scheme for teachers into accordance with the new scales introduced on the 31st October, 1946.  In the case of a school teacher who retires, or retired, within three years after the 31st October, 1946, when the present salary scheme came into operation, whatever pension or gratuity he was entitled to will be based wholly on the new scales. Under the existing schemes the computation of pension or gratuity is based on the average annual salary for the three years preceding the date of retirement; as a result teachers retiring within the three year period in question suffer by reason of the award being based, for part of the three-year period accruing before the 31st October, 1946, on the lower salary scales then in force.  This disability has been the subject of representations and the paragraph now proposed removes this disability in full so that any teacher retiring since 31st October, 1946, will receive the full benefit of the improved scales in his pension or gratuity.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1009" /> Paragraph 10 affects marriage gratuities. They are at present based on the average annual salary for the three years ending on the quarter day before marriage.  As women teachers do not always marry immediately after resignation, it has not infrequently happened that the date of retirement falls in one quarter and the marriage in another.  The paragraph brings the calculation in these cases into line with other awards, such as pension, disablement gratuity or death gratuity by making the date of retirement the determining factor in fixing the amount of the gratuity.</P>
    <P>I ask the Dáil formally to confirm the resolution.</P>

Tá aoisliúntas i gcás múinteoirí agus i gcás gach saghas seirbhíseach eile bunaithe ar sheirbhís agus muna dtugann an múinteoir nó an seirbhíseach <Col N="1010" /> an tseirbhís sin, ní fhéadfaidh sé aoisliúntas i gcóir an ama sin d'fháil. Agus cé go bhféadfaidh sé bheith inphinsinach go hiomlán do réir dlí don am roimh dul ar stailc dó agus taréis dó teacht ar ais ag obair, caillfidh sé an méid a bheadh ag dul dó de bharrpinsin ins an tréimhse bhí sé ar stailc muna ndéanfaí leasú mar atá dá dhéanamh ins an scéim seo.</P>
      <P>Deireann an tAire nach bhfuil suim mhór airgid i gceist.  Ní dóigh liom gur ceist airgid ar fad é, ach bhí cás againn cheana ins an Stát, daoine a chuaigh amach ar stailc, dream faoi leith in Oifig an Phoist, agus cé nach raibh siad ach tamall gearr amuigh níor dearnadh aon rud go ceann tamall fada blianta.

      <P>D'fhéadfaí a rá nach bhfuil na múinteoirí náisiúnta ar aon dul leis na StátSheirbhísí ach dream ana-thábhactach is ea iad agus tá súil agam nach mbeifí ag dearcadh ar an leasú seo mar &ldquo;precedent&rdquo; agus nach mbeidh sé le tuiscint ag aon dream, líon mór nó foireann mhór de dhaoine atá ag fáil tuarastail ó chiste an Stáit, go bhfuil cead acu dul ar stailc má tá siad míshásta leis na coinníollacha a bhfuil siad ag obair fútha nó leis an tuarastal agus nuair a bheas an stailc thart, pe'r bith breithiúnas bheas ann sa deireadh, go bhfuighidh siad lánmhaithiúnas, agus mar sin de.  Má fógraítear dóibh go bhfuighid lánmhaithiúnas agus nach gcaillfidh siad aon rud agus go bhfuighidh siad na cirt chéanna fé is dá mbeadh siad ag obair in ionad bheith ar stailc, ní dóigh liom gur sompla maith é nó go bhféadfaí bheith ag súil go mbeadh siad sásta gan dúl isteach in obair mar sin go dtí go mbeadh machnamh ceart déanta acu agus ar na torthaí a bheas ann.</P>

    <P>Tá fhios agam gur chaill na múinteoirí an tuarastal a bheadh ag dul dóibh faoi na scála nua má ghlach siad leo roimh an stailc nó aon am i rith na stailce.  Má dhéanann an leasú seo maitheas sa tslí go ndéanfaidh sé go mbeidh obair níos éifeachtúla dá dhéanamh agus go mbeidh suaimhneas agus síocháin ins an tseirbhís, is dócha <Col N="1011" /> go bhféadfaí a rá gur rud maith é.  Tá súil agam go ndéanfaidh sé maitheas sa tslí sin agus go bhfeicfidh na múinteoirí nach bhfuil éinne in a gcoinne, mar mhúinteoirí.  D'fhéadfaimis ár dtuairmí bheith againn faoi stailceanna agus cumainn mhóra chumasacha thábhachtacha i saol na tíre ag dul amach ar stailc ach, mar a dúirt mé, nuair a bhí an stailc ar siúl, agus mar a theaspáin mé i rith na stailce, níor theastaigh uainn aon phionós a chur ar na múinteoirí nó níor theastaigh uainn go mbeadh aon tsearbhas eadrainn, go ndéanfaimis ár ndícheall chun oideachas na tíre a chur chun cinn, obair mos fearr a dhéanamh sna scoileanna agus, go mór mór, cúis na Gaeilge a chur ar aghaidh mar ba chóir&mdash;ní hamháin an Ghaeilge a mhúineadh, ach an sprid cheart a thabhairt do na daltaí scoile ionas go bhfeicfeadh siad go bhfuil níos mó sa nGaeilge ná ábhar scoile, gur rud mór í i saol an Náisiúin agus, má cailltear í, nach féidir í a thabhairt ar ais.  Má tá grá ag na páistí don teanga agus má gheibheann siad deashompla ó na múinteoirí éireoidh i bhfad níos fearr leis an obair.</P>
    <P>Ritheann Alt a 6 le Alt a 9, is dóigh liom.  Is dóigh liom gur buntáiste é sin go bhféadfaimis uilig bheith fabharach dó, sé sin, múinteoirí a bheadh ag dul amach ar pinsean agus a chaillfeadh rud éigin mar gheall ar an stailc, nach gcaillfidís aon rud anois má ghlacann an tOireachtas le huimhir a 9 den scéim.</P>
    <P>Mar gheall ar uimhir a 8, níl aon rud le rá agam ach amháin, do réir dealraimh, má gheibheann múinteoir post faoin Rialtas mar chigire scol go mbeidh ísliú ar an tuarastal a gheobhaidh sé má tá pinsin á fháil aige cheana féin.  Déanfar laghdú ar an tuarastal dá réir.</P>

Is oth liom, agus ba chóir gur thrua leis an Dáil, gur labhair an Teachta Ó Deirg fé mar a labhair sé.

Níl de lucht agamsa ar a bhfuil dhá dhéanamh aige ach nach bhfuil an cheist mhór dá réiteach aige: an cheist atá ag déanamh buartha do na múinteoirí agus do na hiar-mhúinteoirí ar fad&mdash;ceist na bpinsean. Má theastaíonn uainn an Ghaeilge d'aithbheochaint, caithfaimid a thuiscint, gur ar na múinteoirí, go mór-mhór na múinteoirí náisiúnta, ata sábháilt na Gaeilge ag braith.  Ní deirim gur orthu ar fad mar ní féidir sábháilt na Gaeilge a chur ar na daltaí scoile agus ar na múinteoiri amach is amach agus a rá nach é gnó aoinne eile é, ach caithfimid a thuiscint go mbraitheann sábháilt na teangan ar na múinteoirí. Dá bhrí sin, measaim aon rud a dhéanfas an tAire ar mhaithe leis na múinteoirí agus a thiubhras dóchas dóibh as an Roinn agus as an Aire, gur maith an rud é.  Is trua liom gur labhair an Teachta Ó Deirg mar a labhair sé.  Ní dhéanfaidh caint mar sin maitheas don tír ná maitheas do chúis na teangan agus ní thiubhraidh sé cabhair nó meanman do na múinteoirí i gcóir na Gaeilge.</P>

      <Col N="1013" /> I have very little to say except that to the limited extent to which the motion deals with the question of teachers' pensions, that is in so far as it confirms the Minister's previously announced scheme, I think it should be recommended.  I would deprecate in the strongest manner possible the attitude of Deputy Derrig in seeking to suggest to the Minister that the service of those teachers who were forced out on strike through the attitude of the Government, of which Deputy Derrig was a member, should not be properly recognised for pension purposes.</P>

If there was one bad day's work for which Deputy Derrig, the then Minister for Education, was responsible when the strike was over, it was the decision of the Government of which Deputy Derrig was a member and of Deputy Derrig's Department, to pay a special bonus to the scabs and black-legs who remained at their posts.</P>

      <P>He devoted 40 years of his life to education, but for a considerable portion of these 40 years he was also prominently identified with the national movement.  As the Minister knows, he served his country and served it well.  Nevertheless, when he retired on pension a year or two ago, he was not given credit for 40 years' service but only for a term of 18 or 20 years, and he received a pension of only 30/- a week.  I know his case will have the sympathy of this House and I should like to know whether this scheme will give to ex-Alderman Frank Cahill, ex-T.D., credit for the service which he rendered with the <Col N="1014" /> Christian Brothers in Seville Place as a lay teacher, though I believe that service was not recognised by the National Commissioners under the British régime.  On account of the circumstances generally and the fact that Mr. Cahill was so prominently associated with the national movement, I would ask that, if he cannot be given credit for a full 40 years' service under this scheme, he should at least get a reasonable pension instead of the pension on which he was retired about two years ago, a pension, I think, of about 30/- a week.</P>

      <P>Is ea tuigim gur bé atá faoi dhíospóireacht againn ná scéim pinsin na múinteoirí a chuaidh ar stailc sa bhliain 1946, agus ar briseadh an tréimhse orthu chun críocha a bpinsin.  Níor cheart don Teachta Conn Ó Liatháin a rá go bhfuil an Teachta Ó Deirg i gcoinne na scéime seo ná go nduírt sé aon ní na coinne ná go bhfuil éinne ar na binnsí seo na coinne, ach, dar ndóigh, ní féidir a thógaint ar an Teachta Ó Deirg ná ar éinne againn-ne má thagraimíd do sheirbhísigh eile an Stáit agus conas a luighfidh agus imreoidh an scéim seo orthu san má bhíonn stailc i gceist aon uair.</P>
      <P>Maidir leis na Bráithre Críostúla, ní ceart go mbeadh aon difríocht idir iad-san agus múinteoirí eile maidir le scéim pinsin nó aoisliúntais.  Dá mbeadh aon rud mar sin i gceist ba cheart gur ar thaobh na mBráthar a bheadh sé mar níl dream múinteoirí in Éirinn a bhfuil an oiread san a dhéanamh acu ar son na Gaeilge, agus go mór n ór ar son labhairt na Teangan, ná na Bráithre Críostúla.</P>

Looking at it from that point of view I take it that no grievance has been raised and that there is some measure of approval by the teachers' organisation.  I think there is a substantial measure of justice contained in these new regulations in so far as they provide that those teachers&mdash;one might say, all the teachers&mdash;in Dublin who participated in the strike will lose no service from the point of view of pension for the period they were on strike.  That is a measure of justice that ought to be written into the regulations as it has been done.  While that period is over and I do not think it is wise to say anything that might cause any recriminations, it is my sincere wish that through proper co-operation between the Department and the teachers a situation such as is provided for in this particular paragraph of the regulations will never occur again.  I, therefore, welcome this motion.</P>

Sin é díreach an rud atá in ár n-aigne.</P>
      <P>Deputy Byrne raised a particular question with regard to paragraphs. The position is that, up to 1934, the untrained and trained principal and assistant teachers had to pay a contribution to their pension fund.  After 1934 that ceased and people who had not been paying pension contributions before 1934 were given credit to the extent of two-thirds of their service up to 1934 for pension purposes although they were not making any contribution to the fund.  In the case of the teachers who came in from the Christian Brothers they only came in under the Board of Education from a date in 1925, 1926 or 1927.  The scheme did arrange that from 1st January, 1927, the lay teachers who were teaching under the Christian Brothers and who made no contribution up to 1934 would be granted for pension purposes two-thirds of the service for the period from 1927 to 1934, the same as was granted to lay teachers in convent and monastery schools and to certain other people.  This now makes provision that the limit date of 1st January, 1927, will be removed and that such service as was given before that date in such a case as the Deputy mentions and some other cases will not be restricted to 1st January, 1927, and if, after the date upon which they were 18 years of age and prior to 1st January, 1927, they did give service they will be allowed to count for pension purposes two-thirds of the period of that service in the same way as they were allowed to count for pension purposes two-thirds of the period between 1927 and 1934 when the contributory scheme was wiped out.  To the extent to which service was given before 1st January, 1927, and if the teacher has attained the age of 18 years, one-third of that period will count for service for the purpose of increasing the amount of the pension that will be granted in future.</P>

The question of the pensioners who retired before the new scheme came into operation has been mentioned, properly and sympathetically, although perhaps the Chair has a right to rule that it is not under discussion here.  I can only reiterate that that matter is having the purposeful consideration of the Government at present and that I hope it will not be long before it will be possible to make a statement on the matter.  The action that is being taken in ameliorating the conditions under this scheme is an earnest of the Government's desire to deal with the case of pensioned teachers in the most equitable possible way.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time. This is a Bill for the purpose of dealing with a very simple matter, but a very difficult matter.  It is a Bill which has been particularly difficult to draft. The position is that a youthful offender who is 12 years of age and under 17 and who is convicted, whether on indictment or by a district court, of an offence punishable in the case of an adult with penal servitude or imprisonment, may be sent to a reformatory school, in addition to and in lieu of any other punishment.  Then, again, young persons are committed to an industrial school for begging; for being found wandering or destitute; if their parents are neglectful; for nonattendance at schools; if they are known to be frequenting evil company, or if they are living in circumstances dangerous to their moral well-being. There is no minimum age of committal. The maximum age of committal is 15 and the maximum age of retention is 16 but, in certain circumstances, on the representation of the manager of the <Col N="1019" /> school that it is desirable to keep the child for another year, namely, until 17, the Minister may authorise the retention of the child for the year.</P>
      <P>Now the necessity for this Bill arises in the first place in connection with young girls under 15 who are known to have been sexually contaminated or who are living in circumstances dangerous to their moral character.  As the law is at present, these girls cannot be committed to reformatory schools because they have not been convicted of any indictable offence. They may be committed to industrial schools, but the managers of those schools either refuse to accept them or, if they accept them, they refuse to retain them.  Where there is a child of that particular kind who cannot be dealt with as a reformatory case and can only be dealt with as an industrial case we want to have some means for dealing with that child where there is a refusal by the industrial school to take it or where, as Deputies will admit, it is undesirable that it should be put into an industrial school.  After special consultation with the religious authorities, there is a particular school provided for in this Bill and the Bill is for the purpose of being able to commit to this particular school a child who normally would be committed to an industrial school but who, by reason of sexual contamination or contact of one kind or another, it is undesirable should be placed there, but nevertheless has to be put in a place where it will be properly trained and properly taken care of.  The authorities of the school to which this Bill refers are particularly skilled in work of this kind and, as I say, the Bill is intended to provide machinery for getting out of that very difficult but easily understood difficulty.</P>

This problem is a serious one.  I can see that it is not a matter to be dealt with by the Minister.  He is concerned only, so to speak, with the accommodation for people dealt with by law, and they come under the control of another Minister.  I agree with the Minister that the matter is complicated and difficult, and that it is wise to segregate these particular people from those others in the industrial schools.  I think that is a wise thing to do.  Subject to the question which I asked the Minister at the outset, I am strongly in favour of this Bill.</P>

Ach bíonn <Col N="1021" /> na cailíní seo lag-intinneach agus caithfimid bheith ag brath ar na mná oilte tuigsionacha atá i mbun na hoibre, faoi an rud is ceart a dhéanamh chun iad a leigint amach nó iad a choimeád.  Níl an tAire ag iarraidh ach iad a choiméad go mbeid 17 mbliana d'aois.  Cheap mise go raibh cead aige iad a choimeád go dtí 18 bliana d'aois.  Nuair a bhí an Criminal Law Amendment Act faoi dhíospóireacht anseo, cheap a lán daoine go mba chóir an aois d'ardú go dtí 18 mbliana nó níos mó.</P>

      <P>Má tá am ag an Aire breathnú ar an Acht sin, cuimhneoidh sé go raibh tuairmí ag daoine go mba chóir an aois d'ardú agus má bhí aon bhunús leis an tuairim sin, tá an aois 17 mbliana ró íseal.  Ní hé sin le rá go mba chóir gach duine a choiméad tar éis na haoise sin, ach go mbeadh discréid ag an Aire iad a choimeád, dá gceapadh sé gurb é sin an rud ceart le déanamh.  Sé an deacracht, is dóigh liom, a bhí ins an scéal, nach raibh aon tslí as ach na cailíní seo a thabhairt ós comhair na cúirte.  An bhféadfaí an cheist a láimhseáil gan teacht isteach sa chúirt ar chor ar bith? Chun duine a choimeád caithfear é a choimeád do réir dlí, ach cén nós imeachta is fearr chun greim d'fháil orthu agus iad a choimeád in áit in a dtabharfaí cúram ceart dóibh, agus iad d'oiliúnt agus a chur ar bhealach a leasa.  Do réir an Bhille anois, caithfí iad a thabhairt ós comhair na cúirte.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Do réir an Bhille caithfí iad a thabhairt ós comhair na cúirte&mdash;Alt 58 ( ) Bille na Leanaí, 1908.  Sé sin le rá, má tá cailín in a cónaí nó ar lóistin i dtig, nó i gcuid de thig, atá á úsáid chun críocha mí-mhorálta, nó má déantar in aon tslí eile ar bith coir in a coinne nó má tá sí i gcuntúirt ó thaobh moráltachta, d'fhéadfaí í a thabhairt ós comhair na cúirte.  Caithfí fianaise a thabhairt agus sé mo thuairim gurb é an trioblóid is mó a bhaineas leis&mdash;ón gcuimhneamh atá agamsa ar an scéal&mdash; go bhfuil sé ar an duine a thugann an cailín ós comhair na cúirte fianaise a thabhairt a chruthós don Giúistís go bhfuil an cailín i gcontúirt.  Más rud é <Col N="1022" /> go bhfuil feall nó coir déanta i gcoinne an chailín is dócha go mbeadh an Giúistís cinnte go leor ansin go bhfuil cúis mhaith aige chun ordú a dhéanamh chun í a chur i scoil cheartúcháin.  Tá mé ag caint anois faoi chailín nach ndearnadh coir ach go ndearna duine éigin coir in a coinne.  Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil sé soiléir ó Uimh. 4 gur féidir gach cailín a ndéanfaí coir in a coinne, coir mhí-mhorálta, coir ionnsú ins an tslí sin, a chur ann ach bfhéidir go mbeadh an Giúistís sásta.  Faoi Alt 58 (e) den Phríomh Acht de Bhille na Leanaí, má dhéanann athair coir i gcoinne cailín, iníon dó féin, caithfí na cailíní eile a thógaint uaidh agus iad a chur i scoil cheartúcháin.  Níl mé sásta, i gcás cailín ar bith a ndéanann aon duine ar bith coir in a coinne, go bhfuil sé soiléir gur féidir an cailín sin, gan amhras ar bith, a chur i scoil cheartúcháin.  Sin pointe amháin.</P>
    <P>An dara pointe, cás cailíní nach bhfuil sé cinte, nó nach féidir fianaise d'fháil, go ndearnadh coir in a gcoinne ach go bhfuil siad i gcuntúirt&mdash;sé sin go mbíonn droch-chomhluadar leo, go mbíonn siad ag dul le fir, abair, nach bhfuil cáil mhaith orthu agus go bhfuil tuairim láidir ag na Gardaí&mdash;ón eolas atá acu faoin áit in a gcónaíonn na cailíní, na tuistí atá acu&mdash;an saghas slí bheatha agus an chaoi ina bhfuil rudaí sa bhaile.  Gí go mbeadh an t-eolas sin ar fad ag na Gardaí agus nach bhfuil aon amhras orthu, b'fhearr liomsa nach mbeadh na Gardaí ann in aon chur ach ní féidir liom a fheiscint cé eile a thiubhras na cailíní ós comahir na cúirte.  Má thugann na Gardaí an cailín ós comhair na cúirte, bíodh is go bhfuil siad cinnte in a n-aigne féin go bhfuil sí i gcuntúirt, agus nach mbeidh aon deireadh leis an scéal ach an taon deireadh amhain má leanann sí sa tslí sin&mdash;gí nach féidir a rá go bhfuil na tuistí go dona amach is amach ó thaobh moráltachta, san am chéanna nach dtugann siad aire cheart do na leanaí agus nach ndéanann siad na leanaí a cheartú agus go ligeann siad amach iad san oíche agus go mbíonn siad i ndroch-chomhluadar agus mar sin de&mdash;an mbeadh an Giúistís sásta le fianaise na nGardaí?  Ní féidir leis na Gardaí a rá ach: &ldquo;Támuid cinnte&mdash;ón méid eolais atá againn, <Col N="1023" /> faoin tslí a mhaireann tuistí an chailín seo&mdash;bféidir nach bhfuil tuistí ar bith ag an gcailín&mdash;agus ón droch-chomhluadar in a mbíonn sí agus ón tslí a dtéann sí mórthimpeall agus mar sin de&mdash;go bhfuil sí i gcuntúirt.&rdquo;  B'fhéidir go ndéarfadh an gíúistís: &ldquo;Tá sé sin ceart go leor ach ar an taobh eile má deireann A. B, nó C gur cailín macánta í agus nach bhfuil aon chuntúirt ann di, níl mé sásta, gí go bhfuil an t-eolas sin ag na Gardaí, an cailín a chur ins an scoil cheartúcháin seo.&rdquo; Má tugtar cailín ós comhair na cúirte agus má cuirtear in a leith gur cailín den toaghas sin í go mba cheart í a chur i scoil mar seo, ní deas an rud é don chailín nó dá gaolta ná d'éinne a mbeadh suim aige inti.  Níor mhór do na Gardaí bheith lán-chinnte i dtaobh an scéil.  Conas a bheadh an scéal ag na Gardaí, o thaobh an dlí, dá n-abradh an Giúistís nach raibh an ceart acu agus nach raibh an fhianaise a thug siad deimhnitheach a dóthain, nach bhfuil sé sásta breith a thabhairt? Nach mbeadh na Gardaí féin i gcuntúirt ansin?  B'féidir go dtiubharfaí ós comhair na cúirte iad faoi dhrochcháil a thabhairt don chailín.  Tuigim na deachrachtaí go maith agus nílim ag iarraidh sin a mheabhrú don Aire.</P>
    <P>Sa gcéad dul síos, an bhfuil sé soiléir, nó an mbeidh sé soiléir, go ndéanfar aon leasú ar an mBille sar rithfear é sa Dáil?  An mbeidh sé de cheart ag an nGiúistís cailín a ndéanfaí aon choir go mí-mhóralta in a coinne a chur sa scoil cheartúcháin gan aon amhras a bheith ina taobh.  Sa gcás eile, an féidir an scéal a dhéanamh níos láidre ná seo ionas gur leor go rachaidh na Gardaí ós comhair na cúirte agus go nabróidh siad go bhfuil an tuairim sin acu?  Mar, má thagann siad ós comhair na cúirte i gcás mar seo ní thiocfadh siad, is dócha, muna mbeadh siad cinnte faoin eolas a bheadh acu.  Dá ndiúltaíodh an Giúistís dóibh ansan is cuma cén chuntúirt a bheadh ann don chailín muna ndéanfaí coir in a coinne, nó rud éigin uafásach mar sin, níorbh fhéidir leis an nGiúistís í a choiméad. Dearfaidh an Giúistís: &ldquo;Caithfidh sibh fianaise a thabhairt dom nach bhfuil aon amhras ach go bhfuil an cailín seo i gcúntúirt ó thaobh mímhoráltachta.&rdquo; Ach an féidir leis an <Col N="1024" /> Dáil an tAlt a dhéanamh níos láidre ionas go mbeadh lán-díscréid ag an nGiúistís i gcás mar seo?  Nílim a rá go mba cheart don Ghiúistis é sin a dhéanamh&mdash;an cailín a chur sa scoil cheartúcháin&mdash;muna mbeadh sé lán-chinnte in a aigne féin faoin scéal.  Is féidir liom a thuiscint go mbeadh Gardaí, ar thaobh amháin, agus fianaise á thabhairt acu agus, ar an taobh eile, duine a rá gur cailín macánta í&mdash;mar uaireanta bíonn daoine sásta é sin a dhéanamh mar bíonn trua acu do dhaoine óga a bhíos i dtrioblóid.</P>
    <P>Ní hé go bhfuil aon mhailís iontu, ná go bhfuil aon droch-rud againn, a bhí ins na tíortha eile buíochas le Dia, ins an tír seo, ach béidir go mbéadh sé simplí, rud beag lag-intinneach. Ar dtús, cheapamar go bhféadfaí an rud a láimhseáil ón taobh sin, go bhféadfaí a rá gur saghas galair intinneach, nó duine ar bith lag in a intinn, agus i gcás daoine mar sin, d'fhéadfadh daoine mí-chearta greim d' fháil orthu agus iad a bhreathnú ar fad.  Nilim cinnte go bhféadfaí iad a leigheas ins an tslí sin.  Dá bhféadfaí iad a leigheas ó thaobh leighis, do réir nós imeachtaí na ndochtúirí, shábhálfadh sé an cheist ar fad an cailín a thabhairt ós comhair na cúirte agus, cé go mbíonn obair na cúirte príobháideach, d'fhéadfaí gan aon tuairisc a chur ins na páipéir.  De gháth ní tugtar ainmneacha na ndaoine óga mar sin.  Mar sin fhéin, chím go mbeidh trioblóid orthú.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom freisin an cheist a chur ar an Aire an bhfuil sé sásta go bhfuil lán-chumhacht aige&mdash;is dócha go bhfuil, mar rinne mé fhéin é&mdash;cailín a aistríú ó scoil go scoil eile. Mar gheall ar an gCeist i gcoitinne, cé go mbéidir nach féidir an rud a oibriú faoin Roinn Sláinte, is dóigh liom go bhfuil baint idir an saghas seo coire agus ceisteanna mórálacha maidir le daoine a bhéas lag-intinneach, idir bhuachaillí agus cailíní; níl aon aimhreas ach go bhfuil laige éicint san intinn acu agus tá siad tugtha don rud seo, agus níl aon leigheas air ach iad a chur ar chúram na ndochtúirí.  Tá daoine ins gach tír, daoine níos eolgasaí ná mise, agus ceapann siad nach féidir an rud a leigheas ar chor ar bith tré phríosún <Col N="1025" /> tacht agus pionós den tsórt sin, ach caithfí é leigheas trí chúram ceart a thabhairt dóibh, agus trí freastal orthu díreach ar nós daoine a mbeadh aon ghalar eile orthu agus cúram ag dul dóibh da bharr.</P>
    <P>Nuair a bheas an cheist&mdash;daoine lag-intinneacha, daoine óga&mdash;á scrúdú, chun a fháil amach anbféadfai scéimeanna níos fearr a chur ar fáil doibh ó thaobh oideachais, béidir go mbeadh slí ag an Aire breathnú isteach ins an taobh sin den scéal.  Ba cheart socrú faoi leith a dhéanamh le deontais a thabhairt don scoil.  Ní bheidh mórán cailiní ins an scoil ach beidh dothain mar sin féin.  Sílim nach ceart go mbeadh na mná rialta i mbun na hoibre&mdash;is cuma fiche nó seisear cailín ann, tá an obair chéanna ar mná rialta, tá a gcuid ama ar fad tugtha don obair sin.  Caithfidh siad úirlisí d'fháil agus caithfidh siad an teach a choimeád i gceart agus gach rud a bhaineas le cothabháil an tí d'íoc.  Is dóigh liom nach bhfuil na gnáth-dheontais sáthach mór, agus caithfidh an tAire&mdash;más féidir in aon chor é&mdash;íocaíocht a thabhairt ina leith, ní do réir <i>capita</i> ach do réir na gcostas reatha a bhaineas leis an teach agus saghas <i>block grant</i> a thabhairt dóibh ins an tslí sin.</P>

      <P>I want to say quite clearly to Deputy Cowan that there is official and competent medical inspection of this particular school.  That inspection is carried out by competent persons, and by qualified medical persons.  Any doubts that the Deputy may have on that score can be laid completely at rest.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Derrig raised a number of points with regard to the various types of cases that may have to be dealt with in this particular way.  I would like to have the simple idea in this Bill understood.  We want to get the basis of our scheme clearly and simply established before we say that it would be desirable to go any further in the matter.  I have no reason to think that <Col N="1026" /> there is any necessity at the moment to go any further.  This Bill does not provide that any person will be dealt with, except a person who in the absence of it would be dealt with by a district justice and be put into an industrial school.  The Deputy speaks of the possibility of a young person having been sinned against.  I think it would be most undesirable, because a person was sinned against, that, contrary to the wishes of the parents, that person should be taken and put either into an industrial or reformatory school.  Deputies can see how undesirable it would be to make new offences. What is being arranged in the Bill is that where young people are committed to an industrial school or, if convicted, to a reformatory school, if they are of a type that need to be segregated, they can be put into this school.  I think that is all we want at the present time.  There may be cases in which young people and their parents would desire that a young person, in particular circumstances, would get the protection of an institution of this kind&mdash;that they would be able to get it without going before the courts &mdash;but nothing in the present situation has suggested to me that I should make provision for that yet.  I am simply clearing the ground so that everything will be ready for any changes that experience may dictate will have to be brought about.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also asked about the grants to this particular school. Special grants will be made in regard to this particular school, which is a reformatory school, on the understanding that a very small number of persons are dealt with in the school.  As regards the cost of upkeep, the normal grants will be paid.  The grants are made on a specially designed notional figure so as to give fair play to the institution.  I do not intend to submit any amendment to this Bill&mdash;I say that in reply to questions that were raised by Deputy Derrig&mdash;except in line 17 where a verbal omission has to be rectified.  In Committee, I propose to ask to be allowed to insert the word &ldquo;any&rdquo; so that the line will read &ldquo;as adapted by or under any enactment&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>It would be a rather difficult Bill to deal with in Committee, and I do not know that if we were to do so we would be very much wiser in the end.  I cannot really say whether it would be necessary to send it to a committee.  I can see the difficulty the Minister has with regard to the question of seeming to make new offences. I do not quite feel that I am in a position to put down the amendments that I would like.  Perhaps the Minister would look at Section 58, sub-section (1), paragraph (g) of the 1908 Act and satisfy himself as to whether that covers the cases completely or not.  I do not know if the Minister has had the advantage of a chat with the justice in the juvenile court in Dublin, and whether the justice feels that the Bill will cover the difficulties that I have referred to&mdash;that he will have discretion in the matter.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Any person may bring before a petty sessional court any person apparently under the age of 14 years who...

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is whether the Guards will be able to satisfy the court. <Col N="1028" /> If the Minister is satisfied that the Guards will, in fact, be able to deal adequately with all these cases, well and good, but I have doubts.  I am not in a position, and I would fear, to suggest an amendment.  A discussion with the district justice and the Gardai is all I could suggest.</P>

      <P>I would hesitate to remove the district justice from any adjudicating machinery that would have to deal with a case like it.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>There is regular machinery there which appertains to the Department of Justice.  There is a juvenile court, a special justice and probation officers, and possibly there is some police officer who deals specially with this matter.  If the Minister has not consulted with them regarding the particular clause I read out&mdash;it is very hard to discuss this in an abstract way&mdash;I suggest he might try to get the people in the Department of Justice to get the opinions of these people as to whether this will cover the matter.</P>

      <P>I have not attempted in any way to complicate the delicate yet simple problem that I find myself presented with.  That is, that there are certain people committed to industrial schools who will not be received in industrial schools because of certain sexual complications.  This Bill proposes that they will be dealt with in an institution adequately and <Col N="1029" /> admirably organised to deal with them. I have not set out to examine a wider area or look for a bigger power.  It seems to me, from the Deputy's suggestion, that there is a condition of affairs that requires to be got after by more effective machinery for the purpose of dealing with people who may be involved in undesirable company or undesirable habits or in criminal habits of a particular kind and he is looking for better machinery for getting after these.  That is not the purpose of this Bill and I would not regard it as my function to endeavour to see whether there was such a problem there or whether there should be better machinery to deal with it.</P>
      <P>I am providing better machinery to deal with a definite problem which does arise.  I have not heard it suggested that the courts that are dealing with these cases, or the police side of things dealing with these cases and bringing forward cases for industrial or reformatory school treatment, are not doing their work.  I have not had the case made that the machinery either on the district court side or the Guards' side is not doing its work.  I would ask Deputy Derrig to realise that I am dealing with a particular problem that is within my province.  I know it is there and can be dealt with in a simple way, and I would ask him not to ask me to undertake the functions either of the Minister for Justice, as the representative of the police, or as the representative of the juvenile or district courts, and begin to look for a different problem and deal with it in some different kind of way.  I think the Deputy is extending the range of the problem dealt with in this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Morrissey) Daniel Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Morrissey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time. Deputies will observe from the Bill and the explanatory memorandum circulated with it that it deals with various miscellaneous provisions, most of which have little relation to one <Col N="1030" /> another but which it has been found necessary to enact for various reasons.</P>
      <P>Section 2 of the Bill authorises the board to make regulations for various purposes.  It is intended when these regulations are made that they shall be submitted to the Minister for Industry and Commerce who, if he approves them with or without amendment, shall confirm them by Order. The regulations, therefore, will have no force or effect until so confirmed by Order.</P>
      <P>Under Sections 33 and 34 of the Electricity Supply Act of 1927, the Board has wide powers to make regulations in regard to various matters. Through a defect, the Act makes no specific provision for the publication of the regulations so made.  Having this in mind, the board has been advised that it is very doubtful if regulations made by it under the sections are enforceable.  Apart from these considerations, it has long been considered undesirable that the board should have power, without reference to any other authority, to make regulations enforceable <i>inter alia</i> against itself.  Section 2 will remove these defects, while at the same time providing a satisfactory and convenient method of providing such regulations as may be necessary, including regulations for the protection of public safety.</P>
      <P>At this point I might add that the board has also found that the provisions of Sections 33 and 34 of the Act of 1927 are defective in certain legal and other respects and the enactment of Section 2 will enable these defects to be removed.</P>
      <P>Section 3 relates to another important purpose, namely, the establishment of an arbitration tribunal for the members of the staff of the board, other than manual workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This tribunal will be established on exactly the same lines as those which relate to the corresponding tribunal for manual workers which was set up under the Electricity Supply Board (Superannuation) Act, 1942, which latter tribunal is confined to matters affecting the manual workers employed by the board.  The composition and features <Col N="1031" /> of the new tribunal will be apparent from the relevant provisions in the Bill, but I may add that it is proposed, as in the case of the Manual Workers' Tribunal, that it shall consist of a chairman and two ordinary members, one to be appointed by the Electricity Supply Board and the other by the general employees concerned.  The chairman will be appointed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce preferably on the joint nomination of the two ordinary members, but where agreement on this matter cannot be reached between these members the chairman will be appointed by the Minister.</P>
    <P>It would, I think, be superfluous for me to enter into a justification of the establishment of this tribunal.  Deputies on both sides of the House will, I am sure, support any legislative proposal which, on the one hand, is likely to enhance the security of an important public utility such as electricity supply and, on the other hand, may tend to promote better relations between employer and employee by providing a ready and smooth means of settling disputes between them.  The Manual Workers' Tribunal established in the year 1943 has proved to be very successful and there is no logical reason why the general employees of the board should not have at their disposal a similar means of adjusting disputes as those which the manual workers already possess.  As a matter of fact, the general employees of the board have asked for this tribunal to be set up.  It may be argued by some people that the machinery of the Labour Court would be appropriate in place of a specialised tribunal; but I think in the case of a vital public utility undertaking possessing, as it does, a virtual monopoly in its own sphere, such as the Electricity Supply Board, it is preferable that any differences which may arise between the employees and the board, which often involve technical problems with which both sides would be familiar but which another body could not be expected to be cognisant of should be submitted to and decided by a tribunal of the kind envisaged in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Sections 4 to 8 also relate, directly <Col N="1032" /> or indirectly, to the new tribunal and are in line with the corresponding provisions of the Electricity Supply Board (Superannuation) Act of 1942 for the Manual Workers' Tribunal.</P>
    <P>Section 9 is in the nature of a drafting amendment to Section 15 (2) of the Superannuation Act of 1942, which section relates to the payment by the board of allowances supplementary to any pension which may be payable under the appropriate superannuation scheme to certain persons transferred to the services of the board from the service of other electricity undertakings, not being local authority undertakings, who had no rights to pension at the time of their transfer to the board.  A number of these persons have long service in the electricity supply industry and it was found that adequate provision, having regard to the length of their service, could not conveniently be made in the appropriate superannuation scheme.  While the board has power to grant supplementary allowances in such cases it cannot legally declare, in advance of the date of retirement, the amount of such allowance it intends to grant.  I think it will be agreed generally that it is reasonable and equitable that the board should be placed in a position to make this supplementary provision and to advise the employees in advance of the extent to which it intends to exercise this power.</P>
    <P>Section 10 deals with the superannuation of certain persons formerly employed by local bodies.  Provision was made in the Electricity Supply Act, 1927, that on the acquisition by the Electricity Supply Board of an undertaking formerly owned and administered by a local authority the pension rights of any employees who possessed such rights at the time of the transfer should be preserved to them in respect of their service with the former undertaker. In other words, they were to suffer no loss of pensionable service by reason of their transfer.</P>
    <P>In the year 1929 the Electricity Supply Board acquired certain electricity undertakings owned by local authorities, notably those of Rathmines. Pembroke and Dún Laoghaire and on acquisition the electricity staffs <Col N="1033" /> of those authorities became employees of the board.  These employees had no pension rights at the time of transfer.  Subsequently, the urban districts of Rathmines and Pembroke were merged in the Dublin County Borough and that of Dún Laoghaire with other local authorities in the newly-formed Borough of Dún Laoghaire.  Following this rearrangement the employees of the various bodies constituting these new authorities who possessed no pension rights up to then acquired them under the statutory provisions covering the mergers, both in respect of their service with the dissolved authorities and such later service as they might have with the newly-created boroughs. These benefits did not, however, extend to those of the former employees of the dissolved bodies who had, prior to the mergers, been transferred to and entered the service of the Electricity Supply Board.</P>
    <P>At a much later stage the responsibility for public lighting in the Rathmines, Pembroke and Dún Laoghaire areas, which had been assumed by the Electricity Supply Board on its acquisition of the relevant electricity undertakings was, by arrangement, re-transferred to the two boroughs concerned and, in consequence, a certain number of the former employees of the Rathmines, Pembroke and Dún Laoghaire Urban Councils who had been engaged upon maintenance of public lighting were re-transferred to the service of the bodies which had succeeded the urban councils, namely, the Boroughs of Dublin and Dún Laoghaire.  By the provisions of the Local Authorities (Electrical Employees) Act, 1937, the employees so re-transferred were given the benefit of (i) past service with the local authorities; and (ii) service whilst with the board; and (iii) later and future service with the relevant boroughs, the aggregate service under the three heads counting for pension purposes on ultimate retirement.</P>
    <P>Those of the transferred employees who had no option but to remain in the service of the board made representations pointing out that their former colleagues who at no time had left the <Col N="1034" /> service of the local authorities concerned, and, more particularly, those who had been transferred with them to the service of the board and later re-transferred to the two boroughs, had acquired pension rights for their entire aggregate service whilst they who were still in the service of the board had obtained no such corresponding rights. Following these representations, which were supported by the board and by the Arbitration Tribunal established under the Electricity Supply Board (Superannuation) Act, 1942, it has been decided that it would be only fair and equitable to give to the transferred employees remaining in the service of the board the same pension rights as have been acquired by their former colleagues. The number of persons concerned is 32 and the cost which will be borne by the board will be relatively small.</P>
    <P>Section 11 relates to the superannuation of certain persons who were employed at the Pigeon House generating station when it was closed down following its acquisition by the board and is framed to meet the case of a few former employees of the Dublin Corporation who were compensated by means of lump sum gratuities on the termination of their employment by the board following the acquisition by the board of the Pigeon House generating station.  Other such employees who had longer service at the relevant time were compensated by way of pension in respect of their service up to the closing of the station.  At a subsequent stage the board found it necessary to reopen and maintain continuously in commission the Pigeon House station, the former employees being re-employed.</P>
    <P>Those who had been compensated by way of pension were, on re-employment, paid at the appropriate rate for the work on which they were reemployed, the pension being abated during their employment.  Provision was also made that on final retirement the pension to which these employees would be entitled would be calculated by reference to their full service both with the former undertaker and the board, the pension which they had been awarded on their earlier retirement being then terminated.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1035" /> It was pointed out in the case of the persons in the pensionable category that the break which had occurred in their service during the short period in which the Pigeon House station was closed by the board operated to deprive them of the pension rights on ultimate retirement in respect of service after the reopening which they would otherwise have possessed under the Dublin Corporation pension scheme. Provision was, accordingly, made in the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Act, 1942, to enable, on final retirement, the pension already awarded at the time of the closing of this station to be terminated and a fresh pension substituted, the latter being based upon the aggregate service (a) up to the closing of the station, and (b) from the date of re-employment to the date of final retirement.</P>
    <P>The position of those persons employed at the station who had been compensated by means of gratuities has only recently been brought to notice, and it is felt that these persons should not, through no fault of their own, be prejudiced by losing pension rights in respect of their service from the time of re-employment by the board.  In their case, however, since these persons were awarded lump sum gratuities in respect of their service up to the closing of the station and since these gratuities are not capable of being recovered from them it is proposed that the pension rights to be restored to them by the Bill should be those in respect of their service from the reopening of the station.</P>
    <P>Section 12 modifies Section 45 of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1927, which section relates to the compulsory acquisition of land, etc., by the board. It has been found that the procedure laid down by the provisions of the Act of 1927 referred to is cumbersome and in some cases involves undue delay. To remedy these defects, the opportunity was taken when the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Act, 1945, was being prepared to modify the provisions of that Act relating to the acquisition of land, etc., under that Act, but these provisions apply only to the acquisition of land to be acquired in connection with hydroelectric <Col N="1036" /> schemes.  It is now proposed to avail of this Bill to extend the modification to the board's development schemes generally.  It may be explained that it happened in a number of cases recently for the interested parties to prolong proceedings for the acquisition of land under the 1927 Act for periods up to three years before the board found it possible to gain possession.  It will be appreciated that such lengthy proceedings may sometimes be resorted to in the hope of gaining a higher price from the board which, in the ultimate event, usually has to bear the extra cost involved by such delay.  The board are anxious that the more expeditious procedure in the 1945 Act should apply generally in all cases including acquisitions in connection with the rural electrification scheme.  While the board will give the longest possible period of notice to the persons concerned it is necessary for the minimum periods referred to in the Bill to stand if it is not to be hampered or delayed in proceeding with necessary work.</P>
    <P>Under Section 45 of the 1927 Act the board has, by special order, to declare its intention to acquire property and before making the order should (a) deposit plans and maps at a suitable place, (b) publish notice of its intention so as to reach people affected, and (c) if necessary, hold a public inquiry.</P>
    <P>All these formalities have to be complied with and completed before the board's order becomes effective, and where objections are raised several months must elapse before the order becomes effective.  In one instance two years had elapsed and the order had not become effective.  Under the Bill the board serves notice on the people affected and enters after 30 days on land and after 90 days on occupied premises.</P>
    <P>Section 13 of the Bill amends Section 53 of the Act of 1927 which latter section relates to wayleaves across land.  It will be clear on examination of the section that the amendment is of a minor drafting character. It may be explained, however, that in practice the board has found it difficult to describe in writing or by maps or plans the nature of each line or fixture <Col N="1037" /> concerned.  In fact, the board has been advised that as Section 53, sub-section (3) stands a very full and complete description must accompany the notice to the occupier of any land or building affected if the section is to be complied with.</P>
    <P>This is so difficult to attain in many cases that it was found necessary to send a representative to the site to explain in detail the nature of the work following the serving of the notice.  In the majority of cases, none the less, such a detailed description of the work is not required by the owner or occupier although the statute requires that it must be provided in every case.</P>
    <P>In the normal development of the transmission and distribution system, this requirement would not impede the board to an extent that would call for an amendment of the Act.  Now that the development of the supply in the rural areas is being undertaken the number of wayleave notices to be issued weekly has been, and will be enormously increased and it is considered that these complete descriptions of the work to be performed should be provided only where they are requested by the owners or occupiers. As the individual areas to be developed are small in extent and as the staff responsible for the development will be close at hand, in all cases, the owners and occupiers of lands and premises affected will be in a position to obtain the fullest information regarding what the board propose to do with the minimum of trouble or delay on either side.</P>
    <P>Section 14 of the Bill, it will be observed, amends sub-section (1) of Section 2 of the Superannuation Act of 1942.  Amongst other things, that Act authorised the payment of pensions to whole-time members of the board under certain conditions.  Under the provisions of the sub-section of the Act referred to, a member of the board, in order to qualify for a pension, must have at least ten years whole-time service as a member and that service must include at least one term of office of five years as a whole-time member of the board.  In the case of one existing member of the board who has served as a whole-time member since the 11th February, 1935, the <Col N="1038" /> various warrants under which he was appointed by the Government have been for a period of four years; 77 days; one year; three years; three years; one year and the warrant at present in operation is also for one year only.</P>
    <P>Consequently, having regard to the terms of sub-section (1) referred to, this member of the board or any other member who might be similarly circumstanced would fail to qualify for a pension under the Act as it stands for the reason that he has not completed one term of office of five years as a whole-time member and this position would continue until he had the opportunity of completing at least one term of office of five years under one warrant.  It is considered that this limitation is inequitable and Section 14 of the Bill amends the provisions of the Act of 1942 so as to provide that a pension will be awarded, (a) after not less than ten years' continuous whole-time membership or, (b) after two or more periods (whether continuous or discontinuous) of whole-time membership of the board which amount in the aggregate to not less than ten years and include at least one term of office of five years as a whole-time member of the board.</P>
    <P>This amendment, it will be appreciated, will enable any whole-time member of the board to qualify for a pension provided he has at least ten years' continuous whole-time membership and without having had one term of office of five years.  A member who has not had ten years' continuous service must have at least one term of office of five years' duration in an aggregate service of at least ten years.</P>
    <P>Section 15 of the Bill amends Section 8 of the Superannuation Act of 1942 which latter section relates to certain financial provisions in relation to superannuation schemes.  Under the section of the 1942 Act referred to, the trustees of the superannuation fund set up under that Act may lend superannuation moneys to the board and the board may accept such loans, the rate of interest on which must be approved by the Minister for Finance. The amendment provided for in this section of the Bill merely provides that the consent of the Minister for Finance <Col N="1039" /> to the interest rates will no longer be required but, in lieu of that consent, provision is being made that the rate of interest shall not exceed 4 per cent. per annum.</P>
    <P>The superannuation funds and the contributions thereto and the benefits payable are calculated upon an actuarial basis and for this purpose it is essential that the actuary and management of the funds should be placed in such a position to know that when they lend moneys to the board as an investment a definite interest rate will be paid.  The funds in this case have, by agreement, been based upon an interest rate of 4 per cent. and this section of the Bill will enable that rate to be paid on future loans.</P>
    <P>Section 16 amends Section 11 of the Superannuation Act, 1942, which relates to the reference of disputes to the Manual Workers' Tribunal.  Under the definition of the expression &ldquo;manual worker&rdquo; as set out in the manual workers' superannuation scheme made under the 1942 Act, workers whose employment is of a casual character are excluded and there is, therefore, no means by which disputes in which they are involved can be brought before this tribunal. The effect of Section 16 of the Bill will be to enable the Manual Workers' Tribunal to deal with disputes in which such casual workers are involved.</P>
    <P>Section 17 increases the amount of the advances for general development which may be made to the board by £16,000,000.  Capital expenditure by the Electricity Supply Board is financed by means of repayable advances made to the board by the Minister for Finance from the Central Fund.  The limit up to which such advances may be made is fixed by the Electricity (Supply) Acts and that limit has been increased from time to time according as the undertaking developed.</P>
    <P>The board has submitted under date of 21st January, 1948, an estimate of the capital requirement for its projected programme during the period to 31st March, 1952, including capital expenditure to which the board is already committed.  This programme envisages <Col N="1040" /> expenditure totalling £29,500,000 and, allowing for the provisions for advances in the Act of 1945, is made up as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>Having regard to the magnitude of the amount involved and in view of the uncertainty as to the trend of prices and supplies of materials within the next few years it is considered that there would be no useful result in attempting at this stage to estimate with even approximate exactitude the capital expenditure which the board may find it necessary to incur in the period in question or the advances which the board may require.  It is, however, abundantly clear that the board's development programme within the next few years will entail very substantial commitments if the demand for electricity is to be adequately provided for and it is, therefore, proposed, as an interim measure until the situation becomes clearer, that the existing statutory limit of the advances which may be made for general development be increased by £16,000,000.</P>
    <P>Section 18 of the Bill repeals the enactments set out in the Schedule to the Bill to the extent shown therein, viz., Sections 33 and 34 of the Act of 1927, to which reference has already been made.  Sub-section (1) of Section 3 of the Superannuation Act, 1942, is also repealed.  This sub-section of the 1942 Act relates to a case in which a whole-time member of the board is entitled to a pension in respect of other and previous service either with a public department or under a local authority, and has the following effect:</P>
    <P>(a)  If a Civil Service or local authority pension equals or exceeds the amount of any pension calculated under the Superannuation Act of <Col N="1041" /> 1942 the latter pension does not become payable, and</P>
    <P>(2)  If a Civil Service or local authority pension happens to be less than the amount of any pension calculated under the Superannuation Act of 1942 only the difference between the two rates of pension may be paid.</P>
    <P>This provision of the 1942 Act affects one member of the present board who is entitled to receive a pension from a local authority in respect of his service with that authority before he was appointed to be a member of the Electricity Supply Board.  If the member in question had been allowed to complete 40 years' service with the local authority his pension, under the Local Government Act, 1925, would have been very much higher than that which he was granted when he left the local authority to take up the appointment with the Electricity Supply Board in 1934.</P>
    <P>It is considered that although the case is an exceptional one, if the Act of 1942 is not amended in the manner proposed this member of the Electricity Supply Board will, on retirement, be prejudiced by reason of his transfer from a local authority to the Electricity Supply Board and it is therefore proposed to remove the sub-section of Section 3 of the 1942 Act which precluded the payment of pensions in respect of service with the board in the particular circumstances of this case.  It is most unlikely that a case will occur in the future where an individual on joining the board as a whole-time member would have an existing right to a pension in excess of the maximum which he would become entitled to in respect of his service with the board. In any event should such a case occur again the probability is that the individual concerned would prove to be entitled to the same consideration which it is now proposed to extend in the present case.</P>
    <P>Section 19 deals only with the short title etc. of the Bill and requires no explanation.</P>

      <P>As the Minister said, this Bill contains various unrelated provisions affecting the Electricity <Col N="1042" /> Supply Board but I think the Dáil should recognise that some of the changes which it proposes are not quite so innocent as the tone of the Minister's speech might suggest.  I know that a very large part of this Bill had been prepared before I ceased to be Minister for Industry and Commerce and my personal assent to the enactment of legislation along the lines indicated here had been conveyed either to the Electricity Supply Board or to certain staff organisations there. In view, however, of the lapse of time which has taken place since then and of the opportunity of viewing these questions from the different angle of this side of the House I am not going to be bound completely by former assent to these provisions in my comments on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking the various matters to which the Bill refers in the order which they are dealt with on the White Paper, we come up first against this rather extraordinary proposal to alter the procedure by which regulations are made affecting the discharge of the board's powers, duties and functions.  I use the adjective &ldquo;extraordinary&rdquo; mainly because of the fact that the proposal has come from the present Minister for Industry and Commerce.  When I was Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash; during the whole of the 16 years that I was Minister&mdash;the Party of which the Minister is now a member was continuously accusing me of endeavouring to invade the liberty of action given to the Electricity Supply Board by the far more intelligent Minister for Industry and Commerce who preceded me.  The Electricity Supply Board was first set up in 1927 with a considerable amount of liberty in the conduct of its affairs.  A certain disorganisation developed within it and the Minister who set it up, the present Minister for Finance, was forced to come back to the Dáil in 1931 and get legislation passed here which gave him certain powers of control over the affairs of the board and to that extent restricted the liberty which had been conferred upon it originally in 1927.  I do not know if the Minister for Industry and Commerce remembers all the phrases that were used to describe what was assumed to be my attitude to the <Col N="1043" /> Electricity Supply Board.  The matter came to a head during the course of the discussions upon the 1942 Bill to which the Minister made frequent references in his speech.  Not merely was the very innocent proposal in that Bill, that the pensions scheme which the Bill required the board to draft should be submitted for approval to the Minister for Industry and Commerce before being brought into operation, described as part of this general plot to impose the authority of the Department of Industry and Commerce on the board, but it was so described in quite melodramatic words.  The Minister for Finance, then Opposition Deputy McGilligan, said that we were trying to put &ldquo;the dead hand of the Civil Service&rdquo; over the Electricity Supply Board.  The present Taoiseach, then Opposition Deputy Costello, used a somewhat similar metaphor but put more dramatically, that we were attempting to insert &ldquo;the black hand of the Department of Finance&rdquo; into the affairs of the Electricity Supply Board.  Every action of mine in relation to the board was described as a breach of the principle under which the board was established and an attempt, again to quote the Deputy McGilligan of the day, to draw back the board into the ambit of Government Buildings.</P>
    <P>I had a perfect defence against all the allegations; I was able to say that all the powers, the functions and the liberties of the Electricity Supply Board as left to it by the Act of 1931 were still unchanged in the year 1947, still unchanged when I ceased to be Minister for Industry and Commerce. For the first time since 1931 we have now a proposal from the present Minister for Industry and Commerce to draw back the Electricity Supply Board into the ambit of Government Buildings.</P>

      <P>There may have been defects in the Electricity Supply Act of 1927, and we have a better idea now how such legislation should be framed than was possible in 1927.  In 1927 there was a very strong Dáil opposition to the very idea of State enterprise in a matter of this kind and the Minister in charge of the Bill went a considerable distance to meet that opposition and that explains many of the provisions of the 1927 Act which we to-day would regard as being somewhat archaic.  Let us have, however, a frank statement of what we are doing.  The White Paper says that if this section is passed then the orders made by the board will be submitted to the Minister and if he approves of them with or without amendment shall confirm them by order.  That is not quite what the Bill says.  The Bill says that the Electricity Supply Board shall draft its regulations and shall submit them to the Minister who may either confirm them or return them to the board for the making of such amendments as he thinks proper or refuse to confirm the regulations, but the board shall make the regulations as required by the Minister.  That is a very considerable invasion of the powers of the Electricity Supply Board and a very considerable extension of the control which <Col N="1045" /> the Minister for Industry and Commerce now exercises over the administration of the Electricity Supply Board.  I think that having regard to that change, which is a fundamental change in view of the provisions of the Act of 1927 and to the fact that the Electricity Supply Board has carried on for 20 years under that Act, we should have a fuller justification than the Minister has attempted to give us.  I am astonished, however, to read that the necessity for the change as described in the White Paper is this:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Through a defect the Act makes no specific provision for the publication of regulations so made.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is, under Sections 33 and 34 of the 1927 Act.  Having in mind the fact that the 1927 Act maks no provision for the publication of regulations:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The board has been advised that it is very doubtful if regulations made by it under the sections are enforceable.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Emphasis appears to be on publication of the regulations and one would have thought that any difficulty the board had under the 1927 Act, any impediment in its powers which it was advised existed because of the absence of a provision in the Act for the publication of regulations, could have been met by a simple alteration in the Act providing for the publication of regulations, but there is no such provision in this Bill.  If there was no specific provision for publication in that Act, surely one might have expected to find it in this Bill.  Will the regulations made by the board and approved of by the Minister's Order be just as weak as regulations made under the 1927 Act because this Bill, no more than the 1927 Act, makes no specific provision for the publication of regulations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think also that we should have been told with a little more detail precisely the legal and other defects which have been found to exist in Sections 33 and 34 of the Act of 1927.  I have no personal recollection of the board having conveyed to me what these defects were.  Perhaps they did, but if they did certainly I would like to be reminded of them.  The board has been working under the 1927 Act for 22 years <Col N="1046" /> and very few Deputies would agree that they have not had very ample powers and did not find themselves able to use those powers rather drastically in a manner which frequently brought about acrimonious debates here in the past.</P>
    <P>Let us now turn, however, to a far more important matter, the proposal to establish an arbitration tribunal for the clerical staffs of the board.  May I say that the introduction of this proposal by the Minister for Industry and Commerce with the support of the members of the Labour Party and other Deputies opposite brings back recollections to me?  It is only a matter of seven years &mdash;less if anything&mdash;since I brought in here the Electricity Supply Board Superannuation Act of 1942 which established an arbitration tribunal for the board's manual workers, which inaugurated a pensions scheme for these workers and which imposed on their right to strike limitations which I thought appropriate to associate with the inauguration of the pensions scheme for manual workers.  Now we have, shall we say, this admission by those who so vigorously opposed the enactment of that measure that I may not have been so far wrong as they thought then.</P>

      <P>An admission is one thing, a handsome admission must be acknowledged.  Let us, however, look at this thing more closely.  In the year 1947, an organisation representative of the clerical staffs of the Electricity Supply Board requested that the appropriate provisions of the 1942 Act relating to manual workers should be re-enacted on their behalf.  It was for me a matter of some personal gratification that any body of workers, through their representative organisation, should come and ask for the enactment in their interests of similar provisions, having regard to the opposition which was offered to the original enactment. I do not think it is a secret that the Electricity Supply Board were not very enthusiastic about the idea.  I had discussions with the Electricity Supply Board and, while their opposition to <Col N="1047" /> the proposal was, I think, weakened before I left office, I had by then decided that the request of the clerical staffs should be implemented and that this legislation should be enacted. That was in 1947.  The Bill was in course of drafting when the change of Government took place.  It was introduced in the Dáil on the 4th August, 1948, but the Dáil did not see it for months and months after that.</P>
      <P>On Thursday last there was a telephone message to the Fianna Fáil office in Leinster House from the Government Whips intimating that it was desired to take this Bill to-day and, on its being pointed out as a reasonable objection that nobody had seen the Bill, they very kindly consented to supply an advanced copy in mimeograph form before the printed copy became available.</P>

      <P>Will the Deputy allow me to say what happened?  I was informed on Thursday that the Deputy, or members of his Party, wanted to know whether it was proposed to take the Electricity Supply Bill this week. I said it was and that it was to be circulated. As the Fianna Fáil Party were having a meeting on the following day, I made inquiries at once.  I understood it was with the printers and was coming out that night, but was informed that the printers would be unable to get it out before Friday night. Therefore I instructed my secretary to ring up the secretary of Fianna Fáil and inform Deputy Lemass that, if it would be any convenience to him, I was prepared to send to his office a mimeographed copy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I was grateful to get it. <Col N="1048" /> Whether our inquiry was responsible for the Bill being taken this week or whether the Minister decided to take it this week&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be taken anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point I want to get.  Why now?  This Bill is being introduced in rather unusual circumstances and I think the Dáil should take note of the fact that a strike notice has been served on the board. There never has been a strike in the Electricity Supply Board service.  The clerical staffs of the Electricity Supply Board occasionally may have had grievances concerning their conditions and expressed their grievances to the board.  I know nothing about the contacts between spokesmen of the clerical staffs and the board.  I do know, however, that in 1947 the clerical staffs requested the enactment of this legislation, that is to say, legislation which establishes for them an arbitration tribunal before which they will have the right to go with their grievances and whose verdict upon those grievances will be binding on the board. Perhaps they decided in favour of the establishment of this arbitration tribunal for them on general principles. Perhaps they did it because there was foreseen in 1947 a development of conditions under which the staffs would have grievances that the board would not be prepared to rectify.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Bill had been enacted, then the arbitration tribunal would have been sitting and would have been available all through 1948 to hear and decide on any grievances of the clerical staffs. The Bill was introduced in August, 1948.  If it had been taken then, if it had been brought to the Dáil and passed here when the Dáil reassembled in November, then the arbitration tribunal would be in existence now and the staff would have that means of securing an examination and, possibly, a rectification of their grievances. But the Bill was left in abeyance from August until last Saturday and is now produced with a request that it be taken to-day.  The Dáil cannot ignore the fact that last week these <Col N="1049" /> clerical staffs of the Electricity Supply Board to whom these sections relate gave notice to the Electricity Supply Board that they are going on strike on April 1st.  But the terms of the public announcement which accompanied that notice are still more illuminating and I propose to read them. This is the statement which was issued by the Joint Trades Union Negotiating Committee:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The board after considerable pressure extending from October, 1948&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I ask Deputies to note the date.  It was certainly subsequent to the introduction of the Bill in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;agreed to meet the trade union on January 26th.  As a result of that meeting a fact-finding committee was set up and reported its findings. Although there have been nine meetings of the board since that date, the board has not dealt realistically with the matter.  It has not agreed to the suggestion of the conference to discuss the dispute, although the Joint Trade Union Negotiating Committee had been informed by the trade unions affiliated to the committee that the great majority of their members were in favour of a strike.  The board will be informed to-morrow that it will receive strike notice to operate on April 1st, unless in the meantime a settlement satisfactory to the members concerned has been reached.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We have got to consider the abrupt decision of the Minister to produce this Bill and submit it to the Dáil in relation to that notice and to ask ourselves whether he intends the Bill to have a significance in relation to the situation existing in the Electricity Supply Board, or has it merely come along now in routine order without an appreciation of the fact that the Dáil is bound, and the clerical staffs of the Electricity Supply Board are bound, to give it a special significance when it is debated here under these circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Second Reading of the Bill at this stage has no relation whatever to that.  It has nothing to do with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1050" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That makes the matter worse.  It seems to me that there has been an extraordinary mis-timing of the whole business.  If the Minister was aware of the fact that this situation was brewing up in the Electricity Supply Board, then it would have been reasonable for him to have come to the Dáil with the Bill last November or last December and ask the Dáil to pass it quickly.  If it had been passed, if the arbitration tribunal had been set up, the arbitration tribunal for which these clerical staffs had themselves requested the enactment of the necessary legislation, then there would have been adequate means by which their grievances could have been considered and they would not now be in the position of issuing a strike notice because the board refused over a period in which they held nine meetings to deal, as they described it, realistically with the situation.  They would not be depending on the consent of the board if this Bill had been passed a few months ago.  They could have operated the machinery to be established and gone to the arbitration tribunal.  It is, in my view, particularly having regard to the nature of the case made against the establishment of a similar tribunal for manual workers in 1942, a very welcome development that the clerical staffs of the Electricity Supply Board have asked for the establishment of a similar tribunal on their behalf.  I think the Minister should not have delayed its establishment, and he certainly is to be held to blame if, by reason of that delay a situation now exists for the first time in the Electricity Supply Board where strike notices have been served on the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, that does not quite end the matter because one of the provisions of the 1942 Act had the effect of imposing upon any worker who joined the pension scheme set up under that Act certain penalities if he went on strike.  I justified that provision in 1942, and I justified it in relation to manual workers.  I pointed out that it was the practice of the Electricity Supply Board to pay their manual workers&mdash;electricians, carpenters, painters and so forth&mdash;the rate of wages paid by other employers to workers of <Col N="1051" /> the same class&mdash;the rate of wages prescribed in national agreements made with the trade unions of these workers &mdash;and to give them, in addition, all the other conditions of employment prescribed in these national agreements.  I said that if over and above everything which workers of the same class could get in wages and in the benefit of good conditions from other employers, they were to get the added security of pensions in the Electricity Supply Board service, then the community was entitled to ask from them a little security in return&mdash;an assurance that their grievances, whenever they had grievances, would be submitted to the arbitration of an impartial tribunal and should not be decided by strike action. That was in relation to the manual workers.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the scales of salary of the clerical staffs of the Electricity Supply Board compare favourably or otherwise with the salaries of clerical workers in the Government service or in private employment, but clearly there is not the same basis of comparison between their rates of remuneration and the rates of remuneration for similar types of workers in other employment as there is between the board's manual workers and similar classes of manual workers elsewhere.  We are now proposing, however, to enact this Bill in a situation where strike notices have been given to operate on the 1st April.  The effect of its enactment will be, assuming the strike takes place and that the strike continues to a date after this Bill becomes law, that the clerical workers will be denied the right to pension in respect of any period of service with the board prior to the break after the passing of this Act.  I could not object to that, provided that the clerical workers concerned had the advantage of an arbitration tribunal in which they had faith, and to which they could bring their grievances.</P>
    <P>If this Bill had been submitted to the Dáil in circumstances in which there was no strike, and in circumstances in which the likelihood of a strike before the date of its enactment were remote, I would not object.  I would say that the enactment of these provisions <Col N="1052" /> should be facilitated, particularly in view of the fact that the staff themselves asked for them.  I would say it was desirable that, in view of the establishment of an arbitration tribunal to deal with their grievances, we could impose on them, in consideration of the additional security, the obligation not to strike.  It is really not an obligation.  The Act of 1942 does not prevent a worker in the Electricity Supply Board going on strike.  It imposes penalties and discourages him from doing so.  In this particular case, we are at the present time legislating to ensure that the clerical workers who have not got the right to arbitration and for whom the tribunal has not yet been established will, if they go on strike and under the terms of this measure, be affected in their pensions because they have done so.</P>
    <P>I think, therefore, it is clearly desirable that some provisions should be inserted in Section 7 of the Bill to make it clear that the penalties imposed by it will not apply in the case of any strike in progress at the time the Bill become law or, alternatively, that the Minister should exert himself to secure the avoidance of a strike on the assurance which he can give, with the authority of every Deputy in this Dáil, I am sure, that we will expedite the enactment of the measure so as to ensure a clear way for the rapid establishment of the arbitration tribunal which it is proposed to set up.  But if the idea of the Minister in bringing the Bill forward at this time, and of making its provisions known at this time, is to deter the trade union negotiating committee from proceeding with the strike notice by reason of these penalties, then we have a purely farcical situation, because simultaneously with its introduction on the same day a motion has been submitted to the Dáil the object of which is to restore the pensions to the national teachers who went on strike more than a year ago.</P>

I think that I have a clearer conception of what the national interest is in relation to this or any other matter than the Minister has shown.  If the staffs of the Electricity Supply Board are agreeable to have their grievances dealt with by arbitration, and they were so agreeable in 1947, then no doubt they can be persuaded to postpone their strike notices on the assurance which I am prepared to give, that the Opposition in this House will expedite the enactment of the measure if the Minister will give an assurance that he will exert himself to carry into effect the establishment of the tribunal after the Bill becomes law.</P>

I am not objecting to what is being done in the case of the national teachers.  I am merely saying that the manner in which this Bill and the national teachers' resolution are being handled shows extraordinary incompetence.</P>

      <P>Did I hear the word &ldquo;sabotage?&rdquo;  What is the allegation against me&mdash;that I am encouraging the staffs of the Electricity Supply Board to go on strike?  I know nothing whatever about the merits of their case.  I do not know what the case is.  All that I know is that they think they have grievances and that they have been trying to get their grievances considered by the Electricity Supply Board, and the suggestion is that because the board would not deal with them they have given strike notice.  I think the staffs of the Electricity Supply Board should be agreeable to follow the course that they were prepared to consider in 1947 and have these grievances determined by an arbitration tribunal.  The only reason why that could not be done was because the Minister did not produce the Bill until to-day, although it was introduced last August and drafted 12 months ago. Why has he introduced it to-day?  He tells us he did not even have cognisance of the fact that there is a strike notice in existence.  Does anybody believe that and, if it is true, does it not make the situation even worse?</P>
      <P>I am quite certain that the members of the committee representative of the Electricity Supply Board clerical staffs, if it is the same committee that I met in the past, are a group of very intelligent, level-headed people who will embark on no course that they cannot see the end of, and they are just as appreciative of the importance to them of the enactment of this measure now as they were two years ago.  I hope that Deputy Larkin who, I observe, is present, has taken the precaution of reading the debates on the 1942 Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that Deputy Larkin will support these provisions. May I go back for a moment to the White Paper?  The situation in the Electricity Supply Board, and particularly the effect of the enactment of these <Col N="1055" /> provisions upon the pensions of the board's staff, is governed in the White Paper by this rather clarifying sentence: &ldquo;Sections 4 to 8 of the Bill also relate directly or indirectly to the new tribunal and are in line with the corresponding provisions of the Electricity Supply Board Act of 1942 for a manual workers' tribunal.&rdquo;  That, I am sure, brings home to Deputies opposite exactly what they are being asked to legislate for at this time.</P>
      <P>I will go on to other matters to which the Bill refers and which have no relationship to what I have discussed already.  So far as the proposal to enable the board to inform members of their staff now that, where they are not entitled to a full pension under the existing scheme, the board will at the time supplement these pensions to a specific amount, is concerned, I am in complete agreement.  I thought the board had that power under the 1942 Act.  I think it was only when the board came up against individual cases, although they had come to their decision and although they knew the amount by which they were going to supplement the pensions, they found they could not legally bind themselves to do so when the time came.  That amendment of the 1942 Act is very necessary and desirable.</P>
      <P>With regard to this matter of workers transferred from non-pensionable employment in the electricity undertakings of local authorities to the board and transferred back again, I agree that it is necessary that we should clarify that situation.  I am not sure that the Minister has finished his troubles by the enactment of these provisions.  I had many changes of mind regarding these workers.  I saw certain difficulties in the board recognising as pensionable service with local authorities service which was not pensionable at the time, but I felt, whatever the logic of the case, that common-sense suggested that anomalous treatment of workers employed side by side by the same employer was a cause of discontent that should be removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot really say, but there may be on the board's staff now some workers who were transferred to the board from <Col N="1056" /> electricity undertakings in private ownership.  It will be difficult to say why they should not get pensions in respect of their service with those former privately-owned electricity undertakings when pensions are being given in respect of service with publicly-owned electricity undertakings, which service was not pensionable at the time.  I recognise that if you go to cover the case of workers who came into the board's service from other privately-owned electricity undertakings it will be hard to distinguish between these workers and workers who came into the board's service from other types of service.  However, if we are going to get rid of this anomaly, I will support the proposal.</P>
    <P>I am not sure that it is necessary, in the case of the Pigeon House workers who were disemployed for a time, to have regard to the lump sum payment which some of them received. Deputies are no doubt familiar with the situation.  When the Shannon scheme was started it was intended that electricity would be sold by wholesale to municipal and private electricity undertakings.  It was found when the supply was available that these undertakings would not take Shannon current.  They thought they could either then or in the future produce current from their own generators at a cheaper rate and so the original Shannon scheme was altered to provide for the compulsory acquisition by the board of all these municipal and private undertakings and the sale of Shannon current direct to consumers.</P>
    <P>At that time there was a miscalculation as to the demand for current.  It was assumed that the supply from the Shannon would be adequate to meet all demands and the Pigeon House was closed down and the staffs employed there were dismissed.  It was then found that the demand was greater than was anticipated, or perhaps there was a dry season affecting the Shannon output, and the Pigeon House was brought back into service and these workers were re-employed.  The workers who were pensioned on disemployment at that time&mdash;in 1928, 1929 or whatever time it was&mdash;are, of course, no worse off.  They will get <Col N="1057" /> pensions based on their pre-stoppage and post-stoppage service, but the workers with short service got, instead of a pension, a lump sum payment that was very little more than sufficient to maintain them for the period in which they were idle before they were brought back into the Electricity Supply Board service.  It was not a capital sum which they could invest to buy a pension later on in life, and it was a bit harsh on these persons who had that short period of service before the stoppage.  A grant of full pension to these workers would not cost very much and it is very harsh to count against them the fact that they received that gratuity during that period of unemployment 20 years ago.</P>
    <P>The next paragraph of the White Paper deals with the proposal to extend the board's powers to acquire land compulsorily.  I recognise fully that where an organisation of this kind is engaging in work which is necessary for the community as a whole, work which, like a waterpower station, must be done at a particular spot, it is desirable it should have powers of compulsory acquisition, as otherwise land and property at the spot where the work must be done will be inflated in price.</P>
    <P>The board got these powers of compulsory acquisition under the Act of 1927.  I simplified them considerably so far as hydro-power schemes are concerned in the Act of 1945.  The proposal here is to carry on that simplification of the board's powers to include compulsory acquisitions of land for purposes other than water-power stations.  I see no objection in principle to that where the land is being acquired for the establishment of generating plant; but I think it is desirable that the board should not have these extended powers of compulsory acquisition for the acquisition of offices, shops or showrooms and, particularly, in the case of properties to be used in connection with that part of their business which they carry on in competition with private traders. There was at one time a substantial agitation against the board going into business in which private traders are also engaged.  That agitation has to some extent died down.  But I think <Col N="1058" /> it is undesirable that we should give the board added powers of compulsory acquisition of property except in relation to such matters as the establishment of generating stations or other essential capital works of that kind.  In my view it is undesirable that the power should cover shops and offices.  That objection is made all the greater in view of the provisions of this Bill which increase the board's powers and make it possible for them to act in the compulsory acquisition of property with greater expedition than they could act heretofore.</P>
    <P>Section 13 of the Bill deals with the question of wayleaves.  There was at one time no subject upon which more heated debates occurred in the Dáil than upon the use by the board of its powers to establish wayleaves across land.  Everybody knows that nothing irritates a farmer so much as the Electricity Supply Board coming in across his land for the purpose of erecting overhead networks and putting down poles where, it is always alleged, they are most inconvenient to the farmer, and generally proceeding without regard to his amenities or convenience. We know that the board's networks must travel in straight lines.  We know that the distance between the poles is determined by the weight of the wires.</P>
    <P>We know that the board cannot just move its poles or lines around here and there to avoid placing one of them in the middle of a private garden and the next in the middle of a farmer's yard. Nevertheless we have to recognise the fact that there is a good deal of irritation concerning the use of these powers by the board.  That irritation is not going to be lessened by the proposals contained in Section 13 of this Bill, which releases the board even from the obligation of depositing a map showing the plan of its networks.  Let me say that I am not going to oppose that section of the Bill.  I realise that the original restrictions upon the board's powers in that regard related to the more leisurely days of the construction of the main network.  Now that we are embarking on rural electrification the mileage of overhead network will be extended enormously.  We want it to be extended quickly and anything that will enable the board to get going with <Col N="1059" /> the extension of rural electrification more rapidly than at present will be supported so far as I am concerned.  I think this, however, gives me the right to make some reference to the progress of the scheme of rural electrification.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether there was a legitimate excuse either last year or this on the grounds of scarcity of material or of skilled workers for the inability of the board to speed up its network construction to the rate originally planned.  I think the Minister should be slow to accept these excuses from the board.  I do not believe there is now any real insuperable difficulty in getting supplies of the necessary equipment. I do not believe that the excuse concerning scarcity of skilled workers is a valid one.  Three years ago the board were certainly told they were to carry out their plan for the training of workers upon whatever basis would ensure that, as soon as materials were available, there would be no hold-up because of scarcity of skilled technicians. I think the Minister would be well advised to shake up the board in this matter and to make them realise that there is growing dissatisfaction with the rate of progress.  It may be that they have difficulties which we do not know or understand; but I am quite certain that we shall not get the maximum amount of progress out of the board by making excuses for them. I speak with some experience in this matter.</P>
    <P>In that connection, I would like to ask whether this comparatively new development of selecting areas under the rural electrification scheme upon the basis of the most profitable return to the board is impeding in any way the development of the scheme.  I am not objecting to that procedure providing that it does not delay the execution of the scheme.  I would like to emphasise that the financing of the rural electrification schemes was not based upon areas but upon the country as a whole.  It was assumed that the supply could be brought to the doors of about 90 per cent. of rural dwellers and that about 70 per cent. of them would, in fact, take it when it became available or at some stage during the <Col N="1060" /> ten years' development of the whole scheme.  Its finances were planned on the assumption that in the country as a whole, not in any particular area but over the whole of the Twenty-Six Counties, there would be 70 per cent. connection of rural dwellers.  There is no real objection to the board picking one area instead of another for development in 1949 because it thereby gets a larger cash return provided that&mdash; and only provided that&mdash;the rate of progress of the scheme as a whole is not delayed by the process of selection. I would like the Minister's assurance &mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not in any way whatsoever being delayed due to that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that assurance from the Minister.  Section 14 of the Bill, which relates to the payment of a pension to an individual member of the board, is only just.  I tried to remember the circumstances under which the condition was imposed that a member of the board, no matter how long he was a member, could not get a pension unless he had one period of appointment for five years.  I think I am correct in saying that it arose out of a debate here in the Dáil on the Committee Stage of the Bill.  Certain objections were made to the possibility of a person having infrequent periods of appointment to the board and nevertheless qualifying for a pension.  It was to meet those objections that this provision was put in.  But it was put in without appreciation of the fact that it could work out most unfairly&mdash;as, in fact, it did in one individual case.  In that case a member who has had continual service for 15 or 16 years, but who never had one single five-year appointment, is not eligible for a pension at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the proposal concerning the financing of the superannuation fund I am anxious to get some information from the Minister.  I fully agree that the actuary and management of the fund must know precisely what their investments will earn; if their investments consist entirely of loans to the board they must know precisely what rate of interest the board is going <Col N="1061" /> to pay.  The present basis is that the rate of interest is fixed with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  We are told here that it is 4 per cent. at the present time.  Now, it seems to me that the Bill does not give any more definite assurance of the rate of interest than exists at the moment.  It provides that in future a rate up to 4 per cent. may be paid upon its future loans. I am anxious to know whether it is intended that all loans made by the superannuation fund to the board will be paid for at the rate of 4 per cent. in the future; if at any time money becomes cheaper and the board is not prepared to accept loans from the fund at the rate of 4 per cent., can it reduce the rate of interest on loans already made?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>It says not exceeding 4 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the aim of the section is to give the management of the funds certain knowledge of what the funds will earn.  On that basis they must know that the money already lent to the board and now earning 4 per cent., will continue to earn 4 per cent. Is there any possibility that the board can refuse to pay that rate of interest in future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that that was adverted to when they came to the agreement they now have with the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that they would have just as much security by means of an agreement to which the Minister for Finance would give his consent as they will get out of this Bill which substitutes the phrase &ldquo;subject to the restriction that it shall not exceed 4 per cent. per annum&rdquo; for the words &ldquo;with the consent of the Minister for Finance&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the capital programme of the board, I appreciate fully the difficulty of the Minister in giving precise figures for individual <Col N="1062" /> items in the capital programme.  As I have mentioned here already in another debate, my anxiety is whether the board is in fact planning its generation programme on an adequate basis.  Over the whole period, since about 1934 or 1935 when the progress of industrial development created a demand for electricity greater than previously existed in this country, there never has been a position in which we had electricity to spare, a position in which the Electricity Supply Board had to send out canvassers to teach the people how electricity could be used.  That is the situation we should aim at now.  We should endeavour to create a position in which we shall have electricity to meet all demands and we could go all out on an active campaign to increase the consumption of electricity per head of the population.  At present this country has one of the lowest consumptions of electricity per head of population of any country of Europe.</P>
    <P>The present generation programme, so far as I am aware of it, will not create that situation.  If my memory serves me right, before the war the demand for electricity increased at the rate of 18,000,000 units per annum. The demand has now been doubled, and it is increasing at the rate of 30,000,000 to 36,000,000 units per annum.  Thirty million units per annum represents the output of the Poulaphouca station.  Therefore, in order to cope with the demand, we must contemplate a programme by the Electricity Supply Board for the erection of a station similar in size to that of Poulaphouca every year or a station three times its size every three years.  The five stations now building will merely take up the slack which developed during the war years and put us in the position that by 1952 we shall be just barely short of the supply necessary to meet the demand fully.</P>
    <P>If we are going to be in any better position by 1953 we have got to start planning now, and I should like to hear from the Minister some indication of the progress which the board has made in the preparation for plans for new generating plants.  We know they have surveyed the Lee, the Boyne, and the <Col N="1063" /> Tore River in Kerry, but I do not think they have yet got to the stage of saying what the development of these sources of power involves in the building of power stations at certain points or the building of dams or other construction work at other points.  It takes a long period to arrive at that stage, and even if the greatest energy is devoted to the preparation of these schemes, it will be some considerable time before the first sod is turned and it will be two or three years afterwards before the new stations can be brought into commission. That is why I ask that the board should be urged to get ahead with new generation plans as rapidly as possible.</P>
    <P>The board have estimated their capital requirements to the end of March, 1952, as being £29,500,000, and the Minister is proposing that the statutory limit of the advances to be made for general development purposes be increased by £16,000,000.  Am I correct in interpreting the figures set out here in that way?  The board's capital programme envisages an expenditure to the 31st March, 1952, of £42,000,000.  As against that advances have already been authorised to a total of £12,500,000, and we are now proposing to authorise advances up to £16,000,000 of the £29,500,000 which they will require up to the 31st March, 1952.  That is all right, provided it is not going to be regarded as an intimation to the board to go slow.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not made clear by the White Paper.  They have estimated their capital requirements up to the 31st March, 1952, as £29,500,000, but we are told that, because of the <Col N="1064" /> difficulty of estimating the cost of certain works, it is proposed in this Bill, &ldquo;as an interim measure until the situation becomes clearer&rdquo;, that the existing statutory limit of the advances which may be made for general development will be increased by only £16,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy would have increased it by only £12,000,000 had he remained in office.  It is now up to £16,000,000.  That is what they asked for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the board had no illusions about my position.  I was continually urging them to get on with the generation programme and with the rural electrification scheme.  If we ever expressed any discontent, it was because they were not progressing as rapidly as we thought they should have. The Minister may have every desire to get ahead but big bodies move slowly and are inclined to sit down a little if they are not spurred once in a while. It will, however, answer my point in relation to the board's generation programme if the Minister will say if the board's estimated capital requirements of £42,000,000 to the end of March, 1952, includes, under the heading of generation, any additional station over and above the five now under construction.</P>
      <P>With regard to Section 18, which deals with another member of the Electricity Supply Board, I think most Deputies know who he is.  He is a man who has had long and honourable service in electricity development here, and I agree that it is very undesirable that it should appear that we had adopted a cheese-paring attitude in regard to his pension.  I am glad that the Minister decided to proceed with that section of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I just want to say in conclusion that if the Minister thinks that the speedy enactment of the Bill will help towards a solution of the present difficulties of the Electricity Supply Board arising out of the threatened strike amongst members of the staff, I assure him that we shall give him the fullest accommodation in getting the Bill through the Dáil.  If, however, the Bill is not likely to have that effect, or if he has not in <Col N="1065" /> troduced it with that in mind, I hope that we shall not be asked to take the Committee Stage of the Bill before the Dáil meets after next week, because while the main sections appear to be unobjectionable, I have not had an opportunity of reading over them with sufficient care to see if there are any amendments desirable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of minor matters dealt with in this Bill but there are one or two outstanding points that call for notice.  One is in connection with the proposed tribunal for the general employees of the board and the other is in regard to the limit of capital expenditure which may be provided.  Deputy Lemass referred very fully to the question of the tribunal, but on the one point which seems to me important, he was skating on very thin ice.  That is the question of interfering with the right to strike by the employee.  It is not correct to say that we never had a strike in the Electricity Supply Board.  We had one big strike when Deputy Lemass was Minister for Industry and Commerce. The strike was very widespread, and, in fact, it affected the whole supply to the City of Dublin.  On the termination of the strike we had the usual experience of being informed by officials of the Department of Industry and Commerce at that time that of course we had no legal right to strike. We were warned that in future we should keep within the law.  On that occasion it would have been far better if the Minister, instead of coming as he did and opening the conference with this reminder, had used the powers that he said he had.  Those powers not only relate to the supply and distribution of electricity but also to the supply and distribution of gas, water and other essential services.  Everybody knows they have been in existence for many years.  Somebody comes along and reminds the trade union that they are very near the verge, but it is generally accepted that at the time those powers were passed we had a different framework and different relations to those we have to-day.  What I dislike, not merely about the present Bill but also about the 1942 Act, is the way in which they tried to solve this <Col N="1066" /> problem.  If we decide that employees in essential undertakings should not have the right to strike why do we not say so?  Whereas in the 1942 Act we do not deny the employees the right to strike, we say that if they do they lose all the credit for the service which they had accumulated before that strike. Not only will they lose the service, not only will the amounts paid in on their behalf by the employers be forfeited but even the sums they themselves have paid into the fund.  I think that is an objectionable way to deal with what in many ways is regarded as high principles between different sections of the people in the country.  I believe that these employees have got the same right as any other workers to withdraw their labour just as an employer has the right to go out of production if he feels that he is not getting the proper return or is operating under unsuitable conditions.  In so far as these particular employees are concerned we are taking this line in the 1942 Act. At that time I was not a member of the House.  I had the more unpleasant duty of trying to speak on behalf of manual workers who had been looking for an increase in their superannuation scheme in respect of employment in the Electricity Supply Board.  When that scheme came along we were told &ldquo;there is the scheme in relation to the right to exercise what is the right of every other type of worker in the State, namely, the right of withdrawing your labour if you have got a genuine grievance.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In our discussions it was a question of balance of forces as to whether or not the scheme would be accepted with that condition.  Nobody tried to influence the workers; it was left to themselves. They pondered on the matter and decided to accept the scheme and they accepted that condition also. Ever since 1942 it has been a source of discontent.  Luckily enough there have been no developments which were of such major importance as to give rise in the minds of the workers to the question whether they should weigh up the merits of withdrawing their labour or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lemass said that there was a problem in regard to national teachers.  We have the same problem <Col N="1067" /> in regard to the employees of the Corporation of Dublin, the Post Office and also those who stand over the principle and take the view which Deputy Lemass advanced early in the debate, that in return for certain conditions of employment these workers should be prepared to forgo their right to strike. When it comes to practical politics, in actual practice the workers frequently are right and we should restore those rights to them that they lost by taking strike action.</P>
    <P>I, too, do not like this provision in regard to Section 7.  I did not like it in 1942 and I am in the process at the moment of making up my mind what to do about it.  I still believe that the worker has the right to strike.  It may be argued that they are engaged in essential services.  Many others are engaged in essential services and we have not yet taken away their right to strike.  Apparently the advantage they have is that they work for private employers. But even if they do provide essential services, have we reached such a period of equitable dealing as between man and man that we can select three, four or five individuals so calm and so judicial in their approach to every problem that masses of workers can accept their verdict as being completely just and on that verdict agree to establish, not merely the newly made conditions but possibly a whole future outlook on life? Whatever we may do in this House because we are used to debating, the average worker has not yet developed that point of view.  It is remarkable that although we say, both in the 1942 Act and in the present Bill, that all questions in dispute must be referred to this tribunal which is in existence for the manual workers and is to be set up for the general employees, if any employee of the Electricity Supply Board withdraws his labour willingly he forfeits his service prior to the withdrawal in respect of superannuation. If the other major legislation be passed, even if the Minister who passed the 1942 Act and who as a Deputy to-day in the course of the debate defended the basis on which we introduced this provision in the 1942 Act in the legislation which deals with <Col N="1068" /> the establishment of the Labour Court, did not take the view that that decision was binding and that right was withdrawn from any worker, why then the difference with regard to the employees of the Electricity Supply Board?  When the change of Government came about I know myself that many of these employees, not only those who supported the present Parties making up the inter-Party Government but even the persons who supported the Fianna Fáil Party, hoped that as workers and as employees of the Electricity Supply Board it would now be possible to be relieved of this restriction which applies to them and which does not apply to so many other sections of the workers also engaged in essential services. I believe that general employees do desire this tribunal.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass has information on the present dispute which is not up to date.  The report he read out from the newspaper clipping is not the latest information.  I understand that since then there has been further progress and negotiations have been opened again.  It is not for me to comment on the court's decisions but I do believe that, just the same as every other body of workers, the general employees of the Electricity Supply Board do welcome machinery through which they can have their difficulties, grievances and complaints considered.  I have experience of negotiations with the Electricity Supply Board.  The remarkable thing is that we never have negotiated with the board.  It is a rare and very precious occasion on which we see a member of the board as trade union officials.  We have to negotiate with the senior officers and on most occasions they are in the same position as an official in the Civil Service, in the sense that they are bound by previous instructions and have got very little discretion left.  One of the secrets of negotiation is the ability to meet and deal with the change in a situation that takes place in a conference.  Very often a single word will settle a dispute. A man coming in with a prepared brief is at a tremendous disadvantage as we have found on many occasions.</P>
    <P>I still feel it would be a big advance <Col N="1069" /> if we could on many occasions have direct contact between the employers of the men and women working in the Electricity Supply Board&mdash;the Board of Directors and the representatives of those men.  If we cannot have that, the tribunal is in addition to such direct negotiations very satisfactory machinery.  Over a long number of years we have been pressing individually and in our national organisations for a proper and adequate negotiating machinery.  We have never taken a stand against negotiating machinery. We have always been anxious to get it.</P>
    <P>The trade union will have to expend a great deal of thought and energy and a great deal of time, money and sacrifice have been expended towards obtaining the right of negotiating with employers in the Electricity Supply Board so that to suggest that the general employees in the Electricity Supply Board would welcome the extension of the machinery of the tribunal to them is merely to repeat something. Whether they object to the provision of an additional tax that is allowed in Section 7, I do not know.  That is a matter for themselves to say.</P>
    <P>I am speaking as one who objects to the limitation of the right to strike. I believe that, if an employer has got a right to close down his factory and withdraw from production at any time that suits him because he does not get his price and his conditions, a worker has got the same right and should not be denied it.  I feel that in this particular case we are applying legislation which is only partly effective in the sense that one section of workers engaged in essential services are confined by this particular restriction.  It is definitely a confined restriction in the sense that a man who has got eight, 15 or 20 years' service is going to be very careful before he endangers that service from the point of view of receiving a pension.  Others say that that particular restriction applying to one particular group of workers was at complete variance with the whole principle of legislation that was passed with unanimous support of all Parties when it was piloted through this House by Deputy Lemass then acting as Minister. We all agreed that this Industrial Relations Act could only have any hope <Col N="1070" /> of being successfully worked and successfully received by the workers and the organisations if it was completely accepted from the beginning that it was constituted on a voluntary basis, that it was voluntarily accepted machinery of arbitration and that there were no restrictions or obstacles placed in our way of resorting to action as we saw fit.  The history of the court has borne out the wisdom of that, and other members of this House and I feel that the principle employed there should be employed now by withdrawing this section from the amended Act and substituting a section to amend the principal section of the 1942 Act and to leave them with their pensions, their tribunals, their freedom of action and the possibility of using their own ability to deal with their problems the same as every other section of workers in this country.</P>
    <P>There is one small matter on which I want to touch.  A good deal of the present Bill deals with amended proposals with regard to superannuation proposals.  Under Section 14 there is an amending clause to deal with the problem of the members of the board who have not been able to qualify under the provisions of the main Act. I do not think anyone will disagree with that.</P>
    <P>Might I suggest to the Minister that he should also consider sympathetically the position of a number of employees? They may not be so exalted or important but they also have a claim for consideration of a somewhat different type.  I refer to a certain number&mdash;it is very small in fact&mdash;of workers who were employed by the Dublin Corporation&mdash;and some of them had a period of service extending to six or seven years on a temporary basis&mdash; prior to the establishment of the Electricity Supply Board.  Subsequently they claimed employment with the Electricity Supply Board and worked there ever since.  They are members of the superannuation scheme but in respect of their claims under that scheme they are different from other employees of Dublin Corporation who were taken over with their pension rights intact under the 1927 Act. The reason why this small group of <Col N="1071" /> workers is not able to secure the same pension provisions as the other men is that on one single day in 1927 they were not in the employment of Dublin Corporation.  I know that in legal matters there must be some limit of that kind, but in this case the day was the 29th March, 1927 and they had service before that date with Dublin Corporation and with the Electricity Supply Board after that date while on just that one particular day they were nobody's child.  Their number is very small.  The case has already gone before the tribunal for manual workers, but they are debarred by the present state of the law from dealing with them.  If we are to pick up the loose ends and deal with the period of service and pensions of other workers and with the passing to and fro of employees in Rathmines and Pembroke in and out of the employment of Dublin Corporation, we should take the opportunity of trying to settle the problem of this small number of men. They should be given credit for their services with Dublin Corporation and regarded as men who, if they had remained with Dublin Corporation would have qualified for their pension and be given the same terms under the 1942 Act as those who did go forward as being in the employment of Dublin Corporation on this one particular day.  It could quite easily be that of two men one was in the employment of Dublin Corporation for three months before the appointed day and on the appointed day and was taken over by the Electricity Supply Board with his pension rights safeguarded, while the other worked for Dublin Corporation for ten or 12 years, sometimes working practically the whole year and at other times working for a major portion of the year, but two weeks before the 29th March was laid off.  Because he was laid off and was off on that one day he was denied the protection afforded under the original and principal Act to his fellow worker who had in fact probably six or seven years less service in Dublin Corporation but who was lucky enough to be in employment on that day.  That is the type of legislation that does require amendment and the <Col N="1072" /> case is as strong as that put forward by the members of the board with regard to their period of service and pension claims.  It is also in line as far as the principle is concerned with the section dealing with the men employed in the Pigeon House who were given a gratuity when their services were terminated.  It is in line too with the approach to the problem of pensions for those men who had been in the employment of Pembroke and Rathmines Urban Councils who passed into the service of the Electricity Supply Board and after a time passed back to the employment of Dublin Corporation and qualified for a pension and then went back to the Electricity Supply Board again.  I would ask the Minister to look into this question.  The numbers of these men are small, their case is genuine and it does require consideration.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of the provision of capital for the board, Deputy Lemass and the Minister had an interchange of queries across the floor of the House as to whether the Minister was pushing the board or the board pushing the Minister.  Whatever may be happening there is very little chance or very little hope that the board is pushing the Minister and I personally believe that the Minister is quite prepared to push, and is pushing, the board.  But I have a feeling and I have had it for a long time that one of the difficulties and weaknesses in the constitution of the board is that it is too technical a board and that we would get much more progress, a wider grasp of affairs and, if you like, a more public approach to our problems if we had on that board 11 ordinary people who were not experts on hydro-electric development or the distribution of electric power or current.</P>
    <P>It is because of that set-up that I urge on the Minister to see that these sums which may be provided for the board should not be limited by what the board thinks it needs, but rather that the board, in the words of Deputy Lemass, should be pushed, harried and driven, because the problem referred to in this House is a real problem. We have not got sufficient power and <Col N="1073" /> we will find very great difficulties, if there is to be any development here, unless we have a much wider vision with regard to providing additional power for the country.  One new development in industry, that of plastics, which I personally think may hold out great hope for the country, is one that we could not enter into on any large scale unless we had a tremendous development in our power resources.</P>
    <P>I recall from reading the reports of the board that the known available and possible water power resources still unutilised seem to be very small. Even if there has been carried out, as we gathered from the reports, investigations extending over a very long period of years, the total available resources still seem to be exceptionally small.  We could add to them by the production of power from either coal or turf.  Our production of power from turf is still, if you like, on an experimental basis.  I feel that there is one matter which might be considered. This whole question of drainage about which we have heard so much discussion in the House is one that could be considered in association with and in relation to the possibility of hydro-electric development.  When we realise that our drainage problem is to get rid of a tremendous mass of water from the countryside and that water can constitute the means of producing power, I feel that some of our technical experts should be asked to sit down and consider the possibility of an arterial drainage scheme, not only from the point of view of draining land in order to restore it for agricultural purposes, but also draining land for the purpose of accumulating, storing and making available that water for hydro-electric purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not a technical expert, but on one occasion I had the opportunity of speaking to a man who was an expert and I remember his showing me a map&mdash;he was a newcomer to this country and probably was not deeply informed&mdash;on which he approached this problem of drainage <Col N="1074" /> from the point of view of hydro-electric power.  He had a viewpoint which I think merits examination as to the possibility of creating storage capacity for water which might be utilised either through the present Shannon scheme or, as he said, might be utilised for stations located in other parts of the country.  That man had a definite technical capacity, and if he felt that this merited his attention and was even in his spare time engaged in examining the problem, surely we ought to try to deal with this particular problem of power supply and ask our technical experts to look into it.</P>
      <P>That brings me back to the remark I made, that the board is a little too technical.  I admit quite frankly that some of this man's ideas were submitted to the board and were not received too happily.  It is not the first occasion on which a technical expert has been given a greater breadth of vision by the ordinary man in the street who does not know anything about techniques.  As we have these two main and very big problems of drainage and power supply, I do not see any reason why we should not ask one or two experts to sit down and see if we cannot get a solution of the two problems and thereby increase our very meagre water resources at the present time.  If we are going to provide adequate power and we cannot do it on the basis of our water resources, then we are going to have a very big problem from the point of view of the importation of either coal or oil or of finding ways and means of greater and more rapid development by the production of power from our peat resources.</P>

      <P>In approaching this Bill, I am inclined to regard it primarily as a measure introduced by the Minister to enable him to remove certain existing anomalies that arise in the case of employees of the Electricity Supply Board.  So far as it is a measure intended to remove these anomalies, to ensure a greater measure of equity and fair play for the employees of the board, I would of course support it.  But the debate has been availed of both by Deputy Lemass and Deputy Larkin to deal with the various sections in the Bill and it has become <Col N="1075" /> apparent to me that this is, if I may say so, a rather peculiar Bill.  I think the Minister would probably have been better advised if he had dealt, for instance, with the matters to which Sections 12 and 17 have reference in a separate Bill.  Section 12 is an enabling section, giving the board powers to acquire land and premises more expeditiously than is the case at present. Section 17 deals with increasing the amount of capital advances to the board.</P>
      <P>So far as this Bill seeks to remove anomalies, I think it will have the support of all sections in the House. There is just one section&mdash;Section 7&mdash; about which it is possible to have a real divergence of opinion.  Quite frankly, I do not like Section 7, and if I thought it was introduced as a big stick, as it were, in the situation that exists at the moment between the clerical workers of the Electricity Supply Board and the board, I would oppose that particular section.  I must say quite honestly that I do not think it is introduced here with that intention, but I will await hearing from the Minister, when he is replying, a definite assurance to that effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's assurance.  However, it does not completely dispose of the position that is created.  Deputy Lemass displayed great concern for the clerical workers against whom he felt this section might be operated in a discriminatory fashion, and to a very large extent he carried me with him, I have not had an opportunity of studying this as a section very carefully and I am subject to correction on it, but I incline to the view that, if the Bill were to become law before whatever date strike action were taken&mdash;if that unfortunate position results&mdash;a dangerous position would be created.  I understand that the date <Col N="1076" /> of expiry of the strike notice is the 1st of April.  As I envisage it, the Bill cannot become law before then and, if it does not become law before the 1st of April, I do not think the difficulties envisaged by Deputy Lemass will arise. That is on a very hurried reading of the section, but that certainly is the view I take of it and Deputy de Valera appears to agree with me.  I have sufficient confidence in the common-sense of the Minister not to conceive that he would introduce a measure of this nature when negotiations were going on between the board and the employees, unless he was assured that its introduction had the goodwill, tacit or otherwise, of the employees whose representatives are at present negotiating with the board.  So much for the provisions of this Bill in so far as they relate to questions of superannuation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Larkin mentioned the case of former employees of the Dublin Corporation and certainly, if cases such as those he instanced exist, I would suggest that if the Minister is setting out to remove anomalies, he should not leave behind him glaring anomalies of that nature and that at a later stage provision should be made in this Bill for dealing with these specific cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 12 will meet with general approval.  Many of us have had experience of the delays occasioned in, for instance, the Department of Local Government, where it was essential and necessary in the public interest to acquire sites for building.  Anyone with experience of acquisition proceedings knows the appalling delays that can be created by people who wish to extort the last penny out of the public authority for their property.  In so far as Section 12 would give the Electricity Supply Board power to acquire land or premises expeditiously, it should be generally welcomed.  I think&mdash;and Deputy Lemass adverted to it also&mdash; that the use of the power to acquire premises should be made sparingly by the board.  As a Deputy representing a Dublin City constituency and bearing in mind the number of former residential premises which could house people and which are at present in the <Col N="1077" /> occupation of the Electricity Supply Board in Dublin City, I believe that the Minister should advise the board, as far as he can, that Section 12 should not be utilised for the purpose of acquiring office premises for the board in Dublin.  I have often felt&mdash; and I know there are many who think with me&mdash;that it is a terrible pity that so many of us who give lip service to the principle of decentralisation are not inclined to see a process of decentralisation put into effect when we come down to cases about it.</P>
    <P>One reference in the White Paper, in paragraph 27, which I found difficult to understand, particularly referring it back to Section 12, is the difference which the Minister draws between general development and rural electrification. In so far as capital expenditure is concerned, the Minister's policy should be to rattle the board if necessary. The Minister's policy should be one of holding out to the Electricity Supply Board every possible encouragement, giving them a shove where necessary, to proceed with the schemes of rural electrification already outlined and to ensure that an adequate generation programme will be got under way at the earliest possible moment.  The Minister, in reply either to Deputy Lemass or Deputy Larkin, stated that no shortage of capital need retard the board in their development programme.  If that is so and if the capital advances necessary for the board's programme are £29,000,000, I think it is rather a pity that the Minister did not make provision for capital advances in excess of the sum of £16,000,000 provided for in the Bill. Those who look to the future development of this country, both agriculturally and industrially, are inclined to pin their faith, and rightly so, to the development of electric power.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Department or the officials of the Electricity Supply Board have ever considered the possibility of extending the scope of the board, or relating the board to some other body, commission or board, which would link the activities of the Electricity Supply Board with the activities of whatever drainage authority is set up and with the activities <Col N="1078" /> of those engaged in the development of our turf resources.  I incline to the view that there has been too much insistence on hydro-electrification and that the examination of our resources for the generation of electric power on the bogs has never been fully considered or as seriously considered as it might have been.  I know that various commissions have gone into these matters, but nothing practical has come from them.  I should like if the Minister would consider that there is quite a lot to be said for the settingup of some authority that would link the activities of the Electricity Supply Board with a drainage authority and with an authority charged with the development of our turf resources.</P>

      <P>There is, but everything that we have heard said here this evening has been directed towards the consideration of the Electricity Supply Board as a body dealing with hydro-electric schemes and nothing else.  If the Deputy had been here earlier he would realise that.  Will the Minister say whether he proposes to set up a wages tribunal similar to that set up for manual workers under the 1942 Act?  I should also like to have an undertaking from him that any limitation on the capital advances provided for in this measure will not retard the development work of the Electricity Supply Board or of its generation programme. It would be helpful if the Minister would tell us, once and for all, what are the causes which he assigns for the present delay in going ahead with rural electrification.  If the cause of the delay is either a shortage of material or of skilled men, we should be told so.  I should like to hear the Minister assure the House that there is one thing there is not a shortage of, and that is, enthusiasm on his part not to restrict the amount of capital advances to the board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 12 of this Bill should get serious consideration from the House because of the position the House itself is in in relation to the Electricity Supply Board.  Members of the House who are familiar with the <Col N="1079" /> history of the development of the State control of electricity know that this board has certain powers, and that, while the Minister has certain authority over it, in nine cases out of ten when questions are addressed to him in this House with regard to the activities of the board, the reply is &ldquo;that is a matter for the board; the Minister has no function whatever in that particular activity&rdquo;.  As Deputy Lemass pointed out, the original intention with regard to the Electricity Supply Board was that it should undertake the generation and sale of electricity, wholesale, to users such as local authorities and other big consumers. Originally, the powers given to the board were designed to meet that kind of a set-up.  As time went on, the board found that its activities would not be a paying proposition unless it also became a retailer of electricity to the individual consumer.  The board went even further.  It went into the retail business&mdash;the supply of fittings&mdash;in competition with existing businesses and small contractors.  The board was given powers and conditions which, I think, the members of this House would like to be able to discuss, just as they are in a position to discuss the administration of Departments of State.</P>
      <P>The original capital for the Shannon scheme was £5,000,000.  Those who prophesied at the time that, in its final completion, it would involve an expenditure of £40,000,000 or £50,000,000 were ridiculed.  I remember that, when suggestions came from this side of the House between 1927 and 1932 that the scheme would finally result in an expenditure of that kind, those of us who made them were sneered at and jeered at.  A number of Deputies at that time did not seem to appreciate what the logical consequences of the proposals in those days would be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but I want the Deputy to understand that we had an orderly debate until he came in here satisfied inwardly as well as outwardly. I was making the point that Departments of State responsible for an annual expenditure raised by taxation that is much smaller than that of the Electricity Supply Board undertaking, have to render an account of their services to this House.  They are represented here by Ministers who are responsible to the House.  Take the case of the Post Office.  With all its works and pomps, its activities cannot be said to compare with those of the Electricity Supply Board.  Yet we have <Col N="1081" /> the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs who is responsible to the Dáil for the act of every employee in the Post Office.  The same applies to the Board of Works.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance is in charge of it.  I submit that its total activities cannot compare with the activities of the Electricity Supply Board.  If any citizen feels that he has a grievance against the activities of the Board of Works, or any other State Department, expression can be given to it in this House.  That is not so in the case of the Electricity Supply Board.  What I am suggesting to the Minister on Section 12 is that he should consider what his predecessor had announced to be his intention, namely, a reorganisation of the constitution of the Electricity Supply Board so that there would be better control over it both by the Minister and by the House.</P>
      <P>As regards these very extravagant sums which are being made available for this development, once they are handed over to the board we cannot have any further discussion about the matter here.  I remember that during the war years we had to restrict the use of electricity and ration it very severely. Members of the poorer sections of our community had to pay a charge on the valuations of their premises and they received very little electricity.  In some cases it was calculated that the charge to the individual consumer reached from 1/- to 1/6d. per unit.  When we asked questions here we were told that that was a matter entirely for the board and it was not the function of the Minister.</P>
      <P>Under Section 12 and another part of the Bill&mdash;and I hope that Deputy Collins will give me the benefit of his legal knowledge on this point&mdash;the board will have the right not only to acquire whatever property and lands it desires for its use, but it will be given the right to get possession within a period of not more than 90 days.  Relate that to the Constitution of the State in which there is a section which gives us a guarantee as to the protection of our private rights and property.  I am not so sure that this section of the Bill is not somewhat unconstitutional.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1082" /> As a representative of the City of Dublin I have asked question after question here in an effort to stop the Electricity Supply Board acquiring streets of houses that would be very suitable for acquisition by the Dublin Corporation for conversion into flats so as to accommodate hundreds of families.  I suggested that the time had come when the Electricity Supply Board should decentralise and have their headquarters at Cork or near the Shannon scheme&mdash;have headquarters down there and not grab, like an octopus, residences all over the city, thus excluding our citizens from needed housing accommodation.  We were told that that was the function of the board and we could not interfere.</P>
    <P>I suggest very seriously to Deputies that we ought to consider amending Section 12 and restricting it in accordance with suggestions that have been made.  I have no illusions, as Deputy Lehane may have, when he says he will be satisfied if the Minister gives him an undertaking that this clause will operate only in a certain limited way. As a solicitor he ought to know that once an Act is passed containing a sort of omnibus arrangement for the Electricity Supply Board, any time you go to court you will be told &ldquo;that is the Act of Parliament&rdquo;.  We should see to it that the limitations we want to have are embodied in this Bill, and I suggest that this is one section that should be amended.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass indicated that the Minister will get this Bill as quickly as he wishes because of the particular situation that exists.  Deputy Larkin gave us quite a long statement on the rights of workers, the rights of employers, the restrictions on the workers' rights, and so forth.  One amazing thing he suggests is that the worker's right to strike should never be restricted because the producer has the right to stop manufacturing the commodity which gives employment to the worker.  Here we have a case where there is not a producer for gain or profit; it is a State undertaking. Nobody can tell me that there is a possibility of the Minister for Industry and Commerce saying: &ldquo;From Monday to Thursday next we will close down the generation of electricity.&rdquo;  Is <Col N="1083" /> it not obvious that this is going to be continuous employment and that the section is in line with the Act of 1942, more or less at the request of the clerical workers themselves?  Surely, if they are going to have this clause in and a superannuation scheme included, together with this body to decide disputes, we ought to have some penal clause to protect the nation, not the employer, from being held to ransom by a certain number of workers in this organisation?</P>
    <P>I am speaking quite frankly and I know what can be argued in relation to this matter.  As time goes on this organisation will become an important factor in the life of the nation.  Cities and rural areas will be electrified and people will become accustomed to electricity.  Every farmer's house, it is hoped, will be wired and he will have implements installed on the farm to make life easier for him.  Are we going to go ahead with an expenditure of £40,000,000 or £50,000,000 and be at the disposal of this body in which, relatively speaking, in relation to the amount of capital invested, the employment is not so high?  Of course the service is good, but it must be remembered that we are setting up a conciliation body, and are arranging for superannuation for the workers, and why should we put them in the position that they can say: &ldquo;We are not satisfied that we are getting a fair deal and unless we get what we want the nation will be plunged into darkness and there will be a cessation of work&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>I think the attitude adopted by Deputy Larkin is bringing things a bit too far.  It reminds me of the confusion that exists sometimes in the ranks of his colleagues.  They confused the word &ldquo;requisition&rdquo; with &ldquo;acquire&rdquo;.  One can acquire under a compulsory acquirement, if you like, but there is always a right of ownership for the person from whom things are acquired and there is compensation relating to it.  If you requisition you take a thing as you would under war conditions, when a person's property is of no account.</P>
    <P>I would like Deputies to study the implications of Section 12.  I am very doubtful as to whether, at this stage, <Col N="1084" /> I shall vote for this Bill with that section in it.  I hope in Committee we may find some way of satisfying the points of view that I and others have expressed.</P>
    <P>With regard to the amendment which changes the rate of interest which the Electricity Supply Board can pay without the sanction of the Minister, not to be in excess of 4 per cent. as distinct from the Minister's sanction, I would like to know how that will work out.  Deputy Lemass sought information on that matter. So far as I understand it, the board will be allowed to take this money so long as they do not pay in excess of 4 per cent.  But supposing they do not pay 4 per cent.&mdash;suppose they decide to pay 2 per cent.&mdash;what follows? Does it mean that the calculations for superannuation, the imposition on the worker, will be higher in order to provide the pension?  I think that is a very dangerous thing, because it might mean that too heavy a sum would be levied against the worker.  I hope the House follows what I mean. I would like to see somebody in between.  If there is to be any question as to whether it should be 2½ per cent., 3 per cent. of 4 per cent. there should be sombody in between capable of measuring the effect either on the board or on the persons who will be the ultimate beneficiaries.</P>
    <P>As I have already said, the picture has completely changed.  The original expenditure envisaged was something in the nature of £5,000,000.  Under the present scheme, if and when it is ever finished, the expenditure involved will be something over £50,000,000.  The consumer is at the mercy of the board for every single unit of electricity used, whether industrial or domestic. I understand from the speeches made by the previous Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Lemass, that the Electricity Supply Board has power to open shops for the sale of electrical equipment and accessories and that it also has power to establish factories for the manufacture of commodities in connection with the installation of electricity.  I sincerely hope that some day this House will be brought to a realisation that we have reached a position where we should <Col N="1085" /> have a Minister for Electricity to whom we can address our questions, as we do now to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance when we want information on drainage.</P>

If one goes through the records of the House I venture to gamble even money that one will find that 50 per cent. of the answers over the last 20 years in relation to questions dealing with the activities of the Electricity Supply Board, has been that &ldquo;the Minister has no function whatever in this matter and it is entirely one for the Electricity Supply Board itself&rdquo;.  That is why I ask the House to reconsider Section 12 of this Bill and to consider also some limitation of the powers of the board by bringing them under the control of this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.D. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand the necessity for implementing very quickly those sections of this Act dealing with arbitration.  Section 12 deals with the compulsory acquisition of land and property and I think that section is being taken much too hastily.  This Bill was introduced last August.  It was not circulated until last Monday and it is being taken in the House to-day.  I think the people who have land or property that may be acquired should have been given an opportunity of considering this Bill to discover how it affects their interests; and they should have had an opportunity of consulting their representatives before the Bill was taken in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the moment the Electricity Supply Board has very wide powers of acquisition. It can take over farms upon which members of the same family have been living for generations past. It can arbitrarily acquire lands and property by the mere formality of publishing <Col N="1086" /> the plans and making an order. It is unreasonable that the Electricity Supply Board should be empowered to acquire any property without at least making plans available and, if necessary, having an inquiry.  If we give this authority to the Electricity Supply Board, we may find that the board will ultimately become a callous impersonal entity.  It may be that we are giving powers now which will cause regret at some future date.  It may be that the day may come when we shall have no right to interfere with anything the board does because we are giving them authority now to do practically anything they wish.  In Wicklow the board were able to take over houses and property; even the dead were not safe because at least one graveyard was transferred.  Some of the people objected very strenuously to acquisition. They were left in their houses until the waters flooded in and they had to be rescued by boat.  I think there are three schemes envisaged for the River Lee.  In that area the same families have been living for generations on the same holdings.  They do not like the present powers enjoyed by the Electricity Supply Board, and I think they would strenuously oppose any extension of these powers even in the slightest degree.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister to consider this section very, very carefully and to consider the danger of giving almost unlimited powers to any board over which neither this House nor the Minister exercises any control.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>In general, I think that this Bill is acceptable to the House.  It does clear up a number of matters that needed clarification for some time past.  I am, however, somewhat surprised at the approach to the Bill by some of those who took part in the debate.  I had some difficulty in knowing whether Deputy Briscoe was in favour of the Bill or against it. Obviously some other contributors to the debate had neither read the Bill properly nor understood it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To some extent the Electicity Supply Board has been condemned.  As a consumer of electricity I have always found the Electricity Supply Board both efficient and well run.  During the <Col N="1087" /> emergency they did an excellent job of work.  I am glad that they should be given power to open up retail shops. Deputy Briscoe objects to that.  I hope that, if they have the power to manufacture, to which reference has been made, they will in the near future establish factories for the manufacture of electrical equipment.</P>
    <P>I join with Deputy Larkin in asking the Minister to include a section in this Bill to cover the case of a small body of former corporation employees who, because they were not serving on the appointed day, have failed to qualify for pension rights.  The insertion of an amendment to cover these would be a very welcome and a desirable addition to the Bill.</P>
    <P>I wish to give my own views in regard to Section 7.  I accept the Minister's statement that the section was not drafted by him but was, in fact, a section already drafted and apparently considered by his predecessor and taken over subsequently by him.</P>
    <P>Apart entirely from that, Section 7 contains a very dangerous principle. It contains the principle that one party to a dispute may be punished if that party takes strike action.  As a general rule, strikes only occur when workers are up against what one might term a stone-wall mentality.  If there is a correct appreciation of the claims of the workers, if they are met in a reasonable way, it is very seldom that workers are anxious to strike because the great majority of workers are people with responsibilities and with families to look after.  Such workers are not anxious to strike at all but they are generally driven to strike action by the mentality of employers or by the mentality of the people with whom they are in negotiation in regard to the matters in dispute.  I take it that if employees of the Electricity Supply Board take the serious step of strike action, it will be because of some stupid mentality on the part of the board or on the part of the particular people with whom they are in negotiation.  If they are driven in the last resort to take strike action it does not seem to me fair that the workers should be penalised for asserting the right to strike <Col N="1088" />&mdash;and the proposed penalty is a very serious one&mdash;whereas the incompetent stupid person driving the workers to strike will not be punished at all.</P>
    <P>This section, as I say, contains a very dangerous and objectionable principle and I do not see there is any necessity for it at all.  I do not know who drafted that section but I do say whoever drafted it originally had what I might describe as a Fascist mentality.  Deputy Larkin has said very simply: &ldquo;Why if we object to strike action, is it not said very clearly in the Bill that the workers cannot take strike action at all&mdash;put a penal clause in the Bill and deal with them by the machinery of the ordinary courts?&rdquo;  That would be the manly and the straight way to deal with them but that is not what is proposed in the Bill.  There is a provision by which all service prior to the strike is forfeited. It is an extraordinary punishment.  It is not only the period of the strike that is forfeited, but all service prior to the strike.  If the tribunal, which it is proposed to establish, does its work well I think the dangers of a strike are very remote but it is an insulting challenge to the worker to say: &ldquo;If you strike we are going to punish you, and punish you severely.  You are going to lose all your service prior to the strike. You are going to lose the contributions you have made towards the pension fund.&rdquo;  That is an insulting way to deal with a body of workers.</P>
    <P>If these workers or their representatives make any approach to the board in regard to conditions of employment, they always have the threat hanging over their heads, that should they, in the long run, take strike action they will be punished in this way.  I can see why it is undesirable that people engaged in what might be termed essential services would take strike action and I know that the general body of workers have no desire at all for strike action.  If we look at it from that point of view, we shall find that a little common-sense in the relations between the board and the workers will result in a happy solution of all problems that may confront them but if you are going to hold this guillotine poised over the necks of the workers and they <Col N="1089" /> dare not assert their rights by the final weapon left in their hands, the weapon of strike action, I suggest that shows a want of confidence and a want of ordinary respect for the worker.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lehane has said that he does not believe the Minister introduced that section because of the present dispute between the board and a section of the workers and the Minister assured him that he had not done that. I accept that but I agree with Deputy Briscoe that when we pass a section of the Bill into law it is not the intention of the Minister that counts but the wording of the section.  If this section is passed into law, there is no guarantee that the present Minister's intentions in regard to it will have anything to do with its interpretation in the near future.  That, I suggest, is not a correct approach to a section of this kind. The section is dangerous in principle; that is the only way in which the section can be considered and not by the intention of the Minister introducing it.  I am perfectly certain that the Minister, in stating that he had no such intention as was suggested, was stating the truth.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider Section 7 in the light of the objections that have been taken to that section in this House.  If the Minister takes his courage in his hands and agrees to the elimination of the objectionable parts of that section there will be no danger whatever of any strike action taking place in the Electricity Supply Board in the future.  If the representative of the board, the representative of the workers and the independent chairman&mdash;the board of arbitration that is envisaged here&mdash;can sit down to consider the matter in dispute freed from this threat over one section of the parties to the dispute I am perfectly certain that a happy solution will be achieved.  I am perfectly certain that the workers themselves will be quite happy knowing that there is no portion of this particular Bill which imposes very serious punishments on them if they should dare to assert their rights to their final conclusion.  With the exception of that section I think this is a good Bill, a Bill that was badly needed and I, for one, cannot agree with the viewpoint that was expressed by Deputy Briscoe or by <Col N="1090" /> Deputy P.D. Lehane in regard to the powers of the board.  The Electricity Supply Board must have the very wide powers that are given them in this Bill and in the Act that this Bill is intended to amend.  Those wide powers are absolutely vital and essential if the Electricity Supply Board is to be a success.  In regard to the matter of capital expenditure I think the Minister was perfectly wise in confining the amount, £16,000,000, that he has mentioned to the amount that is asked for by the board at the moment if they do not want any more.</P>
    <P>If they are not in the position to expend any more with advantage to the community, then I think it would be very unwise to give them that power at the moment.  It is better in a general way for this House that when the board have taken steps to utilise the moneys made available for them the Minister should come back to this House and ask for the additional moneys.  In that way there is some check to this House in regard to the Electricity Supply Board.  I ask the Minister, in conclusion, to examine carefully Section 7 with a view to the elimination from it by general consent of the House of those parts of the section that I and quite a number of other Deputies consider objectionable.</P>

      <P>On a first perusal of this Bill I had thought that the scope of it was fairly narrow.  In the course of the debate it has widened considerably beyond its apparent terms.  In the course of that debate remarks were made about the constitution of the board and the functions of the Minister in that regard.  If I were left to be ruler of order myself regarding it, I feel that I would rule it out, but, perhaps, as the matter has been dwelt upon by other speakers the Chair may permit me to make a few observations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this undertaking, whatever its history, you have a national undertaking comparable with the Post Office. The case of the Post Office is that of an organisation which grew out of the carrying of mails to be an organisation catering for communications generally so that now the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is in fact Minister for Communications. All modern general <Col N="1091" /> means of message communication come within its scope&mdash;radio, postal service, telephones and telegraphs.  He is in the position of controlling the organisation which controls communications but he is also in the position of answering for it, with the result that the public, through the Deputies of this House, can acquire information readily. The affairs of the Post Office are in every way public affairs and subject to question as such.  Institutions and monopolies&mdash;State monopolies as they really are&mdash;such as the Electricity Supply Board and others which are developing in the offing grew up on the same lines under more modern conditions where the administrative personnel of the Civil Service began to feel that they had directive as well as executive and administrative functions. They began to feel, perhaps completely unconsciously,&mdash;I am talking about a machine&mdash;that they had the right to do things in a way that their predecessors, regarding themselves completely as servants of the public, did not believe they had the right and felt they were there merely to carry out the will of the public as expressed through the Ministry of the day.  They felt this completely unconsciously, and I want to be very clear so as not to be taken as making any allegations about our excellent Civil Service.  There is probably no better to be found in Europe at the moment and there is no service of a higher degree of integrity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to show an analogy between the board and the Civil Service in certain respects.  Why should they not be placed <i>vis-à-vis</i> this House and the securing of information in the position of the Civil Service? We have unconsciously developed the system here that a Minister sets up an organisation.  It is, in fact, under the very close control of that Minister and <Col N="1092" /> of the Civil Service organisation, but on the other hand, technically it is a unit and difficulties can be avoided by the simple expedient of saying that the Minister is not responsible.  The result is that information which Deputies seek to secure in this House is not as readily available as it is in the case of the Post Office.  As this opportunity offers itself, I would like to ask the Minister whether it is not desirable in the first place in the case of such a body as the Electricity Supply Board to place the same onus on the Minister and to place the Minister in the same position <i>vis-à-vis</i> that body as he is in regarding his own Department and its functions so that he can answer questions directed to him by the Deputies of this House so as to deal with problems in the same way as they can deal with the problems of, say, the Post Office.</P>
      <P>I am not suggesting introducing any technique or interfering with the Electricity Supply Board beyond that. It should create no difficulty because it is an organisation, an efficient public organisation, that has the information available.  All that is necessary is that the Minister's organisation should have the information necessary for answering questions in the same way as he would have upon any subdivision of his Department.  It should not be the case, as I understand it has been in the past in this House, that the Minister is able to answer that he has no direct functions in that regard and in that way evade giving the information sought.  That is the first comment I would like to make.</P>
      <P>Regarding the question of reorganisation machinery I did not quite see it arises on this Bill, I must confess. I prefaced my remarks by saying that I would be wide of the mark.  Though I am against multiplying Ministerial offices, where the functions of the Minister for Industry and Commerce are becoming so complex in modern times the suggestion made by another Deputy might be considered.  I am not expressing myself as being in favour of it or against it at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the present arrangement, an arrangement which I have tacitly suggested in my remarks, what should be <Col N="1093" /> the relation of the board to the Minister? This has a direct bearing upon a number of things which were said here by Deputy Larkin, in particular those relating to the technical nature of the board.  I take it that the Government, and in particular the Minister, is the proper authority to direct general policy regarding such matters as power production and the affording of facilities for electrical power to consumers, whether they be private or industrial, and so forth.  The proper authority who will have all the information at its disposal, the authority which within itself is a body representative of all facets of the community, is the Government and the immediate authority under that Government is the Minister concerned.  If that be the position, where are we <i>vis-à-vis</i> Deputy Larkin's suggestion that the board is too technical?  They have all the information; they have all the power; they have, in addition, the general executive power of the State in their hands; they have immediate control and immediate access to this House with a prior claim in respect of time.  No other body is better placed to dictate and expedite policy and the suggestion that such power should be delegated to a board of this nature is to my mind a retrograde step.  It is a retrograde step because the delegation of general powers of that nature to a board with limited functions must necessarily result in lopsided action. It is wrong also because that board, having one particular function, cannot see the totality of the picture.  It is further wrong in that if you adopt a policy of that nature in distributing out functions at the expense of the proper functions of the Government you will soon emasculate the Government and it will have no functions left. It has functions, responsibilities and facilities which no other body or group in the State can have; that is so, whether it is a case of the Post Office or of the Electricity Supply Board or of any other body which has limited and to a large extent executive functions&mdash;executive in the case of the Electricity Supply Board because it has to get a job of work done.</P>
    <P>I thus consider it to be the duty of <Col N="1094" /> the board to be an advisory staff in technical matters to the Minister.  The Minister, with other sources of information available, cross checks in his Department and access to his colleagues with regard to the repercussions on the rest of the community, will have ample opportunity of getting a general picture.  The board's information and the useful work the board can do are confined to technical advice very closely and definitely related to the objectives of the board, namely, the supply of electric power.  The board will have administrative functions as well and more so as time goes on and until it reaches the peak of its development, whenever that will be, but even so, I would join issue with Deputy Larkin and say that of its nature it must be largely a technical board because only the board can examine and assess the mass of information collected from its own engineers and technical people, including technical people to deal with purchases of materials and engineering construction work.  The members of the board must be technical in order to assess the value of the information they accumulate, to make firm recommendations to the Minister, to understand the potentialities of any particular problem and the difficulties and physical limitations of its solution.  Put it this way: it has been the case in any work, whether it be the construction of a factory of a dam, or the organisation of a factory for the production of technical goods, that you will usually find in the general planning of how it is to be run, and even on the business end, engineers and technical men and their knowledge comes into play.  When you are handling something which is of its nature essentially technical, in the ordinary day-to-day administration of the affairs of the board, the technical factor will be dominant and the general factor, which seems most to appeal to Deputy Larkin, comes second as far as the board is concerned and it should be more directly referred to the Minister.</P>
    <P>As I visualise the situation, I think it highly desirable that the board should be a technical board and that right through the organisation of that undertaking, which of its nature is almost completely technical, the technical <Col N="1095" /> personnel must be the directing force.  The Minister, with his powers, representing as he does the public in general and knowing the other factors that come into the picture, is the counter-balance, the proper person to be responsible in the sense visualised by Deputy Larkin.  It is the Minister, for instance, who should have to deal with problems in the nature of disputes. The board should be primarily concerned with pressing ahead with plans for development, the efficient production of power and distribution to the consumer and, of course, the incidental administration concerned with that.  If major problems arise, then the board will naturally have its view.  If there is a counter public view, a labour view, that particular labour problem is a matter for the Minister by right in another regard.  Then, it is in my opinion wrong that such an important problem should be merely passed back to the board and the responsibility evaded by the Minister.  If that is involved in the Deputy's suggestion, that would be wrong.  For these reasons I join issue with him upon it.</P>
    <P>After all, what is this board?  Deputy Larkin, Deputy Cowan and these people go on talking about this board as if it were a private board, what certain people like to call a capitalist employer, somebody exploiting the worker. What is this board?  The Electricity Supply Board is a board of directors appointed by the Government, or, let us say, they are appointed by this House acting on behalf of the people, through legislation providing a concern for the benefit of the people.  The employers in this case are the people. The sooner we get down to see what the real issue is the better.  By all means, let us have fair play; let us have the worker get a fair crack of the whip.  I would go a little bit further and say that where leeway has to be given, let it be at the top by the people who have big incomes, if there are any such in the country.  Let the &ldquo;give&rdquo; be there first.  I grant you all that.  But the reality of the situation in dealing with such a board as the Electricity Supply Board is that the real employers are the people, <Col N="1096" /> including the workers themselves. Therefore, it is futile to talk about the board or any other such body as if it were an oppressive employer.  You have to get it into perspective.  But really it is the Government acting for the people who are the employers. For that reason, I suggest that when tackling these problems they must be tackled soberly and quietly.  We must understand in connection with such disputes that the payment both of capital and ordinary incidental outlay in the case of this board, if it does not come from collections from the consumer or profits on ordinary working, which are in the nature of collections from the consumer, comes from the pockets of the ordinary people.  These are all problems that have to be balanced, but they are problems which can only be rationally balanced by this House with the advice of the Government which is able to give us all the information.</P>
    <P>I merely mention this point in passing just to offset slightly what seems to be the instinctive attitude of certain Deputies like Deputy Cowan and to bring into clear relief that my conception of this organisation is that it is virtually a State Department, a State Department in which in the present set-up there is a gap which prevents us getting the same clear view in this House that we have of the Post Office where the State did it frankly without any apparent gap.  I suggest in the interests of efficiency that we should realise the true situation, that the board is put in the position of making such information available to the Minister and so can make itself, shall I say, amenable to affording information as other Departments are but, its set-up should be preponderantly technical; right through its framework the technical angle must take precedence.  The engineers, the skilled technical men, should, in my opinion, take precedence over the mere administrative angle in that Department.  As for the general social question, it is for the State to hold the scales in the way I have indicated. So much for the point about a technical board.</P>
    <P>The question of power production was also touched upon by certain <Col N="1097" /> Deputies.  I quite agree in principle with Deputy Larkin that if you can coordinate such a thing as a drainage programme with a power programme so much the better.  But the trouble, or may be the blessing, is that when dealing with things like power production you are up against definite physical laws and you cannot talk round them.  I immediately ask myself when people talk about drainage: is there not very often fairly low land that needs draining and even some draining that may mean pumping?  If such very low land needs draining and you are trying to get the water off, where do you stand with regard to getting the head necessary for power?</P>
    <P>If it can be done, by all means let it be done, but I have doubts about the augmentation of our water power resources by such a scheme.  In certain localities, perhaps yes.  If in any way such a drainage scheme can be designed to increase the volume of water in the main power rivers, for instance, the drainage of an area increasing the volume of water going into the Shannon, subject to what the engineers would have to say, generally that might appear to be a desirable thing.  Personally, however, I have doubts as to real contribution that can be gained from that source.</P>
    <P>Secondly, we have been talking about turf.  The big advantage about a water hydro-electric power scheme is that you have a fair expectation of continuing power, whereas when you develop your bogs you are likely to use up the fuel supply at a greater rate than it can be replaced and to that extent you are impoverishing yourselves for the future.  Therefore, in answer to Deputy Lehane, I think it was, one has to work it on the hard physical basis of how much is actually available for burning and what is the economic or useful rate to burn it.  I am merely giving the other side of the problems with a view to stressing again the fact that you cannot dispose of things of that nature my merely flicking your hand.</P>

    <P>That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that, in order to ascertain costs of production in agriculture with a view to ensuring that the efficient farmer will get his cost of production and a reasonable profit, one or more medium-sized farms should be acquired by the Department of Agriculture in each county, and under the direction of the county agricultural officer should be run entirely by hired labour employed at the minimum rate of wages fixed by the Agricultural Wages Board. &mdash;(Patrick Cogan, Patrick O'Reilly).</P>

      <P>To resume the debate on the motion before the House is rather difficult after the lapse of a week.  I would like to continue to deal with the points raised the last day.  I am glad the Minister is present now. It would have been an advantage to us if we could have had his mind earlier, but he will have ample time before the debate concludes.</P>
      <P>First of all, the question of farm costings has been in dispute over a long number of years.  Various figures have been put up by individuals and by organisations and invariably they were disputed by others or by the Minister for Agriculture at the time.  It is about time there was some authoritative source whereby the question would be put beyond doubt or dispute.  Regarding the necessity for such costings I think there is general agreement and it is only on the question as to how those costings should be ascertained that there is any dispute.  There has been a good deal of obvious misunderstanding of the purpose of this motion and I think it must be because various speakers did not read the motion.  The wording is rather clear and I fail to see how anyone could misunderstand it. If I am in order, a Chinn Chomhairle, I will read it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I will read the motion.  <i>(Motion read.)</i>  That is not in any way ambiguous.  Seeing that it is more or less generally agreed that it is essential to get an authoritative figure on costings, I do not see why any Deputy should say that the thing is impossible or unworkable in relation to facts.  Those who intervened in the debate from each side of the House seemed to hold very varying views.  It is quite obvious that the House is not going to divide in the centre on it.  We have protagonists and antagonists on each side, which is a healthy situation and a sign that the question is about to be considered on its merits rather than on Party issues.  That is something to be thankful for.</P>
      <P>In the absence of the Minister on the last day of the debate, when the Minister for Defence was acting in his place and spoke on the motion, he seemed to think that, in the setting up of this experimental farm to ascertain costs, there would be a farm manager who would be more or less a technical officer of the Department of Agriculture and that a salary commensurate with his degrees in agriculture would be charged against the farm.  In addition, he seemed to think that, since it would be run under the direction of the county agricultural officer, a proportion of his salary would be charged against this experimental farm.  I do not think I am wronging the Minister for Defence in that&mdash;if I am, I certainly wish to withdraw it&mdash;but I would like to correct that misapprehension.  It is not now and never was in the mind of the proposer of the motion, or in my mind as seconder, that such a thing should be contemplated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The idea is that a farm be taken, an ordinary farm representative of the size of the farms in each county, representative of the system of farming carried on in those counties, and that it be carried on entirely by hired labour, to see if it would pay the cost of the labour and give a working profit. There should be no high-scaled salaries charged against it but ordinary labourers' wages.  I suppose there would be something more due to the charge-hand, or farm manager, if you <Col N="1100" /> have to call him such.  He would be entitled to something more than an ordinary labourer's wages, just as a farmer running his own farm would be entitled to something more than his hired labourers, since he carries the responsibilities and brings a more highly skilled knowledge to operate in the carrying on of the business.  In addition, he has to do a good deal of overtime, as those conversant with farming know quite well that the farmer&mdash;or, in this case, the farm manager &mdash;might be called on at any of the 24 hours of the day and night to perform some task on the farm.  Beyond that, there would be no special wages beyond the ordinary wages of labour on the farm.  I cannot see how anyone could be under a misapprehension that there would be an undue charge on this experimental farm which might inflate the costings.</P>
    <P>It would not be possible to ascertain farm costings in one year.  The rotation of crops is at least over a three or four-year period, so it would take at least that time, and possibly longer, to ascertain the costings with any degree of accuracy.  To be properly run, the farm would have to be divided into at least three departments&mdash;the production of root crops, the production of grain crops and the production of grass crops&mdash;to find out what it would cost to produce all these things.  That would be totted up at the end of the three-year period&mdash;the whole expenses and the income received&mdash;and the balance would be struck, to see over the period if it would pay the labourers and give a reasonable profit.</P>
    <P>Why is there need for farm costings? One may say the farmer is free to run his farm in whatever manner he wishes. But is that so?  Has it been so?  Particularly during the years of the emergency, has not farming been regimented? Has not the farmer been directed as to the crops he must produce for the benefit of other sections of the community?  Have not the wages of the worker been fixed? In face of all that, shall we say the farmer is free?  Had the farmer been free during the years of the emergency to engage in any task he found most profitable, would he have continued to <Col N="1101" /> produce foodstuffs for the other sections of the population?  He might possibly have engaged in some other line that would yield him a higher net profit.</P>
    <P>We are told that farm prices have been fixed.  They have been but, in the main, for what purpose?  To keep down the price the farmer should get for his produce.  Had the price of butter and milk not been fixed during the years of scarcity, what price would the farmers have got for these products? The farmer was regimented.  He was directed to do a particular thing for the benefit of others at his own personal loss.  We are told that is all ended, that there will be no compulsion, that the farmer is free to run his farm and will not be directed by inspectors unless he invites them.  That is all to the good.  But, the farmer having given national service and having reduced the capital value of his farm by the production of crops without sufficient fertilisers, is it right to tell the farmer now, when there is a possibility of a slump as a result of increased production in the world, to do what he likes and to allow him to face international competition in markets that may mean that he will have to take a price that is highly unprofitable?</P>
    <P>The farmer has an income and an outlay.  His outlay includes purchase of raw materials, interest on the capital value of his farm and equipment, depreciation, purchase of agricultural machinery, rent and rates, fertilisers, etcetera, payment of minimum wage to his workers.  His income is derived from the sale of produce in whatever form he may market it.  Whether in the raw state, or as a highly concentrated article of human food, the farmer is hemmed in between those two lines.  That is a further reason why farm costings should be ascertained.  It is not right that anyone should be compelled to work on what he considers a loss.  The only way in which costings can be ascertained is by actual experiment on the land, where there can be no dispute.</P>
    <P>We are told that restitution is to be made to the farmer for reduction of soil fertility during the emergency by <Col N="1102" /> schemes of restoration, refertilisation and so on.  That is all to the good. That is a grand scheme which will benefit those living on the land and the nation.  It will make the land more reproductive and will be a great national capital investment that will bear interest that no other investment could bear.  But that is a long-term policy that will produce no immediate results.  What are the farmers to do in the meantime?  Is a state of affairs to continue where the farmer complains that he is not getting a labourer's wage while other sections of the community say that the farmer was never as well off, that he is wallowing in wealth and has no cause for complaint?</P>
    <P>There is another reason why the issue should be put beyond doubt.  It takes a year to complete the work on a farm.  The farmer prepares his ground and sows his crops in spring. The crop matures during the summer and in the autumn he reaps the harvest. Then he sells his produce in the raw state or produces a highly-concentrated article of human food by feeding his crops to animals.  He receives no weekly return.  He has to take his income over the year, and one year is interlocked with another.  He is engaged during the year in a task which gives no immediate return. Therefore, his income must be regarded as an annual income, and one year will interlock with another, which is the reason why I have suggested the three-year period for the purpose of costing.</P>
    <P>Surprise has been expressed that farmer representatives should be anxious to ascertain farm costings.  It is remarkable that farmer representatives should be anxious to disclose the profits of the agricultural industry, and I doubt if any other industry would be anxious to have a detailed investigation of its costs of production.  If there are the big profits in agriculture that some people seem to imagine, why would farmer representatives be anxious to have that fact disclosed?  We dispute the statement that there are big profits. We challenge anyone to put it to the test and to see if farming will pay the labourers and give a reasonable profit. <Col N="1103" /> If it does not pay the labourers over a period of three years, then farming is being carried on at a loss and is not giving a labourer's wage to the farmer and family labour.</P>
    <P>It may be contended that there is no comparison between hired labour and family labour.  Is family labour not entitled to at least a hired labourer's wage?  Are the family not giving personal service to the State which, it must be admitted, will give better results than hired labour?  Why should the comparison be regarded as unequal? The labourer is worthy of his hire whether he is a hired labourer or a member of the family.  That is irrefutable.</P>
    <P>Suppose this system of farm costings discloses a profit.  Who would object to this experiment being carried out in each county if it resulted in better methods of farming than those which exist on farms at present and if it showed a profit?  Would it not be a great education to the rest of us to see that if the advice and instructions given by the technical officer of the Department of Agriculture were practised on a farm it would yield better results than those obtaining under the present system?  Would it not be a great national advantage, a great education to all our farmers?  I for one will be the first to congratulate the Department of Agriculture if they are able to disclose them.  I will gladly imitate and emulate their efforts on my farm if they will effect an improvement.</P>
    <P>Taken all round, I sincerely hope the House will go honestly into the question, examine it without prejudice in any way in an effort to get down to a better system of farming, and put an end to the dispute that is always going on between farmers and whoever happens to be the Minister for Agriculture.</P>

One is the general question of the desirability of farm costings and the other is the most effective method whereby to ascertain farm costings.  I think there is, really, a third section, because I infer from the paragraph &ldquo;that the efficient farmer will get his <Col N="1104" /> costs of production and a reasonable profit&rdquo; that the issue is raised as to how far Parliament, on behalf of the community, should pledge the resources of the State to see that, whatever the state of the world markets may be, a farmer in Ireland who has worked conscientiously and energetically will get a price for what he produces sufficient to leave him a profit for his year's labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to take these three issues seriatim.  Many people will advise the Minister for Agriculture to avoid, if he could, the seeming dilemma that is created for him when he is asked: &ldquo;Are you prepared to ensure that a farmer who works conscientiously and well during the 12 months will get not an extravagant profit or riches, but a reasonable reward for his year's work,&rdquo; and to that, I believe, any honest Minister for Agriculture must reply: &ldquo;I believe I am paid to do my best to ensure that a farmer will get an adequate reward for his year's work, but neither I nor any other Minister for Agriculture in the world who is a Minister of the Government in a country primarily agricultural can honestly give any such guarantee to every farmer.&rdquo;  Many farmers, seeing the Government of the United States, seeing the Government of Great Britain, guaranteeing prices not unnaturally incline to ask themselves: &ldquo;Why cannot our Government do for our farmers what the Government of the United States and the Government of Great Britain can do for their farmers?&rdquo;  The reason our Government cannot do for the farmers of Ireland what the Government of Great Britain and the Government of the United States can do for their farmers is that in Ireland everybody, in the last analysis, is getting his living out of the farmer.  Doctors, lawyers, merchants, manufacturers, labourers, all ultimately derive their living out of the wealth created by those who live upon the land and get their living out of the land.  In America, in Great Britain, the exact reverse obtains. The main source of the wealth of those two nations is their mineral resources and their industrial capacity.  It does, from time to time, suit their general political set up deliberately to tie the <Col N="1105" /> income of their industrial wealth with a sum adequate to guarantee to those who live upon the land fixed prices for the produce of the land&mdash;well knowing that world prices may so fluctuate as to create an immense liability for them but well knowing that, if they do, the Treasury is so enriched by industrial and mineral wealth that it can afford to carry the charge.</P>
    <P>Here in Ireland, suppose we undertake to guarantee the price of a commodity of which our people are readily capable of producing a substantial surplus over and above the capacity of our people to consume, when a surplus is produced, the Irish Treasury must find the money to make up the difference between world prices and the price which has been guaranteed.  Where must they go for that?  Where have they to go to?  Whatever tax they level, whatever source they tap for revenue &mdash;follow it to its ultimate end and you will find the source of the wealth is the land.  You will find that, directly or indirectly, the money used to subsidise that particular crop has been, in the last analysis, extracted from the agricultural community itself until, ultimately, the situation is created which has repeatedly caused me irritation and disgust in which the farmers of this country are expected to say &ldquo;Thank you&rdquo; to the Government which puts their hand in the farmer's left-hand pocket, takes out his money, and, to the strains of a brass band and loud declaration, gives him back his own to put it into his right-hand pocket.  If that were the only danger that beset us in pursuing such a policy, it would be relatively small.  But it is not.  Fix the price of any particular crop in this country, the production of which comes natural to our economy, and, if the trend of world prices is generally lower &mdash;as it most undoubtedly is going to be over the next decade&mdash;if you leave that one particular crop fixed at a rigid point, while the rest of the economy drops away and there is no natural tendency for the crop to disappear from our rotation, there will happen precisely what happened in France&mdash;more and more of the subsidised crop is produced and the liability on the central Treasury becomes heavier and heavier.  Ultimately <Col N="1106" /> the astonishing situation emerges that the Government finds itself the possessor of a vast surplus of some particular cereal or other product for which it is bound to pay the farmer the price stipulated for and which it has to get rid of by exporting it and selling it at what it will fetch.</P>
    <P>Deputies will remember that, before the war, for purely ulterior political reasons succeeding French Governments subsidised the growing of wheat in France until the stage was reached at which the French Government were paying for wheat in France a price which would have justified 30/-a cwt. for flour and were yet obliged to export flour to London where they sold it for 17/-.  At the beginning of 1938 or 1939, many of the agricultural economists of the world, contemplating that spectacle, began to ask themselves: When is there going to emerge in France a Government which will break this vicious circle because if it goes on forever France is increasing the volume of flour which she has to export; her own people are unable to consume it, and are we going to see the glorious day when the French people are growing a crop on their own land and, in substance, giving it away to the British people, not for any economic or international political reason but just because it has become so important in domestic policy to maintain this particular price level that no Government dares change it?</P>
    <P>Therefore, when we talk of fixing prices, I beg this House to remember that, in so far as we are producing a crop the total produce of which has to be consumed in Ireland by our own people, it becomes purely a matter for this House to decide, as representing all sections of the people, whether the price is to be fixed or not and how and on whom that price is to be levied, whether it be the consumer or the taxpayer in general.  But, where you are dealing with a crop which manifestly may easily and rapidly attain an acreage or a volume which produces year after year a growing surplus over and above our own requirements, face the fact that, though you may pretend to subsidise it, the consumer will not, because we cannot compel him, inasmuch <Col N="1107" /> as he lives outside our dominion. Therefore, we must bridge the gap between what the foreign consumer will pay and what the farmer is to receive.  We must find the money to bridge that gap, and if my study of the economics of this country is correct, no matter what abracadabra is employed in the process of raising the money to bridge that gap to ensure the farmer a fixed price, in the last analysis it will boil down to the Government putting its hand in the farmer's left-hand pocket and, having extracted his money silently and covertly, handing it back to him to put in his right-hand pocket with a great fanfare of trumpets and the constant reminder of how deeply beholden the farmer is to the community for all the largesse that is bestowed on him.  If any farmers dare afterwards call it a slice of their own, is it to be suggested that they are parasites in the body politic living on the community?</P>
    <P>I do not believe in putting the farmers of this country in the position where those concerned to belittle them can suggest that they are living on something approximating to charity when, in fact, no matter what way the cat jumps in Ireland, if the people in Ireland are to live at all it is the farmers they must live out of, and if they had not the farmers to live out of then no one in this country would live at all.  All the wealth that we have comes out of the 10,000,000 or 12,000,000 acres of arable land that we have, and it comes out of that through the work of our farmers and farm labourers.  Do not ever let us forget that, and do not let us ever mislead the, farmers of this country into permitting anybody to blind their eyes to that fact, or create a situation in which they can propound, with many similitudes, the proposition that the farmers of this country are living on their neighbours.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with each of the three propositions that this resolution proposes. The only crop that interests me is the crop or produce of which I believe the competent farmer in this country can produce in evergrowing abundance.  That means a crop of which we must anticipate, at some <Col N="1108" /> stage, an exportable surplus.  Now, that is where I deem the duty of a Minister for Agriculture comes in.  His duty is to impress on the Government to which he belongs that, in any trade agreement entered into by this country with another country, the potentialities of the market of that country for the profitable disposal of agricultural produce must be the first concern of our Government.  The duty of the Minister for Agriculture is to persuade, and to assist, the Government in which he takes part to capture for our people as many and as great outlets for as great a variety of products capable of production by our people as he possibly can, so that by securing a profitable market for such things as cattle, sheep, pigs, bacon, eggs and fowl, he will be in a position to say to the farmers of this country: &ldquo;Now, you can produce confidently to the limit of your capacity because if, in regard to any particular crop you grow, a cash market is not readily available, we have secured an outlet at your disposal for a term, a sure market, at a remunerative price, for a finished product in the production of which you can employ the crop which, when you sow it, you hope to sell for cash, but which, in the harvest conditions in which you have been called to reap it, is no longer readily saleable as a cash crop.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Far from lamenting and deploring that situation, he must recognise that the state of the cereal market of the world is for us in Ireland no worse than in any other country.  Unlike most of the great cereal-producing countries of the world, we can change our policy from cereals to meat or meat to cereals. If the cereal price be high and farmers want to avail of it, they can.  If the world cereal price goes against cereals, our farmers, instead of having to lament their losses, should seize the opportunity to recompense themselves for the loss of their anticipated profits by feeding, not only the cereals they have produced upon their own land, but going on to the market in which the price of cereals had catastrophically fallen and buying cheap cereals to double their potential production&mdash;feed pigs, fowl, cattle, sheep, to be disposed of in the guaranteed market secured for them as their insurance against the <Col N="1109" /> unexpected fluctuations of a cereal market which this country is no more able to control than we can control the ebbing and the flowing of the tide.</P>
    <P>How can a rational body like this House seriously exhort the Minister for Agriculture to control the price of surplus cereals in a time when the entire resources of the United States Treasury, thrown into their own market, is utterly powerless to stem the flood?  You may see the cereals market of Chicago, before Mayday, suffer an earthquake and instead of sitting down here and wringing our hands and making silly speeches for silly, unworthy, little political ends, we should be hoping that neither our friends in America nor elsewhere will unduly suffer as a result of a fall in the price of cereals and we should seize the golden opportunity to double and treble our production by using up all the cereals of our own production and buying as much as we can lay hands on to put it through the same process of conversion.</P>
    <P>It is right that I should say to every Deputy now, most explicitly, that in my judgment no Minister for Agriculture in the world can undertake to provide a profitable cash market for every cereal crop that the farmers of this country, in their wisdom, choose to produce.  If that is the criterion set for me, the sooner I am dismissed the better.  I cannot do it, I do not believe any living man can do it, and I am not going to concede that, for £1,525 a year, I can do it, when I know full well I cannot.  What I do concede to be the duty of the Minister for Agriculture is to get a secure market for what the farmers for whom he stands trustee are capable of producing.  I have got that, and I intend to continue with that, and when I can no longer get it, I will make place for someone who can.</P>
    <P>There are two other topics that I shall deal with in a moment.  I understood Deputy O'Reilly to say that he welcomed the restoration of freedom, but he thought it a hardship that farmers, having to see the fertility of their soil decline and having had to bear the rigours of the past ten or 15 years unaided, should be thrown out on the <Col N="1110" /> waves of freedom and expect to be profoundly grateful.  He said they were now placed on land that is capable of producing relatively little. I agree with Deputy O'Reilly, and I think it would be a great disservice to the farmers in this country, large or small, knowing the deplorable devastation which has been wrought upon the agricultural land here, if the Government of to-day were to pretend to ignore that and to tell the farmers: &ldquo;Now you are free to run your own place in your own way&rdquo;, and then upbraid them if they do not produce the stuff, pretending that we did not know the land that had been left to them would not respond to their efforts.</P>
    <P>But we have not done that.  What we have done is to get the markets, to affirm the principle that the best people to operate the land of this country are the people who live on that land and who get their living on it. So long as it is not legal in this country to break the lock on a doctor's door, or a lawyer's door, or a shopkeeper's door, it is not legal to break the lock on a farmer's gate.  That has been our undertaking.  Fixed with the knowledge that the land he is left with has substantially lost heart, we are starting out to put back out of the common purse of our people fertility into the land of Ireland; not as a relief work, not as a device primarily to employ labour, not as a bounty for this farmer or that farmer, but in the profound conviction that the source of all wealth in this country ultimately is the land. The best economy that any Government in Ireland can follow is to make the land as productive as it is possible to make it, whoever owns it and without regard to the fact as to whether he is a big farmer, or a little farmer, or a middling farmer; not because of who owns the land, but because it is Ireland. Then the corollary of that decision must be that we do not accept the proposition that the bulk of Irish farmers are lazy, ignorant, incompetent goms who ought not to be allowed to run their places except under control and direction and inspection.  If that is true we are throwing away a great part of this nation's wealth and saving. If that is true everything I have stood <Col N="1111" /> for in public life is so much sound and fury signifying naught.  If that is true the last three generations of our people have spent their lives in vain.  If it is true, then the landlords should never have been put out of the land.  If it is true, then it was a good thing to have the bailiffs and the agents to manage the land.  But the fathers of most of us believed that that was not true and believed that the land would never yield what it could be made to yield until the landlords, the agents and the bailiffs were cleared out and the men who lived upon the land were given a chance to work it.  They are going to get that chance now.  They are going to get a chance to work the land not as the residue of a century of landlords' mismanagement and not as the residue of 15 years of folly through which we have just passed.  They are going to get the land as perfect as it is possible for us to make it.  They are going to get land, some of which, as has been described in the report of Professor Holmes circulated to-day, he believes to be the finest in the world.  They are going to get land which some of the greatest authorities in the world have said is capable of a higher production than any equal acreage in any quarter of the globe.</P>
    <P>No matter what section of our people contributes to that, I think they will get the best value they ever got for money laid out; if they disagree with me, then the sooner they shift me the better.  That is what their money will be spent on&mdash;the safest investment in the world to-day, the land of Ireland and the people who live on it.  A great part of our savings will be put into the land in the confident anticipation that ultimately they will come back to our people ten and twenty-fold.</P>
    <P>I sympathise with Deputy O'Reilly's apprehension when he talks of our asking the farmers to perform miracles on land which was run down.  We have not done that and we do not intend to do it.  Deputy O'Reilly envisaged a three-year period for costings.  I find it hard to understand how a three-year period could work.  I know that in countries like Great Britain, where the farms are large and the farmers are <Col N="1112" /> accustomed to keeping accounts for their own information, and similarly in the United States of America, farm costings have been done with varying degrees of success.  I am constantly conscious of this shortcoming on my own part.  I was reared amongst ten and 15-acre farms.  When I think of agricultural problems, I am conscious of the fact that my mind is perhaps in some degree clouded by the intimacy of my family with the ten-acre man and the 15-acre man.  When I am asked to consider costings, or some other development of that statistical type, I think of them in relation to the people amongst whom I was brought up.  Naturally, that is an error which it is my duty to correct.  It is an error which I am trying to correct.  When I first thought of costings in relation to the small farmers, it did not seem to me to come within the sphere of practical politics; because my neighbours kept a pig at one time and they thought it was going to pay to keep a pig, but the next time one called, they were no longer keeping a pig; they had gone into something else.</P>
    <P>I discovered, however, that Dr. Murphy's results, through the limited surveys he took, were of such a character that no rational person, having perused them, could maintain the position that costings were impossible in this country.  I suppose the best sign of a powerful intellect is that a man is not afraid to change his mind; and I am glad to inform the House that my mind has been coerced by the work done by Dr. Murphy.  Certainly within a certain sphere it is possible to get useful costings in this country.  Accordingly, I am going to do what I believe to be the rational thing; I am going to ask Dr. Murphy's opinion, and the opinion of any other well-informed person with whom I can discuss the matter, as to what is the most effective method of designing a costings' survey system for the Department of Agriculture. Personally, I shall proceed with caution from one sphere of agriculture to another.  Unless I am greatly mistaken Professor Murphy has established that it is possible in respect of the dairying industry, taking a wide enough sample, to get a reasonably <Col N="1113" /> reliable service.  It can never be conclusive. I am not prepared to admit that any statistical operation is a conclusive proof because no matter what statistical operation one engages in, unless it is on a quasi-universal scale, there still remains the human element.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister gave his reply the other day to my question on this subject, he obviously got some support from certain members of the House, judging by the exclamations of &ldquo;hear, hear&rdquo;, which were quite audible.  I want to assure the House that the reason for putting that question on the Order Paper was that in the constituency for which I am Deputy there exists a condition of affairs such as would be scarcely credible in a Christian society.  It was in response to appeals of several of my constituents that that question was put down.  Since the housing council came into existence, in the Borough of Dun Laoghaire and in the Rathdown area, apart from the initiative of the Dun Laoghaire Borough council, little progress has been made. True, in the Ballyboden area, a partial, but still inadequate, effort has been made to alleviate the hardships of the people but, nevertheless, a vast area in that constituency remains untouched. However congested space in Dun Laoghaire may be, there is no excuse for failing to develop the hinterland and literally choke it with houses.  The people in this large constituency are undergoing hardships of which I am sure the housing council have no knowledge.  If they had, they would pay some attention to the conditions which prevail there&mdash;rat-infested houses, vermin-infested houses, disease-infested houses, sewage-infested houses &mdash;not in a few cases but in hundreds of cases in this Christian State of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the housing council have done nothing to alleviate the needs of the people suffering these hardships in places like Newtown Park, Dalkey, Stillorgan, Windy Arbour, Stepaside. <Col N="1114" /> But we hear of plans.  Since we came to this House we have been hearing of nothing but plans.  I should like to know whether the Minister is satisfied that the housing council have done what they should.  Has any attempt been made to recruit direct labour? There are many excuses regarding the scarcity of skilled labour.  Undoubtedly in some cases there is a scarcity of skilled labour but have the housing council made any approach to the trade unions and asked for their co-operation? Have they guaranteed the workers constant work, and particularly have they discussed with the trade unions the question of bringing back to the country the skilled tradesmen who have emigrated, undertaking to keep them in constant employment? If the housing council have not done that I suggest that they have sadly failed in their duty.</P>
    <P>If that interchange of views with the trade unions took place sufficient tradesmen could be supplied and, even if not, is there anything to prevent the coincidental adoption of the excellent pre-cast houses which have recently been patented in this country by Mr. Fitzpatrick?  These are not merely prefabricated houses intended to last for a few years.  Their durability extends to a couple of hundred years. They could be built by unskilled labourers for the greater part.  I wonder whether an approach has been made to the problem by inquiring into the advisability of erecting houses of this type.  Again, if the housing council have not done so, I suggest they have failed in their duty.</P>
    <P>One of the things that I am sure will face the housing council is the existence of &ldquo;rings&rdquo;.  In these houses of which I have spoken, these prefabricated houses of Mr. Fitzpatrick, I saw locks which were bought at 3/6 less than the figure at which they could be procured in Dublin.  These locks were not only locks in the ordinary sense. They were double locks.  I saw their doors, which were considerably cheaper than those which could be bought in Dublin.  I saw their baths, which were pounds cheaper than similar articles in Dublin.  I am certain that the existence of such impediments, increasing <Col N="1115" /> the cost of the erection of houses, must be a serious barrier to the development of the aims which the housing council should have in view.  Not only is there a &ldquo;ring&rdquo; in housing equipment, but there is also a &ldquo;ring&rdquo; in the actual building of houses.  It is a strange thing that a four-roomed labourer's cottage can be built in County Meath for £725 and five or six miles away in County Dublin the same cottage will cost between £1,100 and £1,200.  I suggest that the existence of such a state of affairs should not be tolerated.</P>
    <P>If the housing council is to have powers, I suggest that it should see that this extraordinary discrepancy between the cost of various articles which can be procured and the cost of erecting the houses should be investigated seriously.  If this investigation is carried out I am perfectly certain that the number of houses could be considerably increased.  As I said at the beginning, I am quite certain in my own mind that the housing council have done very little in the part of the County of Dublin which I have the honour to represent.  I suggest to the Minister that he should decentralise that administration and that he should set up in the Borough of Dun Laoghaire a body of men who know local conditions and who would have power to develop housing in that area.  I am perfectly certain, too, that the greatest barrier the housing council may have to face, and probably does face, is the existence of that incomparable monster, red tape.  I am perfectly certain that it is probably the greatest barrier to the activities of the housing council, and I suggest to the Minister that he should abolish that form of government.  He should insist that no considerations of red tape will interfere with the provision of houses for those who need them.</P>
    <P>I should like to read a letter from amongst the hundreds which I have got concerning conditions which prevail in Dublin.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am sending you on particulars of my room.  It is a top back room over a yard and lavatories and in the warm weather the smell and flies that come up through the window are <Col N="1116" /> terrible.  Also it is damp and I cannot put anything against the walls for long as it becomes mouldy.  As for the rats, my wife's nerves are not worth anything with them.  At first she discovered a dead one in a clothes drawer when cleaning it out.  Another morning she went to the baby's cot and there was one under the blankets alive.  I have plastered and cemented the holes several times but they come through again.  My wife had three good coats, a frock and a hat eaten by them, not to mention the kiddies' clothes.  The fire-grate is very bad; the fire brigade man said I was not to light a fire and the owner is supposed to repair it.  Anyway, when we do light the fire at times it blows out and would choke you so it has to be put out.</P>
    <P>We have two boys, one two and a half years and the other four years of age.  The youngest sweats an awful lot at night when asleep.  My wife, being worried, brought him to the clinic and the doctor sent him for an X-ray.  They cannot get out for a walk except when my wife can bring them as, being so young, they cannot go out on their own.  When she does bring them out the oldest complains of pains in his legs and of being tired.  I am sure you understand.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do understand.  That child is probably suffering from tuberculosis due to overcrowding.  I suggest that if this were a totalitarian State the housing question would have been solved in the last 12 months.  I suggest, too, that the housing council are sowing seeds of social unrest by failing to provide houses for those who need them.  I want to assure the Minister that it is from no other desire than to help that these matters have been so raised.  I hope that he will break the shackles which hold him and his council and that a practical step will be taken soon to relieve this problem and to give our long suffering citizens at least some place on which they can lay their heads.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrady" hpid="Mr. S. Brady Mr. S. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very anxious to hear the Minister and, therefore, I shall only take a minute or two.  I should like to say at the outset that I <Col N="1117" /> do not agree with the opinion that the housing council has no knowledge of this problem or that they have neglected their duty.  When the Minister set up this council I expressed the view that he could not have got a better, a more conscientious or a more capable officer for that council than Mr. O'Mahoney.  I do not think anyone appreciates the problem more than Mr. O'Mahoney but now that the question is raised I think it would be wise if the Minister would give a very detailed statement on the whole subject.</P>
      <P>We, on the Dun Laoghaire Borough Corporation, understand what the problem is and we realise that we still have houses as appalling as described by Deputy Brennan.  It is in the interest of those people who are still without proper houses and who believe that something more could be done in the way of speeding up the houses that the Minister should be given an opportunity to explain as fully as possible what the problem in Dun Laoghaire is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Murphy) Timothy Joseph Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Murphy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge very freely the sincerity and zeal which Deputy Dr. Brennan has brought to bear on this question.  It is entirely in line with his approach to social questions and, indeed, to any other questions to which he has addressed himself when a member of this House.  If I do not admit the conclusions that he has arrived at it in no way detracts from my full understanding of the spirit in which he has approached this problem.</P>
      <P>I want to submit to the House details showing that while the position is one which requires to be improved as much as possible, the existing conditions give considerable hope of very good results in a reasonably short time. The Deputy's question relates to two areas, one the borough area of Dun Laoghaire and the other that portion of the County Dublin area known as the Rathdown area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the up-to-date information in both areas would help to clear up any misconceptions that may exist about inactivity there.  The Dun Laoghaire Borough Council, which, of course, is the housing authority, <Col N="1118" /> because the housing council is an advisory body, have ascertained the needs of the borough to be 1,000 houses. Since March, 1947, 83 houses have been completed.  At the moment, there are in course of construction in the borough 130 houses; and houses about to be commenced&mdash;these would be houses, I presume, in the hands of the contractors but not yet started&mdash;24.  Development work is in progress by direct labour in the case of 20 houses, and plans approved, bills of quantities being prepared or tenders accepted for the development of part of the site in the case of 367 houses.  The figures I have given, apart from the completed houses &mdash;a comparatively small number&mdash; represent 550 additional houses, and the housing needs of the borough, as I have said, are estimated at 1,000 houses.</P>
    <P>My information is that the Rathdown area comprises about one-third of the area of South County Dublin, stretching from Milltown to Shankill, adjoining the Borough of Dun Laoghaire, and I want to tell the House what the Dublin County Council have been doing in that area.  They have in progress, tenders accepted, tenders about to be invited or sites being acquired, proposals in respect of 183 houses.  I am not quite clear, because the survey that was recently decided on is not yet completed, as to the actual housing requirements of the area, but the result of the survey of sites which is being carried on by the sites committee will be available very shortly.</P>
    <P>It will be of interest to Deputies to know that over 500 cottages are in course of construction in the rural areas in County Dublin at present. They include, of course, groups of cottages close by non-municipal towns. It is confidently expected that that number will be increased to 1,000 during the course of the present year.  Sites have been selected for immediate acquisition in County Dublin to the number of about 1,000, and preliminary steps are being taken in connection with 1,500 more.  The total housing needs of the county are estimated at 3,000 houses, and between the 500 cottages under construction at the moment and the other proposals in the various <Col N="1119" /> stages of development, the entire requirements of County Dublin, as estimated to date, are being provided for.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, in housing schemes, there has to be a programme and there have to be plans, not alone in the technical sense, but in the administrative sense, and sometimes there are delays which are unavoidable, but which, in the circumstances of terrible urgency which I acknowledge freely exist, are depressing and irritating. Unfortunately, the acquisition of land, the acceptance of tenders and the various steps that have to be taken in accordance with the law as laid down in the Housing Acts sometimes involves a certain amount of delay, which, in the absence of any change in the law, cannot be shortened.  Short of that, short of the statutory requirements, so far as we in the Local Government Department are concerned, and so far as the local authorities in the County and City of Dublin are concerned, there is a combined and, on the whole, very satisfactory effort to shorten delays as much as possible, and consequently there are consultations on the spot between the officers of the local authorities and the officers of the Department with a view to getting immediate results.</P>
    <P>The housing council appointed to act with the housing director, in co-operation with the local authorities&mdash;not in any position of control of the local authorities but in co-operation with them&mdash;in the city and county of Dublin assumed very formidable responsibility and a very heavy and depressing task.  I think they have applied themselves to that work very diligently and with considerable success.  The progress which has been made has been made in face of enormous difficulties. It has been made at a time when housing costs have not only increased, as Deputy Brennan said, but in many cases have quadrupled themselves since the pre-war period.  They have attempted to supplement to a very considerable extent the very attenuated skilled labour force.  No opportunity has been missed by me or by representatives of the local authorities, either in this House or outside it, to invite the skilled workers who are still outside <Col N="1120" /> this country and engaged on the building of houses in Great Britain to come back here and help us with this housing drive.  We know how valuable their services are and we shall be very glad to have them here.  Over and over again, it has been made clear beyond question that guaranteed employment not alone for a considerable period but for many years to come is certain to them.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that other steps might be taken to help in that direction.  Suggestions have been made that a certain number of the houses to be erected might be reserved for skilled workers, if they could be attracted to come back and live in this country and take their part in the work.  That suggestion, with others, is under consideration at the moment, and I want to avail of this opportunity to make again the strongest plea that I can for the addition of every skilled worker who can be obtained to the rather thin labour force we still have in this city and county.  Any changes we may make administratively or any additions we may make to advisory authorities to help us in this work will, all the time, so far as results are concerned be governed by the size of our labour force, because in the end that is the main difficulty we have to meet, in addition to difficulties of costs.</P>
    <P>We have been giving the question of costs very continuous consideration. We have decided to explore the possibility of getting the combined purchasing section of the Department to take a hand in this matter of the examination of costs, and, if necessary, to help to provide an organisation with a view to mitigating and reducing costs generally as much as possible.  I want to assure the Deputy that we would be very pleased if Mr. Fitzpatrick to whom one of his questions related last week would put forward any proposals he has in mind as to how we could utilise his services or any plans he has in mind for the purposes of this drive of ours.  I understand that the house which Mr. Fitzpatrick erected was inspected and that proposals by him to the local authority are awaited and we should be glad, if he has any proposals to put forward to the local <Col N="1121" /> authority as to how he could help us, to have these proposals examined and considered as rapidly as possible.  Any suggestions of that kind that we get are very acceptable and are utilised so far as possible.</P>
    <P>With regard to the proposed provision of prefabricated houses, 50 tenders are under consideration at the moment.  I should say that, so far as my relations with the trade unions are concerned, some officials of the trade unions who are members of the housing council and some of whom I have met otherwise expressed their willingness to help in every way possible.  They have taken a very big part in helping us to supplement the skilled labour force by diverting as many of their members as possible to local authority <Col N="1122" /> housing and advertising in the Press instructions to their members to apply themselves to the work of local authority housing as much as possible.  On the whole, the position, while far from satisfactory in Dublin or anywhere else, shows signs of very rapid improvement, and I have confidence in both the local authorities in the City of Dublin and the Borough of Dun Laoghaire continuing to help in the good work.  May I assure Deputy Brennan that any further suggestions he has to make in connection with this matter will be received by me in a very sympathetic spirit, realising as I do his sincere and zealous approach to this problem?</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Thursday 10th March, 1949.</P>
