      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether, before the Estimates for the coming financial year are completed, he will communicate with organisations which use the word &ldquo;Royal&rdquo; in their names or descriptions, and particularly with those which are in receipt of grants from the Exchequer as set out in the Book of Estimates for the present financial year, with a view to securing their consent to eliminating the word &ldquo;Royal&rdquo; from their names or their descriptions.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The survival from the past of such relics of former conditions as the word &ldquo;Royal&rdquo; in the names of certain organisations, while anomalous, is not, in present circumstances, of any&mdash;other than historical &mdash;significance.  The organisations concerned may take, of their own volition, such steps as may be open to them to change their names, but I do not propose to put any pressure on them to do so or to communicate with them in the sense suggested by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach not aware that there is a certain amount of resentment in the country that organisations drawing money from the public purse should continue with this description?  Is he not aware that he himself is in a particularly strong position to request them to drop this word &ldquo;Royal&rdquo; from their description; that it cannot be held that there is anything political in that; that there is no Party in this country at the moment which stands for having a <Col N="2034" /> King in the Park; and that even the <i>Irish Times</i> itself has dropped the court circular and the royal coat of arms from its court and personal column, and that, after all, it can be argued that what is good enough for the Taoiseach is good enough for these organisations?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the retention of this objectionable anachronism is motivated in many instances by a desire on the part of those responsible to parade their hostility to the aspirations of the majority of the people?  Will the Taoiseach not make it plain to these people that they will not be permitted to &ldquo;cock a snook&rdquo; at the people while at the same time expecting to be subsidised by them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The view I take of this word &ldquo;Royal&rdquo; is that it marks merely the historic evolution of our own country and that the fact of its being there emphasises and underlines the progress which has been made.  If Deputies will look around any countries in the world they will see statues and monuments of past history left there as an indication of the historic progress which has been made in these countries.  It is in that sense that I regard the use of this word &ldquo;Royal&rdquo; by these people.  It is a matter of no consequence so far as I am concerned; it is of no importance and not worth wasting time over.  I am not aware of any of the organisations referred to by Deputy Lehane which are trying to parade that word.  In many instances the word &ldquo;Royal&rdquo; derives from a patent and is implicit in the patent and might be difficult to change.  My attitude towards it is that it is merely an historic underlining and emphasising of the progress which has been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The people of the country would agree so far as statues are concerned that they merely mark the milestones in the road of Irish history, but is he not aware that at least one of these organisations has not the word &ldquo;Royal&rdquo; in its patent; that it assumed that particular word and grafted it on without any legal basis; and that it is so much opposed to republicianism or independence here <Col N="2035" /> that it refused even to take a grant of land on the condition that it would reassume its proper legal title?</P>

    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Arrest of County Down Vessel.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether he is aware that a fishing vessel owned by a resident of Kilkeel, County Down, was arrested by the L.E. <i>Cliona</i> and that proceedings were instituted against the owner in the Dublin District Court on the 1st instant, and that this action has caused grave public uneasiness, and whether in view of the serious implications of the arrest and prosecution the Government will quash the sentence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that a fishing vessel registered in the Six Counties was arrested, as stated by the Deputy, and that the master of the vessel was fined in the District Court for unlawfully entering our exclusive fishery limits.</P>
      <P>The proceedings were taken in accordance with the provisions of the Sea Fisheries Protection Act, 1933, as adapted by the Constitution (Consequential Provisions) Act, 1937, which, in effect, make it unlawful for any sea-fishing boat not registered in our register under our Merchant Shipping Acts to enter (except for certain lawful purposes) or to fish within our exclusive fishery limits.  I am not aware that the enforcement of the law for the protection of Irish fishermen whose sea-fishing boats are registered in our register has caused grave public uneasiness any more than the enforcement of the law against our fellow-countrymen in the six north-eastern counties in reference to customs matters on the land border causes any such uneasiness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is well known that the interests of <Col N="2036" /> our fishermen have been seriously affected by British sea-fishing boats unlawfully entering and fishing within our exclusive fishery limits, and, if exceptions in favour of Six-County residents were made, it would be a simple matter for such British fishing boats to register at one of the ports within the six north-eastern counties and so claim immunity.  If owners of sea-fishing boats resident in the six north-eastern counties wish to fish in our exclusive fishery limits they can do so very simply by registering their boats in our register.</P>
    <P>All these matters merely emphasise the unhappy results of the unnatural partition of our country.</P>
    <P>No petition for a remission of the penalty imposed has been received. In fact the fine was promptly paid.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that our exclusive fishery limits embrace the four seas of Ireland; that under the Treaty of 1921 all Ireland became the Free State and that only six northern counties opted out of that State; and that, consequently, the seas round Antrim, Down and Derry are part of our exclusive fishery limits?  Does the Taoiseach say then that our exclusive fishery limits are the territorial waters of the Republic of Ireland rather than the territorial waters of Ireland as a whole?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Taoiseach if he is aware that north of Ireland fishing boats operating off the coast of the Twenty-Six Counties do so under the Union Jack and that one month ago two north County Dublin boats, the <i>Girl Nancy</i> and <i>Maid of Fingal,</i> were prevented from fishing at Annalong in the County Down?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will answer Deputy Dunne's supplementary first.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is easier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the other is quite easy, but it may be a little longer.  I have been informed of the matter referred to by Deputy Dunne. Of course, in international law, the position of a northern vessel registered in Kilkeel or the Six Counties is a <Col N="2037" /> British vessel presumably flying the British flag.</P>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Cowan's question, I am fully aware of the point that he raised because I take the credit for having been the first to discover it when I was Attorney-General, and of giving an opinion to that effect. That is the position at the moment. But with the Deputy, I think, his other point is a different one.  His other point would lead us to go after British vessels off the coast of Antrim, collect them and bring them in here and prosecute or fine them in our courts.  I do not know whether the Deputy wishes to do that or not, but it is the obverse side of the case that he put here in his question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to assure the Taoiseach that the object of the supplementary question was to make clear that that was the constitutional position as far as the territorial waters are concerned.  Once that position is clearly understood, that we are not limiting our rights to territorial waters of the Republic of Ireland, I must say that I am perfectly satisfied with the Taoiseach's declaration which, naturally, would give us the right to proceed against vessels not registered here that may be fishing in Belfast Lough.  Arising further out of the question, may I ask the Taoiseach if the Government would consider permitting Six-County vessels to register here on terms different from those on which vessels owned in this part of the country may be registered?  In other words, would it be possible to permit them to be registered here free of any charge?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not at all sure that there is any charge except a nominal one for registering any boat here under our Merchant Shipping Act. I cannot say from recollection, but the amount of the charge is of no importance. As regards the other point raised by the Deputy in the first part of his statement, I made the international position clear, I think it was when I was speaking in the Seanad on the Republic of Ireland Bill, that we did claim the entire of Ireland and all its territorial seas other than what <Col N="2038" /> is excepted out by the Government of Ireland Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>That declaration certainly satisfies me.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it from what the Taoiseach has said that the action against this particular boat was taken in order to protect the interests of our inshore fishermen?  Would he define his attitude on a case which is causing great hardship to fishermen at the present time where we have boats registered in Dublin but manned entirely by Scottish crews which are doing a lot of damage to our inshore fishermen?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare whether he is aware that Mr. James Reilly, of 99 O'Neill Park, Clones, receives an old age pension of only 7/6 weekly, due to the fact that he is in receipt of 15/- weekly from the British Government for the loss of a son killed in the late war; and, if so, whether, in the circumstances, he will exclude the pension <Col N="2041" /> from the British Government in calculating Mr. Reilly's means and so enable him to qualify for the full old age pension.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether the Deputy is quite familiar with all the circumstances of this case.  If he is not, I would like to put him in possession of the facts.  In 1939 Mr. Reilly was awarded an old age pension at the rate of 10/- a week.  In 1946 it was discovered that he was in receipt of a pension from the British Army authorities of 15/- a week, whereupon, in 1946, his old age pension was reduced from 10/- to 1/-.</P>

      <P>Last year, 1948, under the Social Welfare Act, that pension which was reduced in 1946 from 10/- to 1/- was increased to 7/6.  Mr. Reilly may, therefore, thank this Government for having passed that Act.</P>

      <P>Since 1934, growers have had an assured market for homegrown tobacco, and, with due regard to quality, have obtained a remunerative price for each year's crop. Despite this, the number of growers has declined steadily from 1,500 to 12, and the area under the crop from 1,050 acres to 17 acres.  Reasonable incentives for development have been provided, but it is evident that farmers are more attracted by other forms of agricultural production.</P>

The Mayo County Council share of the grants for road works in the current year has already been applied to specific works, some of which are on the roads referred to by the Deputy.  It is not possible at this stage to make further grants available for road works in the current financial year.  The question of selecting works to be undertaken with the moneys available in any year is a matter for the county council in the first instance and it is open to the Deputy to make representations to that body to include particular works in next year's programme.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether he is aware that a vacancy for a midwife in County Roscommon was not advertised in the local Press as is customary, and that, as a result, two potential candidates did not get an opportunity of applying and whether, in view of this, and of the fact that only one application was received for the position, the position will now be declared vacant and readvertised in the local Press.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. Browne)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the vacancy referred to by the Deputy is that for a midwife in the Aughrim dispensary district. For an appointment of this nature, Article 26 of the Local Government (Officers) Regulations, 1943, provides that an advertisement shall be published in at least one newspaper circulating in the functional area of the local authority stating that the appointment is to be made, inviting applications from persons desirous of being appointed, stating how such persons can obtain full particulars and specifying a date not less than ten days after such publication before which such application must be received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been informed that advertisements for this post appeared in the <i>Irish Independent</i> and the <i>Irish Press</i><Col N="2056" /> on the 29th July, 1949, setting out the particulars required under the article to which I have referred and since the terms of the article have been complied with, I have no power to declare the position vacant and require the vacancy to be readvertised in the local Press.</P>
    <P>I consider it desirable that vacancies of this kind should be advertised in the local Press.  I have been informed, however, by the local authority that as the Aughrim dispensary district is situated on the border between the Counties Leitrim and Roscommon and as the previous appointee acted under the control of both local authorities it was considered more feasible to advertise the vacancy in the daily Press.  It was felt that one or other of the two papers in which the advertisement appeared would reach practically every home in the area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beirne</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister is not so foolish as to believe a report stating that the advertisement did not appear in the local paper for the simple reason that the local paper had not a circulation in the area concerned. The local paper had an adequate circulation in the area concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister if he has considered the point put to him last night&mdash;to give the House information as to the type of board visualised by him; whether it is to be a whole-time board; whether it is to be a board of persons who will be concerned with general policy or whether it is to be a board of experts who will have considerable experience in the ordinary technical management of a transport company?</P>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister, also, if he has made up his mind on the matters that were dealt with here yesterday evening in regard to the position of the general manager?  As the Minister knows, from all parts of the House the general opinion was that it would not be desirable that the general manager of the company should be a member of the board.  The point was made that if the general manager is a member of the bcard it may affect the working of the company seriously because the board may have to consider the general manager's own administration, and it was felt that the board, to some extent, would have their hands tied when discussing the administration of the general manager while the general manager himself was a member of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Further, if the board does its work well, as it should be done, naturally they must, from time to time, call in senior experts or officials of the company. These officials or experts may have a viewpoint completely at variance with the viewpoint of the general manager.  The position may be that the viewpoint of a particular expert may be accepted by the board and, in those circumstances, the general manager might feel that had it not been for the representations or the evidence or the information given by the particular expert and member of the company, the board might not have taken or adopted a view contrary to his own particular view.  In these circumstances, bad feeling could conceivably arise between the general manager and that particular official or expert.  That has been known to happen in many concerns.  The general manager, being an ordinary human being with ordinary human reactions, <Col N="2062" /> may feel that that particular expert or official should be subjected to supervision that was undesirable and that might, in the long run, lead to his resignation.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister at this stage to indicate whether he has considered the matter since last night and whether he can now give the House his views on the matters that have been raised on this particular amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that the discussion we had last night on this particular matter of the composition of the board will have served a useful purpose.  In the course of the discussion many of the members&mdash;even while standing on their feet&mdash;I think, were in the process of clarifying their own minds.  The appeal made by Deputy Cowan to the Minister should be responded to at this moment if the Minister, since last night, has had an opportunity of determining his attitude to the various points put forward.</P>
      <P>The board, as such, is, if you like, the keystone of the arch which we are trying to erect and the main part of the operating machinery.  While, from all sides of the House, there will be a desire to try and leave this Bill in its final stages in such a manner as will be most effective and helpful to the national transport industry, it is important that, in doing that, we put the right emphasis on the right spot.  It occurred to me, listening to the discussion last night, that we have at first two principal questions to decide and on which we would, I think, like guidance from the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first is whether the board is going to be what we would call a lay board&mdash;a board composed of men and women selected for their general capacity, general knowledge and general competency, and who are of sufficient stature to carry the responsibility that will devolve upon them as members of the board.  Alternatively, are we going to have a board composed of technical experts, largely if you like, holding membership of the board because of the technical or executive position which they hold in the company?  Having got that particular <Col N="2063" /> matter clear, then the question in regard to the general manager would be one of lesser importance&mdash;at least to my mind&mdash;from the point of view of the value of the board in relation to the Act as a whole.</P>
    <P>In so far as we have a general guidance on that principal question, the other matter, I think, that the Minister might give us some guidance on and which would further help to clarify our minds with regard to the position of the general manager, is whether the board is going to be a lay board which will be a board composed only of part-time members or only of whole-time members or whether we will have, as we see now in regard to some analogous boards in Great Britain, a board composed of some part-time and some whole-time members.</P>
    <P>I think one point that was stressed here was that if we have a board of part-time members there is quite clearly the difficulty that if on that board are sitting executive members of the company&mdash;either the general manager or other officers&mdash;it must almost of necessity, by virtue of their weight on the board, bring about a position where the part-time members will find themselves largely dependent upon, and frequently influenced by, the opinions of the technical experts.  Quite clearly, a board of part-time members cannot for obvious reasons acquire the same grasp of the general functions of the national transport industry, particularly from such details as would be available to part-time members.  They will have other outside commitments. Many of us are aware that where there are part-time members of boards of this character, it often becomes a matter of formal discussion at meetings without any adequate information or any proper perusal of reports which may be available.  The part-time members show a readiness to accept the advice given them by the technical experts. That would be more particularly the case if one of the executive officers of the company were actually sitting as a member of the board.  Many of the difficulties that have presented themselves to Deputies could be clarified if <Col N="2064" /> the Minister were able to assist us on the general principles raised on both sides of the House with regard to the composition of the board.  The matter is so important that at this stage we cannot immediately reconcile our views.  It is a matter we should not rush because quite clearly unless we do reach agreement as to the type of board best suited to carry out the functions which will have to be discharged under this Act, we shall not be giving the Act a fair opportunity of working successfully and we shall certainly be placing the members of the future board in a position in which they will not have a fair and reasonable opportunity to carry out what is going to be a most difficult and complicated job. If we had some indication as to what way the Minister's mind was working it would help us at this stage of the debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I should remind Deputies again of the wording of this sub-section.  Many of the speeches that have been made in support of the amendment and against the sub-section have been made as if this sub-section were imposing on the company the general manager as a member of the board.  It is entirely permissive, as I said last night.  The initiative in putting the general manager on the board must be taken by the board itself, subject to the consent of the Minister.  I assume that a board of directors, a board of responsible men, would only seek to appoint the general manager for the time being as a member of the board if they were satisfied that it would be to the advantage of the board and the working of the whole system by having him as a member of the board.  As I said last night, there is nothing new in this.  It is a very common thing in relation to both public and private companies.  I think in every country where a board finds itself with a person of outstanding ability and capacity as its general manager, very frequently is he made a member of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the board itself and the type of board you are going to have, it is not just easy at this particular stage to say whether it is to be entirely non-technical, partly technical, <Col N="2065" /> full-time, part-time or both.  One thing I will say: I do not believe that it should be a technical board entirely. Personally, I should prefer to see a board of competent men, men of general knowledge and capacity, men who can bring to bear on the various problems of a national transport concern ordinary commonsense together with a knowledge of business and of commerce, labour conditions, social conditions, etc.  But it may be essential to have on the board some technical men.  For instance, I would consider myself that the general manager of a concern of the size of Córas Iompair Éireann should be a member of the board.  I would further consider that it would be desirable, if a suitable person were available and prepared to accept the position, that a very competent accountant or a person with a very competent knowledge of finance should be a member of the board.</P>
    <P>To the question as to whether it should be a full-time or a part-time board, it is not quite easy to say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  You might be able to get very suitable personnel for a part-time board but it might be very difficult to get the type of person whom you would like to put on a board to act in a full-time capacity on the board.  If it is to be a board of laymen and a full-time board, at the moment anyway I find it difficult to see how you can keep them employed full-time if they have not technical knowledge and experience of the various aspects of both road and rail transport.  So far as I am concerned&mdash; if Deputies want to make any capital out of this they can&mdash;I have not, nor has the Government, definitely decided yet as to the exact type of personnel we are going to have on the board. So far as I am concerned I would be influenced to some extent, perhaps to a large extent, by the views expressed here from all sides of the House.  I should like Deputies to appreciate that it is not just easy to say at this stage that you are going to have a board which is composed entirely of laymen or a board composed of laymen with some technical men.  It is very difficult to say at the moment whether it <Col N="2066" /> should be an entirely full-time board or whether some members should be full-time and others part-time.  What I am now saying may not be very helpful to Deputies, but in any case I am speaking of the position as I see it at the moment.</P>
    <P>Coming back to the question of the general manager, I would say, whether this is to be a board of laymen or a board which is partly composed of laymen and partly of technical men, I think it should be within the power of the board, subject to the consent of the Minister, to appoint the general manager a director of the board.  I would remind Deputies that this board is going to have a very difficult task.  Deputies need hardly be reminded of what has been stated over and over again in the debate&mdash;it has been mentioned by Deputy Lemass and it is quite true&mdash;that the railway end of the problem is the big end of the problem, and it may be necessary, if we can, to get a person who would have railway experience. I doubt very much whether we can or not.  There is no doubt that there is a need for a person either on the executive staff or on the board with a competent, practical and experienced knowledge of railway matters.  I have no desire to appear to be unduly obstinate about this matter, but I think Deputies ought to realise that all I am asking in the sub-section to which this amendment is down is that it should be made possible for the board, if they so desire, or if, in their wisdom they think it will be an advantage and a help, to have on the board the person who for the time being may be general manager of the company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am as anxious as any Deputy on this side of the House that the scheme enshrined in this Bill should be a success and I am certain that the success or failure of the transport policy of the present Government will expose itself before the end of the period of office of the members of the board provided for in Section 6.  Everything the Minister has said, in my opinion, makes a good case for the setting up or creation of a permanent <Col N="2067" /> board or a board of full-time members with experience and knowledge and the desire to clean up the mess which we now find ourselves in so far as the transport industry is concerned.  I am not fully convinced, however, by the remarks of the Minister that he has made a good case for this permissive authority to be given to the members of the new board, subject of course to his own sanction.</P>
      <P>I hope I am correct in assuming that the present chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann will be the chairman under the framework of the Bill.  Whether it is the present chairman or some other person is appointed to the position, he will be the senior member of the board, the co-ordinating officer, the person whose responsibility it will be to see that the members of the board, the executive officers, and all those employed by the company will play their part in making the scheme a success.  Supposing we had a general manager with a strong, dominating personality and a good background, is it not possible for such a general manager, if and when he becomes a member of the board, to be in a position at board meetings to persuade the majority of his colleagues to take a view different from that of the chairman? If such a position arose, it would not be a very comfortable position for the person who would be occupying the position of chairman and directly responsible to the Government for the success or failure of the whole scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have listened very attentively in discussions of this kind to Deputies who talk about the necessity for getting the service of technicians or experts.  Do not compare the working of a transport industry, however, with the working of a clothing manufacturing concern.  While it is essential to have tailors, cutters, etc., in such a concern, and they are technical people, apparently it is the practice in that particular trade to get as directors not people who have had technical experience of the business, but people who will represent the moneyed interest and who will see that the wages of the tailors and cutters, etc., will not be the first charge on the successful working <Col N="2068" /> of the industry, but that the maximum rate of interest to the people who put their money into the concern will be the first charge by way of dividends.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that it would be necessary, and I agree it will be necessary in a big concern of this kind or any other public service corporation, to have a man with the qualifications of an accountant.  Without any disrespect to the best accountants in the country, I suggest that the Government could select one of the ablest accountants but that, if he had no previous knowledge and experience of the working of the transport industry, not alone would he not know what he was talking about at the first board meeting, but if you sent him to a station office to audit the accounts he would not be able to give a truthful certificate as to whether they were correct or not because, without experience and knowledge of rates and charges, he would not know whether the goods had been properly charged up or invoiced correctly.  I am only quoting that as one instance.</P>
    <P>The general manager idea is running all through this permissive section in the Bill.  In the old days, the general managers were born for their job.  They belonged to a certain select social circle. Those responsible for putting them in gave them the opportunity to start in the service on the lowest rung of the ladder and they worked up from the bottom to the top.  That is, I understand, what was done by Sir James Milne, who is the author of this very informative report.  I do not claim to be an expert in transport or railway working, although I have had 40 years' experience of railways.  I regard this as the most informative report I have ever read in my career as a railway man and I would say that it is better understood by those who have worked in the railway transport industry than any report of any previous commission set up by this House or by the British Government when they were in control in this country.  The other reports were framed by outsiders.  This report, and all the information contained in it&mdash; and nobody, apparently, appreciates the value of it more than Deputy Lemass&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I was saying that the general managers in those days were born for their jobs.  Notwithstanding that, they had to work up from the bottom to the top.  If we are lucky enough to find a general manager who has been trained in that school, who has had that experience, and who has a strong personality and a good background, I invite the Minister to contemplate the position which might arise if on the board he is able, by his powerful personality, to carry his point of view and the majority of his colleagues with him against the viewpoint of the Minister.</P>
      <P>That is the only point I am putting to the Minister in connection with this. I do not like the idea, but I appreciate what the Minister said&mdash;that he is anxious to get the viewpoint of the majority of Deputies before he takes a final decision on the whole matter, or even before he takes a final decision as to whether the board shall consist of persons who would be full-time or part-time or whether they should be technicians or otherwise.  Every Deputy is anxious to share the responsibility for cleaning up the mess which exists. I am saying that regardless of who is responsible for the present position.  It would pay this House to take much more time over this, as we passed an Estimate only a few days ago for the provision of a sum of £4,091,000 for Córas Iompair Éireann.  What does the salary of the chairman or the members of the board or the general manager count for when compared with the necessity for the Government as a body to think carefully over the persons they are going to select to do this work, to give the individuals, whoever they may be, a fair chance and opportunity of carrying out the Government policy on behalf of the people within their first period of office?</P>

      <P>I do not think the Minister can have appreciated the difficulty caused for the Dáil by the statement he has just made.  It is true that he asked us to express our views upon the character of the board to be set up under Section 6.  We have been <Col N="2070" /> discussing that now for some time, but it is difficult to do so in view of the uncertainty which exists in the minds of the Government as to the type of board they want.</P>
      <P>This is an important section of the Bill.  The proposal which was brought to the Dáil in the Bill was that the undertakings of Córas Iompair Éireann and the Grand Canal Company should be acquired from their present owners and entrusted to a board to be established in accordance with the provisions of this section.  One would have expected that the Government would have decided, in advance, the type of board best suited, in their view, to carry on these undertakings. One can make certain assumptions from the provisions of the Bill&mdash;the assumption that there will be a whole-time chairman and from various reports that have been circulating, of people who have been invited to act on the board, that a whole-time board was contemplated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps so.  It is irrelevant.  It seems to me that we can have three kinds of board.  We can have a board similar to the Electricity Supply Board composed in part of people who are also holding executive positions in the board's organisation. When the Minister talks about technical people on the board, I take it that is what he has in mind, that the board might consist, in whole or in <Col N="2071" /> part, of executive officers of the organisation: the general manager, the accountant, the traffic manager, the works manager and so forth.  That type of organisation exists here.  The Electricity Supply Board is a fair example, and it is quite common in other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only trying to get the position clarified.  My view is that if we are going to have that kind of board it is clear that Deputy O'Sullivan's amendment cannot be persisted in, because if the board is to consist in whole or in part of executive officers of the undertaking, one of the members of it must be the general manager.  If you were to have that kind of board, executive officers nominated by the Minister, it would be impossible if, instead of taking the works manager you took a shop superintendent and put him on the board over the works manager.  It would be an impossible position if, instead of taking the accountant you took a clerk in the accountant's office and put him on the board.  If we are going to have a board, in whole or in part, of executive officers, I think the Dáil should insist on naming the executive officers that the Minister could nominate on the board.  If, on the other hand, the board is to consist of persons appointed to exercise a general supervisory function in relation to the organisation and which will not include executive officers, then it seems to me there is point in Deputy O'Sullivan's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that some of the arguments advanced by Deputy Davin and by Deputy Cowan were valid.  I think that if the board is to consist, in the main, of persons who are not themselves executive officers then the position of the general manager would be weakened by appointment to the board in so far as the general manager has the duty of carrying out the policy decided on by the board and implementing <Col N="2072" /> its decisions.  I think he will be in a much stronger position in dealing with the organisation and with people having business with it if he faces them as an executive officer of an authority of which he is not himself a member.  I think that most people who have experience in business administration will realise the strength of that argument.</P>
    <P>The third kind of board is that for which there is the analogy of the Irish Sugar Company and some other State organisations created in closer conformity to the normal business practice, a board that consists of directors remunerated by fee whose responsibility is very largely confined to attending board meetings, and expressing their views at board meetings on proposals brought to the board by the managing director or chairman or executive officers.  I do not favour the type of board which would include executive officers.  I admit that my experience is not very extensive, but, such as it is, it has, I will admit prejudiced me against that type of board. I think, for the reasons I gave here last night, a board consisting of executive officers will become a prey to the type of internal politics that always grows up in large organisations and will suffer in its efficiency on that account.</P>
    <P>I think that the organisation which we are setting up now, one which is to be responsible for the maintenance of different kinds of transport facilities over the greater part of the country, would need a board of whole-time directors without executive responsibility. At least, it should have available to it directors who are free to devote a very large part of their time to the supervision and inspection of the organisation.  If that is so, and if the Minister agrees with that type of board, and if the Government ultimately decide in favour of that type of board, then I think we should put into this Bill some provision which will ensure that that is the kind of board we will get.  There seems to be, so far as I can follow the speeches that have been made, a substantial amount of agreement in favour of a board excluding executive officers.  If that is so, then I think the Dáil should take steps <Col N="2073" /> to make sure that it will get that kind of board by putting into the Bill some such amendment as I have suggested.</P>
    <P>As the Bill stands the organisation could start off with a non-executive board that did not include executive officers, but persons brought in because of their general competence, and given functions of a general supervisory character.  At a later stage it could be transferred into the other type of board under Section 6.  The Minister is not limited in any way.  He can either pick people of general experience, knowledge and competence and put them on the board and give them supervisory functions, or he can drop them and go into the board's organisation and pick out people who hold, and will continue to hold after their appointment to the board, executive positions there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I know the only board analogous to this one which has been created so far is the Electricity Supply Board.  It is a board which consists, with the exception of one, of a number of persons who are remunerated on a whole-time basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know.  It is true, probably, as far as statutory organisations like the turf board and the tourist board are concerned, but the other State organisations, the sugar company, the steel company, and so forth, were, I think, established under the authority of law, in conformity with the provisions of the Companies Acts.  They were, in fact, directed by boards of part-time directors with, perhaps, a whole-time chairman or managing director.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This organisation we are dealing with is, in many respects, far more important than any of these, excluding the Electricity Supply Board, because of the widespread ramifications of its work and its possible effects upon the whole national <Col N="2074" /> economy.  We should, I think, have a clear idea as to the type of board that is going to direct it.  I can see arguments in favour of the three kinds of board I have mentioned.  I have expressed a personal preference for one of them, but it is not a very strong preference.  If the Minister expects the Dáil to help him to improve the Bill and to put forward suggestions which will make it work more efficiently, he must tell us his own views as to which type of board it is intended will follow the enactment of the Bill.  If we get that information we can consider whether any variation or amendment of the Bill is necessary. Without that information the Dáil will be working very largely in the dark.</P>
    <P>I have to decide, assuming Deputy O'Sullivan's amendment is put to the Dáil, whether I am in favour of it or against it.  I would be against it if there is any intention to put on the board other executive officers.  If there are other executive officers there, the general manager must be there.  If the board is not going to include any other executive officers, the weight of the argument is in favour of Deputy O'Sullivan's amendment and the deletion of the sub-section, which mentions the probability of the appointment of a general manager to the board.</P>
    <P>The only issue I ever came up against in connection with transport administration which has a bearing on this question was the desirability of having a general manager at all. Deputy Davin will remember when the Great Southern Railways Company had no general manager, when the whole board used to meet to discuss whether a stationmaster would be transferred or a porter promoted to the stationmaster grade.  The whole work of the organisation went into slow motion on that account and there was a very strong demand expressed in the Dáil &mdash;possibly by Deputy Davin&mdash;in 1932 or 1933 that the Great Southern Railways board should be compelled by legislation to appoint a general manager, and when it did the organisation benefited by their action.</P>
    <P>There should be an executive head of the organisation, someone who can <Col N="2075" /> bring the problems of the organisation to the board.  He does not have to be a member of the board if the board does not consist of other persons with executive functions.  I think the work which this board will have to do for a large number of years will be of such a character that it will be almost impossible to get it done by members who are not free to give the most of their time to it.</P>
    <P>I have considered whether, in the new circumstances, it will be practicable to carry on this organisation under a board of part-time, fee-remunerated directors, and I think it would not.  Therefore, I have indicated my preference and on the basis of that preference I would have to support Deputy O'Sullivan's amendment.  If, however, the board is going to be of a different character, I may have to take a different view in regard to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister has very fairly said to the House that he would like to have the assistance of the House in making up his mind as to what type of board there should be, and he told us very frankly that he has not made up his mind whether it will be a whole or a part-time board, a technical or a non-technical board. I think that is being very frank with the House and, as the Minister has asked for an expression of opinion, I would like to say that my own view is that the board ought to be a whole-time board.  I did express on the Second Reading the view that probably the best type of board for the successful running of the company would be perhaps a board of experts who had grown up in the service of the company and gained experience.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>The type of board I can visualise is a board of experts or, if you like, executive members who have an executive capacity and executive knowledge.  So far as that particular type of board is concerned, I do not think it would be a success unless there was as chairman of it a member of this House, either a Minister or a Parliamentary Secretary.  It would have to be completely a State run organisation.  We have a somewhat similar board in the Army&mdash;the Council of Defence.  The Council of Defence has as chairman the Minister for Defence and it is composed of officers holding certain positions who may be, and in fact are, removed every three years and the board is changed in that way.  That board runs very satisfactorily.</P>
      <P>I can visualise that type of board where particular executive officers would be members under the chairmanship of a Minister or a Parliamentary Secretary.  I can see we have not reached that stage where we could get agreement on that particular type of board, and that being so, I think the general viewpoint and the one that I would support is that that board should be whole-time and should be composed of people of experience, particularly experience in the running and administration of a transport company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it should be limited to that.  It should include that type of member and there should also be on it competent people with business experience and also competent people who would have their ears to the ground so far as the country is concerned.  In other words, they would not be so far removed from the ordinary running of the country. They should know how the costs of transport affect the community and where services should be made available <Col N="2077" /> for both passengers and goods. That seems to be the general type of board visualised.  My view is that it should be whole-time and the members should be paid well enough to enable them to devote their whole attention to their work.  I think in those circumstances no officer who holds an executive position in the company should be a member of the board.  I think Deputy Lemass, Deputy Davin and I are agreed on that point.  It may be that when the Government and the Minister come to consider the establishment of this board they may go into their own rail services, or even into the canal service, and find there a competent official whom they would appoint to the board. If such an official is appointed he should cease to be an executive officer of the company and should become a full-time member of the board.  I support what has been said on both sides that it should not even be permissive for the board to appoint its general manager a member because difficulties and complications may arise. Those difficulties have already been adverted to.  This House has a serious responsibility in regard to the financing of the board and it must not place itself in the position of appointing a board in which controversies may arise between the general manager and the chairman, between the general manager and other members of the board, or between the general manager, as a member of the board, and the executive officers of the company whose duty it will be to implement the orders of the board as given to them by the general manager.  For that reason I ask the Minister to give careful consideration to the viewpoints that have been expressed and to the general opinion held that this particular sub-section should be deleted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like to intervene in a discussion among experts, but I find myself becoming more and more confused as the debate goes on.  I missed the Minister's statement, but I take it that he admitted he had not definitely made up his mind yet as to the type of board that should be established and he asked for the advice of the House on that particular matter.  Considering the size of the <Col N="2078" /> Bill, the position is a rather peculiar one.  No doubt it is very flattering to the House that the Minister should seek its opinion, but I think the House should have a stronger lead than just leaving such a matter to this very wide interpretation.</P>
      <P>There are one or two points upon which the Minister may be able to clear my mind.  Deputy Lemass spoke about the three types of board he could visualise.  He referred to a board of technical experts and, at that point, the Minister interrupted and said that it should be obvious from the sub-section, which Deputy Martin O'Sullivan proposes to delete, that he did not visualise a board of technical experts.  Deputy Lemass referred to the fact that if we did not want a board of technical experts some clause should be incorporated in the Act rendering it impossible to appoint that particular type of board; he instanced the case of the Electricity Supply Board and pointed out that it was staffed with technical experts.  The Minister pointed out that the Electricity Supply Board had not been subjected to any such restrictions under the Act.  But look at what happened.  The board, as far as I can see, is a board of technical experts.</P>

Then he says it is unnecessary to take Deputy Lemass's amendment No. 8 because such a clause is not in the Act which set up the Electricity Supply Board.  As far as I can see, the Electricity Supply Board is a board of experts.</P>

With regard to the permissive action the board may take in relation to putting the general manager on the board, it is not clear to me what precise benefit would accrue to the board, to the company or to the country in general by making the general manager a member of the board.  I have practically no knowledge of public transport, but I cannot conceive of anything the general manager could do as a member of the board that he could not do as general manager from the point of view of the efficient running of the transport organisation.  So far I have not heard any explanation on that point.  The Minister said certain things might be of benefit, but that is just a bit too general.  The Minister should give us some more precise information as to what extra help he thinks the general manager would be to the board if he was a member of the board.</P>

      <P>I want to press the Minister, too, along the same lines as those adopted by Deputy Sheldon just now.  I asked the Minister a question last night.  I can myself conceive no satisfactory answer to it.  Is there anything further the board could get from the general manager by making him a member of the board?  I do not think there is.  On the contrary, I think it would result in making the board less effective.  If this board is responsible in the main for policy and its implementation, plus the general supervision of the company, then I can visualise a position in which, on the level of the general manager himself, the board may have to take action.  I think it would be far from being in the best interests of the board that the general manager, so criticised, would be a member of the board itself and might be in a position to vote on certain actions to be taken by himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not approaching this matter in any contentious spirit.  I am open to conviction.  I want to be convinced, if such conviction can be pressed home, that there is something extraordinary about making this general manager a member of the board.  I say without fear of contradiction that it might be a good thing if this extraordinary general manager did exist to make him a member of the board, but that he must cease to be an executive officer of the company if the board is to carry out its functions in the most untrammelled way we can conceive. There is the natural consequence that a man carrying the responsibility of being chief executive officer of a company of this magnitude if he is to be efficient will be a man of strong personality and a man of no mean ability. His membership of the board might virtually make him too strong to be on the board.  In the set-up of directing general policy you might have permeating through the general manager's own mind what might be the executive mind of the company rather than the <Col N="2081" /> broad approach of people who were not concerned with the executive control of the company or with the direct administration of the company.</P>
    <P>As I said at the beginning, I can see hundreds of reasons why the general manager should not be a member of the board.  However, I am still not convinced, and the Minister has said nothing in this House to convince me, that there is any special benefit to be accrued to the board by making the general manager also a member of the board.  The Minister will have to face the situation that he is either going to have a distinct type of board or not. If he is going to have the type of board that is a board composed of men outside Córas Iompair Éireann or a board of people who if they are in Córas Iompair Éireann are going to cease to be executives and become whole-time members of the board, I urge that, to avoid certain practical difficulties that might arise, it would be better to have that board unfettered in its membership by having anyone who is an executive officer of the company on it as such.  They would then be in a position to deal with the company in general and to use their general manager in every way that they would use a chief executive officer. They would be able to get from him the benefit of the collective information from the heads of the various departments, as sifted by him in relation to any particular point of view, but they would not be subject either in respect of voting or in respect of impetus because of his being a member of the board.  If that board is conceived, the general manager should not in any circumstances be a member of the board.</P>
    <P>With regard to the other type of board, let me say that whether it might consist of people from outside, and also of certain experts within the company itself, even if it were only to be broadened to the extent of having the general manager, this is making for a dual type of board that will damn the concern before it starts.  The Minister will have to stand on either of two legs: (1) the type of board which I would hate to see formed, that useless type of board&mdash;or, at any rate, I could <Col N="2082" /> conceive it being useless&mdash;with various heads of departments and a general manager coming together as a board in a type of departmental conference, more or less.  The Minister should step out and get five or six men of breadth of vision, of human experience, some of them of proven business capacity, some of them of proven knowledge of dealing with the complex and difficult labour problem that will arise within the company itself, and more of them knowing the fundamental principles necessary in a good transport system.  If the board is composed of that type of man, to whom he will give a specific remuneration, the Minister will get from the board a breadth of vision and a formation of policy that will be of very great value indeed.</P>

      <P>Two things can happen. The board might set out to manage the manager.  That could happen quite simply.  Again, if the manager is a strong-minded person, he could influence the board in any possible direction. There are plenty of members of this House who have had some slight experience in that direction, one way or another.  It would depend on the general manager himself as to whether he would function as an ordinary member of that board or whether he would bring his superior knowledge of all the affairs of the company to bear on his colleagues or not.  That is the danger.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2083" /> If the Minister wants an independent board, a board which will act independently and on their own, irrespective of the views of the manager, at all times, it would be much better to have the general manager outside the board rather than that he should be a member of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>This discussion is very unreal.  First of all, a legislative assembly is attempting in this amendment to do something which it cannot really do.  As a Parliament, we can only set up a board and set it up as untrammelled as possible.  Sub-section (2) is permissive.  It does not force the board to appoint the general manager on the board&mdash;it only permits them to do so if they want to do it.  Then there is a further check in that, if the Minister allows it, the general manager will be a member of the board.  He will, first of all, have to pass the hurdle of the board.  Then he will have to pass the hurdle of the Minister.  That is a double check on the suitability of the individual for the seat on the board. After that has been settled, we come upon a whole series of incongruities. We do not know who will be sitting on that board.  Even if we did know, we could not here, in this Assembly, start to discuss the individual character and characteristics of the members of the board of this company or of any other company.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that, as I said earlier, we are trying to do something which is impossible and that, in trying to do so, we are tying up the board in a way in which I do not think we should.  This is the one individual whom the board may appoint, again with the sanction of the Minister.  I take it there is no other person the board can appoint.  I think we should leave it that freedom subject to the sanction of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Various Deputies have spoken about the desirability of having an executive officer there.  I have no personal experience of transport companies but I think that when they are conducting the company's business, they must act in a similar manner to other commercial concerns.  They are not just so different from any commercial concern <Col N="2084" /> that the same fundamentals which apply in commercial practice do not also apply to them.  At least that is the way I look at it.</P>
    <P>There are undoubtedly some differences between transport companies and other companies but there are also points of similarity.  In most other companies there are high executive officers on the board and they are able to bring to the deliberations of the board a very precise knowledge which no other individual could supply.  The fact also that the general manager is made a director enhances and makes his position all the better in dealing with certain types of business.  He wins his spurs, as it were, when he is put on the board.  There may be certain drawbacks in having him a member of the board but that largely depends on the character of the general manager.  There are certain drawbacks on almost everything done in business life.  No business or board knows precisely when they appoint a person to a position whether or not he is going to be 100 per cent. successful.  They appoint the very best person they can and they give that person as many powers as they can.  After that, it depends on the character of the individual. We as a Parliament can only rely on the commonsense and judgment of the future board, whatever its composition may be.  We have got to assume that it will be a board of sensible people.  I think if anything emerges from this discussion it is that the amendment limits the power of the board because it prevents them putting on the board the highest executive officers in the company.  That I consider would be a mistake.</P>
    <P>As regards the composition of the board, the Minister apparently asked for enlightenment from certain people. I believe the best board is a board which is neither exclusively composed of executive officers, experts nor ordinary individuals but a board which is a mixture of all three.  I shall just mention one board set up some years ago, namely, the Port and Docks Board.  I regard that as one of the finest boards with which I am connected.  I think its success&mdash; and everybody will admit it is a <Col N="2085" /> success&mdash;arises from the fact that you have all the various interests well represented on that board.  You have shipping interests, commercial interests, manufacturing interests and representatives of labour and of the corporation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so but, of course, there is a special section of the Act dealing with his powers.  I believe that the success of any board is in direct proportion to the diversity of interests represented on the board. When I say &ldquo;interests&rdquo; I do not mean that it should be a question of &ldquo;pull baker, pull devil&rdquo;, but the various representatives of those interests bring to the deliberations of the board a special knowledge of the problems which face them by virtue of their various occupations and, in addition, they are enabled to bring an enlightened commonsense to bear on every subject that is put before them.  In that way, you have a successful board.  I think it would be very foolish to press this amendment because I think it limits the board's powers, and I should like to see the board left with all the freedom we can give them.  They may not need it very much but I think it is no harm to give it to them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the consideration of the amendment in Deputy Lemass's name, and that in the names of Deputies O'Sullivan and Davin, would have been much more helpful to the Minister if the House first had had a clear idea of the type of board that is in the Minister's own mind.  I think that that is the difficulty many of us have experienced, after listening to the various points made, in arriving at a conclusion.  In default of a clear picture of what is in the Minister's mind, we are compelled to be guided by general principles.  Probably it may be said that we would be guided by general principles in any event but some of us perhaps suffer from that form of mental laziness which makes it easier for us to consider the concrete rather <Col N="2086" /> than the abstract or the general.  I must confess to a great deal of sympathy with both amendment No. 7 and amendment No. 8 but I am in the difficulty, and I am sure there are many Deputies in a similar difficulty in approaching these amendments, that the general structure envisaged, not being that nearest to the heart's desire of many of us, our views on these amendments are coloured by that fact If, for instance, I were satisfied that this House had effective control over the general policy of the company then I would be readier to say, subject to that control: &ldquo;Let the board have that untrammelled freedom in operation for which Deputy Dockrell made a case.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy Dockrell made a plea for a freedom for the board as broad and as untrammelled as possible.  He thought that what Deputies were trying to do in these amendments was impossible.  I cannot subscribe to that view.  I think that in the light of the fact that the control which this House will exercise will be of such a remote nature, the closest scrutiny must be given to every line in this Bill and to every amendment tabled to every section.  Deputy Dockrell carried me with him a good deal of the way on many points, but, if he will forgive me for saying so, I think he was basing his arguments on a false premise.  He spoke of the desirability of having executives with experience free to act on the board.  He instanced the Port and Docks Board as the ideal type of board which he envisaged.  I have no quarrel with that statement.  I think, however, I am in the company of Deputy Davin and Deputy Cowan when I say that their attitude is that if there is a useful executive available for service on the board&mdash;the same would apply to the general manager&mdash; by all means let the board have the benefit of his assistance as a member, but, if so, he must cease to be an executive.  If he is to remain as an executive, the board can still have the benefit of his advice and experience by calling him into consultation.  I do not think, however, that the difficulty which Deputy Dockrell created for himself actually exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2087" /> The Minister asked Deputies for their view of the type of board which should be set up.  I am sure this point has been covered by somebody, but, lest it has not, let me make it briefly. I suggest to the Minister that on that board there should be at least one direct representative of the workers. I suggest to the Minister that if he is to have such a representative he should not necessarily be a trade union official or somebody connected with the administration of union affairs, but that he should be somebody from the rank and file of the ordinary workers. There are amongst the workers in Córas Iompair Éireann at present, and amongst all our organised workers, hundreds and probably thousands of men of ability and intelligence who would be of real assistance to the board in their administration of the undertaking which we envisage.  I do not think there is any need to impress this on the Minister, but I would hope that the Minister would not even for a second be so foolish as to contemplate a board composed exclusively of experts.  In my submission, that would be disastrous.</P>
    <P>This undertaking has to be regarded as an important part of our national economy.  If he confines the administration of that undertaking to experts, even experts in another sphere, and excludes from it men who will be able to take a broad national viewpoint on many matters which would have no immediate connection with transport problems, the Minister will have done something very foolish.  I do not think, however, that there is the slightest danger of the Minister's making that mistake.  I think the board should be a whole-time job.  I do not see how the House or the Minister could hope to have this important transport undertaking satisfactorily operated by part-time directors.  Deputy Lemass made a reference to the Irish Sugar Company. I am not quite clear whether he was recommending to the Minister that type of board.  I take it he was not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance is pursuing a different point from the one I am trying to make. The only reason I mentioned the Irish Sugar Company is that I wanted to assure myself that Deputy Lemass was not recommending that type of board to the Minister.  I merely mentioned it to reinforce my argument that what ever type of board is appointed should be a whole-time board.  I suppose this arises on these two amendments and on the Bill generally.  The nearer the Minister can get to a board subject in major matters of national policy to this House, a board composed of whole-time directors, the nearer he can get to ensuring that the workers will be directly represented on that board&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The purpose which I would seek to achieve is that there would be on that board a mind which would understand, not at second-hand, the outlook and the attitude of those working in the industry. <Col N="2089" /> That may be a plea which it is premature to make.  I may be a little bit before my time in suggesting that to the Minister.  It may fall on deaf ears now.  But, at some time in the future, in this and many other industries, it is a plea which will be hearkened to and I believe, hearkened to with good results for the undertakings concerned and the nation.  I think that, before the Minister allows the discussion on these two amendments to proceed further, he should indicate to the House the type of board that he envisages.</P>

      <P>I support the retention of sub-section (2) in the Bill.  I do not wish to reflect on the shortcomings of the late board of Córas Iompair Éireann.  In my opinion, the board suffered from one very serious defect in that it was more or less lopsided, to the extent that it had in the chairman, Mr. Percy Reynolds, a very able man and one who certainly made his mark so far as road-transportminded people are concerned.  He devoted all his energies to road transport when he occupied that position. There was no balancing influence and no progress from the railway point of of view.  As far as the composition of the new board is concerned, it is essential that there should be on it a man with some knowledge of railway administration.  That is necessary, in my view, if any progress is to be made in the way of bringing the railways back to the position which they should occupy.  The railways are a national asset, and so the members of this House should do everything in their power to help the Minister to carry out suggestions which have been made from time to time.  It should be our duty to see that the railway point of view will be specially considered by whatever board is appointed to run this concern.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree almost entirely with the arguments advanced by Deputy Dockrell on this amendment. I cannot get rid of the feeling that we have been spending a great deal of time in talking about something that really does not matter a whole lot, one way or the other.  I believe that Deputy Dockrell was correct in describing it last night as &ldquo;much ado about nothing&rdquo;.  I do not want to adopt the attitude that some of the points made by Deputy Davin and Deputy Martin O'Sullivan may not have very great force in certain circumstances.  I think that is so.  I agree with the viewpoint expressed by Deputy Dockrell that we are discussing this whole thing on a purely hypothetical basis.  We are seeing fears which may, in fact, never materialise.  Some forceful arguments were put forward by Deputy Davin, Deputy Cowan and by Deputy Martin O'Sullivan.  The one that struck me as being the most forceful was this: if, first of all, this section is passed, secondly, if the board that is appointed decides to take advantage of the section; thirdly, if the Minister gives his consent to do that, then the general manager becomes a member of the board and you get the fourth &ldquo;if&rdquo;. If the general manager is a man of particular stature, if he is very strongminded and is able to overawe the remainder of the board, you get the fifth &ldquo;if&rdquo;, and if the rest of the board are so weak that they are going to give way to him and be completely overawed by him, then in that event there is force in the arguments which Deputy Davin and Deputy Martin O'Sullivan made against the inclusion of this <Col N="2091" /> section.  If you get over all these fences, and all the &ldquo;ifs&rdquo;, then I agree there is force in the argument.</P>
      <P>The simple issue involved is this: is it possible that there ever will be circumstances in which it might be advisable or desirable to have the general manager a member of the board?  If the Deputies answer that question by saying &ldquo;No&rdquo; then I think this section should go out, but if Deputies agree that, some time in the future if not at present, circumstances might be such as to make it desirable to have a particular general manager a member of the board, then surely, our duty is to pass this sub-section in its present form as a permissive sub-section to enable that to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that Deputy Con Lehane may have misunderstood Deputy Dockrell's argument regarding the untrammelled freedom of the board. Deputy Seán Collins urged the Minister to accept this amendment.  He did so on the basis that, if the general manager should ever become a member of the board it was not going to be a free and untrammelled board: that it was going to be influenced by him, and that all the other members &mdash;there might be six of them&mdash;were going to give way to and to defer to the opinion of the general manager. I think that what Deputy Dockrell intended to point out was that, while the argument was put forward on the one hand that the freedom of the board would be interfered with, the trammelling of the board would be by those who wanted to delete this sub-section because, as it stands, and if it is carried, the initiative will lie with the board and not with the Minister. As I say, there are so many &ldquo;ifs&rdquo; in the argument and provided all the fears materialise, then I can see that there is a certain amount of substance and solidity in the arguments. I do not think it is probable that all those circumstances will exist at the same time and I think it does boil down to a simple issue as to whether or not Deputies are of opinion that, at some time in the future, if not in the present, circumstances may arise where it might be desirable to <Col N="2092" /> have the general manager a member of the board.  If there is even a possibility, we should not close the door.</P>

      <P>It may be there is more force in that question than I can see, but I think that in order to answer it fully I would have to go very much off the rails.  I would have to discuss the relative powers of councillors, as distinct from members of the board; the remuneration of councillors, which is nil, and the possible remuneration of members of the board.  There are various questions of that sort, and I do not think there is any parallel in the Dublin Corporation or any other corporation.  Members of this board will not be elected by adult suffrage, and I really cannot see any parallel.</P>
      <P>If there is any possibility that the appointment of a general manager at some time in the future might be desirable and might, in fact, be necessary for the proper operation of the concern, we would be wrong to pass this amendment and to close the door in that way.  If, on the other hand, Deputies were satisfied that under no conceivable set of circumstances could a situation arise where the addition of a general manager as a member of the board would be a matter that might be necessary or desirable, then I think the amendment proposed by Deputy O'Sullivan should be accepted by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one aspect in relation to the appointment of the manager that I have not heard any Deputy referring to.  If the manager died or resigned or was removed and if the board felt that one of their members, <Col N="2093" /> an outstanding member, would be best fitted to become the general manager, it might be advisable in these circumstances to give freedom to the board to appoint him as the general manager.  I do not think that case was made and it might be worthy of consideration.</P>
      <P>So far as the constitution of the board is concerned, I do not agree with Deputies who suggested that the board should be comprised of men with business experience and without any practical knowledge of the running of a railway or a transport company.  Deputy Cowan made a comparison between this board and the Army Council.  He suggested that a Minister or Parliamentary Secretary might become chairman.  He pointed out that the Army Council has worked satisfactorily. So far as the Army Council are concerned, the majority of its members, I am inclined to think, came from the ranks.  If that council is taken as a comparison, would it not be practicable that we should recommend to the Minister, when he is appointing this board, that he should appoint men with practical knowledge of rail and road transport, men who, because of their experience and ability, have raised themselves to the position of being quite capable and competent to direct road and rail transport?  I think that type of individual would be best suited as a member of this board.</P>
      <P>I make a special appeal to the Minister to have the majority on this board composed of men with a practical knowledge of the running and development of road and rail transport.  I feel the door should not be altogether closed from the point of view of the general manager being appointed from amongst the members of the board. That should be a matter entirely for the board and the Minister should not take it out of the hands of the board. I can visualise a very capable and experienced member of the board at some time being recommended to replace the general manager.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to clear up a doubt which appears <Col N="2094" /> to exist.  One sub-section sets out that the membership of the board shall not exceed six.  If this other person, the general manager, is brought into the board, does that mean that the board will consist of seven persons?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JosephPatrickBrennan" hpid="Dr. Brennan Dr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me there is some ambiguity as to the exact position. If the Government are limited to appointing six members, would the appointment of the general manager to the board mean that there will be seven?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Say that the Government appoint six members, the seventh position could only be filled by the appointment of the general manager to the board, subject to the sanction of the Minister.  If the board do not decide to appoint the general manager as a member of the board, then the board could not exceed six members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>If the board do not decide to recommend the appointment of the general manager as a member of the board, what is the general manager's association with the board? Can he attend board meetings as an <i>ex-officio</i> member and take part in the discussions?  If he cannot do that, I can see a very awkward situation arising whereby the board will be coming to a decision and will then have to convey this decision to the general manager.</P>

      <P>I must say my colleagues and myself are exceedingly gratified at the attention that has been given to this amendment.  May I confess that when it was put down we did not contemplate that its consideration would have extended to the time that it has now taken?  The members of the House who have taken part in the discussion are to be congratulated on their interest in a very deep subject. They have shown a very intimate knowledge of the important points at issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think, too, that we can congratulate ourselves on the fact that this amendment has given the House an opportunity they would not otherwise have <Col N="2095" /> had of discussing the composition of the proposed board.  In that respect may I say that the Minister himself and the Deputies who have spoken do not seem to be fixed in their ideas and convictions as regards the composition of this board?  The Minister has said that he has not finally made up his mind as to whether it should be a non-technical, a part-time or a full-time board.  Each Deputy has placed on record his views on this subject. May I extend what I have already said by making it clear that last night I had no use for a board composed of executive officers?  I gave my reasons. This afternoon a good deal of play has been made with technicians.  Equally, I am not in the least attracted to a board the outstanding qualifications of the members of which will be their technical ability.  A good deal of the discussion that has taken place in connection with Córas Iompair Éireann in the last few weeks has centred upon the fact that the technical assistance at the disposal of Córas Iompair Éireann in the past was not fully availed of by the board.  In formulating the types of persons the Minister might consider suitable as members of the board he did say that an accountant might be appointed because he was an accountant.  I sincerely hope that that will not be his approach.  If he starts on that premise he must carry his argument to a logical conclusion and he may find himself placed in the position of having to have an engineer, because he is an engineer, and, if an engineer, why not a lawyer too?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can well visualise such a board.  If Mr. Courtney is appointed chairman&mdash;and I hope he will be&mdash;I can well visualise the battle royal he would have in presiding over a board of that character.  I do not think the selection of the personnel of that board will be such an impossible task as it has been represented to be. If the Minister approaches this as a large commercial concern designed to serve the national interest, then it should not be impossible for him to <Col N="2096" /> select half a dozen competent people for that board.  If the Minister is wise, in the interests of our transport system in the years to come he will give preference to people who are experienced in the transport industry.</P>
      <P>It may be said that Deputy Davin and I have harped a good deal on this question of experience.  May I take this opportunity of saying that neither Deputy Davin nor I will be eligible for any of these positions?  We have no personal interest in them.  The Minister should make up his mind in advance that this will be a whole-time board, otherwise the mistakes of the past will be repeated when we had part-time directors chasing around to bank, insurance and every other kind of meeting and paying a very casual interest to transport.  Transport should be a whole-time job.  If the Minister has any apprehensions as to how the board will occupy its time, any experienced railway man will give him all the guidance he wants in that respect.  He will have it from his own technical experts.  He can rest assured that all the directors can be easily allocated to the various sections of the transport concern.  I can assure the House they will have a full day's work every day of the week.</P>
      <P>I and my colleagues are very grateful for the attention that has been paid to this particular amendment. The Minister has admitted that he is not yet in a position to indicate to the House the type of board he proposes to establish.  May I put this question to the Minister in an attempt to bring this debate to a satisfactory conclusion? Is the Minister prepared to examine this matter before the Report Stage and will it then be possible for him to refer to it again?  In view of the fact that he has told the House he has not finally made up his mind, the House will be indulgent and, if he gives a satisfactory answer to my question, that will make it easy for us to adopt a certain course in relation to this amendment.</P>

      <P>I must confess I do not feel like craving the indulgence of the House because I did not come in here with a fixed idea.  I have been <Col N="2097" /> reprimanded because I did not absolutely and definitely make up my mind as to the type of board I wanted and because I did not come in and present that to the House with the intention, no matter what was said here, of never changing my mind. That is a new slant.  I feel that occasionally, at least, this House should be treated as a deliberative assembly rather than as a mere recording machine.  It is interesting to know that it is a sign of weakness if one wishes to consult the House as to what is the better line to pursue.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>It certainly was. Every Deputy who spoke has rebuked me for not having an absolutely clear mind and a fixed idea as to which would be the better board&mdash;not only that, but as to which would be the perfect board.  The extraordinary thing is that no two Deputies agreed as to which would be the better type of board.  Deputies spoke about three or four different types of boards. Deputy Lemass quite rightly said that there were at least three different types of board for each of which one could make a good case.  That is quite true.  I have very definite views of my own.  I have no objection to giving them to the House.  At the same time I will not say to the House now, any more than I said it at the outset of this discussion, that I am sticking to those views irrespective of what the House may think.</P>
      <P>I believe we should have a board consisting of a full-time chairman and and five practical, experienced men with knowledge of the economic life of the country.  Transport is the biggest undertaking we have in the country and, if these men are considered competent to manage an expenditure of £1,000,000, to handle over 20,000 employees and be responsible for the entire transport of the country, then surely such a body ought to be competent to decide whether it is or is not a wise thing to ask the Minister's permission to make their general manager, of whom they have experience, a member of the board. Is that not the issue?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>On that it is easy to say that you have to make up your mind.  Again, I am going to be quite frank with the House.  That, to a very large extent, depends on the type of personnel you want.  There are certain men who probably would make excellent members of a transport board. They are known probably to many Deputies of the House&mdash;men of a type. I can assure the House that nobody has been consulted and that it has not been suggested to anybody that they are going to be members of the board in any way whatsoever, good, bad or indifferent. There are no commitments, either on my part or on the part of the Government, to any individual as to his being a member of the board. But there are men who might make excellent members on the board but who, if you insisted on making it a whole-time job, would not accept the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is another question.  But surely Deputies will admit that it is at least open to argument as to whether the board should or should not be full time.  Will Deputies concede that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is debatable. All I want to make clear is that I have very definite views of my own.  I am prepared at all times, I hope, to listen and to give attention and consideration to the views put forward by responsible members of this House and particularly if those views are put forward from all sides of the House.  I must confess that when I was charged from all sides of the House, and from behind my back, with not having made any case for giving the board permission to ask the Minister's permission to appoint the general manager, I felt myself that the case made against the sub-section was a very poor one.  I do not think there was any case made against it&mdash;certainly not any very convincing case.  However, being that <Col N="2099" /> rather unusual type of Minister who believes that the House should be listened to, that some attention should be paid to what is said, and because I want to get this Bill through this House, when it has finally been got through it, rather as a Bill that will be passed by the House and the whole House than as my Bill, I am prepared to consider any points put up.</P>
      <P>Personally, like Deputy M. O'Sullivan, I welcome the spirit in which this particular amendment and the section was discussed.  I hope that it will be in that spirit and in that atmosphere that the Bill will be discussed for the remainder of its stages.  Frankly, I should like to have the assistance of all the members of this House in trying to make this the best measure we can get for the future guidance of those who will be in charge of the national transport of the country.  In that spirit, I am prepared further to consider the question of this amendment &mdash;I am not prepared to commit myself beyond that&mdash;between now and the Report Stage, if Deputies are satisfied with that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of full-time or part-time membership of the board will have to be considered but I think that both this amendment and Deputy Lemass's amendment can hold together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me get this clear. What the Minister intends is the type of board that will be made compulsory by my amendment, that is a board that would not include, as a general practice anyway, executive officers of the company. The Minister will appreciate that if that point of view is shared generally, and I think that it is, the Dáil would like to see in the Bill some provision to make it certain that that is the type of board they will get either <Col N="2100" /> next year or in five years' time&mdash;that the Bill should not be drawn so widely that at any time the type of board could be changed without legislation and a completely different type of organisation substituted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection to that.  I have no desire to have any position which would enable the complexion of the board to be changed at the whim of any particular Minister or any particular board, for that matter. But Deputy Lemass's amendment deals with a different point or deals with this matter from a different angle&mdash;that is, that a member of the board should not be an executive officer&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It was the easiest way I could put it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is a remote contingency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister favour a part-time board because he thinks it desirable to get a certain type of director who cannot be got for a full-time job?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the main consideration must be the getting of the best types of persons available for the particular job to be done.  I think the House will agree with that.  It is a matter that must be taken into consideration. If my choice, or the choice of whoever may be in my position, is so limited by the insistence on its being a full-time job, so to speak, you may then defeat the very purpose you have in mind.  Alternatively, it may force the Government to offer salaries at such a high figure that will entice persons of that type to give their full time to the job and to surrender whatever other occupations they have at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not obvious to the Minister that a board composed of part-time directors are, almost inevitably, going to appoint a general manager for the purpose of, in practice, delegating the entire job, and that there is a danger of a repetition of what has already been condemned as having been unsuitable in the past?</P>

I think that was the feeling of a number of Deputies that spoke.  I do not want the Minister now to go away with the feeling that we have been criticising him.  I think he was perfectly right in getting the assistance of the House and&mdash;having got it, as is the position now&mdash;I think he has done the right thing in saying that he will further consider the matter and that he will deal with it on the Report Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 9:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(4)  The Government shall, within seven days from the day they appoint a person to be a member of the board, lay before each House of the Oireachtas a statement in writing of the fact of his appointment and of his qualifications for appointment as a member of the board.</P>
      <P>It is a very simple amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, very.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must honestly say that my amendment was attracted by sub-section (4) (c) of Section 7.  It says that:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;If and whenever the Government remove from office under this sub-section <Col N="2102" /> any member of the board, the Government shall lay before each House of the Oireachtas a statement in writing of the fact of his removal from office and of the reasons for such removal.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that from the public point of view it is more important that the reasons for the appointment rather than the reasons for the removal should be laid before both Houses.  If the Government considers it desirable in the event of a removal from office that there should be such publication I think the same principle applies with regard to the appointment.  If the Minister does, as I am perfectly satisfied the Minister will when it comes to the question of appointing a board, consider the merits of the different people who may be recommended to him as suitable members for the board or that he may himself consider as suitable, that will lead to a consideration of the qualifications of the particular persons for appointment.  The amendment proposes that when the Government appoints&mdash;and I take it the Government will appoint on the recommendation of the Minister and that that recommendation will set before the Government the qualifications of the particular people nominated &mdash; the Government will lay before Parliament a statement setting out the appointment and the qualifications of the member. I think that is a safeguard and a wise thing to do.  I think it would be very wise if it were done in all cases of public appointment so that the public would see the qualifications of persons appointed to positions of this responsibility.  I take it that if the Government makes an appointment of a particular person as a member of the board it will be prepared to stand over that appointment in this House or elsewhere.  That being so, I think there would or should be no objection to placing before the House within seven days a statement of the qualifications of the particular persons whom it is proposed to appoint as members of the board.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to accept this viewpoint.  We all hope that when this Bill is passed into law, it will <Col N="2103" /> establish a new board that will make a success of the transport undertaking. For many years to come Governments will be appointing members to the board under the powers conferred by this Bill and it will be a very useful thing in the future to have the provision contained in this amendment. I can see no objection to it and I take it the Minister has no objection to it, that he will accept it as an amendment that helps to complete the Bill, and make it more satisfactory from the point of view of the general public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">

    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would urge that the Minister should not accept this amendment. I should like to make the reverse case to that made by Deputy Cowan.  I think that by accepting the amendment the House would be imposing on the Minister limitations that might be very dangerous because we cannot have it both ways.  It might happen that there would be a man who would be admirably suitable to act on the board but who, if considered in the light of normal qualifications, could be described as having none.  Yet, from the point of practical ability, he might be an infinitely suitable man for the job.  You might put the Minister in the position of having to face an argument in this House as to whether a man with certain qualifications could or could not be considered suitable for the job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, you are going to try to limit the Minister in his scope and outlook on certain types of qualifications. I think that if you do that you are going to defeat the object of getting the best possible board.  I can conceive, and I am sure Deputies with more experience than I have will agree that a man who, within the narrow meaning of the word &ldquo;qualifications&rdquo;, might have none, yet might have an infinitely longer experience and more practical ability that would make him definitely more suitable as a member of the board than a man who some people might consider as having the necessary qualifications.  I think the <Col N="2104" /> Minister has sufficiently safeguarded the position in that he is going to consider between now and the Report Stage the arguments put to him on the last amendment and, as I interpreted it, he is going to have his mind fixed in a more definite and decisive manner by the Report Stage on the type of board to be established.  I think that this amendment might leave the House open to be criticised in a way that would not be of advantage to the House or of advantage to the board that will ultimately be appointed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister is not so simple or so naïve as Deputy Cowan seems to assume in asking us to accept this amendment.  Of course the comparison which Deputy Cowan has drawn between an appointment to the board and a removal from the board does not hold water at all.  It does not follow that because the Minister makes a report to the House of the reasons why a member of the board was removed from office he should also furnish a statement to the House of the qualifications of a member on appointment to the House.  There are quite a number of very good arguments, as Deputy Collins has pointed out, why the Minister should be allowed a certain freedom of choice in this matter.  It is quite within the bounds of imagination that certain individuals whom this House would unanimously choose as suitable members of the board, would not subject themselves to that public discussion of their personal standing, their personal history or merits that this amendment would render necessary for such appointment. That is one factor and I think it is an overriding one.  There is the other side, that we have been most insistent on in this matter of transport as a whole, that the Minister, as Minister, shall retain very wide controlling powers over the operations of the board. Many Deputies felt that it should be subject to the Dáil.  If Deputy Cowan wishes to have his amendment accepted he should say that the Dáil should make the appointment and take the responsibility off the Minister altogether.  I do not think, however, that he wants that.  I think he realises that it would <Col N="2105" /> be impossible.  Equally, I think it is impossible to ask any body of men to set down in definite and precise language the reasons why they may pick out a particular individual for appointment to a board of this character. There are so many undefinable things that go to make it up that it would be impossible to do it in such a way.  It is the responsibility of the Minister and his advisers to make the appointment and that responsibility should be left upon him.</P>
      <P>It is an entirely different matter when a member is removed from a board, because then something definite has to be stated as to why the removal took place.  That is something which can be placed before the Dáil and which Deputies can discuss if they wish.  They would be discussing the reasons why the member was removed, not what goes to make up his personality, his history, his background and his experience, which form the basis on which his appointment would be made.  While I appreciate Deputy Cowan's approach to the matter, I do not think he has any real hope that the amendment will be accepted by the Minister.  I think he has even less hope that many Deputies will support it.</P>

    <Title>Pensions (Increase) Bill, 1949&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. McGilligan) Patrick McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The Bill provides for the increase of certain pensions payable in respect of public service.  It adheres to the general scheme which I outlined to the Dáil on the 19th July last when token Supplementary Estimates for pension increases were before the House.  The Bill authorises increases in certain pensions of less than £450 a year payable in respect of public service which have been calculated by reference to remuneration below the levels obtaining after the general increase in remuneration which took place towards the end of 1946.  The pensions <Col N="2106" /> covered are those which were granted following retirement in the normal course and were being paid on the 1st April last to teachers, police, civil servants, widows and children of Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries, local and harbour authority employees and certain Electricity Supply Board employees whose pensions are at present restricted under the Emergency Powers (No. 244) Order, 1942.</P>
      <P>In general the Bill provides that a pension will not be increased to a greater amount than would be payable to or in respect of a person of equivalent status and service who retired after the general increases in remuneration in 1946.  Subject to this proviso the increases authorised in cases where no increase has previously been given are as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Where the pension does not exceed £100 a year, 50 per cent. of the pension; where the pension exceeds £100 but does not exceed £150 a year, 40 per cent. of the pension, but not less than £50; where the pension exceeds £150 but does not exceed £450 a year, 30 per cent. of the pension, but not less than £60, provided that no pension will be increased to more than £450 a year.  Where a pension includes an element attributable to the payment of emergency bonus that element is to be neglected in calculating the increase, and ceases to be payable once the pension is increased.  Increases are payable with effect from the 1st April 1949, or the date of commencement of the pension if that is later.</P>
      <P>The pensions of civil servants and Gardaí Síochána who retired in the period from the 1st July, 1940, to the 31st October, 1946, when their salaries were stabilised, have already been increased under previous legislation. In most cases where retirement took place before the 1st July, 1943, the increased pensions are less than would be obtained by increasing the original pensions in accordance with this Bill. In such cases increases in accordance with this Bill are being given in lieu of the previous increase, with effect from the 1st April, 1949.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have considered carefully the <Col N="2107" /> question of providing for a minimum increase, as was suggested when the Supplementary Estimates for pension increases were being discussed by the Dáil.  In view of the very substantial percentage increase being given in the smaller pensions, I do not feel called upon to do so, particularly as any provision for a minimum increase would be likely to be applicable to a considerable number of pensioners, and would result in many of those pensioners receiving more than if they retired at a later date and had their pensions calculated on post-war rates of pay.</P>
    <P>The total cost to State funds of the increases provided under the Bill is estimated at £200,000 a year, of which £119,000 will go to national teachers and £44,000 to civil servants.  The balance of £37,000 will be divided among members of the Garda Síochána and Dublin Metropolitan Police, certain resigned and dismissed members of the Royal Irish Constabulary and a group of others.  The total number of pensions payable from State funds which are being increased under the Bill is approximately 4,600.</P>
    <P>Provision is not made in the Bill for the increase of pensions payable to the widows of Gardaí Síochána, or of resigned and dismissed members of the Royal Irish Constabulary, or of members of the Dublin Metropolitan Police who adopted the terms of the Dublin Metropolitan Police (Pensions) Order, 1922, and who retired after the amalgamation of that force with the Garda Síochána in 1925.  It is considered preferable to provide for these increases by way of amendment to the various Orders regulating the pensions, in order that the increases may apply to pensions awarded in future as well as to those already being paid.  Approximately 500 widows' pensions already in course of payment will be increased in this manner and 600 allowances to children of deceased members of the Garda Síochána and Dublin Metropolitan Police.</P>
    <P>Provision is not being made for any increase in the compensation awarded under Article 10 of the Treaty to former civil servants or members of <Col N="2108" /> the Dublin Metropolitan Police.  These persons have enjoyed for many years the benefit of the enhanced compensation terms provided by Article 10.  In many cases, the compensation payable is higher than the maximum amount payable under this Bill.</P>
    <P>Increases to pensioners of local authorities and harbour authorities will be granted by the authority concerned, subject to the sanction of the responsible Minister.  The increases will be on a basis similar to that applicable to civil servants.</P>
    <P>While the House will not wish me to examine the provisions of the Bill in detail at this stage, I should like to indicate briefly the scope of the various sections.  Section 1 contains the definitions; the second sub-section covers any pensions which were suspended on the 1st April, 1949, by reason of the pensioner's re-employment.  Where a civil servant has been transferred to the service of a local authority or other public employment, his last employer will bear the cost of any increase in his pension subsequent to the date of transfer.</P>
    <P>Section 2 is the important section and sets out the &ldquo;appropriate sum&rdquo;, which is the increase which may be given subject to the general overriding consideration that no pensioner may receive more than would be payable if the pension were recalculated by reference to the increases in pay granted in 1946.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides for the increase of the pensions of police and civil servants, other than those increased under previous legislation, and the pensions of teachers.  Section 4 provides for widows' pensions and children's allowances granted under the Ministerial and Parliamentary Officers Acts, and Section 5 for police and Civil Service pensions where increases under this Bill are being substituted for previous lesser increases given.  Local authorities are covered by Section 6 and harbour authorities by Section 7.</P>
    <P>Section 8 is of particular application. It applies to a person who has two pensions.  No increase will be payable if the total of the pensions amounts to £450 a year or more, and subject to <Col N="2109" /> this consideration the increase given will be the appropriate sum calculated by reference to the aggregate of the pensions in the manner set out in Section 2.</P>
    <P>Section 9 allows increases to be granted retrospectively from the 1st April, 1949, except in the case where the pension did not commence until a later date.  Under Section 10 increases now being granted in pensions which were increased under the Pensions (Increase) Act, 1920, will be calculated on the total amount at present being paid.  Section 11 provides that any statutory provision which applied to a pension immediately before it was increased shall apply to it as increased, and under this authority increases in pensions will be charged to the same source as the original pensions. Section 12 provides that increases in teachers' pensions will be granted by the Minister for Education, police pensions by the Minister for Justice, post office pensions by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, and all other pensions by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Section 13 provides a slight easement in a provision in the Royal Irish Constabulary (Resigned and Dismissed) Pensions Order, 1924, which restricts to two-thirds of retiring salary the total which can be drawn by way of pension under the Order and pension in respect of service in another police force or public office.  I propose to allow retiring salary to be taken at 1946 levels for this purpose.</P>
    <P>Section 14 is another special provision of limited application to cover cases where the recovery of compensation in respect of the injury or death of a member of a police force led to the award of a reduced pension or sometimes to no pension at all.  Section 15 enables the Minister for Finance to determine doubts and Section 16 provides for Electricity Supply Board employees whose pensions are at present restricted under the Emergency Powers (No. 244) Order, 1942.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that the Minister has not found it possible to introduce a section in this Bill to enable lower-paid pensioners, those, for example, under £50 a year or <Col N="2110" /> perhaps an even lower minimum, to be placed at a certain basic figure, irrespective of what the increase might amount to as a percentage.  According to the figures given by the Minister, there are some 200 retired civil servants who are receiving superannuation under 30/- a week.  I know that there are nearly 300 ex-national teachers who are also in receipt of pensions under £50 per annum.  I have not got the figures for the other Departments. The Minister stated, when the Supplementary Estimate was under discussion here, that he thought there were some 900.  If the national teachers in the class of lowly-paid pensioners are in proportion to the total number of national teacher pensioners as compared with the total number of pensioners who will benefit under this Bill, I think that perhaps the figure might not be so high.  However, the Minister has mentioned a figure of 900. Having regard to the large number of cases which are covered, and the fact that there is a graded percentage basis and a means test, the expenditure, although substantial, is not nearly as heavy as might have been anticipated if, in fact, an effort were made to give compensation to superannuated servants of the State which would have some relation to the increase in the cost of living.</P>
      <P>I should like to say, with reference to the cases of pensioners in receipt of small amounts, that of course they are a disappearing element.  The large bulk of the pensioners who will benefit under this legislation will continue for a considerable time, but those who went out 15 years ago&mdash;some of them are out much longer&mdash;are obviously going to disappear pretty rapidly.  The cost of living is not treating those old servants of the public very kindly.  The cost of living has really increased during the past few years.  As regards food and clothing, the price of which affects the poorer people more than the better off classes, the increase is definitely admitted in the official statistics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the present year, from mid-May to mid-August, there have been increase in respect of such necessary articles of food as potatoes and milk. <Col N="2111" /> We know that in the winter season the cost of some of these necessities increases still more.  We know, too, that by reason of their financial position some of those pensioners have to make their purchases of necessities at higher prices than people in more comfortable circumstances.  I have no doubt that the position will remain difficult for those people.  There is no indication that the price of such necessary articles as I have mentioned is likely to fall.  There is the danger that for some time to come there may be an increase.  The devaluation which has taken place is, I think, likely to cause repercussions here similar to what it has caused elsewhere in the way of increasing cost of living, especially in the case of those who have only a small margin to meet the increased cost of the times.</P>
    <P>The measure, I take it, is introduced in fulfilment of the pledges that were given prior to the general election.  I think the Minister ought to give opportunities to enable the representatives of the associations in question to put their case before Deputies and so enable them, if they are in a position to do it, to secure amendments even though these may not be very substantial. Even though this is a Money Bill, they might be able to effect some improvement in it if such an opportunity were given to them.</P>
    <P>The position, as I understand it, with regard to the particular class to which the Minister has not referred in Section 17 of the Bill, is that there is a general restriction providing that the conditions for increased pensions shall not apply to those who went out under Article 10 of the Treaty.  It is stated by an association representing those who went out under the 1929 Act that definite pledges were given to them by the Parties now constituting the Government that they would do their utmost to have legislation introduced and passed through the Oireachtas to remedy the injustices of which they complained.  In one case I notice it is mentioned that the amount would not be very great.  It seems, therefore, that the Minister is likely to be taking his stand in this matter on the fact that he feels there is a principle at stake.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2112" /> In the first place, he has stated that the particular class to which I have referred retired prematurely from the service of the Irish Government. There is a question whether, whatever about those who retired before 1929 and were entitled to go out voluntarily and to receive the appropriate increase in superannuation, the expression &ldquo;retiring prematurely&rdquo; covers fairly the cases of those who went out after the 1929 Act was passed.  As I understand it, under that Act the officer who wished to retire had to go before a tribunal, where he had to prove that his conditions of employment were materially altered to his detriment, and if the court appointed by the Oireachtas came to the conclusion that his conditions of employment were so altered, surely we can hardly fairly describe them as not having had a reason?  Whether we agree in general with the point of view of such officers, we must admit that the fact that they did go before a court and prove their case of having their positions of employment materially worsened shows they had a case to make which the Oireachtas recognised had to be made in that way.</P>
    <P>As regards the point that they received their full legal entitlement as far as superannuation was concerned, that could be pleaded in respect of other cases as well.  I think in this measure the Government are rightly not being bound entirely by legal entitlement.  I take it they are approaching the matter on compassionate grounds, having regard to the serious increase in the cost of living, and in an effort to alleviate the circumstances of superannuated servants of the State.  There was no overriding maximum before the 1929 Act, but in that Act there was an overriding maximum and those who retired afterwards were not in as favourable a position as those who retired previously and who have got the full benefit of whatever the cost-of-living figure was at the time.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say that those persons took a certain decision, having regard to all the circumstances, and he is not willing to review their cases; but if, in fact, as seems evident from <Col N="2113" /> the representations they have made, that the present situation, as in other cases, is pressing heavily upon them and the superannuation benefit, whatever it may be, of 1949 in their case has a very much less purchasing power than in 1929, I think the Minister might try to effect a remedy.  Even having regard to the sentiments which we know many of us on all sides of the House may have with regard to that particular class, nevertheless they have given good service to the State.  They retired under the conditions I explained. They are worse off than those who went out before them.  I have not figures as to the numbers, but it is stated in the reply from one of the political Parties which is the cornerstone of the Coalition that the amount involved could not be very large and would, in the nature of things, be a diminishing charge.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say a few words on behalf of the people who are very poorly circumstanced because of the small pensions they are receiving. In doing that, I want to say that the increase given by the Minister to pensioners to the tune of £200,000 is appreciated.  There are cases of hardship and, of course, it is difficult in any general scheme to provide for the elimination of those cases of hardship. But I would say to the Minister that perhaps the minimum pension could be increased.  I do not think it would cost a considerable sum.  It would relieve quite a considerable amount of the hardship which we discovered in examining individual cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are particular people exempted from benefit under the Pension Increases Act.  I feel the period has passed during which there should be a discrimination against those particular people.  I know that, in respect of quite a number who are in receipt of pensions under Article 10 of the Treaty, that they, under that Article, were enabled to retire and get a substantial pension much earlier than they might and it is natural that there should be some resentment of their action at the time.  But if we look at it from a broad point of view, their action in retiring at that time may have opened up opportunities for <Col N="2114" /> younger people to obtain employment and to gain a knowledge of administration, and the State is benefiting now from the experience in administration that has been received by those younger people because of the vacancies created through retirements under Article 10.</P>
    <P>To some extent the same thing applies to the Dublin Metropolitan Police pensioners who are on somewhat similar lines.  Some of them at the time they retired had some hostility to the State.  Some saw the opportunity of retiring with a pretty good pension early on.  Twenty-seven years have passed.  Feelings have mellowed a good deal.  Those people now believe that they are being discriminated against.  From the general viewpoint of the public good, I think it would be better if there was no section, even though it is a small section, which should feel that there is discrimination against it.  For that reason I ask the Minister to consider bringing those excluded categories into the machinery of pension increases.</P>
    <P>There is another section on entirely different ground.  That is the section whose pensions exceed £450 per year. These pensioners are not very large in number.  The Minister gave me the exact number in answer to a question but, since I did not anticipate this measure would come up for discussion to-day, I did not bring the information with me.  These men reached a very high point in their particular professions by reason of their industry, hard work and ability.  They reached what one might describe as the peak of their professions.  They retired and their pensions fixed on the rate of retirement pay were in excess of £450 a year.  They have been hit by the increase in the cost of living just as everybody else has been hit by it.  They have a certain position to maintain.  They contribute to the cultural work of the country. Because of the increased cost of living the purchasing power of their incomes has been considerably reduced.  I think it is unjust that we should say to these people: &ldquo;You have a pension in excess of £450 a year; that is a generous pension; although the cost of living has gone up and we feel that every <Col N="2115" /> section of the community should receive increases both in pension and in pay, you should get nothing.&rdquo;  Because of the increased cost of living we have increased the pay of nearly every person in the State.</P>
    <P>We have increased the allowances that are paid to Deputies.  We have increased the salary attaching to the position of Minister.  We have increased the salaries of the judiciary. We have increased the salaries of the higher civil servants and of every public official.  Yet, we say to this small group of exceptionally distinguished people: &ldquo;You have a pension of £500 a year; that may have been given to you before there was any increase in the cost of living; there has been a considerable increase in the cost of living and that £500 is not as good as it was; nevertheless, notwithstanding the fact that we have met every other section of the community, we will not give you a single ½d. increase.&rdquo;  I think that is unjust and unfair.  The amount of such an increase to these people would be very small.  I appeal to the Minister to raise the ceiling above £450 and to grant increases to that very small section of ex-public servants to whom so much is due from the State.</P>
    <P>Deputy Derrig mentioned an appeal that was made to the political Parties by the Association of Civil Service Pensioners prior to the general election of January, 1948.  He quoted a reply given by the Fine Gael Party to that appeal.  The reply was that they were in favour of an increase.  I have before me a copy of that communication. It was sent to every political Party and every Party, with the exception of Fianna Fáil, replied stating that they committed themselves to supporting the association. Deputy Derrig quoted the Fine Gael reply.  He did not say that Fianna Fáil did not commit themselves at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>They did not commit themselves one way or the other.  If Deputy Derrig had not anticipated me by endeavouring to make his case on <Col N="2116" /> what Fine Gael had said, I might have placed the complete correspondence on the records of this House.  If his Party at the time had said: &ldquo;If we become the Government again we will refuse to consider this,&rdquo; or &ldquo;if we become the Government again we will consider it and we will grant it&rdquo;, then I could understand his point of view.  But, having steered clear of that particular point, I will not follow my original intention of placing the correspondence in its entirety on the records of the House.  It is sufficient for me to say that every political Party at that time, after consideration of the case made by the association, guaranteed to support the claims of the association if there was a change of Government.</P>
      <P>I realise the Minister for Finance has very difficult problems to face and I think the House ought to sympathise with him because of that.  He has to find increases in pay all round.  He has to find the moneys recently voted for transport and other purposes.</P>
      <P>He has to find the money, which will exceed £1,000,000, in connection with the additional payments to teachers. These are enormous burdens for the Minister to bear, and, in an approach to these problems, we must be realistic and appreciate and understand those vital problems that confront him.  What I have been advocating this evening would not, I think, taking it on a general balance, amount to a very big sum.  But the amount that would be payable, if my recommendations were accepted, while not very substantial in itself, would have a tremendous effect on the people who are affected&mdash; particularly on that very unfortunate section of the pensioner community who are compelled to exist on a totally inadequate pension, on a pension that is insufficient to enable them to keep body and soul together in ordinary frugal comfort.</P>
      <P>While, as I said at the beginning, the increases that have been given are welcome, they are particularly welcome when they are given in circumstances such as the financial position and the financial demands that face the Minister and face the Government at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2117" /> I would ask the Minister to consider favourably the suggestions I have put forward to him this evening and to endeavour to meet the additional demands that I recommend to him for consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is fair of Deputies in this House to meet the Minister on the Second Reading of this Bill with a hearty compliment.  The Minister has gone a long way to meet long-outstanding just claims of pensioners. I say to him, on behalf of the pensioned teachers who have approached me: Well done.  They appreciate, in no uncertain fashion, the circumstances under which the increases are given.  Deputy Cowan has made a plea in connection with very lowly paid pensioners to which the Minister might well advert.  There are sections of his argument with which I do not agree and with which I propose to deal later.  It ill befits Deputy Derrig to do a moaning act here in a dishonest way about an increase of the cost of living that, he purports to suggest, is, in the main, an incident of the last two years, when he knows that statement to be completely untrue.  He knows that he himself was not a person who could be described as most sympathetic to and understanding of the teachers&mdash;either pensioned teachers or the teachers actually serving.  I am proud, and Deputy Derrig can have this back from me, as a member of the Fine Gael Party, that we have been able to implement our promise and give these people some ray of hope and take them off the subsistence or semi-starvation level.  It is time Deputy Derrig woke up to the fact that he himself and his administration&mdash;as far as the teachers are concerned, pensioned or otherwise&mdash;have been completely discredited by the courageous approach of the new Government to their problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might be a good thing if the Minister could consider the possibility of striking a minimum.  There are certain limited numbers of people, to whom this Pensions (Increase) Act is going to apply, that even an increase of 50 per cent. in their pension is not going to ameliorate their conditions to <Col N="2118" /> give them any standard of life.  I am assured that the numbers so affected are small.  Where a pensioner is receiving £50 a year, or less, this Dáil, in a spirit of Christian charity if nothing else, should fix at least a 100 per cent increase for that category of pensioner.  We all know perfectly well that, as far as that particular class is concerned, it is a rapidly diminishing and dying class.  It is very hard for a person who has occupied some position of responsibility in the State to have to eke out his last days in practically semi-starvation as many of these pensioners are doing now.</P>
    <P>I do not subscribe to Deputy Cowan's rather <i>ad misericordíam</i> appeal for certain people who elected to take a certain course under Article 10.  I think a lot of those people did it deliberately and that many of them opted to take certain favourable conditions, that they could avail of them, for the purpose of starting themselves in another walk of life.  It is easy to say that feelings have mellowed in the meantime.  I would hate anybody to think that I had any discrimination against or any animosity towards that class, but I feel that many of them, at an early age, had a pension with which to face the economic situation of the last 27 years and that they were infinitely better off than many people who had to compete against them in the ordinary maelstrom of life.  If money is to be squeezed out of a hard pressed Exchequer I would far sooner see it expended to raise to a certain fixed minimum the amount of pension of any servant of the State rather than turn around and give further consideration to those people.  I have a feeling that Deputy Cowan is perfectly sincere and honest in the case he makes.  But if I think that if any further money is to be squeezed out of the hard-pressed Exchequer I would rather see it go by way of a 100 per cent. increase to the £50 or less than £50 pensioner than to start considering people who opted, under Section 10 of the Treaty, to go out under what were then very favourable conditions and out into a situation where they could start or re-establish themselves <Col N="2119" /> in life at a comparatively young age with a pension which they could not hope to obtain otherwise unless they had given many further years of service in the Departments they were in.</P>
    <P>I advocate in no uncertain fashion the responsibility of the State to its pensioners&mdash;to people who have given service to this State&mdash;that they should at least be brought up to a reasonable level at which they can exist and not have them existing as many of them are existing at the moment, in semistarvation conditions.  I do not consider that you can make a valid case for reopening, 27 years afterwards, or 25 years afterwards or 20 years afterwards, the case of people who, in their own deliberate judgment, took a certain course and, because their judgment proved to be wrong and they were not able to do better, that we should now kind of turn around and say: &ldquo;We forgive your taking all the benefits you got then and we are now going to take you on as a burden&rdquo;.  I do not think that is a logical argument.</P>

      <P>My contention is that they came into the economic field in this country and on to the labour market that they could supply, so to speak in a far better equipped position than many of the people who had to compete with them.  They did that in a deliberate way and got certain very substantial advantages.  If they have not been successful, it is not our duty now to compensate them for that lack of success.  I think there is a fair basis for Deputy Cowan's argument that the ceiling pension should not be fixed at £450.  Again I feel, however, that the strength of his argument might be lessened by the fact that if these people are of the extraordinary ability, cultural value and experience that Deputy Cowan suggests, we know that many of them on retirement have found certain jobs and small occupations to supplement their incomes.</P>

      <P>It does not matter. I know a good many men who have retired in this city who are over 70 and who are engaged in small commercial occupations.  I do not think we should start advocating increases in the top scale pensions before we have dealt with the problem of raising the standard of the lowest type pensioner. I say to the Minister, in welcoming his Bill and giving the Second Reading of it wholehearted support, that if any more money can be found he should use it, every halfpenny of it&mdash;and he will have my blessing in doing so&mdash;in raising the level of the most lowly paid pensioners rather than adding to the pensions of any other strata.  I should like to see a minimum fixed so that no pensioner would be drawing less than £100.</P>

    <P>One case in particular that has come to my notice may be typical of a small number of others.  It would seem that certain classes of teachers in national schools do not benefit in the same favourable way under the proposals contained in this Bill as other members of the profession do. I have been given particulars of one case which I would like to bring to the Minister's attention, which, as I say, is, perhaps, typical of a small number of other cases that I think should be covered.  It is the case of a junior assistant mistress who retired after the 31st October, 1946.  I understand that cases such as that are not covered by this measure at all.  The amount of pension awarded to the teacher in question was £74 13s. 6d. That is a pension in the lower category altogether and there was provision made under a Pensions Order some time last year by which that pension was increased by the sum of £15.  Had that case been dealt with <Col N="2121" /> under this measure, the amount of the increase would be £37 6s. 9d. instead of the £15 awarded.  What I want to know is: cannot a case like that be provided for under this Bill without making the financial burden by any means much more severe?  The extra amount that would have to be provided in order to cover such cases would be very small.  It is a type of case with which all sections of the Dáil should have sympathy, cases referred to previously in which the pension is less than £100 a year.</P>
    <P>I have been in touch with the Department of Education about this case but I am told that it is not a case that is dealt with under this measure. First of all, when I heard of the case I was under the impression that it was covered by Section 2, sub-section (1) (a) and that there would be an automatic increase of 50 per cent. in the amount of the pension.  Then I discovered afterwards that the Bill does not apply to pensions of this nature at all but only to those teachers who retired before the new scales of salaries came into operation on the 31st October, 1946.  These are the only remarks I have to make in regard to this piece of legislation.  There seem to be anomalies even though the net appears to have been spread fairly widely.  I should like to ask whether cases of that nature could not get the benefits that are provided for under this measure whereby the pensioner would get a 50 per cent. increase instead of the small increase awarded.</P>

      <P>I shall not delay the House because other Deputies have already given expression to the views which I wish to put forward.  I only desire to repeat that it is a pity, in view of the importance of the Bill and of the good reception that has been accorded to it by seven-eighths of the pensioners, that there should be one-eighth left with a grievance.  Numerically the one-eighth left with a grievance may not seem very large compared with the seven-eighths who are satisfied with the Bill but, nevertheless, there are 200 or 300 civil servants who are receiving 30/- a week and under at the moment and the increases which they are going to get will not be <Col N="2122" /> sufficient to compensate them for the loss which they suffered by reason of the increased cost of living spread over eight or ten years during which they had to exist on that small pension. Then there are 300 or 400 retired national teachers with pensions of £1, 25/- or 30/- a week and the increase given to them is very small indeed.  I have also had a number of letters from retired Dublin Metropolitan Policemen and in some of these letters the famous phrase of the late General Michael Collins is quoted:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;They shall be treated not less favourably than those who remained on.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>They say that they are being treated less favourably, in fact that they are being passed over altogether.</P>
      <P>I understand that those in receipt of pensions under the Transferred Officers Act of 1929 are to get nothing at all.  I appeal to the Minister to go a little further and give these people who are dissatisfied and feel they have been selected for a sort of victimisation some increase.  It is well to remind people that promises made at a general election should not be broken.  I remember the circular which Deputy Cowan referred to being sent to all the Parties asking them if they would support the Civil Service Pensioners' Organisation in their effort to improve the pensions paid to their members.  I remember all the answers given to that circular, but I do not remember any answer coming from the then Government Party.  With others, I signed the form sent out and agreed to support their claim for an increase as far as lay in my power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I rise now to support this measure, with an appeal to the Minister to consider the appeals made with regard to those who are on small pensions and to ask him not to forget the old Dublin Metropolitan Policemen who retired on the promise that they would be looked after when the time came, and also the widows of some of these men to whom that promise was made.  These men accepted the word of those who were in public life at that time and carried out the instructions given them and they now feel that <Col N="2123" /> they have been victimised.  A number of those who retired, as well as those who continued to serve for some time and who were in the service for a long time, went out on very small pensions. Some of the letters I received drew attention to the fact that they are getting nothing, that they will not benefit at all, and I think something should be done for them.</P>
    <P>The Civil Service Pensioners' Association also points out that some senior civil servants who gave their whole lifetime to the service went out on the maximum pension at the time, but that that pension would buy exactly double the quantity of food at the time which it would buy to-day.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows that clothing has nearly doubled in price since some of these senior civil servants went out on the maximum pension, so that that pension is now equivalent to less than half of what it was at the time of their retirement, I, therefore, appeal to the Minister to see that the promises made by different Parties to the Civil Service Pensioners' Association will be carried out.</P>
    <P>I also understand that a large number of Post Office pensioners have only miserable pensions and were hoping that something better would be done for them than is being done under this Bill.  With other Deputies, I sympathise with the Minister in his difficulties. I know it is easy for any of us to keep on making requests for more money.  But, if it was essential for emergency purposes, the Minister would be able to find millions tomorrow. I hope, therefore, that he will find a little more money to meet the demands of those who served the country so well in the past.</P>

      <P>Like Deputy Cowan, I sympathise with the Minister in the difficulties which must naturally face him in the introduction of such a measure as this.  Undoubtedly, the provisions of the Bill have gone a good way to relieve some of the difficulties under which certain pensioners were suffering.  I think, however, that he should go a little bit further.  Dealing particularly with the lower class of pensioners, I entirely subscribe to the <Col N="2124" /> views expressed by Deputy Seán Collins.  I do not, however, subscribe to the deduction which might follow from a careless reading of his speech&mdash; that the Party to which he belongs is the Government.  He must realise that that is not so.  If not, the sooner he does the better.  The success of this Bill, which is intended to do justice to a great many sufferers, depends on the support which it receives in this House. The Government does not consist of one Party, but of several Parties brought together to give effect to measures such as this.  We may hope that the time will come when the Party spirit will disappear in the discussion of Pension Bills and such other matters as are of common concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case made by Deputy Cowan was one which the Minister should consider, particularly in relation to those who went out under Article 10.  I think it was quite unfair on the part of Deputy Collins to reflect on the motives of those who took advantage of the position created by Article 10 of the Treaty in suggesting that a good many of them started in competition with the difficulties of life on a much safer, sounder basis than those who did not retire.  If Deputy Collins took an interest in the affairs which faced the country when Article 10 became effective, he would realise that there were very noble motives in the minds of those who took advantage of that Article.  It is quite unfair to suggest, or to convey, that those people, in availing of the opportunities that were afforded to them, were doing something which was to their advantage and against the national interest.  I would ask the Minister to consider favourably the case of the Dublin Metropolitan Police, particularly those who retired under the terms of the Anglo-Irish Treaty. Their number is now very small.  I would ask him to consider their position favourably, and to bring their pensions up to what will now prevail under this Bill.  I have been informed that the number of pensioners is well under 200.  While the Minister has, naturally, to be very careful of the expenditure of every penny of public money and while the House agrees with him on that, I think he should reconsider the attitude which he has taken in regard to these <Col N="2125" /> pensioners and bring them in under this Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne reminded us that, at the general election, the Parties which now compose the Government all replied to a circular which was sent to the various Parties, and gave a promise to do their best, if and when the opportunity arose, to have the grievances mentioned rectified.  It does not follow that, because Fianna Fáil did not reply, they were not in favour of that.  If one is to judge from the speech of Deputy Derrig, there can be no doubt that there is some sympathy on the Fianna Fáil benches for this measure. I think that, in dealing with matters of this kind, if we had less recrimination from all sides of the House and more concentration on the affairs with which we are concerned, we would do our business better and be representing the interests of our constituents more adequately.</P>

      <P>I am sure everyone is glad to see the pensioners getting an increase to enable them to meet the increase in the cost of living.  I cannot understand why there is one body, the Old I.R.A., left out of this Bill.  I am speaking of a class of people who are destitute, people who got pensions, or what was called a special allowance, under the 1946 Act. They seem to be completely forgotten under this Bill.  Disability pensions have been increased.  I am sure the Minister is well aware that, in order to qualify for the special allowance, one must be incapable of self-support. It seems strange to give an increase to disability pensioners and not to give it to people who are incapable of self-support.</P>

      <P>I was referring to people who got pensions under the 1946 Act and who are really destitute now, I contend that from a couple of Government Departments circulars have been sent to local authorities since 1946 requesting them to give increases to people to enable them to meet the increased cost of living.  I maintain that those men are entitled to an increase owing to the increase that has taken place in the cost of living since 1946.  It seems to me that one particular section of the people is being left out of this Bill, and I would appeal to the Minister to reconsider that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose that when the people who refrained, if they did not refuse, to give pensions in an earlier day feel it necessary to speak on this, and complain of how meagre the terms of the increases are and argue the point without feeling any shame, any comment of mine would not have any effect on them.  Deputy Derrig complains that compensation is not being given here on a fair scale.  I think it stands a pretty good comparison with anything that was done previously in this matter.  The Deputy also thinks that an opportunity ought to be given to the representatives of different associations to put <Col N="2127" /> their case to Deputies so that amendments might be moved to the measure. I announced the terms with regard to all these pensions in July of last year. Surely the Deputy will agree that there was plenty of time, in between, for any association interested in any group of pensioners to make representations.  I have received quite a number of communications on this subject.  I have been approached and interviewed by nearly everybody interested in these associations as well as by individuals.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cowan with other Deputies raised the question of a minimum pension. This Bill provides a better percentage increase at the lower end of the scale than most of the other pension measures.  That attitude was adopted quite deliberately.  The position of the teachers weighed most in the balance when the final decision was being taken.  Having given what is a very substantial increase at the lower end of the scale, it was decided not to give a minimum pension.  Personally, as far as I am concerned, it is not so much a matter of the money that is involved, although that might turn out to be considerable.  There is this difficulty: if I were to establish a minimum pension with regard to the group of pensioners now being dealt with, must I not maintain that in the case of every pensioner who at any time comes under the control of the State?  Otherwise, I would have this desperate anomaly that people who might go out hereafter as a result of short service and get a small pension, even though it was related to an increase in pay, might be getting less than the pensioners I was dealing with under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the House ought to bear in mind that the people who are getting very small pensions, and whose pensions will not be very much even when raised by the 50 per cent., are people who must have had extremely short service.  It is quite possible that through ill-health some had to retire after a very short period of service. The proposal is that we should make an adjustment of pensions, whatever the amount might have been, earned by service, because of their depreciation <Col N="2128" /> in value owing to the increase in the cost of living.  That is the case that is made with regard to these people.</P>
    <P>The case I make with regard to the Article 10 people is entirely different. I think a good deal of undeserved sympathy has been excited over these people because of the atmosphere bred by the use of the words &ldquo;discrimination&rdquo; and &ldquo;resentment&rdquo;&mdash;and Deputy Byrne added the word &ldquo;victimisation&rdquo;. That is not the case with regard to the Article 10 pensioners.  As regards the Article 10 pensioners, I could quote Michael Collins's words as quoted by Deputy Byrne.  Those people were promised that they would not be less favourably treated than those who remained on.  That promise has been completely fulfilled.  These people are better off than the people who remained on, but they are now asking for something additional and I do not think they are entitled to it.</P>
    <P>There were at least two reasons that drove people out of the service: one was the question of the change of Government, and the second&mdash;and that is the group that is more under observation now&mdash;concerns people who retired at a later stage because they said their conditions of service had been worsened.  These people went to a court and they had rights and they established those rights before the court and they got every penny that was due to them.  If the particular worsened conditions that they complained of had been applicable to themselves only, and if they could have made the case that there was some victimisation or discrimination or some marking them out for worse treatment than their colleagues, then undoubtedly there would have been grounds for complaint.  But they would not accept the conditions that those who remained on in the Irish Civil Service did accept. They had resort to the courts and they got added years and increased pensions built on these added years of national service.  They have had increased pensions since they retired.</P>
    <P>I met representatives of these people recently and I made an offer to them&mdash; not that I thought that offer would be seriously considered.  I did offer them that I would go back over the years <Col N="2129" /> and re-assess their pensions as if they had not taken Article 10 terms but had just gone out like an ordinary civil servant.  I said I would have to make some calculation of the benefits they got in the years between.  They would not have that at all; they nearly ran out of the room.  They wanted the Article 10 rates increased by what we are giving to the people who did not get Article 10 conditions.  These people, rather than being at a disadvantage over the years, have had a considerable advantage.  It looks as if the current is setting a little against them at the moment.  They put up the plea that the cost of living is affecting them.  The cost of living has the same effect on both classes, but the Article 10 people had a better protection, whatever the cost of living has been over the years; they have had that protection over all the years.</P>
    <P>I have examined cases without the slightest trace of resentment or animosity. I may say I have no sympathy with them.  The more their case is examined the less justification appears for the claim that they make.  Whatever their position is, they placed themselves in that position under the old Act. Over the years it was a very favourable position, but they are not inclined to weigh that in the balance.  I do not think they have any case and I do not intend to spend any more time or waste any more sympathy on them.</P>
    <P>I have been asked with regard to people who are over £450.  It does seem somewhat anomalous that we should stop at that point.  I am not speaking now with my mind riveted entirely on increased pension legislation, but, where people are being dealt with, and where there are classes to be considered, it is always the people at the lower end of the scale who get the better treatment.  That is the case here.  I cannot say cold-bloodedly that where there is a certain amount allowed for compensation I thought of dividing it out.  We take two or three ways of arriving at a sum that we think would meet whatever hardship there might be on pensioners through an increase in the cost of living and we calculate in order to see how it could best be divided.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2130" /> The teachers were a complication. The position of the teachers forced us away from a calculation based entirely on the cost of living and into association with a new cost-of-living figure. The case of the teacher pensioners drove us to this matter of the 50 per cent. in the low ranges.  There were examples of pension increases granted in other countries that fell for comparison. When I was speaking with my colleagues I did refer to the legislation passed in England.  At no time in England did they give any increase equal to the 50 per cent. that we give. They also made a distinction between the married pensioners in that group. They took into consideration the single man with something in the nature of a dependent and they had a different scale for the single pensioners without dependents.</P>
    <P>In the first legislation they had a ceiling of £300 with regard to married men and £225 in the case of single men. In their latest legislation they have raised these ceilings to £450 for the married men or the single men with dependents and £350 for the single men without dependents.  The civil servant did get alternative conditions.  I am not speaking with the greatest possible precision on this matter, because I have not had it under consideration for long.  Once the civil servant went above £400 the highest rate of increase given to him was 10 per cent. and it was scaled down to 7½ and 5 per cent. when you got to the £600 pensioners. In England they have a means test and they do not allow the pension to rise to these high points.</P>
    <P>When I look at the group who are excluded here because of the £450 ceiling, there are a number of people classified as members of the judiciary, Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries and more or less people of that type.  Outside that group there are a certain number of civil servants and a very small number of the Garda, but the average pension of the civil servant and of the Garda omitted from this is £600 a year.  There are some lower and some higher, but that is the average. If I adopted anything like the English method I would be giving these people 5 or 6 per cent., but I would have to <Col N="2131" /> subtract from that somewhere else.  We thought it better to have this ceiling.</P>
    <P>There is no great logic in the matter. The cost of living has its impact on the man with £500 in much the same way, I suppose, as it has upon the man with half that sum; but the man with £500 has a little more slack to gather in than has the man on the £200 mark. That is a calculation that did enter into our considerations.</P>
    <P>The case was raised of a junior assistant mistress who retired since 1946. That being so, she is ruled by the 1946 legislation and, even if she did merge into this, she would be ruled by the maximum given under the 1946 legislation. There are two overriding standards in that.  One is the £450 ceiling. The other is that nobody can do better than the 1947 code which related to 1946 conditions.  Therefore, that lady could not have done better than she has done.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 10:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (7).</P>
      <P>The Minister proposes in sub-section (7) of Section 7 that a member of the board shall, as a condition of his appointment, sell or otherwise dispose of any securities he may hold in any transport undertaking.  I am not quite clear why the Minister thinks that provision necessary in relation to this particular board.  It is quite true that under the 1944 Act the chairman, the only member of the Córas Iompair Éireann board appointed by the Government, was required to dispose of any Córas Iompair Éireann or other transport stock he might hold and prohibited from acquiring such stock during his term of office.  The circumstances which, in my opinion, required the insertion of that provision in that Bill do not operate in relation to this board.</P>
      <P>The board of Córas Iompair Éireann, was, as to the great majority of its members, composed of directors elected by the stockholders.  Their responsibility was to the stockholders and they were dependent for their reelection upon the manner in which they served the stockholders.  The chairman was appointed as a representative of the Government with the direct responsibility of protecting the public interest in the management of the concern against, if necessary, the narrower financial interests of the stockholders' representatives and it was clearly desirable, therefore, that the chairman should not himself have any personal interest in the concern and particularly in the size, if any, of the dividend paid on the common stock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this particular case the whole of the board will be appointed by the Government.  It does not appear to me <Col N="2133" /> to be desirable that the members of the board should have a financial interest in the transport stock issued by the Government to finance the concern. In fact it might even be argued that it would be an advantage if the members of the board had such a financial interest so that they would be the more concerned with the financial results of their operations.  However, I put in the amendment merely to give the Minister an opportunity of explaining why he thought the provision necessary, assuming that he has not decided, on noting my amendment, to delete the sub-section.</P>
    <P>I may say that I am the more surprised that the Minister thought it necessary to impose this restriction upon the members of the proposed board in view of the fact that he had not proposed to place a similar restriction where it is far more necessary to have it, namely on the members to be appointed to the transport tribunal which a later amendment of the Minister's suggests should be established. I think it is obviously desirable that the members of the transport tribunal should be free of all financial interest in Córas Iompair Éireann, or any other transport concern. Yet, no such restriction is intended to be placed upon the members of the tribunal.  If the Minister sees good reason why this provision should be retained in relation to the members of the board, then I suggest to him that he should consider the desirability of having a similar provision in relation to the members of the transport tribunal.  In my view&mdash;I do not intend to argue it very strongly&mdash;it is unnecessary to have a restriction of this kind and it may operate to make it slightly more difficult for the Minister to get on this board people with the requisite experience in the operation of transport concerns.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this sub-section should be retained.  I have listened to Deputy Lemass explaining why he put a somewhat similar provision into the 1944 Act so far as the chairman was concerned.  But the section in the present Bill does not refer only to transport stock.  It also refers to securities held in any transport undertaking in the State.  If we refer to the general <Col N="2134" /> powers of the board we find that under sub-section (3) of Section 12 they are empowered to enter into agreements with persons carrying on business as carriers of passengers or merchandise. As a matter of public policy, I think it would be objectionable that a contract should be made between the new board and a transport undertaking to carry on certain transport operations if a member of that board had any interest in the particular undertaking.  This may appear to be far-fetched, but many of these provisos are merely put in for the sake of ensuring public confidence. From that point of view I think it should be retained.  Because of the important role this board will play in the industrial and economic life of the country, I think we would almost be justified in calling upon the members of the board to sever any interest they might have in any industrial undertaking.  Quite clearly, the operations of the board and its decisions will have either a beneficial or a harmful effect on many industrial undertakings, if such decisions are taken in an arbitrary manner.  It seems to me that the section does not rest on the question of the holding of transport stock which was largely, I gathered from Deputy Lemass, the basis on which the limitation was placed on the chairman under the 1944 Act.  In this case it refers to both transport stock and interest in a transport undertaking. If there is power given to the board to enter into a contract for the carrying on of transport activities in any other part of the State, it should be clearly laid down that a member of the board would not be entitled to hold any interest in a general manner in these undertakings.  From that point of view I think the section should be changed.</P>

      <P>I suggest that a middle course be taken.  I agree with Deputy Lemass.  I can see the difficulty he points out in regard to other undertakings. I would suggest that the Minister might remove from the sub-section any reference to transport stock.  That, I think, would meet the case that has been made by Deputy Lemass&mdash;a case which I think is very fair.  I do not see how there can be any possible objection <Col N="2135" /> to a member of the board holding transport stock.  Deputy Lemass said that it would even be an advantage that they should, because it would give them a greater interest, if necessary, and it would also make it easier, possibly, for the Minister to find suitable members for the board.  There is no point in arguing at great length on a small matter.  I would suggest that the Minister remove from the sub-section references to transport stock and leave the prohibition of interest in other transport undertakings.</P>

      <P>I think Deputy Larkin has touched on the vital part of this section, namely, that a member of the board ought not to have any interest in any other transport concern. I think there have been some complaints in regard to that type of matter already.  If a member of the board has transport stock, in the ordinary way it would appear to be an advantage because it would show that he had some confidence himself in the undertaking and, because he had that confidence in it, he could be depended upon to do his work properly.  But there is a further consideration.  If a person has stock of that type in a concern, his viewpoint may be that the concern of the stockholder is paramount and, although the Bill provides for a Government guarantee, I visualise the board that will be established as endeavouring, in as far as they can, to avoid calling on the Government for that guarantee.  Consequently, if members of the board are to have any substantial holding of stock, they may endeavour to maintain the dividends by means of depriving the workers engaged in the industry of rights or wages to which they may be entitled. I think the Minister is wise in putting the section there so that there can be no possible charge on any of the grounds mentioned against any member of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At first sight, when I looked at the section, I said to myself that anyone who holds transport stock in Córas Iompair Éireann should never be appointed a member of the board.  That view resulted from what I might call a completely different approach.  From <Col N="2136" /> my own personal knowledge of the operation of concerns such as this I think that it is wise to have this prohibition and I think the section should remain in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I think myself that it is not merely desirable but that it is almost essential that these safeguards or restrictions contained in the section should be there.  Deputy Lemass knows himself that there is a somewhat similar restriction in the Electricity Supply Board Act in respect of that.  Personally, I do not think that everybody will agree that, in respect of persons who will be appointed to the membership of this board, there is any great hardship in requiring them to do what the section requires.  I should say that I think the Deputy will find, in relation to the proposed transport tribunal, that the same point is covered in amendment No. 101 which refers back.  In that way we are imposing similar restrictions in relation to the proposed transport tribunal.  I do not think the Deputy proposes to press this amendment or feels very strongly about it.  I think he will agree&mdash;now that he has heard the arguments&mdash;that it is not merely desirable but essential, particularly from the point of view, as Deputy Larkin said, of obtaining public confidence in a board such as this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a few observations to make on the section.  This is a section which deals with the remuneration, with the conditions of appointment and with other matters affecting members of the board.  In view of what the Minister said earlier to the <Col N="2137" /> effect that he has not yet made up his mind whether the members of the board are to be whole-time or part-time it would not be reasonable to ask him to inform the House as to the remuneration he has in mind for members of the board and I do not propose to do it at this stage.</P>
      <P>Sub-section (3) of this section, however, refers to the Second Schedule. Deputies who turn to the Second Schedule will see that it provides for the payment of pensions to members of the board after ten years' service.  I should like the Minister to know now that in our view it is desirable only to provide for pensions for members who are appointed to the board in a whole-time capacity and that if it is contemplated that part-time directors, remunerated on a fee basis like directors of commercial concerns, are also qualified for pensions under the provisions of that Schedule, we would be completely opposed to it.  If the Minister can inform the Dáil before the Report Stage as to the probable Government decision on the nature and composition of the board&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We can consider the Schedule in that regard when we come to it.  There are one or two other points which are really more drafting points than anything else.  Sub-section (4), paragraph (a), says that the Government may at any time remove from office any member of the board who has become incapable through ill-health of performing efficiently his duties as such member.  I should imagine that the question whether a member is incapable of performing his duties through ill-health is one upon which a conflict of medical opinion could arise. It seems to me desirable that there should be inserted there words similar to those which are contained in the next paragraph which would make it clear that the opinion of the Government upon the capability of the member to perform his duties, if liable to ill-health, is all that matters.  Without some such safeguarding phrase, the removal of a member on the grounds <Col N="2138" /> that he is incapable through ill-health of performing his duties may be a cause of contention and perhaps of legal action.</P>
      <P>The other point to which I want to refer relates to sub-section (8).  Sub-section (8) says that a member of the board shall while holding office as such member be disqualified from being nominated or elected and from sitting as a member of Dáil Éireann or Seanad Éireann.  That section is, I know, similar in form to sections in other Acts but I have often wondered whether it would prove effective if it were ever tested.  It will be recollected that on occasions in the past returning officers have held that it is not their duty to inquire whether a person nominated for election is eligible to be nominated or not.  I know there is no effective machinery by which the eligibility of a person for nomination for election can be tested before the election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that the time has come when we might consider changing the form of these sections for the purposes of this Bill and future legislation of this kind, by reversing them and by saying that if a person is nominated or elected, he ceases to be eligible to act on the board.  There could be no question about the ability to give effect to such a sub-section, whereas as it stands it is of somewhat doubtful value.  We could conceivably have, what is I think admitted to be an undesirable situation, namely, a member of the board being nominated for election and pursuing an election campaign in a partisan manner&mdash;a thing which is not desired.  I admit that if he were elected to the Dáil he could be removed from the board under another sub-section but the intention of having the provisions in the Bill is to make it clear that members of these statutory boards are to keep out of partisan political discussions.  That end can be more effectively secured by reversing these sections.  It is not a matter that I intend to press now, but it would be desirable to establish a new precedent in this matter, and to put these sections in the form I have suggested, namely, to declare that any person that is nominated for election <Col N="2139" /> shall be ineligible to remain as a member of the board.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lemass has anticipated the only point which I wished to make in connection with sub-section (8).  I had a note on that very question when the Bill was going through Second Reading as the wording intrigued me to some extent.  The wording is that a member of the board shall, while holding office as such member, be disqualified from being nominated or elected and from sitting as a member of Dáil Éireann or Seanad Éireann.  I could understand a prohibition being placed on a member of this House in so far as the board is concerned, but I think it must be <i>ultra vires</i> the Constitution to attempt to place the embargo at the other end. If a man ceases to be a member of the board, and he wishes to go forward for Parliament I think we are going a little bit too far by this section.  I could understand as Deputy Lemass has indicated that a person who was nominated for election to the Dáil should be ineligible for appointment to the board, but a time might come when a member of the board might wish to go forward as a parliamentary candidate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad this point has cropped up because my attention was drawn to it some years ago.  I feel that the prohibitions with regard to nomination for election to this House should be contained clearly in an Electoral Act and that they should not be spread around amongst Acts of this kind.  I remember coming across a provision similar to this in the old Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Act and it was one of those which used to worry me personally, being a member of the Reserve. I had to consider whether I was validly nominated at all.  However, I used to take a chance.  Certain members of the House did take a chance and, immediately they were elected, resigned from the Defence Forces. <Col N="2140" /> That point always worried me and I am delighted that Deputy O'Sullivan and Deputy Lemass have drawn attention to it.  I think that what the Minister should do is to prohibit any person from being a member of the board who permits himself to be nominated for election to the Dáil or Seanad.  That should automatically end his membership of the board.</P>
      <P>In regard to the other matter mentioned by Deputy Lemass it is provided that each member of the board appointed by the Government shall hold office on such terms and conditions as shall be fixed by the Government at the time of his appointment. I think it just as well to reiterate that it is my view that membership of the board should be whole-time and that consequently payments to members of the board should be substantial payments because, as has been said here, this is probably one of the biggest undertakings in the State. These six members appointed by the Government will have a tremendous responsibility and we must attract to the board the very best brains in the country.  The fixing of niggardly salaries will not induce the very best and most efficient persons to accept appointment to the board.  I should like when the Government is considering this matter that they should feel that they have behind them the general support of the Dáil in making the conditions of service and the pay so attractive that the most efficient, the most competent and ablest people in the country will be anxious to accept appointment as members of the board.</P>

      <P>There is one small point which I should like the Minister to consider and that is in paragraph 2 of sub-section (4) which refers to the absence of a member of the board and says that the Government may remove him when he is absent for a period of six months unless his explanation is considered satisfactory.  I would be intrigued to learn why the period should be six months.  I am not suggesting that the Minister or the Government would be satisfied to allow a member to absent himself for six months, but this gives the impression <Col N="2141" /> at least that the Government will not be perturbed if a member of this very important board absents himself for six months.  It does not say a certain number of meetings, but a period of six months.  This board may conceivably meet once a week and such a member may be absent from 26 meetings. There may, indeed, be additional meetings held.  Normally, if a person is absent from three or five meetings of a board he is generally regarded as disqualified.  Why a man should be entitled to sit on a board who absents himself possibly from 26 meetings is something that I should like to know. It is an unusual period to stand over in public.  I think that we should either reduce the period or make reference to the actual number of meetings.</P>

My attention was drawn to that matter also.  I did not advert to it myself when reading the Bill.  Whether it was an extraordinary coincidence that a number of different people spotted this at the same time or that Deputy Lemass spotted it and mentioned it to somebody else who passed on the word, I do not know.  However, when my attention was drawn to it, it struck me that it was a rather odd way of putting the position.  Obviously, the suggestion made by Deputy Lemass is quite a sensible one and one which I think should be met by the Minister.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I might clear up that point in case other Deputies may think that this is the first time that words like these appeared in a Bill or an Act.  It is not. Section 5 of the Tourist Traffic Act, 1939, provides:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Every member of the board shall, while holding office as such member, be disqualified from being nominated or elected to and from sitting or receiving payment as a member of Dáil Éireann or of Seanad Éireann.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 12:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1) to delete paragraph (b).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I tabled this amendment because I was intrigued by the extraordinary construction of the section.  If I may summarise it, I think I will make my point clear.  Sub-section (1) says that the board shall have power to operate transport services, to consign merchandise, to enter into agreements for the carriage of passengers and merchandise at through rates, to store merchandise, to carry on any hotel or place of refreshment and to provide amenities and facilities for passengers. Then note this: &ldquo;to exercise such other powers as are vested in, or conferred on, the board by this Act&rdquo;. Immediately under that is this: &ldquo;The powers conferred by paragraph (a) of this sub-section&rdquo;,&mdash;that is all the <Col N="2143" /> powers which I have enumerated&mdash;&ldquo;may be exercised within or without the State&rdquo;, including, as I make it, those enumerated in sub-paragraph (vii), &ldquo;such other powers as are vested in, or conferred on, the board by this Act&rdquo;.  If we turn to sub-section (2), we find that there are other powers conferred on the board, and I assume the effect of paragraph (b) is to provide that the powers enumerated in sub-section (2) may not be carried on outside the State, despite the provision of sub-paragraph (vii) of sub-section (1).</P>
    <P>I cannot quite see why paragraph (b) is there at all.  Anyone who reads the powers set out in sub-section (2) will realise that some of these must be carried on outside the State; for example, the purchase of equipment which is enumerated in sub-paragraph (b) of sub-section (2).  Many of the other things which are indicated there appear to me to be functions which must be carried on outside the State. I was proposing to delete the words &ldquo;or without&rdquo; because it seems to me that they serve no purpose except to confuse the meaning of the section for anybody who reads it.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I had better repeat that as the Minister was otherwise engaged. Certain powers are set out in sub-section (1), paragraph (a).  Paragraph (b) says that these powers may be exercised within or without the State. Other powers are enumerated in sub-section (2).  The implication of paragraph (b) of sub-section (1) appears to mean that the powers under sub-section (1) may not be carried on without the State.  There must be some reason why it is necessary to provide that the powers set out in sub-section (1) may be carried on outside the State.  I am anxious to get the position clarified. It seems to me that the paragraph might be read to mean that only the powers in sub-section (1) could be carried on outside the State and that the powers of sub-section (2) may not be carried out.  If it is intended that these powers should be exercised by the board in the way in which it is necessary to exercise them, it appears to me that paragraph (b) is unnecessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">

      <P>It may have that appearance, but I am quite satisfied that that is not so, that it is necessary to have paragraph (b) with the others. There may be a set of circumstances in the future which we are trying to provide for here.</P>

      <P>If the Minister has in mind that in future the board shall operate transport services outside the State, then it seems to me that that would be secured even if the section was drafted without paragraph (b).  If it does have to carry on transport services outside the State, then it will always have to exercise a lot of the activities enumerated in sub-section (2).  It does not seem to me that the inclusion of paragraph (b) serves any purpose.  If that is so, it is clearly desirable to delete it because at some stage there may be five or six lawyers drawing fat briefs arguing what exactly the appearance of that paragraph in the sub-section means.</P>

      <P>I can see what the Minister and the drafters of this measure visualised in putting in the sub-section, but it seems to be isolated in the place where it is.  It is like a lone orphan thrown in there.  I would much prefer to see a deliberate section put into the Bill giving whatever authority the Minister considers may be necessary if certain things happen with regard to across the Border, or beyond the Border, operation of transport. I think Deputy Lemass is right in drawing attention to the very peculiar place in which this sub-section is put in.  I would be satisfied if the Minister would undertake to examine the matter and see whether a specific section cannot be put in somewhere in the Bill.  In its present place it suggests that the powers in sub-section (1), paragraph (a) may be operated within the State.  Clearly, there is no necessity to say that, because when this Bill becomes an Act it will be operated within the State.  Therefore, these words would seem to be unnecessary. If we clear off that dead timber, we are left with this &ldquo;that the powers conferred in this sub-section may be exercised without the State.&rdquo;  Now the word &ldquo;without&rdquo; is a very uncouth one.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 13:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In sub-section (2), paragraph (e), after the word &ldquo;tenancy&rdquo; in line 25 to add the following:&mdash;&ldquo;and to <Col N="2147" /> purchase houses for its employees and/or to make loans for the purchase of houses by its employees.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister will be aware that for a considerable time there has been an intensified drive in the matter of house building.  It is interesting to know that a number of our larger industrial firms have evinced a keen interest in this problem and have entered into negotiations for the purchase of sites for houses, as well as making available to their staffs certain facilities for the purchase of these houses.</P>
    <P>With that in mind, we felt that it would be a calamity if Córas Iompair Éireann, the largest employers in the country, were not in line with that very commendable enterprise. For years past it was an old custom with the railway companies to provide, particularly at their larger depôts, houses for their employees.  The idea was that there would be accommodation available for types of employees who needed it by reason of the fact that they had to take duty on early morning trains or arrived home late at night.</P>
    <P>Members of the House may be aware of certain colonies of houses dotted around various towns where there are large railway depôts.  Recently, I understand, it was the policy of the company to dispose of that property. I am not going to question the wisdom or otherwise of that course except to say that the tenants of the houses were considered in so far as they might purchase these houses.  Having regard to the general housing question and the interest that has been aroused in it, it would be desirable if Córas Iompair Éireann reverted to the old practice of making a contribution for housing in respect of their employees at the larger depôts.</P>
    <P>I will express a preference for that portion of the amendment which states that it might be possible for the new concern to make arrangements whereby staffs would be enabled to purchase their houses.  The Minister may say that that would be a colossal and almost impossible task for the company to undertake because of its heavy financial commitments and seeing there are 21,000 employees involved.  If he puts <Col N="2148" /> that point of view, I am prepared to agree that it is not a suitable time to suggest that the company should set out to provide 21,000 houses.  I may say that already there are facilities, through local authorities, as distinct from the company, by means of the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act, to provide houses that may be required. The Minister was a member of a local authority and he knows that that very excellent Act, which is doing such fine work, is not compulsory in its application and there are instances throughout the country where local authorities declined to operate the beneficial clauses of that Act.</P>
    <P>I am trying to anticipate what the Minister might say in connection with these facilities&mdash;that it may happen in certain districts that transport men would not have the facilities which we are now seeking.  I ask the Minister to line up with other large employers in the country and make some gesture under this heading.  I recognise that there will be financial limitations for a considerable period and that it would be impossible to provide for all the applicants, but at least we might have a gesture, a certain amount appropriated to each area such as Cork, Galway, Sligo or Mullingar.  A certain amount might be appropriated for a limited number of areas by the company by way of loan under conditions that would make it easy for the staff to carry out the purchase of their houses.</P>
    <P>We are asking the Minister in this amendment to make some gesture that will help a limited number of the 21,000 where they may be stymied by insurance companies or where they may find it difficult even with the local authority to get the credit they need.  A company like this can do what employers in Dublin are doing&mdash;they can make deductions from the pay of their employees. That will be an easy way for the individual to pay back whatever loan he gets.  I am trying to get the Minister's sympathy in this matter. Perhaps he will be in a position to say that when the company is in a better position they could do as I suggest. The main point is to give them the power, when a suitable time arrives, to <Col N="2149" /> make this gesture towards solving the housing problems that face their employees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy will agree that, having regard to the financial position of the company and what its financial position is likely to be for some time ahead, any gesture I could make would be a very empty gesture.  I think it would be entirely unreal, and a complete ignoring of the facts of the present situation and the situation for a considerable time to come, if we were to put any obligation on the company to lend money or to purchase houses for their employees.  They have certain powers in that connection.  As the Deputy told us, they have provided houses in the past.  There is nothing in this Bill to prevent them continuing that, if and when they are in a position to do it. But to make a gesture such as the Deputy has suggested would be entirely unreal and would be holding out to the employees hopes which we have no right to hold out.</P>
      <P>So far as I am concerned I could not agree to put something into this Bill which might be regarded almost as an obligation on the board to provide very substantial sums when, in fact, they have not got the money.  There is no use in saying that they would be expected to provide money for only a small number of their 21,000 employees. Every one of the 21,000 would have an equal right and claim on the company. I could not accept the amendment.  I do not think it would do any good.  It would be entirely unreal and we would be ignoring the facts of the situation.</P>

That may arise also over parts of the Córas Iompair Éireann system and I presume that if the extension of the activities of the company or the development of its manufacturing or other work in particular districts requires that housing accommodation should be provided for workers, they can provide it.</P>
      <P>I am surprised this question was raised.  I had sent to me this morning, free of charge, an excellently produced pamphlet, probably produced by the Labour Party or Clann na Poblachta, or both in combination, which would seem to suggest that there is no housing problem.</P>

      <P>We are creating a new board now and giving that board certain powers.  The Minister has made those powers as extensive as possible. Deputy O'Sullivan proposes an additional power.  It is not mandatory; it is purely permissive.  If in four or five years' time the transport company is in a good sound financial position and may wish to exercise this particular power by making houses available for their employees, I think the Minister would either have to make new powers under Section 13 or come in here for an amendment.  We all agree this power cannot be operated for a considerable time.  There is no harm in putting it in the Bill.  I think it is a very desirable power.</P>

Seeing that it would be permissive, no harm would be done. I believe this amendment would have a good effect psychologically and I think the Minister should accept it.</P>

      <P>The Minister's main objection to accepting the amendment is that it is unreal.  I suggest to the Minister that he might make a gesture. I have on my left here, Alderman Byrne, and on my right a number of members of the local authority here who are interested in the housing of newly-weds, particularly in the City of Dublin.  Without any advertisement we had a position recently where 2,000 people applied for such proposed houses.  No member of the Dublin Corporation would regard this as an unreal gesture.  I am aware that powers already exist for the building of houses.  I am not at all interested in the question of the company building houses for its employees as such.  I have known railway men who, on retirement from the company's service, had to give up occupation of their houses. Some of them had lived in them for 20 or 25 years.  Everyone knows how difficult it is to find alternative accommodation. I think this power should be given to the new company.  It would be welcomed by the staff.  I can see nothing objectionable in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment does not appeal to me at all.  We are not facing the actual position of the national transport undertaking when we talk about an amendment like this. This amendment could only be <Col N="2153" /> operated effectively by the employment of very large sums of money.  Putting such an amendment into this Bill will only raise false hopes.  I am sorry to say that it is my belief that the company will not be in a position for a long time to implement such an amendment as this, to engage in the purchase of houses for resale to their employees, for letting to their employees or for the advancing of loans.  I said earlier that I hoped we could discuss this whole question frankly.</P>
      <P>I venture to suggest that if that were in the Bill pressure would be brought to bear on the board to implement that and to give effect to it before they would be in a position to provide the money or that the money would have to be diverted from some other purpose to give effect to this section.  Is it not quite true to say, quite frankly, that regard is not always had to the financial position of this undertaking when demands are being made on it?  Frankly I would see no objection whatever to the suggestion and, as a matter of fact, I would welcome it.  I should like to see it as one of the features of the board's operations that it would, to the fullest extent to which its financial position would allow, play its full part in housing its own employees, and I should like to see every other firm in the country doing the same thing.

      <P>I am beginning to lose confidence altogether so far as this Bill is concerned.  I might practically say that we Deputies are not facing up to our responsibilities at all.  I have always had the greatest admiration for the contributions which Deputy O'Sullivan made in this House but I think that this amendment is just asking for too much.  Consider the position of this company.  It has been bankrupt. It is only able to keep going by the <Col N="2155" /> grant of millions of pounds subscribed, in many cases, by the poor men on the bog and on the mountainside.  All that is being ignored and the company is to be asked to make grants to enable its employees to buy houses.  On the question of treating all citizens equally, by what stretch of imagination can a railway worker call upon this company at the country's expense to buy a house for him, any more than for any other citizen?  Can he not avail of the facilities that appertain at the moment?  Surely Deputy O'Sullivan is aware that under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts a tenant of a house may apply to the local authority for a capital sum that will enable him to buy his house from the private landlord.</P>
      <P>Is that not so?  That we should seek to create false hopes in the minds of the railway workers, considering the present position of the company is, I think, very foolish.  What I should like to do is to call the 15,000 or 20,000 employees of Córas Iompair Éireann together&mdash;from the general manager down to the humblest worker&mdash;and instil into the mind of each one of them an appreciation of the difficult position in which the company finds itself at the moment.  I would impress upon them that it would require all the co-operation and the best exertions on the part of each one of them to keep this concern going.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 14:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2), paragraph (i), line 44, to insert after the word &ldquo;insurance&rdquo; the words &ldquo;or otherwise.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not familiar with the rules of legal interpretation.  I do not know to what extent the definition of the powers of the board in the extended form in which they appear in this section has a limiting effect upon it. Deputies who will have compared this Bill with the 1944 Transport Act will have noted that in 1944 we did not think it necessary to set out in paragraphs of this kind the powers of Córas Iompair Éireann.  In fact, the 1944 Act said merely that the company shall operate transport services and carry on any ancillary and supplementary business.  It seems to me that that is all that is required.  Perhaps the Minister would have been wiser to recast the section&mdash;(1) the board <Col N="2157" /> shall have power to operate transport services and, as in accordance with paragraph (k) of sub-section (2) of the section to do all other things which, in the opinion of the board, are calculated to facilitate the proper carrying on of the business of the board.</P>
    <P>If I am right, however, in assuming that the rules of interpretation have the effect of limiting the powers of the board when they are set out in this extended paragraph, then we must be concerned with the wording of the paragraph.  Paragraph (j) empowers the board to make payments towards insurance for the benefit of all or any of its employees.  Córas Iompair Éireann at present makes payments under its welfare scheme for the benefit of its employees but the company are not making payments towards an insurance scheme or otherwise than directly out of revenue for the purpose of providing these benefits.  It might be argued subsequently that the insertion of the words &ldquo;towards insurance&rdquo; after the word &ldquo;payments&rdquo; would have the effect of limiting the power of the board to making payments for the benefit of employees only in the form of contributions to some insurance scheme.  I am sure that that is not what is intended.  I assume that the existing welfare scheme is not likely to be departed from.</P>

      <P>I am not clear about that at all.  Clause (h) is a similar section to that contained in the 1944 Act which Deputy Davin thought at one time contained some secret scheme of my own to establish company unions but which in fact was intended to enable the company to assist institutions such as the Inchicore Club, which is maintained by the company to provide recreation and restaurant facilities for its employees.  It may be that clause (h) also covers the point I have in mind, but I am submitting this amendment in order to ensure that the point will be examined as to whether the effect of the words &ldquo;towards insurance&rdquo;, will limit the powers of the <Col N="2158" /> company in the matter of making payments for these purposes.  I think these words would be better out.  I think the purpose of the paragraph would be clearer with the words out. If they are not to be taken out, some such words as Deputy O'Sullivan suggests should be inserted or, as I suggest in my amendment, after the words &ldquo;insurance&rdquo; the words &ldquo;or otherwise&rdquo; should be added so that we shall avoid the danger of a query being raised at some stage as to the powers of the company to continue these payments.</P>

      <P>I am advised the amendment is entirely unnecessary and that this matter is already adequately covered.  Clause (h) seems to cover everything&mdash;&ldquo;to establish and support or aid in the establishment and support of, associations, clubs, institutions, funds, trusts and conveniences calculated to promote the welfare of its employees or ex-employees and the dependents or relatives of such employees or ex-employees.&rdquo;  I think that this clause should be read in conjunc tion with the other clause but if there is any doubt about it we can have it looked into.</P>

      <P>I want to draw attention to the company's welfare scheme under which benefits were paid in sickness and in certain other circumstances. There is a welfare scheme but there is no fund; the company pays these benefits as circumstances arise. The contributions towards trusts, institutions or funds do not refer to that scheme at all.</P>

      <P>There is this sole argument in favour of the amendments. Paragraph (h) gives authority to establish and support or aid in the establishment and support of these institutions, funds or trusts.  Clause (i) deals with the making of payments and it might be contended that the establishment, support or aiding did not include the making of payments.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to amendment No. 15, is the Minister satisfied that there is provision in the Bill to meet the point I have already raised in connection with increased pensions?  If he can say there is, there will be no necessity to make the case.  Anyway the case briefly is that a number of men have retired within the last five years and, strange <Col N="2160" /> though it may seem to the House, having retired on small salaries they have got no increase whatsoever in their pensions to meet the increased cost of living, such as has been given in the case of civil servants and employees of local authorities.  I do happen to know that the chairman and board of the company are anxious to meet that position if they are permitted to do so. Naturally those concerned are interested lest this Bill might pass through the House without such a provision, and although the company might be desirous of doing something, eventually they might find that they would not have the power to do so.  That is the reason the amendment is put down. There is general acceptance outside the House that something should be done for these people and I think the point at issue is whether the new board would have the power to attend to the matter.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>When I moved this motion demanding an increase in the contribution for rural improvements schemes from 75 to 90 per cent. I had in my mind the same thought as many Deputies who have spoken in favour of the motion, and that was that it may be unfair to place the people who live in the poorer parts, or, in other on the same basis as the people who live in the richer parts, or, in other words, to expect the small congested landowners along the western seaboard to contribute as much money as the more well-to-do people who live in the richer parts of the country.  But, having a certain amount of experience in dealing with Governments of every kind, both in opposition and as a supporter of the Government, I have found that it is very rarely that anybody who looks for any concession with regard to money matters succeeds in getting the actual amount he looks for. Having that in mind, I decided to seek for a 90 per cent. grant for everybody as, if any knuckling down had to be done, if the scheme submitted by the Parliamentary Secretary was satisfactory, I would be only too willing to accept such a scheme, especially if I thought it would be just and fair to those people who are most in need or who are unable to contribute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In fairness to the Parliamentary Secretary I will say that, while the scheme he is supposed to implement in the coming year may not agree entirely with what I should like to have or what I expected, it is a vast improvement so far as the people who expect to benefit by this motion are concerned and so far as I am concerned, because those who are in a better financial position should be made to pay more and those who are not so well off financially should be treated more lightly.  I welcome the suggestion by the Parliamentary Secretary that it might be possible in these rural improvement schemes to allow a grant of 100 per cent. in the poorer areas, and that in some cases it may possibly be <Col N="2162" /> 95 per cent., because that is from 5 to 10 per cent. more than I asked for in the motion.  He also stated that he intended to hold rigidly to the 75 per cent. and that this would not be reduced for those who were financially better off.</P>
    <P>After being some 18 months or so in office, the Parliamentary Secretary says he is determined to recast the whole scheme; that he always regarded the rural improvements scheme as administered as a rich man's scheme.  If he had these ideas in his mind for such a long time, he should have recast the rural improvements scheme during the past year.  If my motion has not done any good in one way it has done an immense amount of good in another way, because it has given the Parliamentary Secretary an opportunity to make up his mind to do what I claim should have been done at least a year ago.  However, as he has decided to give the concessions I have mentioned and that he spoke of in the debate, that is satisfactory and will suit the constituency which I represent more than any other constituency.</P>
    <P>When we come to debate a motion such as this, we have Deputies on all sides of the House giving a certain amount of encouragement, but there is also a certain amount of criticism thrown at it.  The chief critic of the motion was, of course, Deputy Childers, who said that he was amazed at the smallness of the demand made in the motion and proceeded to point out that various 100 per cent. grants were given by the Fianna Fáil Government. At a later stage, however, it was found that during the time when he said so many such grants were given only one full 100 per cent. grant had been given for a scheme in County Cork.  Since the change of Government, the Parliamentary Secretary can boast that during his term of office in dealing with special employment schemes he has given four full-cost grants amounting to almost six or seven times anything which was given before.</P>
    <P>Of course, Deputy Corry can always find defects in any good scheme put up by anybody other than himself.  He told us that he was amazed at the <Col N="2163" /> smallness of the demand made in the motion.  There were many years in which Deputy Corry could have moved a motion similar to this when his Party was in power and when, as he often told us, he had great influence over Ministers and the Government as a whole.  If the Government whom he supported were as anxious to help out people in rural Ireland as the members of the present Government, Deputy Corry could then have done a very good day's work in getting an 85, 90 or 95 per cent. grant for the people of rural Ireland, just as I and Deputy Beirne have succeeded in doing with this motion.  Of course, the Deputy always prefers to complain.  He reminds me of the American who always complained of the heat of the summer and, when winter came, stoked up his furnace so much that he complained even more of the heat.  He complained that the grant was not bigger, but in years gone by there was no effort made by him to get any benefit for the people he was supposed to represent or was supposed to be anxious to help.</P>
    <P>Another exhibition which amused me very much was given by Deputy Childers, who suddenly found after 16 years that there were such things in this country as cul-de-sac roads.  When I was in opposition and tried with members of my Party to bring to the notice of Deputy Childers, as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government, that we were gravely concerned with the condition of the cul-de-sac roads, we received very little consideration or sympathy from him.  Everybody who was in the Dáil at that time knows that Deputy Childers's chief concern was the laying down of 60-feet wide roads for motor cars and heavy traffic, and that those living on the cul-de-sac roads were only given a meagre 75 per cent. grant.  Now we have the same Deputy telling us of the terrible concern he has for the 20,000 or 30,000 miles of cul-de-sac roads which this motion is intended to benefit.</P>
    <P>If some of the people who now shed tears over the conditions of people living on cul-de-sac roads had decided, when they had the power, to come to <Col N="2164" /> the assistance of those people, would not things be very much better than they are?  There would be more sincerity in the man who would stand up in the Dáil and say that he had an interest in and was anxious to help those people out.  It seems, of course, that as times change people change. They now begin to realise that there are such things as cul-de-sac roads, that important people live on them and have to be taken care of.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy of West Cork made what I thought were some useful suggestions on the motion.  His speech was short, but I agreed with very much of what he said.  He pointed out, as I did in my opening speech, that there are people who can pay, and people who cannot pay, a contribution of 25 per cent.  Deputy S. Collins followed on the same lines.  His constituency, if not as poor as mine, is somewhat similar to it.  Nevertheless, the conditions there may be bad.  Each of these Deputies was most anxious that a scheme with a sliding scale contribution should be brought forward and encouraged.  The guarantee given by the Parliamentary Secretary was quite satisfactory as far as I am concerned. I can assure Deputies that, when I stand up here, I will advocate the same concessions for the large farmer as for the small farmer.  Everyone knows the respect that I have for the big farmer. I do not put him in the same grade as the small farmer who is more industrious. The latter has to struggle harder to eke out a livelihood.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowan made a very useful contribution.  He was slightly out as far as the money for this motion is concerned.  He pointed out that, if £100,000 was spent on these schemes last year, all that was necessary in order to make the schemes satisfactory for the people concerned was an extra £15,000.  I would like to point out to him and to the Parliamentary Secretary that, when we get the schemes promised by the Parliamentary Secretary and when his guarantee comes into operation, there will be greater demands from the people for such schemes.  Many more applications will be coming in and so much more money will be wanted to implement them and <Col N="2165" /> to supplement the money already there.  Much more, I think, will be required than £10,000, £15,000 or £20,000 to supplement the £100,000 already there.  I shall keep a very close eye on the Estimate when it is presented setting out the amount of money that is to be spent on these schemes in the coming year.  I intend to see that there will be a large enough sum of money provided to meet the demands of all the schemes that will be submitted, and that are bound to be suitable as rural improvements schemes.  If that is not done, then this motion and the promise given by the Parliamentary Secretary would not be worth a pinch of salt.</P>
    <P>I want to say again, however, that the Parliamentary Secretary has pledged his word.  He has given an assurance that the necessary amount of money will be found.  I can assure him that it will be usefully and beneficially spent so far as the people living on the cul-de-sac roads are concerned. Those people have not the advantages enjoyed by people living on our main highways.  The Local Authorities (Works) Act will take quite a load off the shoulders of the Parliamentary Secretary's Department so far as schemes in regard to drainage are concerned. Everybody realises that, when weather conditions are more favourable, very many useful schemes can be carried through under that particular Act, schemes which would otherwise have to be done by the Department as rural improvements schemes. When that load has been taken off the Department, the money made available for rural improvements schemes can be devoted almost entirely to the repair and upkeep of cul-de-sac roads.  These roads have been forgotten over a long number of years.  Therefore, I say it is the duty of the Government to help out, as far as possible, the people living on them.  So far they have had to exist under conditions which were not a credit to any Government either in the present or in the past.</P>
    <P>Take the case of people living along these cul-de-sac roads or on boreens. If they want to take advantage of modern methods of farming they cannot bring heavy farming machinery <Col N="2166" /> that would be useful in taking the drudgery out of their work, into their land.  In view of that, the people living under such conditions must have felt that the Governments they supported now or in the past did not take much interest in their welfare.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to say that I am fully satisfied with the promise that the Parliamentary Secretary has given that he will increase in certain cases the amount of the grants.  I would have preferred, of course, to get the 90 per cent. contribution in all cases. The money on these schemes will be usefully spent.  No group of individuals would undertake to make a 10 per cent. contribution to any scheme unless they felt that it was definitely wanted and was going to prove useful in their locality.  I do not say that I have succeeded in accomplishing what I set out to achieve.  Deputy Beirne and myself have, however, succeeded in getting from the Government an extra amount of money which will enable more employment to be given in doing useful work in constituencies where that employment is most needed.  Everybody knows that the western counties are more thickly populated than the better off counties.  We have more village roads in the western counties and I can say they are very bad village roads.  It is hoped that more and more money will flow into those areas to help to bring the roads and the drains into a satisfactory condition for the people who live there.</P>
    <P>I will hold the Parliamentary Secretary definitely to the promise he has given, and which I know he will implement. I do not expect that he can delve into the pockets of the Government and produce £5,000, £10,000 or £15,000 between now and Christmas night in order to carry out rural improvements schemes, but when the Estimates come forward I expect he will see to it that the necessary provision is made for the amount required to finance all the schemes which have been approved by his Department and which are so necessary in various parts of the country.</P>
    <P>The getting of £10,000, £20,000, £40,000, or even more from the Government <Col N="2167" /> and expending it in rural Ireland is something which should have been done, not this week, this year, or even last year, but it should have been done 25 years ago.  It is not at this stage that we should be looking for these things.  These schemes should have been carried out long ago and they should be in such a position now that they could be maintained at a lesser cost.  But perhaps it is better late than never, and if this motion has not succeeded in getting all it set out to achieve, at least it has done a very good day's work for the rural community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  Briefly I would like to indicate to the House the origin and the necessity for this Bill. A recent development in tourism here has been the establishment of holiday camps.  There now exist three such camps, one situated at Trabolgan, County Cork, one at Skerries, County Dublin, and Mosney, County Meath. The problem affecting these camps presented itself in a very significant way when one of them made application at the normal period to the Circuit Court for a licence to sell intoxicating liquor. It was then learned that certain difficulties existed in the licensing code which precluded the Circuit Court judge, however willing he might be, from granting a licence to the particular camp.  The purpose of this Bill may be found primarily in the judgment given by Judge Fawsitt when he indicated clearly that the present licensing laws would not permit him to grant a licence to a holiday camp. These large enterprises thereupon found themselves in a difficulty.  I might mention that they have a tremendous employment potential.  On a permanent basis these camps would give employment to no less than 300 persons; and on a seasonal basis they would give employment to at least 1,200 persons for a period of six months.  In the main the type of visitor using these camps is limited in the amount he or she can afford to spend on a holiday. By virtue of the defects in the licensing code, they are precluded from having at their disposal within these camps intoxicating liquor.  Some people might say that there is a latent menace in such a licence.  In the case of one camp I might point out that a Catholic church has been built for its patrons, and there is a resident Catholic chaplain in the camp.  There are visiting chaplains of other denominations. In that way there is adequate supervision so far as the camps are concerned.</P>
      <P>To advert to the difficulty that arose under the licensing system, the learned Circuit Court judge indicated that he would willingly give such a licence if it were in his power to do so.  He suggested that the way was open&mdash;that his suggestion would be that representations should be made to have the law amended so that he would be in a position to grant this licence.</P>

    <P>The Bill itself is simple and straightforward. It purports to give no greater facilities to these holiday camps than <Col N="2171" /> are available to any other licensed premises in the country, in fact, less.  All it does is that once a holiday camp fulfils the statutory requirements laid down in the Act&mdash;that it has residential accommodation for not less than 250 people and that it has a valuation of not less than £200&mdash;it is entitled to get the certificate that it is a holiday camp and, having done that, it is entitled to make an application to the Circult Court for a licence under this Act.</P>
    <P>When I am dealing with the sections of this Bill I shall explain in detail to the Deputies what it actually purports to do.  The condition precedent and the first thing necessary even before you can become an applicant for a licence under this Bill, when it becomes an Act, is that you get a certificate that you have a holiday camp&mdash;and for that purpose you have to fulfil the statuary requirement of having accommodation for not less than 250 residential guests and a valuation of not less than £200.</P>

      <P>I am open to receive suggestions of any type from Deputies that will meet this problem, because this is something that is opening up a field of development and a new potential. I am convinced, and I have reason to be convinced, that at least one further camp in another tourist centre is envisaged if this Bill goes through this House and the provisions become law.  Having fulfilled the statutory conditions of having residential accommodation for 250 guests and a valuation of not less than £200, they can apply to the Circuit Court.  On the issue of the certificate to the effect that they have a holiday camp, they may apply to the Circuit Court for the following things&mdash;a licence for two public bars within the camp and a licence to attach to the portions of the camp that are normally set aside for the serving of meals.  They can serve those drinks within the normal hours laid down for <Col N="2172" /> any publican in any part of Ireland. They have no advantages, good, bad or indifferent, over anybody else.  They are only getting the normal licensing hours.</P>
      <P>If a camp accommodates 1,500 people it is entitled to that particular licence &mdash;two bars and the portions of the camp normally set aside for the serving of meals.  If the camp normally accommodates more than 1,500 people then, for each 800 people in excess of 1,500, the Circuit Court may grant one more public bar.  All this Bill purports to do is to give as a right to the holiday camp, so certified, the right to apply for this type of licence.  It has to fulfil the conditions of having accommodation for more than 1,500 and, for each 800 people in excess of 1,500, it may get an extra bar.  I think that will present itself to this House as something eminently reasonable.</P>
      <P>These camps are a new experiment in the development of Irish tourism. They offer a peculiar type of holiday all their own.  At least one of them is a large public concern in which the small investors of Ireland have invested their money.  I feel that this Bill is giving these camps something that we should, as normal beings, envisage as an adjunct to any individual resorting to these camps.  It is giving to them something to put it on a par with hotel competitors or other competitors of that type.  The Bill is introduced into this House in a completely noncontentious way.  I believe that this is something that will redound to the benefit of the holiday camps and, through the benefit of the holiday camps, to the benefit of the tourist industry in Ireland and of the people of Ireland in general&mdash;as well as the fact that these camps have an immense employment potential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the main, the part of the Bill that Deputies would really be interested in is covered by Sections 2, 3 and 4.  I have dealt with those by telling the House exactly what they envisage&mdash;a simple method of first having to obtain a certificate that it is, in fact, a holiday camp, of then applying to the Circuit Court and then limiting what the Circuit Court may grant you.  This Bill will have to go through the normal <Col N="2173" /> channels that any licence application to the courts will take.  All this Bill does is to give a new type of institution, the holiday camp, a right, if it is such a holiday camp, to apply for a licence. Deputies will see other sections that impose certain restrictions with regard to St. Patrick's Day, Good Friday and other specific days; the limitations with regard to the selling of drink on Sunday and the fact that, under certain conditions, when people are, for instance, ordering a substantial meal, drinks can be supplied.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House.  It is something that is going to make holiday camps better.  In the amenities they can offer to their patrons it is giving the holiday camps no particular benefits over anybody else.  In fact, Deputies who have read the Bill&mdash;and particularly Deputies who know something about the licensing laws&mdash;will realise that it is, in fact, getting less facilities than the normal hotel or public-house would have.</P>
    <P>Again, I commend this Bill to the House in a non-contentious way and as a matter of urgency because, under this type of legislation, it will be necessary for this Bill to go subsequently to a Select Committee of the House.  In that way, time is short because it is hoped that the benefits of this Act may be obtained by the holiday camps before the next season opens.</P>
    <P>I ask the House, if they can see their way to facilitate the Bill, to let it get its Second Stage, if possible, before we conclude Private Members' time to-night so that we can ask the Select Committee, representative of all Parties, to deal with further stages of it.  The Bill I present to you for what it is, in its plain simple form.  All it does, is to give certain people who fulfil certain statutory conditions the right to the certificate that they are a holiday camp and, having got that, the right to apply to the Circuit Court to have given to them the benefit of the provisions as stated in the Act itself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I second this motion. It is quite obvious to the people in this country that holiday camps have come <Col N="2174" /> to stay.  This Bill, in its present form, is designed to avoid interference with existing amenities in the localities concerned. This Bill realises that the holiday camps provide what you could describe as an inclusive holiday providing a variety of amenities.  This is the ideal class of holiday for the working man and his family.  It is many years since it was first realised that these amenities were needed.  In other countries such holiday camps are in existence and they are provided with the amenities which this Bill proposes to extend.  Apart from that, we must realise that these are concerns which give a large volume of employment and that will add considerably to the development of what is probably our most valuable industry, the tourist industry.  The existing legislation did not anticipate this innovation and that explains the need for a Bill of this nature.  It is not designed to cater for the <i>bona fide</i> trade and therefore will not interfere with the interests of owners of licensed premises in the area.  On the contrary it will help it, because it will bring into the area a group of holiday-makers who would not otherwise find themselves in the locality.</P>
      <P>Consequently the passing of a Bill of this character will not interfere with the interests of licensed traders in the areas concerned.  Incidentally, this Bill will also have the effect of bringing a measure of prosperity into the areas where these large camps are located.  Naturally when there are large groups of people in these areas, it can be assumed that many of them will visit licensed premises and other business premises in the localities concerned. Therefore, I consider that legislation of this character is necessary and desirable and I have very much pleasure in supporting the motion for Second Reading.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>As my name is associated with the introduction of this Bill, I want to say one or two words in its regard.  I think the Bill is a very desirable and necessary step.  I support it principally for the reason that these camps do represent a new departure in so far as holidays are concerned. <Col N="2175" /> They provide the possibility for workers of having a holiday at a reasonable figure.  They are a completely new enterprise in this country and they should be encouraged in every way. Working class people, whether they be from this country or from across the water, who visit these camps for holidays should not be denied any amenities that are available to those who are in a position to go to high-class hotels for their holidays.  There will be no possibility of a <i>bona fide</i> traffic developing in these camps as the consumption of intoxicating liquor will be confined to residents in the camp.  It is a simple Bill to provide these camps with the same rights and entitlements as operate in other establishments to which the more prosperous section of the community have recourse for holidays. In that light I want to express my support for the Bill.</P>

      <P>When I first read the Bill, I was very much inclined to oppose it because I personally believe there are sufficient licensed establishments in the country to cater for the general public.  However, in the interests of tourism which is of great importance to the country, I support the Bill in order to give an opportunity to the people in Butlin's to apply for a licence.  I sincerely hope, however, that if this is not the last, it will be very nearly the last of such Bills.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (General MacEoin)</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the manner in which the Bill has been presented, I do not think it is necessary for me to say much in regard to it.  It is true to say that the Licensing Acts at present in operation do not cater for or foresee this type of development or the establishment of holiday camps as such.  It is also true to say that while the law as it stands makes arrangements for licensing suitable hotels for the sale of drink, it does not contain any provision under which such a licence can be obtained for a holiday camp.  I am satisfied, therefore, that there is need for facilities such as those suggested in the Bill for holiday camps.  I am further satisfied that a <Col N="2176" /> well-run camp possessing such facilities will not lead to abuses.  The provisions of the Bill appear to be generally satisfactory.  Some amendments in my opinion may be desirable but these will be examined, I presume, by the Special Committee and by the Government at a later date.</P>
      <P>The main idea behind the Bill is in my opinion sound.  It contains safeguards to ensure that only substantial and well-run camps will be licensed and that the renewal of a licence for a camp may be refused if it is not conducted in an orderly manner.  The grant or refusal of licences is vested in the courts.  The courts have power to prescribe what portions of the camp may be licensed and Section 4 provides for limitations on the number of bars which may be set up in the camp.  The hours at which drink may be sold are also prescribed in the Bill. It is quite clear that these hours are limited and that even residents in the camp will not be entitled to get drink at any hour as guests in a hotel may. The Government have given some small consideration to the Bill and I have decided not to oppose it.  At the same time, as it is a new departure and one which has not been very well canvassed or thought of up to the moment, the Government has decided that the question of the passage of the Bill will be left to a free vote of the House.  It is for the House to consider the matter in all its aspects. I am not opposing the Bill and I think it is necessary.  Personally I shall vote for it but, of course, the House is free to take whatever decision it likes in the matter.</P>

      <P>The Minister has now given his blessing to a Bill which is going to provide that, in the heart of the country, other sections of the community who are on holidays have only <Col N="2177" /> to walk on Sundays from their sleeping place to the dining-room for a drink.  When looking around me, I am amazed at the absence of the apostles of temperance that we heard five or six months ago when I was endeavouring to get for the ordinary working rural community the right to have a drink within three miles of their home on a Sunday.  The men who have to provide the food for the holiday camps, who have to go out to work every morning, can now picture the holiday camps where the boys are going to get their drink on Sunday.  The man who has to go out in the morning to milk the cows to see that these people are provided with milk, and who has to feed the cattle will now see that, through the wisdom, God save us, of the elected representatives to this House, these holiday people are going to get an opportunity of having their drink on Sunday.  I have sympathy with the people who sent these representatives here when that is the picture that is given us.  There may be a necessity for this, but I wonder where are all the apostles of temperance who were condemning with bell, book and candle a Bill to afford the ordinary working man the same right to go into a public house on Sunday and drink his pint of porter as the gentleman in the City of Dublin, the City of Cork or the City of Limerick.</P>

If they were enforced or observed, there would be a mutiny all over the country.  But, while you have licensing laws which permit an individual who finishes work at 2 o'clock or at 5 or 6 o'clock on a Saturday and who has not to worry about his business until he goes to work at 8 or 9 o'clock on Monday morning to walk out of his own home and go into a public-house next door and stay there for four hours on any Sunday, and while you have another law&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a great deal of sympathy with Deputy Corry because it is quite right, as he says, that he is surrounded on all sides by many hypocrites on this question of drink.  That is a peculiar thing in itself, but it is almost a commonplace in the country. I do not want to traverse the general remarks of Deputy Corry.  I propose to confine myself to one or two points, because I realise quite well that, so far as the House is concerned, it is fairly certain this Bill will go through.  I indicated before, when speaking against a measure of this particular <Col N="2180" /> type, that I felt drink is a problem that cannot be dealt with by prohibitions or limitations, and that you have to take your stand one way or the other on it.  It is a problem that you cannot play with in the sense of saying that you can go so far, and that if you go that distance there are going to be no abuses.  What I am concerned with is that all our anxitey seems to be in the direction of providing greater facilities while not concerning ourselves at all with the actual problem that faces us.</P>
      <P>We have just heard the Minister for Justice, in speaking on this Bill, express the viewpoint of the Government. During recent months in this House that same Minister, and another Minister, have had numerous questions addressed to them in regard to road offences arising from this same cause. We all deplore that, but at the same time we seem to feel that, all the time, we have to give increased facilities in regard to this drink question.  I do not intend to make a speech on temperance. I do not believe that temperance can be promoted by making speeches on it.  It does seem to me a peculiar thing that many members of this House who, during a particular period of the country's history set a headline on this particular question which gave inspiration to young men and women, have now stepped back from that forward position, with the result that the section of our people which seems to be most affected by this drink problem is that section which is composed not of the aged or the middle-aged, but rather of our young people&mdash;our boys and girls.</P>
      <P>So far as this Bill is concerned, I want to express my opposition to it.  I gather that the main justification for it is the encouragement of tourism and of facilities for tourists.  Judging by what has happened during the past few years in this country, we shall rapidly reach the stage when tourism and the provision of facilities for tourists can be pleaded as a justification for almost anything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I, personally, do not believe that in the camps we are discussing there should be these facilities.  I think that anybody with knowledge of the atmosphere that is developed when you have <Col N="2181" /> a large body of people gathered together, as they will be in camps, will agree that it is almost impossible to ensure that there will not be abuses. It seems to me that if we are so concerned with tourism and with tourists that we should also have regard to the benefits which are supposed to flow as regards the political well-being of the people.  As far as I understand, the great majority of the people who go to these camps are young people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is not so then they must be attracting a different type of people from that which this Bill is intended to appeal to.  I have always felt that it is extremely difficult to apply limitations on the sale of liquor so far as confined premises, such as clubs are concerned, and now in the case of camps.  Those of us who live in Dublin have a good knowledge of the atmosphere that surrounds clubs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The limitations in this Bill are much more strict than they are in the case of clubs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>At the same time, while I am not taking the line that it is possible to stop these adjustments being made, I do want to have it on record that I am not a party in any way to what is being done.  It is quite clear from the atmosphere of the House and from Deputy Corry's remarks that the Bill is going through. I think that those who feel like me should express their views on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another interesting feature that one has to take notice of.  While we cannot mention names in regard to these camps, it is interesting to note that the camps are not merely places for enjoyment for those who frequent them but, apparently, they are also profitable concerns for those who run them.  We all saw recently that one particular firm engaged in this type of activity expressed the hope of being able to pay a 100 per cent. dividend. It hoped to be able to do that shortly. One can gather from that that these camps are a highly commercialised form of profit making.  I have no doubt <Col N="2182" /> that when this Bill goes through that particular firm will be able to pay its 100 per cent. dividend much more quickly than if the Bill were not passed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this Bill may be regarded as one of those pieces of freak legislation which are introduced into this House from time to time. Perhaps it is fitting that it should follow so closely on the Transport Bill which the House has been discussing during the past two days.  There has been a good deal of muddled thinking on transport, a good deal of that blindness to which the Minister for Finance referred here.  But we have even more muddled thinking on this Bill, more confusion, and a more freakish inclination to foster commercial interests which, in my opinion, have very little value for the country.</P>
      <P>I think that this Bill ought to be opposed by Deputies in all Parties.  I am rather glad that the Minister for Justice has indicated that he is leaving this matter to a free vote of the House, and I am sure that there will be a free vote.  Let us ask ourselves, how many of the ordinary manual workers of the country can avail of the amenities provided by these holiday camps.  We do not see farmers, or farm workers, skedaddling off for a week or a fortnight to a holiday camp. We do not see their wives, their sons or their daughters frequenting these places.  For the agricultural community there is no such thing as a holiday or rest of any kind.  Therefore, I think that those who have been contending that this Bill provides amenities for the poorer sections of the community were talking with no sense of sincerity.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think those people were simply trying to pull wool over the eyes of Deputies.  The people who frequent holiday camps are those who are in a position to accumulate a certain amount of money to enable them to take a holiday, and they are only a minority as far as the country is concerned.  The members of the agricultural community and manual workers generally have not the means to <Col N="2183" /> provide themselves with a holiday in a residential holiday camp.  Therefore, I think that whole argument in favour of this Bill falls to the ground.</P>
      <P>Another argument is provided.  We are told that this is to encourage tourists.  Is there any limit to the length to which the nation may go in order to encourage moneyed people from outside the country to come here? If we are justified in opening public houses&mdash;for that is what it means&mdash;on Christmas Day and St. Patrick's Day, in order to encourage wealthy tourists to come into this country, why should we not open various forms of gambling saloons and other premises of that kind in order to encourage the same type of people?  We ought to have some sense of reality.  We ought to realise how the average citizen in this country lives and we ought to provide equal amenities for all sections of our own community.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corry is logical when he suggests that if we can provide these facilities for people who can afford a holiday, we should provide equal facilities for those who cannot afford a holiday, those who have to work the seven days of the week.  I am amazed at this proposal. The proposer of the Bill did not refer to the provisions which seek to provide for an opening on St. Patrick's Day and Christmas Day.  I understood that on those days all licensed premises were definitely closed.  It seems, however, that those specially favoured holiday camps will be permitted to open on those days.</P>
      <P>There is another aspect of this question. If holiday camps have any value at all they should provide attractions for the younger generation.  It was stated in the course of the debate that the people who avail of those holiday camps are mixed.  I assume the word &ldquo;mixed&rdquo; means that both sexes avail of this form of holiday.  Is it desirable that these additional facilities in the form proposed should be provided for young people?</P>

      <P>If the proposer made that absolutely clear when he was introducing the Bill, he would have done a service.  The point I am making now is that those facilities ought not to be provided for people who can afford a holiday if they are denied to those who cannot.  They ought not to be afforded to the types of people who avail of this form of holiday and who are, in the main, young people of both sexes.</P>
      <P>I think this is a very undesirable piece of legislation.  I have no hesitation in saying that it is a piece of freak legislation, and it must have originated in a freak mind.  I intend to oppose this Bill and to challenge a division on it if necessary.</P>

      <P>I would like to be consistent in this matter.  So far as these camps are concerned, when they came here first I vigorously opposed them.  They succeeded in getting in the thin edge of the wedge.  Now that they have their feet in the ground, along comes this proposal to establish licensed premises in these camps.  The suggestion is that there should be two or three in each camp.  I think the whole proposal is ridiculous.  Has this nation any anxiety to adopt Irish ideas?  I do not think it has.  Must we always ape the foreigner?  There is nothing Irish in the outlook of these camps.  They are based on ideas that are definitely not Irish.  No matter how well they are run, I believe that they tend to sap the morale of the people of this nation until we will be just as bad as the people of other nations where these camps were originally formed. Camps of this type are well established in various countries in Europe and they are flourishing there.  This island of ours is supposed to be an outpost of Christianity, and I do not think we should encourage the development of <Col N="2185" /> these camps by offering such facilities as are proposed in this Bill.</P>
      <P>I would like Deputy Collins to withdraw this Bill and to show, by doing so, that he is the son of a worthy father and that he is proud of the people who have gone before him. Those of us who fought for certain ideals in this country are now beginning to realise that the ideals for which we fought are now being forgotten. New ideals are being brought forward, but they are un-Irish and unchristian. Some of our people want to live in what I might describe as the materialist age; they want to enjoy to the full all the pleasures that can be showered on them.  We know that in this country there is a vast amount of drink consumed&mdash;far too much for a nation which calls itself a Catholic nation.  Under this Bill we would be giving more facilities in that direction to a pleasure-seeking people.</P>
      <P>We are told that these camps are Irish camps for Irish people.  I live not too far away from them and I am satisfied that they are British camps and nothing more.  The majority of the people may be of the industrial type from England.  I know that these camps are pretty well conducted, but I do not agree with the customs of the camps, with their ideals, or with the moral outlook of the people who come across the Irish Channel to avail of them.  That moral outlook is not good for our people.</P>
      <P>I will be consistent right through and I will oppose this licensing proposal for these camps.  I opposed the camps and I say that the sooner they close their doors and the sooner the promoters silently steal away, the better it will be for Ireland.  Then we will have an opportunity of getting back to the ideals of an Irish nation, and, if necessary, similar places can be developed in the interests of Ireland and in accordance with the Christian philosophy. These are the things I will stand for and these are the things that I and my colleagues in the past fought for.  I ask Deputy Collins to be true to the ideals his uncle fought and died for.  He should withdraw this measure.</P>

      <P>I wish to be associated <Col N="2186" /> with previous speakers so far as opposition to this measure is concerned. I am opposing it more or less for the same reasons as my colleague in the Labour Party, Deputy Larkin, who conveyed the impression to the House that he was not in thorough agreement with the Bill.  I am in thorough agreement with the statement made by Deputy Corry.  I believe that so far as the introduction of this measure goes, the Deputy who introduced it should certainly have given more careful consideration to a measure of a similar nature that was introduced here three or four months ago.  That measure certainly catered for the interests of the plain people of Ireland.  We find this Bill caters only for a certain section, not of the Irish people, but of people who come to this country and who are rich enough to live in luxury. I oppose the Bill also for this reason, that in my opinion intoxicating liquor is largely responsible for many of the road accidents that are occurring at the present day.  To my mind, if this Bill passes through the House, and if the people for whom it caters get opportunities for the unlimited consumption of intoxicating liquor, it will lead to greater tragedies on the roads of this country.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBernieJnr" hpid="Mr. Beirne Mr. Beirne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beirne</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Minister at Question Time to-day whether he was aware that certain appointments to the staffs of local authorities were made by means of interview and examination conducted by certain selected members or senior officers of these bodies; whether he was aware of the undesirability of this practice in view of the danger of patronage and close association with members of such interview boards being an important factor in the selection of successful candidates and, if, so, whether he proposed to take any action to terminate this system.  The answer was as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The system of examination referred to by the Deputy has been operated in appropriate cases over a <Col N="2187" /> number of years in the local services and in the Civil Service and has been found generally satisfactory.  I do not at present propose to take action to discontinue it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The House will notice that I stress the word &ldquo;generally&rdquo;.  I considered that unsatisfactory and I, therefore, raise the matter again now.  The Minister may think that I am personally aggrieved because of some appointment in my own constituency.  I can assure the Minister that such is not the case.  I raise this matter as one of principle.  I do not use the occasion for any political advantage.  I am quite honest in that.  I know this question may be unpopular from the point of view of public officials.  They may think that I am casting aspersions on their integrity.  Such is not the case. I cast no reflections on any public officials.</P>
    <P>I do not think this practice is desirable in the public interest and I think the time has come when a different system must be evolved.  Human nature being what it is, we are often influenced by such things as close association, patronage and so on.  The position must be an exceedingly difficult one for the selection board itself since some of the members may know some of the candidates intimately.  It may happen that a man's heart may rule his head.  For that reason, he may choose a candidate who may not possibly be the best qualified.  There may be border-line cases.  When border-line cases arise the possibility is that the most efficient candidate will not be selected.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not been living in obscurity all his life.  I am sure he has heard of appointments being made through pull, patronage, influence, politics and so on.  A number of patronage appointments have been made in the past under two successive native Governments.  When we were on the Opposition Benches we criticised such appointments very severely. I know the Minister is aware that certain irregularities have occurred.  I have only been a short time in public life and I know that they occur.  The Minister may tell me that if I have a <Col N="2188" /> particular case in mind I can present him with the facts of it.  That is an invitation I shall not accept.  That is a very dangerous invitation.  Technical points may have arisen in a particular instance where the best qualified candidate was not appointed.  It is very difficult for anybody to get sufficient evidence to convince even himself sometimes that there are irregularities. But we all know these things are happening day in and day out.</P>
    <P>I would not blame the Minister for continuing the old system if there was no remedy available.  I hold the Minister has many remedies available to him by means of which he could eliminate these abuses.  In the majority of cases, if my information is correct and I think it is, the personnel of these examining boards is selected from the officers of the county councils. Those officers are known.  In many cases the names of the members of such boards are common property. Approaches may be made to them. Close association and politics may influence them.  I think we should have some body similar to the present Civil Service Commission.  The names of the commissioners are not known to all and sundry.  If we had a body such as that these appointments could be made in a legitimate way.  There are many avenues open to the Minister to eliminate these abuses.  As far as I know, the examinations for these positions are generally carried out in the county council offices.  I think that, in the vicinity of most such offices, you will get men, apart altogether from the officials, who are quite competent to deal with the examining or the interviewing of candidates for posts.  In the case of candidates for a minor job I would recommend that the selection be made by people other than the officials of the county council.  Surely there are people of intelligence to be found in the neighbourhood of the county council offices who would be suitable to do that type of work?  Generally speaking, good schools are near at hand; there may be an industry nearby or there may be a contractor there. You will find people of good education in the schools and you will find practical people in industry and in the contracting business.  All these classes <Col N="2189" /> of people would serve admirably on a board.</P>
    <P>With regard to vacancies for appointments carrying responsibility, and which carry a fairly decent salary, I think such appointments should be made either by the Civil Service Commissioners or by a board selected by the Minister.  I would say to the Minister in all faith and honesty that the members of that board should have absolutely no connection with the county in which the appointment is to be made.  I would urge that, in such instances, an independent body, entirely divorced from and having no connections or associations with any people in the county concerned, should be set up.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to suggest to the county managers or the county secretaries that they should get sufficient names in the whole county of people who would be willing to act as examiners.  They could then notify these people a short time before the appointment is to be made and invite them to carry out the examinations and interviews.  I do not think there would be any great difficulty in that.</P>
    <P>May I say that it is only in some counties that this practice prevails?  I have been talking to some people regarding this question to-night and I understand that in other counties they have selection boards composed, perhaps, of people from various educational establishments or from industrial establishments.  I can refer in particular now to County Cork.  There is no such thing as an examining body there selected from the officials of the county council.  I understand that the boards are composed of independent individuals called from outside.  These are some of the avenues which are open to local authorities in connection with the filling of certain appointments to their staffs.  However, the best avenue and the proper way, I think, to conduct the examinations is to have open competition and when the papers have been completed they should be sent perhaps to the Civil Service Commissioners or to some other body to examine and correct them and award the marks accordingly.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, I know for a <Col N="2190" /> fact that officials of local authorities do not welcome this class of work.  It is a very unpleasant job for them and, at times, it can be very embarrassing. Even though the officials may or may not think that I am trying to put a nail in their coffins, I think they would welcome the change.  I know officials in county council offices who consider that it is very embarrassing and unpleasant to have to act as examiners or interviewers.</P>

      <P>I want to assure the Minister that I did not raise this question on the adjournment for the purpose of casting anything in the nature of suspicion on public officials or examining bodies.  All that I say is that the practice is entirely wrong.  The Minister, in his reply to-day, to some extent, admitted it when he said: &ldquo;The system of examination referred to by the Deputy has been operated in appropriate cases over a number of years in the local services and in the Civil Service and has been found generally satisfactory.&rdquo;  Let me lay emphasis on the word &ldquo;generally.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I say that it is an admission by the Minister that things are not just right. It is up to us, therefore, to put this matter right.  The Minister then said that he did not at present propose to take action to discontinue the system. What do Deputies think of that statement even if, generally speaking&mdash;and only generally speaking&mdash;we were to assume that 50 per cent. of the cases might be right?  After all, there is the danger that the other 50 per cent. of the cases might be wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am anxious that the protest I am now voicing will receive the greatest publicity.  I know that this protest has been looked for by people in general and not alone people in the country where, when somebody is appointed to a job, the rumour goes round in the district that he had a pull with somebody or other in the county council. That type of thing is very objectionable. I want to see it ended once and for all.  If the Minister will be kind enough to act on the suggestions I have made to him he will find that all this thing of political pull and patronage <Col N="2191" /> and so forth will be eliminated automatically from the making of these appointments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened very carefully to the case made by Deputy Beirne but I must say that I thought it was a most unimpressive one.  The whole burden of his complaint was that something was wrong and yet he said that there was nothing wrong.  He talks about minor appointments in local authorities and objects to the candidates being known to those who will make the appointments.  I want to point out to him and to the House that I once attended a convention for the selection of candidates for an election&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>One of them had a spokesman who said that what was in favour of this candidate was the fact that he was so well known to everybody. &ldquo;That is the reason,&rdquo; said the chairman of the convention, &ldquo;why he should not be selected, because if they know him they certainly will not elect him.&rdquo;  In the same way, surely to goodness, for promotions in the case of minor positions in the service of local authorities, the persons should be known&mdash;and particularly where the officials are making the selections. After all, they are subsequently responsible for them.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Local Government has always, in fact, a safeguard in relation to all appointments under local authorities.  When the appointments are of a senior character there are very severe conditions laid down for the filling of such appointments.  As a representative of a local authority, Dublin Corporation, I feel that the representatives of local authorities should have some hope of being able to afford promotions to some of their very loyal and efficient servants, and particularly when they know them to be efficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy referred to the two last Governments&mdash;I suppose he means the Cumann na nGaedheal Government and the Fianna Fáil Government&mdash;in connection <Col N="2192" /> with certain patronage appointments. I intend now to deal only with the Cumann na nGaedheal Government. When our first native Government was set up, a Civil Service had to be created from almost nothing.  A great many of the appointments were patronage appointments.  In the course of time it was found that very many of these people who were appointed were highly efficient&mdash;we have some of them serving with us still&mdash;and that they served the State loyally and efficiently irrespective of changes of successive Governments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Keyes) Michael Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Keyes)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy draws a good deal of solace from my use of the word &ldquo;generally&rdquo; in my reply to his parliamentary question to-day.  In that he displays an optimism that I do not consider justified.  I said that the system of examination referred to by him has been operated in appropriate cases over a number of years in the local services and in the Civil Service and has been found generally satisfactory. I did not, however, claim that the system was fool-proof.  The Deputy objected to the system but yet I did not hear anything about the absolutely fool-proof remedy that he was to provide. I have seen the operation of various types of systems and let me say that I think that this system is working reasonably well.  I thought that perhaps the Deputy had some particular case at the back of his mind and I intended to suggest that, in that event, he should put it before me and that I would be prepared to investigate it if there was an allegation of unfair or unscrupulous treatment.</P>
      <P>The Deputy has not even quoted one case to support his allegations.  While there can be no question of challenging the honesty of the motives of the Deputy in raising the question, I must seriously challenge the wisdom of the method which he has adopted because this is a matter which has very widespread ramifications and it is worthy of more thought than could be devoted to it by mere question and answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a matter of fact there are three methods obtaining in regard to public appointments under local authorities. <Col N="2193" /> There is first of all, the recommendation by the Local Appointments Commission, the system under which certain types of higher officials are appointed.  Then you have the method of competition by written examination and thirdly, there is the method of the interview board.  The interview board seems to be the method to which the Deputy takes exception.  There are many posts which require to be filled by local authorities which could not suitably be made the subject of written examinations and so the method has been adopted of setting up a board locally to interview candidates. I think it will be generally agreed that this is the most suitable method, provided that all reasonable steps are being taken to ensure that no corruption can arise.  I think the Deputy will agree that he has been unable to indicate any case in which corruption has entered into these appointments.  He has suggested that we should get an outside panel from which the members of these interview boards would be drawn, but what guarantee have we that the members of such an outside panel would not be subject to the same human weaknesses as he suggests the members of the present interview boards are likely to suffer from?  The Deputy's suggestion as to an outside panel suffers from one great weakness, that there is likely to be a lack of knowledge amongst the members of such panel of the type of work which has to be done.  We want men on these boards who are familiar with the work to be done.  If we are going to ask people from outside who have no contact with public boards or their staffs or who have no idea of the work which has to be performed, what kind of appointments are you going to get?  We have no guarantee that such people would not suffer from all the frailties of human nature which the Deputy suggests exist amongst members of the interview boards.</P>
    <P>The Deputy says that he was not making any allegations against the officers doing this job.  What else does the question indicate but a definite allegation that there is, though he might not call it corruption, an absence of probity in dealing with these matters?  What happens generally, <Col N="2194" /> if there is an appointment to be made by the interview board&mdash;this is apart from appointments made by written examinations or those which go to the Local Appointments Commission&mdash;is that the manager sets up a body which is in effect another local appointments committee.  The board generally consists of officers from an adjoining county and perhaps officers from some other office in the county itself. Generally the manager does not sit on the board at all himself, but he is the responsible officer to see that the arrangements for the appointment are properly carried out.  The members of the board are drawn from his own county, a neighbouring borough or a neighbouring county, and their duty is to select the best candidate from amongst those who present themselves. If it is alleged that any one of these men are influenced by compassionate grounds or some kind of fellow feeling for some of the candidates, why should we assume that disease would spread to the three or four other members of the board?  One may have a leaning towards one particular candidate and another member may have a leaning towards another candidate, but I think the present method is the best that can be devised in the circumstances to select the best candidate. The manager, as I have said, generally goes to an outside county to get assistance to enable him to make a selection.</P>
    <P>If all these appointments were to be referred to the Local Appointments Commission here in Dublin you would clutter up the whole machinery.  The machine would be clogged and you would be handicapping men who have been working under particular councils for many years, and who would feel that they were justly entitled to get promotion in their areas when vacancies arose, in obliging them to compete with candidates from the other 26 counties.  Personally, I am not satisfied that the Deputy has offered us any remedy for the problem which he has raised.  I was hoping that he might put forward some tangible or definite suggestion, but I do not think he has.</P>

      <P>Even if the manager does not go outside the county, the personnel changes. At one time he may select the head of the local vocational school, an arts master or a drawing master.  Then somebody is called in from the local council or corporation but the personnel is different.  That is positive.  If the Deputy had been able to show that he had any particular grievance or that some little weakness or corruption had crept in to this system of appointment, I would be prepared to investigate it but I do not think it fair to pillory the whole system on generalities.  The Deputy refers to some counties but it is a rather unfortunate thing for him that the most recent case arose in Galway.</P>

I do not think the suggestion the Deputy made to call in people who have no contact with or no knowledge of the work carried on by the councils would serve the interest of efficiency or would lead to impartiality or fair play.  There is no reason to suggest that people drawn from outside institutions would show any greater integrity than that possessed by the officers of the council. These officers are in the highest degree capable of being entrusted with the task of interviewing candidates and of coming to a decision on the merits of the candidates.  If they are not fitted for that job, they are not fit to be in the public service at all.  I do not think that any case has been made for a change in the present system.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether he is aware that a large number of farmers in County Dublin had to sell their barley at under £2 per barrel while the price to breweries was 57/6; and, if so, whether he will consider recouping their losses to these farmers.</P>

      <P>Farmers generally were advised by public announcements last spring that there would be no control on the price of barley of the 1949 crop and that a cash market for malting barley was assured only in cases in which sale contracts had been made with industrial users.  The suggestion that growers who may have sold barley at less than the top price for firstquality malting barley should receive the difference from public funds is one that could not be entertained.</P>

      <P>I have been keeping in close touch with the Great Northern Railway Company as I have been concerned to secure that the company would take no precipitate action in regard to reductions of staff.  They have assured me that they are equally concerned <Col N="2059" /> to avoid dismissals in so far as their resources will permit.  They inform me that they have had to dispense with the services of some staff, but that this has been largely as a result of seasonal redundancy.</P>
