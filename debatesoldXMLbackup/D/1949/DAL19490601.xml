      <P>As the Deputy is, no doubt, aware the social services were substantially improved as from the 1st January last.  I have now completed the examination of proposals for a comprehensive social insurance scheme which will be the Government's next objective in the improvement and extension of our code of social legislation. When these proposals have been implemented the question of increasing the allowances under the Children's Allowances Acts will be considered.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands whether he is aware that the Oakport Demesne, Cootehall, Boyle, has been in the hands of the Land Commission for a considerable number of years; that it is being annually let for grazing; and, if so, whether he will recommend to the Land Commission that it take immediate steps to divide this land in view of the congestion which exists in the locality.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands whether he is aware that Mrs. Margaret Kelly, Churchfield, Knock, <Col N="2320" /> County Mayo, has advertised for sale approximately 60 acres of land; and, if so, whether the Land Commission will proceed to have this farm acquired for the relief of local congestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to a previous question on 28th April last, I pointed out that the mere fact that lands are offered for sale is not sufficient reason for the Land Commission to institute proceedings for acquisition.  I have asked the Land Commission to inquire as to congestion in the area and to take any steps that may be possible to relieve any such congestion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether he is aware of the necessity for additional creamery stops at (i) Emlaghmore and Mastergeehy, and (ii) Cromane and Glencutane areas, County Kerry; and, if so, whether he will take steps to facilitate the farmers concerned at the earliest possible date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon) James M. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon)</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of providing special creamery facilities in the four areas referred to by the Deputy has been examined by the Dairy Disposals Company. I am satisfied, as a result of this survey, that these districts are already reasonably well served by existing creameries, either stationary or portable.  The Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible, with the number of travelling creameries at present available, to provide stopping places in every district, and, in consequence, some suppliers must of necessity be less favourably situated than others.  I propose to ask the Dairy Disposals Company to re-examine the whole position in the Cahirciveen <Col N="2321" /> peninsula next winter in the light of the milk supplies received this season, with a view to providing additional facilities, if circumstances appear to justify such a course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>If, as a result of the survey, additional stops are required, due mainly to increased milk production in these areas within the past year and probably next year as well, will the Minister favourably consider the question of establishing new creamery stops in the Emlaghmore and Mastergeehy area and the Cromane and Glencutane areas as well?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not doubt that if that happy event transpires the Deputy and I and the Dairy Disposals Board and all others concerned will conspire to provide as many stops as may be necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFlynn" hpid="Mr. J. Flynn Mr. J. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he is now prepared to introduce proposals for legislation to amend Section 35 (6) of the Fisheries Act, 1939, so that fishermen in areas where the open fishing season is normally less than the minimum 26 weeks specified in the section may receive full compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot undertake to introduce legislative proposals of the nature indicated, as there is no evidence that Section 35 (6) in its present form does not fairly represent the intention of the Oireachtas in respect of the matters covered by it.  There is no mention in Section 35 (6) of a minimum 26 weeks as suggested by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, a minimum of 26 weeks in certain areas in certain counties is practicable but there are other areas where the actual fishing season is only a possible 16 weeks and, with the best intention in the world, compensation cannot be granted in such areas.  Would the Minister reconsider the matter in the light of those circumstances?  I have had discussions with the officials of his Department and difficulty seems to have arisen not alone in my county but in some of <Col N="2322" /> the western counties, too, in regard to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to mislead the Deputy by saying that I will reconsider the matter and thus persuade him that it may be possible for me to do something.  But, quite literally, I do propose to re-examine the matter; but I do not wish the Deputy to accept that as implying that I foresee my ability to change matters.  The position will be re-examined.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture his reason for stating in the Dáil on 17th May (Official Report, Volume 115, column 1320) that the County Galway Committee of Agriculture might have the civility to answer his letter; whether he was then aware that his letter was discussed by the committee at its meeting on the 27th April and that as a result of the discussion a reply was sent to him by the secretary of the committee that evening; whether he is further aware that a letter dated the 30th April from the Minister's private secretary was sent to the secretary of the committee acknowledging receipt of the letter of 27th April regarding suggested changes in the matter of agricultural instruction; and finally whether, in view of the facts set out, he will now withdraw his aspersion on the chairman, secretary and members of the County Galway Committee of Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Galway County Committee of Agriculture had before them at their meeting on the 27th April two letters from me, one related to the price of eggs, and the other was a request for their advice in regard to the organisation of additional facilities for farmers in the county and ended with the paragraph: &ldquo;I cannot too strongly emphasise that this letter is not a demand nor is it an announcement of a change in policy; it is a <i>bona fide</i> request to your committee for the benefit of their advice on the merits of the proposal, and any decision on this matter will be taken in the light of that advice.  It is in order to have the help of that advice that I <Col N="2323" /> have ventured to trouble you with this communication.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The committee thought it well to pay my first letter the compliment of &ldquo;marking it as &lsquo;read,&rsquo;&rdquo; and after Mr. Callanan had inquired &ldquo;what are the instructors going to be there for, is it to look after the grass?&rdquo; and Councillor Ruane had stated &ldquo;in my opinion all that will be there soon are the graziers, the herds, sheepdogs and the bailiffs,&rdquo; and Mr. O'Toole had said &ldquo;tell him to mind his own business and we will mind ours,&rdquo; Councillor Ruane inquired &ldquo;what is the use of declaring a Republic and adopting a foreign policy as the Minister for Agriculture is doing,&rdquo; Mr. King commented on the fact that the Minister had sent out the letter personally and wondered if he had gone against the advice of his experts; after this interlude the secretary was instructed to reply to one of my letters and did so in a perfectly correct communication dated 27th April, which was acknowledged from my Department on the 30th.</P>
      <P>If in the light of this, the Deputy considers the phrase &ldquo;acting the role of crumpaun&rdquo; inappropriate, I can only say we must continue to agree to differ, and I am happy to add that the surprising example of the Galway County Committee was followed by relatively few other county committees in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, which is no reply whatever to my question, I have given here the date of the volume, and the column and the words that he actually used, wherein it was stated that the Galway County Committee of Agriculture treated him in a contemptible manner by failing to answer his letter in regard to his suggestion for improved agricultural instruction.  He has not replied to that question.</P>

      <P>I would direct the attention of the Deputy to the fact that I have answered his specific question.  I would further direct his attention to the fact that if he considers the record which I have described as a civil reply, I wonder what it would have been if they tried to be uncivil.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the Minister's further comment I do not mind what appeared in flaring headlines in a paper but I mind the decision which was given and which was conveyed to the Minister as a reply.  Furthermore, his letter to the chairman was acknowledged on the 21st April.  He has carried on in this manner to such an extent that he still further implies that they did not treat him as they should have treated him with common courtesy.  I would regret very much if any Minister of State was treated with that form of discourtesy.  I might raise the matter on the Adjournment, but I do not intend to waste time in doing so because his conduct is such as to injure only himself and to increase our popularity.</P>

      <P>The gentleman in question was a volunteer member of the Old I.R.A. attached to one of the northern divisions and he had very meritorious service.  He was a medical officer in the National Army for a considerable number of years during which time he gave meritorious service.  He has been reappointed in a part-time capacity and is giving complete satisfaction.

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Cosgrave)</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from the fact that the Deputy has not indicated whether he has Irish-registered or Irish-owned ships in mind, the statistics in regard to trade and shipping are not compiled in such a way as would make it feasible to give the figures asked for in the question.  There are some Irish-owned ships not registered in this country and conversely.  In the case of the two main companies which engage in cross-Channel <Col N="2326" /> services all the ships of one are on the British register and some of the ships of the other company are on the Irish register.  There are a number of other Irish and British companies who engage in the cross-Channel trade and some of the trade is carried in ships of other nationalities.  Of the two principal companies engaged in the cross-Channel service it is believed that in one case the majority of the crews are signed on in Dublin and that in the other case the crews contain only a small number of Irishmen.</P>

      <P>I have been informed by a representative of this firm that, because of a falling off in orders for its <Col N="2327" /> products, due to over-stocking by traders, consequent on heavy importations over the past few years, the firm was obliged, early this year, to lay off a number of workers.</P>
      <P>The manufacture here of gloves is protected by a tariff of 37½ per cent. <i>ad valorem</i>, full, 25 per cent. preferential, in the case of leather gloves, and double those rates in the case of fur gloves.  A request for increased protection was made to my Department by a deputation from the glove industry in March of this year, but no reply was received to a request made to the deputation for the particulars necessary to substantiate the claim that the existing protective tariffs are not adequate.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that the importation and use in the construction of public buildings of Portland stone is causing unemployment among quarry workers; and, if so, whether he will take such steps as are necessary to ensure that Irish granite will, where possible, be used.</P>

This Portland stone is, however, imported unworked and employment is given on the working of the stone.

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if, in view of the necessity for increasing the volume of skilled labour available for the building of houses, so that the inhuman conditions under which many of our people are forced to live may be ended, he has directed his attention towards the formulation of any scheme guaranteeing continuity of employment to building trade operatives, and if he has examined the scheme directed to this end which was put before the Labour Court by the building trade groups.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It has never been suggested to me, nor have I any reason to believe, that the absence of a guarantee of continuity of employment is retarding the completion of the housing programme.  It is apparent that the implementation of many building plans already announced will provide continuous employment for building trade operatives for a considerable time.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that private enterprise must take the initiative in the formulation and working of any scheme designed to guarantee continuity of employment to building workers.  In so far as the Control of Building Order can be operated to achieve the end which he has in view, licences for less essential projects stipulate, as far as practicable, that the work is done during periods of the year when activity in the building of houses and other essential works is less intense.</P>
      <P>The scheme to which the Deputy refers as having been put before the Labour Court had reference only to a &ldquo;guaranteed week&rdquo;, and the court made no recommendation on that matter, but referred it back for discussion between the parties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking last night on this Estimate, I had reached the stage of referring to a matter that had been mentioned in the debate and which I regard as a rather delicate subject, and I do not wish to be misconstrued or misunderstood in any remarks I have so far made on the matter.  That was the question of employees' share in the management and profits of industry.  I <Col N="2334" /> hold that that is rather a delicate subject and that it demands something more than has been suggested.  It requires illustration and explanation by the protagonists of that system and if we have not that, no matter how highly inspired the motives underlying it may be, I fear that instead of being an incentive to the revival and expansion of industry it might prove quite the opposite.</P>
      <P>I suggest that those on the Labour Benches, trade unionists and others, should go into this matter very minutely, explain it by way of illustration and show to the people the benefits likely to accrue from it.  As I said, I have no objection to it at all.  On the face of it, it looks a good idea.  At the same time, business people are business people, and they might look at it in a very different light.  In my opinion, they would require definite proof and assurance that it would be to their benefit, to the benefit of the industry and the benefit of the nation as a whole.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Industrial Development Authority if it approaches its job in the proper manner.  I believe the line of approach must be a liberal-minded one.  If the approach is on the too conservative side and if all the difficulties are first summed up and you look at the possibilities through the spectacles of insurmountable difficulty, I am afraid the authority will not get very far.  I have always been interested &mdash;as has every Deputy from rural Ireland and, perhaps, all Deputies&mdash;in the decentralisation of industry.  We all would like to see industry dispersed as widely as possible throughout the country.  The medium and small industries would be best suited for many of the towns in rural Ireland, particularly in the West.  Great industries have sprung up and advanced from very small beginnings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this Industrial Development Authority gets into its stride, I would like to see it getting in touch with the teachers in our vocational schools who are teaching handicraft and trade subjects. In that way, the authority would get some very useful information and suggestions as to the type of industries that might be established in <Col N="2335" /> medium and small towns.  After all, there was a time, within my own memory, when we had such industries in a small way&mdash;such as coachbuilding, harness-making, boot and shoe manufacture and the blacksmith industry. In the blacksmith industry in very small towns, even in my own constituency, there would be anything from 50 to 60 employed.  The concentration on big industries and the advance in mechanisation, with the change-over from horse to motor transport, has caused nearly all the employees to become disemployed. Many of them are alive yet and, in fact, they are a problem, as they are a type of unemployed for whom it is very difficult to find suitable employment. That is why I would like to see small industries established, and I feel that the vocational teachers could give very useful information on that point to the Industrial Development Authority.</P>
    <P>I do not hold that, by way of relieving unemployment or giving full employment, the Minister&mdash;any more than any other Minister&mdash;can perform miracles, as the employment problem is a difficult one.  The easiest side of it to tackle is the unskilled side.  On the skilled side it is quite a different matter.  That is another reason why I would like this authority to get in touch with the vocational teachers.  Persons who invest money in specialised industries requiring technical training are not anxious to give preference to workers who have reached, say, 25 years of age.  Preference will be given, in the main, to those from 17 to 25, as people hold they have a clear brain and an active mind and become adapted more easily to the operation of machinery.  That will be a growing problem all the time, and provision will have to be made for taking these people into other employment as soon as they become unemployed. The other classes of unemployed could be dealt with in another way.  Everything possible should be done to tackle the whole question in its varied aspects in the manner best suited to each.</P>
    <P>I believe the Minister is anxious that <Col N="2336" /> industry expand and be fostered.  My one charge against the present Government in this respect is that, when they took office, a number of them were old, staid, set politicians, who did not take over with the open mind of a school teacher towards his teaching.  I thought they would at least continue to operate the very useful schemes initiated by the previous Government. That would show far greater statesmanship than what has happened.  It cannot be denied by anybody that, during the first year of this Government, the keynotes were, as far as industries established by Fianna Fáil were concerned, to curtail, abandon and abolish.  It would have been much better for the Government itself and for the country if, instead of curtailment, abandonment and demolition, the keynotes had been expansion, protection and improvement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>When speaking on this Estimate last year, I made the suggestion that an important Department like the Department of Industry and Commerce cannot be successfully run, no matter how competent or efficient the Minister is, if he has to devote his time to the day-to-day details of the various matters that come within the responsibility of his Department.  Every Deputy will agree that the responsibilities of a Minister for Industry and Commerce are very grave.  It was my impression that if there was a reorganisation of the Department and if we had in the Department one or more additional Parliamentary Secretaries to handle the day-to-day routine responsibilities, it would leave the Minister free for the larger duty of planning in a big way.  Looking at the work of the Minister during the past year, I have been amazed by the way in which he has been able to deal with all these problems himself.  The Minister has one Parliamentary Secretary, a very efficient Parliamentary Secretary.  It is the experience of the general public and of Deputies who have to come in contact with him, that he is courteous, efficient, competent and capable and if, in addition to Deputy Cosgrave as Parliamentary Secretary, the Minister had one or two Parliamentary Secretaries of that calibre, it would lead to very <Col N="2337" /> substantial improvement in the running of the Department.</P>
      <P>Not only has the Minister to deal with the day-to-day routine of his Department, but he has to deal with many other matters, and it amazes me how the Minister can find the time to attend all these public functions he attends, how his constitution can stand up to all the dinners he has to eat and how he can possibly stand up to the strain of preparing all the speeches he has to deliver at these functions.  It is impossible for us as a Parliament to expect any one person to carry that tremendous responsibility, and, although I am not entitled on an Estimate to advocate legislation&mdash;and I do not intend to do so&mdash;I say that much legislation is needed, and if we are to swamp the Minister with all this day-to-day routine it is impossible for him to find time to consider the preparation of the legislation which each and every one of us knows is necessary if the Department is to serve its proper purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister not only has the responsibility of developing Irish industry and providing for employment in Irish Industry, but he has responsibility in regard to the cost of living, which is a very heavy responsibility. He has responsibility in regard to Córas Iompair Éireann and for our whole transport service, by road, air and sea, and, that being so, I again make the suggestion for consideration by the Government that this reorganisation I mention should be put in hands right away.  The difference between the Minister and his predecessor is that Deputy Lemass, when he took over the responsibility of the Department 17 years ago, started to build up gradually and over the years, and naturally in the period of 16 years during which he was Minister he handled these problems and these developments right from their infancy. The position is entirely different with any new Minister who has to take responsibility for a Department such as this, because he must make himself familiar with all the legislation, all the rules and all the machinery of the Department, and it is because I believe that no one individual can carry that <Col N="2338" /> responsibility that I make the suggestion I have made.</P>
    <P>Figures have been given by the Minister which would indicate an increase in industrial employment during the past 12 months, but every city Deputy knows that, in the City of Dublin, there are thousands of boys who have finished their schooling, of 16, 17, 18 or 19 years of age, for whom it is impossible to find employment.  That is a serious problem confronting each and every one of us.  This particular Department is the Department that carries the responsibility for endeavouring to establish industries and to enlarge or improve existing industries so as to provide employment for those young boys.  It is regrettable to see day after day mothers and fathers of those young boys being forced into the position of agreeing that they must emigrate, to take service in British industry or in the British armed forces. The loss of those fine young boys, that splendid material, is a very serious loss to the country, and each and every one of us should be devoting his talents, ability and energies towards finding ways and means of providing employment for those young men at home.</P>

      <P>If I had known that the Deputy was drawing attention to the fact that there was not a quorum I would have made no comment because I do think that we are failing in our responsibilities as Deputies if we cannot provide the small quorum of 20 out of 147 during the progress of a debate such as this.</P>
      <P>I was dealing with the problem of unemployment and the responsibility that rests on each and every one of us to try to solve it.  I can see no hope of a solution of that problem if we are to jog along in the way we have been jogging along for a number of years. Some step must be taken, and it can only be taken by the Government, to deal with the problem.  It is very little use to be able to say that according to the records there has been a slight improvement in industrial employment when we know that there are thousands of young people unable to find employment in the country.  That responsibility to a large extent rests on the Minister for Industry and Commerce but it is unfair for the Government and Parliament to expect the Minister to solve the problem when we compel him to work probably 16 hours a day administering his Department and dealing with the day to day routine of that Department.  That drives me back to my original point, which I repeat as a recommendation to the Government, that there must be a reorganisation of the Department if the Department is to fulfil its principal function.</P>
      <P>Deputy Larkin and Deputy Connolly mentioned the matter of a comprehensive plan.  A comprehensive plan is necessary and unless there is some plan, not simply drawn up as a plan, but drawn up for the purpose of being implemented and put into operation, I can see no hope of this problem being solved in the lifetime of this Parliament and I am anxious that it should be solved in the lifetime of this Parliament. I am anxious that effective steps towards its solution should be taken in the lifetime of this Parliament. That is, in so far as employment is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next problem that faces the city Deputy is the problem of the cost of living.  I think that all that can be <Col N="2340" /> said in regard to the cost of living is that it has been stabilised, that since the inter-Party Government was formed the cost of living has not been permitted to increase.  That will be accepted by every reasonable and fair-minded individual.  But, we were sent here to do something more than that. Although I agree that stabilisation was necessary as a preliminary step, we were sent here deliberately by the people to reduce the cost of living.</P>
    <P>I realise that the reduction of the cost of living is a very serious problem and requires very detailed examination of all the factors that enter into the costs which the consumer has to pay for all the goods he uses.  When I see what the producer gets, and when I compare that with what the consumer has to pay, it seems clear that between the producer and the consumer exorbitant profits are being made by somebody. It is the duty and the responsibility of the Minister's Department to examine that intermediate stage between the producer and the consumer and to eliminate, where possible and where necessary, unnecessary profits that are being made by distributors. If we can see to it that there is a rationalised system of distribution, and that the profits permitted in distribution are fair and reasonable only, we must reduce the cost of living.  But there is tremendous waste and that is evident without going outside the City of Dublin.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister adverted to this waste on the occasion when he referred to the cost and the expense involved in advertising.  I can see in my own area of Dublin, and right through the city, enormous waste, that affects the cost of living, in regard to milk and in regard to other commodities.  Several milk companies compete with one another to supply milk to the people living on the road I live on.  If there were a rational system of distribution one milk-distributing firm would distribute milk in one area.  We would not then have the position that five or six or seven different vehicles belonging to different companies&mdash;each selling milk of the same kind&mdash;move around on that road in competition with one another.  I make that suggestion <Col N="2341" /> to the Minister without going into the subject of bread.  We read advertisements: &ldquo;Change over to this&rdquo; or &ldquo;Change over to that&rdquo;.  All bread made in this city is good.  It is made under the very best conditions, which are subject to inspection.  Similarly in regard to our dairies.  Our milk is produced for final distribution in those dairies under the very best conditions and there should be no reason why these firms producing bread or milk or other essentials should be engaged in a cut-throat competition that has to be paid for by the consumer in the long run.  I make that suggestion to the Minister as a practical suggestion by which the cost of living can be reduced.</P>
    <P>This debate has lasted a long time. There have been several contributions to it and there have been several contributions that have been in no way helpful.  There have been attempts made to score points.  I heard one Deputy saying that milk consumption was drying up&mdash;that we were able to consume less milk in Dublin than we were able to consume some years ago and that there was no market for milk in Dublin because, I think, 90,000 people had emigrated from the city.</P>
    <P>What are the facts?  The facts were given by the Minister for Agriculture in this House no later than last week when he said that the consumption of milk in Dublin had gone up from 40,000 to 50,000 gallons a day.  If those figures which the Minister for Agriculture gave us are correct, then the Deputy who said, on this Estimate, that the whole milk business was falling to bits was entirely wrong.  It is a good point, probably, to make against the Minister and to make against the Government, but, from the broad general point of view of the public interest, contributions of that kind are not helpful.</P>
    <P>I listened to Deputy Briscoe yesterday. He made a speech that was intended to be mischievous.  He dealt with, or tried to deal with, the difference of outlook which exists between the Labour Party here and members of the Fine Gael Party.  Everybody knows that there is a difference between the Labour Party and some members of the Fine Gael Party.  But there is, in fact, the same difference <Col N="2342" /> of outlook on the Fianna Fáil Benches. We have some members of the Fianna Fáil Party who are progressive in outlook and we have some members who are reactionary.  That proves nothing. As has been stated, this inter-Party Government is an experiment&mdash;and a very necessary experiment&mdash;because we had, unfortunately, got into the position in this country that people were being drugged into the idea that there could be only one Government in this country and it was necessary in the public interest that that drug should be expelled from the whole political system.  That is the explanation of the inter-Party Government.  There are different views on this side of the House&mdash;there is no doubt whatever about that&mdash;but every effort is being made by those people with those conflicting views to harmonise them in the public interest and that is what is being done.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The debate on this Estimate and the debate on the Estimates before it have, <Col N="2344" /> taken up a very large part of Parliamentary time.  While the Government take the line that it is the right of every Deputy to discuss and criticise Estimates, that we can spend months and months discussing these Estimates if we want to, I suggest that we are losing valuable time by the tactics which are being adopted.  There is a very big legislative programme facing the Dáil.  The Party opposite, however, has made up its mind that it is going to debate <i>ad nauseam</i> every particular Estimate.  What will the result be? That we shall be adjourning at the end of July and we shall have done nothing. Are we doing the right thing?  Is that what we were sent here for&mdash;to waste Parliamentary time and do nothing?</P>
    <P>My complaint against the Government is that they have not produced all the Bills that are on the stocks waiting to be introduced.  They ought to introduce them.  It takes very little time to get a First Reading and let the people know the legislative programme which is being held up by these long-winded discussions on the Estimates. In another Parliament a certain number of days is given to the Estimates by agreement.  Whatever can be discussed within that time is discussed and at the end of the time the Estimates are passed and the time is left for the work a Parliament should do&mdash;the passing into law of the legislation necessary for the public good.  It may be good political tactics for Fianna Fáil&mdash;I do not know.  I have seen political tactics carried out here for the past year which have been a failure.  I have seen tactics which were led by Deputy MacEntee in his attacks on each of the individual Parties who comprise the inter-Party Government&mdash;Parties that have different outlooks.</P>

      <P>I am not concerned about that.  I will not go into the matter in detail.  That will be a relief to the Party opposite.  Suffice it to say that these long speeches, which are a repetition of the speeches that have gone before, in criticism of the Minister are a waste of Parliamentary time because when we, by a majority, passed the Budget we accepted the Estimates on which that Budget was passed in principle.  Having done that, it has been a waste of Parliamentary time to have had the long discussions we have had on them.  However, that is a matter with which I have no power to deal.  If the Opposition want to obstruct the business of the Government, they have the power to do so, because this is a democratic country in which they have the right so to act.</P>
      <P>In discussing the Estimate I dealt with three matters only which I consider to be of importance.  There are many other matters in the Estimate which have been dealt with by other Deputies and I have no intention of repeating what has been said in regard to these matters.  I believe, however, that the Minister, subjected as he is to the limitations I mentioned, has worked very hard in his Department, and done valuable work.  But the work would have been more valuable, would have more lasting effect and would be more beneficial to the country if the Minister were free from all these administrative details and could be in a position to plan in a big way.  It would be better for the country if, instead of wasting time on trivialities here, we were discussing those big plans in a big way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made by Deputy <Col N="2346" /> Larkin, Deputy Connolly and other Deputies to the speech made by the Minister in Sligo.  I gather from the Minister that he will explain that statement when replying.  It was a statement that the unemployed are not anxious to work.  That was an unfortunate statement for the Minister to make.  When the old age pensions scheme first started it was condemned by a number of people who said it was giving away money for nothing and that was not right.  The same thing happened when the unemployment insurance scheme was brought in. Unemployment insurance is something to which a worker contributes in the same way as to any other insurance. He contributes his share to the fund and is paid benefit when he becomes unemployed.  There is nothing wrong ment; when a person became unemployed and his benefit on the stamps ran out, unemployment assistance was provided.  As each of those improvements came along we had people of reactionary mind saying: &ldquo;These things are bad.  Why should a man work when he is getting a few shillings?  Why should he work when he is getting the dole?&rdquo;  I am perfectly certain that the Minister, being, as I am sure he always has been and still is, a friend of the workers in his own constituency and elsewhere, never intended those words of his to be taken as a condemnation of unemployment insurance or of unemployment assistance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  I am perfectly satisfied the Minister never intended that.  It has been stated over and over again through the country that people will not work while they are in receipt of certain benefits or allowances.  I want to say that I never found that to be so.  Where you have a young person physically fit and able to work he wants to work.  He much prefers to work and earn a livelihood than draw a dole or an allowance that is insufficient to keep his body and soul together.  If the problem is examined as to the number of people who are offered employment and who refuse to accept the employment <Col N="2347" /> it will be found that those numbers are very small.  It was regrettable that the Minister's statement gave courage and hope to many enemies of the ordinary people who hate to see the facilities, inadequate as they are, that are in operation at the moment for the benefit of those people. I am glad to know that the Minister, in his reply, is going to explain that and I am perfectly certain that when he does so, the explanation will support the views that have been expressed here on this particular section of the Government Benches in regard to that problem.</P>
      <P>I would appeal to every Deputy in the House when dealing with this Estimate to endeavour to do so on the lines that I have endeavoured to deal with it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>What I should like to say in regard to the Estimate is that it is an important one and that the views of every section of the House should be given.  When Deputy Cowan has spoken here for the best part of half an hour he then accuses the Opposition of being long-winded and does his little best to more or less suggest that we are wasting time and that he is not.  I am not suggesting that Deputy Cowan wasted the time of this House.  I do not think any Deputy who gets up here and gives his honest views can be accused of wasting the time of the House.  If Deputy Cowan had a little more experience of the conduct of the affairs of this House and the attitude generally of the official Opposition in the House he would realise&mdash;and he can still realise if he is prepared to go to the trouble of perusing the official Dáil Debates&mdash;that the Opposition of the period from 1932 to 1947 wasted, as he described it, the time of the House to a considerably greater extent than the Opposition of to-day.</P>

      <P>We are criticising in a way that the members of the Government Party do not appear to like.  It is our duty to do so and because we feel it to be our duty we are going to exercise our rights to criticise.</P>
      <P>An extraordinary thing happened here to-day in respect to a question which was tabled by Deputy Con Lehane.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in reply to a supplementary question put by the Deputy, said that there was no shortage of labour for essential building.  The Minister, in the course of his own statement, said the main limiting factor in the building industry is the shortage of skilled workers.  One or the other of these gentlemen is correct, and I am prepared to believe that the Minister is correct because otherwise I feel sure that a greater effort would be put into the construction and the provision of houses for the workers of this city. But, however that may be, the workers are not there, and they are not there because there was no employment for them in the early part of 1947.  That, in my opinion, was, in the main, due to the fact that licences for essential building work were not forthcoming, and, naturally, these skilled workers, when they could not secure employment, emigrated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary, in the course of his reply to a question to-day, did say that there was work here for any of those men who returned.  I think it was on Saturday last that I read in the evening papers a letter which purported to have come from a skilled worker.  He suggested that he had returned here from England, where he had been gainfully employed, and that he had returned because of the fact that he had been informed there was plenty of work here for men of his craft.  He stated, I think, that he was now back five weeks, and had still failed to find employment.  He said that was poor encouragement for his fellow-workers, who were in England, to return here.  I do not know if the Minister responsible for housing could make these licences available.  If he could, it would, of course, greatly aid the Minister for Industry and Commerce <Col N="2350" /> in reducing the considerable number of unemployed which still exists.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowan was preening himself more or less on the fact that the cost of living here had at last been stabilised. But that is not what the Parties on the opposite side promised the people.  Every single section of them promised to reduce the cost of living by a considerable percentage.  One of the bids went to the extent of something like 30 per cent.  However that may be, Deputy Cowan is a very much wiser man to-day.  He is now inclined to do a little bit of bragging on the fact that the cost of living has been stabilised. He was a member of the Party which promised to end emigration which was bleeding this country white. I am sure that to-day he is a sadder and a wiser man with regard to the position which exists in relation to emigration. Emigration has not been brought to an end, as the public were promised it would be by reason of the employment which these gentlemen proposed they would procure for the unemployed.  So that we have that problem still.  The Minister himself on one occasion made the statement in this House that it was a problem which could be solved in 24 hours.  I have no doubt that he may have believed that at the time he made the statement by reason of the fact that he had not the experience which he has since gained during his period in office.  That may be all to the good.  It probably means that we will have a much better informed Dáil in the future as a result of the experience gained by the members of the Government while in office.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowan also deplored the fact that boys in this city are unable to secure employment, that they are more or less running wild through the streets of the city, and that parents were caused considerable pain because of their failure to fix those boys in some kind of employment.  I would like to remind the Deputy that the former Government did something&mdash;I am not going to describe it as a remedy&mdash;to try and meet that particular statement of his.  At any rate, it was an effort <Col N="2351" /> to try and do something to deal with the situation which existed in regard to these boys.  I refer to the establishment of the Construction Corps.  As most Deputies will remember, it aimed at taking these boys off the streets and of teaching them, as far as it was possible to teach them, a craft, or to give them the skill which it is necessary for a skilled labourer to possess.  As a result of the establishment of that corps, quite a large number of these boys, taken away from the dangers which existed on the streets, were trained and disciplined.  The teaching of discipline is a very necessary asset for every boy.  They were disciplined and, generally, they were made better citizens than they otherwise would be. I am quite prepared to admit that that was not the work of the Army, and if the Minister for Defence conceived it to be his duty to disestablish the Construction Corps by reason of the fact that it was not a unit of the Army, he was perfectly entitled to do so.  I mention that by way of suggesting, in reply to the remarks of Deputy Cowan, that perhaps the Minister might consider the possibility of taking over that idea, and that some means might be devised whereby these boys could be given the same type of training as that which was given to the boys who were in the Construction Corps.  That is a matter that might be taken up either by the Minister's Department or the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>I am now going to refer to a matter that I know is not in the Estimate. I am aware of the fact that the Minister, in reply to a suggestion by Deputy Lemass about Córas Iompair Eireann, said that the work on the station in Store Street had not ceased. The impression that I have from passing that building every day in the week and sometimes twice a day, is that all work on the building has ceased. There may, of course, be a good reason for that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I might explain to the Deputy.  The position there, I am informed, is this&mdash;the Deputy will appreciate that there are several contracts for different parts of the work&mdash;that the main contractors <Col N="2352" /> have finished their job.  At the moment they are just finishing up prior to the other contractors taking over and continuing with their part of the work. There is no question, however, of instructions being given by anybody that the contract for the building is not to go on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to hear that.  I am sure the Minister himself would be the first to realise that the unfortunate people who come mainly from the country deserve better treatment than they are getting at the moment.  We all know that they have to stand on the southern quays in what is perhaps one of the draughtiest parts of the city.  I am glad to see also that the Minister is going into the question of industrial research.  I think that is highly desirable work to undertake. It is work which, I believe, will eventually pay dividends, because if the industries of this country are ever to prosper and reach their full 100 per cent. productive capacity, we must, as far as possible, make our own raw materials available for them.  I believe the industrial research which is now taking place will produce quite a number of ingredients which will go a long way towards providing raw materials for some of our industries.</P>
      <P>I am glad to see that the Minister is going ahead with the protection of the industries which are established here. There is no doubt that those industries, even though they have been established for a decade or more, will need help, every little bit of help the Government can give, to ensure that they will eventually reach the standard reached by similar industries in other countries.  It is only by that type of benevolent protection that that can be secured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not too happy about this industrial authority that is being established here.  If the Minister has confidence in it, I suppose that is all that counts at the moment.  As long as that industrial authority is not used as a buffer by the Minister, I shall be perfectly satisfied. I hope it will do more than merely recommend that an industry should be placed here and an industry should be placed there.  The policy of the former <Col N="2353" /> Government was to decentralise as far as possible the various industries as they were being established.  If proof of that were needed it can be seen by any person travelling throughout the country.  Not only are they scattered widely, but they have been established on what would appear to be a pretty firm basis.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that he was, in a limited way, going to end quotas. I think that would be a very desirable thing.  It may be that in certain industries quotas will have to be continued, but in the main I think the Minister would be well advised if he set his mind as far as possible against the influx of large quantities of industrial goods.</P>
    <P>There were also remarks by the Minister with reference to a prejudice against Irish industry.  That is of very long standing and it is something the industry itself will wear down.  It can do it by the production of goods of a quality which will at least equal if it does not exceed the quality of those coming in.  I have no reason to doubt that our industrialists are capable of producing goods the equal, if not the superior, of any that come into the country.</P>
    <P>I am also glad that the Minister is about to carry out experiments in relation to turf.  The potentials which exist in regard to turf are to a large extent unknown, but it is quite possible, if the scientific people who will undertake research work in regard to the different classes of things which can be secured from turf are successful, that they will be able to provide to a large extent a lot of the raw material required by many of our industries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>There are undoubtedly a number of matters which arise on this Estimate that require serious consideration and, while I must admit a number of Deputies approached the Estimate in a constructive way, I should like to say to other Deputies, sitting on both sides of the House, that it is no longer political propaganda that is wanted, but planning and imagination. We should have before us an ideal of the country we want to make and a passionate desire so to make it. <Col N="2354" /> If we contemplate a little more on this Estimate and what it means to our people, we will do much better for the country.</P>
      <P>I want to deal, first of all, with unemployment in the woollen industry. We stand for the necessary protection for all our industries from unfair competition, foreign or otherwise.  In standing for that, I should like to see more co-operation from the manufacturers, and a desire to make a 100 per cent job of Irish industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to know from the Minister if it is true that of the 12,000,000 yards of cloth required for this country in 1948, there were only 5,445,000 yards produced by Irish manufacturers, and that left upwards of 8,500,000 yards of imported material.  I also know that our blanket requirements can be supplied by all the mills in this country. These are situated throughout the country areas, they give very useful employment and it means the decentralisation of industry, as some Deputies have rightly said.  I am informed by persons engaged in that industry that in 1936 there were 6,000 pairs of blankets imported and in 1947-48 there were over 70,000 pairs imported.  That means that employment of a permanent nature is no longer possible in that industry.  I should like to know if it is true that in 1947 there were 8,557,000 yards of cloth imported and in 1948 6,349,000 yards imported.  If that is so, and I am inclined to believe it is, that means that the woollen and worsted industry is not sufficiently developed to meet the requirements of our people. My reasoning is that it has never been developed sufficiently to meet the requirements of our people and the industry is able to cater for only 45 per cent. of the nation's requirements, which means that 55 per cent. has to be imported.  I want to impress upon the Minister that if that industry were developed to such an extent as to enable it to cater for the requirements of our own people at least the number employed at the present time could be doubled.  I am informed that at the moment a good deal of cloth is being exported.  That is a very important development, but I would like the Minister <Col N="2355" /> to ensure that those directing this industry have not divided interests. Our aim should be to make a decent job of our industries one by one.  We should develop them 100 per cent. and give employment to our people.  I am not satisfied that some of those in charge of our industries have not divided interests.</P>
    <P>With regard to shipping, what control is exercised over our shipping? Who is engaged in looking after our ships and our export and import trade?  We have a population of 2,900,000.  One-third of that number reside in Munster.  Surely the people in Munster should get a reasonable percentage of cargoes coming in or being sent out of the country through their own ports in the South.  In Munster we own at least one-third of the cattle population.  We own 40 per cent of the horses.  What do we find with regard to trading in cattle and horses?  In the year 1947, 233, 144 cattle were exported from Dublin; 41,415 were exported from Cork; Dublin exported 11,542 horses and Cork 1,584. With regard to general cargoes, in 1947, 26,808 tons of oranges were imported through Dublin, while 109 tons were imported through Cork. With regard to wheat, 22,361 tons were imported through Cork, while 106,562 tons were imported through Dublin. We come then to sugar; 1,556 tons of sugar were imported through Cork and 19,763 tons through Dublin.  The people of Munster consume a good deal of tea, but only 1,919 tons of tea were imported through Cork, while 12,201 tons were imported through Dublin. There were only 2,768 tons of paper imported through Cork, while 21,744 tons were imported through Dublin. Altogether there were 290,880 tons more cargo imported through Dublin as compared with Cork.  The people have to pay the extra cost of transport on these different commodities.  Yesterday it was remarked that I was appreciative of what was done about shipping by the last Government, but nothing was done until the Government was forced by events to do it.  If the Minister will look up the files in his Department he will see there correspondence from people in Cork back <Col N="2356" /> in 1941 and 1942 pressing for a revival of shipping through the port of Cork. I remember on one occasion, between 1938 and 1943, when in one year alone Cork merchants paid in freight as much as would have bought 40 ships. Complaint was made about that at the time, but no heed was given to that complaint.  I am inclined to believe&mdash; I say this out of no spirit of vindictiveness&mdash;that the present situation is due to the fact that advice is taken from vested interests rather than from those who are interested in the country as a whole.  I think the Minister should safeguard against that in the future.  If he wants advice in connection with industry he should take that advice from those who have the interests of the country at heart and who have a proper sense of patriotism.</P>
    <P>I endorse all that has been said about the need for increasing our shipping. At the end of the war Norway had 2,700,000 tons of shipping.  That has now increased to 4,800,000 tons, and 2,000,000 tons are in course of construction at the moment.  I do not know if we have even reached the million mark.  A question was asked to-day about the percentage of goods carried in Irish ships.  There, again, I am anxious that the Minister should take a hand and make someone responsible to this House for the development of that important industry and its subsequent direction and control.</P>
    <P>With regard to our mineral resources, I think nobody can have any doubts as to what our views are.  A good deal of unfair propaganda has been spread in an endeavour to make it appear as if the present Government is not interested in our mineral resources.  I think mineral resources are something upon which the Minister should concentrate. As far back as 1918 there was a large export through the port of Cork of barytes from a mine in West Cork.  When our own Government was formed I presume that vested interests closed down that mine.  A rather strange development has taken place in recent months.  A Hungarian is now shipping barytes from West Cork.  It is odd that we should wait until a Hungarian comes along to do that.  I do not think our disinclination is <Col N="2357" /> entirely due to fear of investing in such an industry.  I think it is due more to the fact that we have not got effective Government control to ensure that these important industries are developed with State help and State supervision.</P>
    <P>There has been a good deal of discussion here about the necessity for increased output.  I think it was Deputy Briscoe who said that there was an implied threat to the industrialists in the suggestion that there should be part ownership by the workers and some share in the management of these industries.  I have long thought and believed that the workers invest all they have got to invest.  They invest their bodies, their brains, their skill and their experience and their labour is as necessary to industry as capital is.  Surely they have a right to part ownership, control and a share in the management of such industries. The sooner we think along these lines the better it will be.  Our present economic system is fraught with contention and strife.  The reason for that is because the worker is not treated as he should be.  I am satisfied that the workers would respond satisfactorily if they were given some share in responsibility. At the present moment the worker feels that he has no status. Speakers on the Fianna Fáil Benches talk as if the industrialists were alarmed and shocked and as if they had no guarantee and no security.  If anybody takes the trouble to analyse the position of the industrialists in this country for a number of years back he will find very quickly that they are well looked after.</P>
    <P>In 1938, for instance, 284 concerns were making a profit of over £2,000 a year.  In 1947-48 that number had risen to 908.  If anyone compares the figures of those liable to surtax in the years 1935 to 1937 and in the year 1944-45 he will find that 1,169 were added to that number.  In other words, we created 1,169 new rich.  If these people have any worries I cannot understand why Deputies should take the extreme step of trying to ventilate them here. Do not forget that the workers have grievances.  The sooner we appreciate the fact that the worker is entitled to <Col N="2358" /> a proper status in industry the sooner we shall have industrial peace.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention as another important matter the development of our slate quarries.  I remember we started an agitation some years ago for the purpose of ensuring that corporation houses in Cork should be roofed with slates.  We have slate quarries in West Cork, in Killaloe and various other places throughout the country.  Subsequently we got expert advice in regard to the Cork houses. The expert advice prevailed and, as a result, I do not know that there is 1 per cent. of the houses built by Cork Corporation roofed with slates produced in this country.  I made some inquiries in regard to the destination of the output of the Killaloe quarry and I discovered that the best customers of that quarry for small slates were the Glasgow Corporation.  These are matters which would indicate that we are allowing a group of men in this country to dominate our industrial policy and the result is that we have no decent industrial development.  I am glad to see this new body set up. I hope it will be an independent body and that they will set themselves to the task of seeing that industrial development is carried on in this country in the best interests of the people as a whole.</P>
    <P>I am informed that there are certain people manufacturing goods in this country who have to pay royalties to English combines on the goods which they produce.  The sooner we get down to these things and eliminate such interference with industrial development the sooner we shall develop our industrial arm from an Irish standpoint. Deputy Briscoe last night said he did not think anybody could advocate that workers should have a say in the management of industry.  I am at a loss to understand how any man in this House can consistently advocate political democracy if he is not prepared to advocate the same principles on the industrial side.  I think any other attitude would be quite inconsistent.  The democratic principle of industrial development is that the great mass of the workers should have a say in the industry in <Col N="2359" /> which they are employed.  I should like to see the Minister get around him a group of men who are not so much interested in the profits of industry, as many of them are, but men who have a sense of patriotism, a sense of justice in their hearts and souls, who feel that they have a duty for the common good rather than towards the privileged few.  If there is anything for which I had to criticise the Deputies now in opposition during the 16 years when they had control of the Government it was the fact that they took too much dictation from those people who were interested in the privileged few rather than the Irish people as a whole.  If the Minister is not going to teach these people he will have no one more critical of his policy than I shall be.  I believe the Irish people want more consideration and are entitled to more consideration than they have got in the past from these people.</P>
    <P>We hear a lot about the expansion of industry in this country, but I do not want to see such an expansion confined to petty industries employing little groups of girls here and there whilst the manhood of the country must emigrate.  We must try to develop big, heavy industries such as the steel industry.  If we are going to make any real industrial progress we must have such heavy industries to provide the raw materials for smaller subsidiary industries.  The people of Ireland want changes, bold changes and carefully planned changes in the economy of the country.  So far as the working class are concerned, any Party which is prepared to initiate these changes will get 100 per cent. support from them any time they want it.</P>

I really rise in this debate to deal with a subject with which I am fairly familiar and to reply to the contribution made by Deputy M.J. O'Higgins to this debate wherein he referred to the Minister's dealing with the butchers.  As reported in Volume 115, No. 15, column 2113, of the Dáil Debates, Deputy O'Higgins said, dealing with this question:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I am going to talk about sheep and beef in my own way.  At any rate, there were a great number of Parliamentary Questions asked by Fianna Fáil Deputies regarding the Minister's attitude towards butchers. It was not until the Minister put it bluntly to the Deputies opposite what their position was and did they want to see the price going down for the farmers or did they want to see the price of meat raised on the consumers in Dublin, that those very Deputies decided that possibly the best thing they could do would be to revert to the tactics they employed when they were supporting their own Government and so they remained silent.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I contend that no section of the community should be controlled to such an extent that they lose, month after month, in their particular business and are driven to the point of bankruptcy in order to keep down the cost of living.  That has been the fate of the butchers under this Ministry.  Let me state certain facts.  Under the previous Government, retail prices for meat were fixed in November, 1947, when the average price for cattle on the Dublin market was 82/10 per cwt. live weight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2361" /> Deputy O'Higgins, as reported in the same volume, also at column 2113, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;These people made no secret to any Deputy on this side of the House of the fact that they had met Deputy Lemass prior to the general election which resulted in Fianna Fáil Deputies occupying the benches on the opposite side and he had promised them an increase, but told them it would not be convenient for him to announce it for the present. It was because that promise was given to them by Deputy Lemass that the present Minister felt that he had to honour it and an increase of, I think, 1d. per lb. was given shortly after the present Minister took office.</P>
    <P>The butchers certainly were not content with that.  They overlooked the fact that they were not now dealing with Deputy Lemass and I think, inside a fortnight or so, they were back looking for more.  After months of effort, and supported in the manner I have indicated by Fianna Fáil Deputies, eventually they decided that they were dealing with a different kind of proposition and a new Minister, and they were not going to get the increase in the price of meat.  They realised that this Minister conceived it to be one of his duties to protect the interests of the consumers in Dublin and throughout the country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass was approached all right at the time of the general election, but he could not deal with them. His successors dealt with them and in March, 1948, 1d. per lb. was allowed in the price of meat because the price of meat had gone up to 88/10 per cwt. The price of meat to-day, however, averages 103/- a cwt. and in the 12 months up to last April it has averaged 95/- a cwt.  It is a case of who will survive now, and the weakest will come to the wall.  I contend that this association is entitled to justice.  They have shown and can show that they are losing week after week, particularly at this time of the year.  I make their case here and Deputies of every Party on the opposite benches know that they are entitled to consideration.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2362" /> A lawyer, a solicitor, is not asked to reduce his fees by half and neither is any other professional man.  Neither is the trade unionist working for the butcher asked to reduce his wages nor the butcher's help nor the landlord nor the supplier of light or water.  These particular people have their backs to the wall and, whether it is a case of increasing the cost of living by a point or not, they have justice on their side and need fair play.  I ask for reconsideration of the whole matter.  I know the trade inside out.  I belong to that trade myself and my people for three generations and I know that at present it is a case of the survival of the man with the longest purse.  Since the Minister's agreement in March, 1948, the price of cattle has gone up by 15/-a cwt. live weight and any Deputy can compute how much per lb. that is as you can double that for dead weight. These people have a case if they are not to close up and cease business.</P>
    <P>Of course you can have nationalisation of that industry.  Nationalisation is in the air.  I am not all out for nationalisation.  I think there is too much of it in this State.  Córas Iompair Éireann and the position it is in is being thrown at this Party and we are given to believe that the present Government are for the nationalisation of the railways.  I would ask the House to examine the countries where the railways are nationalised and see do they pay.  Even in countries where private enterprise is in operation and where road transport is not restricted are any railways paying?  It will be found that they are not but that there are huge losses.  If the Government have a nationalisation programme they will have to bring in a big subsidy each year to pay the deficit on railway transport unless there is complete restriction of road transport.  We have too much nationalisation altogether, of water power, turf and fuel production. We are a threequarters Socialist State.</P>
    <P>I am not one of those who stand for doing away with the profit motive.  I stand for the profit motive.  The greatest incentive to industry is a right and fair profit.  I do not believe in the system of going into every shop and <Col N="2363" /> pegging a man and nationalising it to the glory of the State, and for its greater advantage, making everybody slaves, State slaves.</P>

      <P>That advocacy is there always.  There are more ways of choking a dog than with butter.</P>
      <P>The Deputy has talked about the woollen industry and I am with him on that.  We should not send our wool across the water to get it back in the shape of yarn.  The industry should be developed here from the shearing, the combing and scouring to the manufacture of the yarn.  We should not send it to Yorkshire and get it back for the final process of manufacture.  I know a little about this, because I buy a small amount of wool in my own area and generations before me have bought it.  When the Government tackle this question they are up against a terrific combine, terrific interests, and they will be shown how important it is to do this, that or the other, but it is a problem well worth tackling.  The labour content is great.  If we have every process of the manufacture here in Ireland, from shearing the sheep to putting the coat on the man or the woman, a wonderful amount of labour will be employed.  I know that in Cork certain firms have done wonders and they have not had the whole crop or near it.  There is a lot more to be done.  I am not an expert, but I know enough from the late Deputy Fred Crowley, who represented Kerry, and who knew a lot about this business, having been trained in Leeds, to know that there is a lot to be done to establish a fully working industry in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins&mdash;I do not know his exact words&mdash;backed the Minister for Finance in the statement that we were urging people to go on the register in the unemployment exchanges.  I do not know what foundation he has for that statement.  I urged nobody, and I do not know that any Deputy in my immediate vicinity urged anybody, to register.  The unemployed do not want to be told to register, as they <Col N="2364" /> know that unemployment assistance is there.  I do not know what the basis of this statement was, but I think it was malicious on the part of the Minister for Finance and malicious repetition on the part of Deputy O'Higgins. You have a return of the number of men who are not working and if the Government is to carry out its promises to the unemployed, it should take cognisance of the number on the register.  In my own town in January, February and March I see them lined up, having come in several miles to register.  They would not have done that if they were not unemployed.  I did not put it to them to come, neither did Deputy Carter nor Deputy Childers. They were unemployed and they came in to register.  I know a considerable number of schemes in my own locality which could be operated to give them work.  I am approaching this subject as impartially as I can.  It is a very wrong principle for a Government Department, when there are 100 or 200 men registered in an area in the month of January in a particular year, to start turning over files to find out how many were registered there the previous year and if there were only 25 to decide that they would give an allocation of money only to give employment to 25.  That is a case of &ldquo;Live horse and you will get grass&rdquo;.  There will have to be a different approach to the problem.  I know you cannot go round from day to day to solve it, but if unemployment becomes bad in an area it should be relieved within a short period.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies have spoken of small industries.  I should second their efforts in stressing the importance of sustaining the ones that exist and establishing new ones.  In the debate on the glass-houses a year ago, we heard Deputy Cowan's repeated loquacious &ldquo;How many do they employ?&rdquo; in a most sarcastic way.  It does not matter whether it is 100 men or only a few.  If I can get ten or even one man extra into employment, it is ten or one taken off the dole and getting something approaching a living wage.  Every man put into employment is to the national good and every man who goes out of employment is a national disadvantage. It is not essential we should have big <Col N="2365" /> numbers.  Are we to wait for an industry capable of employing 1,000, and turn down one that will employ only 900?  The baker and the candlestick maker have a place in our economy and the more diversified it is the better for everybody.</P>
    <P>I again make the case for the butchers, who are hard working people in a hard industry which requires strength and skill and who are an essential section of the community. They are working at a loss and cannot be asked to do so indefinitely.  They have a just case, which the Minister may examine under a microscope if he likes.  The more microscopically he examines it, the more he will find it is impossible for them to continue.  I plead with him, with the Government and with the House to give them justice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the most mixed Departments we have in the State.  It is much too unwieldy for one Minister and should be divided amongst three or four.  The nation is satisfied that we have the right man at the helm, a big, broadminded man, who has a national outlook.  I know the nation has full confidence in his steering of our industrial development. He has a hard and difficult task and many problems to solve which are unsolvable to the ordinary man.  There are many muddles, some of which were left by the last Government and which should not have been muddles at all&mdash; there is the transport muddle, the turf and coal muddle, the dumps in the Park, the black-marketeers, the Border smuggling, and so on.  These things have been let go on for six or eight years, and leave a bad taste in our mouths.  Something must be done to clear them off before we can get a proper industrial organisation.  The Minister has the sympathy of everybody in clearing up these messes.  The transport mess is a headache for him. Some people have decried nationalisation. Who wants nationalisation if it can be avoided, but how can we avoid it in transport?  How can an efficient transport service be provided out of the present muddle otherwise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Hickey that one <Col N="2366" /> of the chief drawbacks is the want of a proper mercantile marine to carry our goods to and fro.  This is an important question and I hope the Minister will make a drive for a first-class mercantile marine.  Then, if another emergency occurs, we will be able to weather the storm.</P>
    <P>Turf is one of our principal industries and, properly handled, it can give immense employment and provide a valuable fuel.  The machine-won turf on the market at present can be of immense value to the whole country, and I hope the Minister will further the machine-turf plans in every way. By having our bogs properly utilised, we will provide work for our people and avoid importing vast quantities of coal as in the past.</P>
    <P>The Minister's statement shows that he has the decentralisation of industry clearly centred in his mind.  That is as it should be.  In the early stages of our industrial development far too many of our bigger industries were allowed to become centred in big places like Dublin and Cork.  That was all wrong.  Once they were allowed to get a grip in that way it is hard to change that.  The only hope of a properly balanced economy is to start new industries around other centres of population.  There are many fair-sized towns which have been passed by in our industrial development.  It may be that the local people had not proper initiative or that there was not the right drive at the time.  A town like Mullingar in the centre of Ireland could be a thriving industrial town, but it is not, and I would ask the Minister to keep it in mind.  We will change the whole face of the country if towns like that are given a proper balance.</P>
    <P>Our industrial arm is slowly but surely taking shape on proper lines and we will have a balanced economy if it goes on as it has gone for the last eight or ten years.  In another ten years our country will be properly balanced.  I am satisfied that, under the guidance of the present Minister, it will go in the right direction.  There is necessity for the select body the Minister is setting up.  It is not to-day or yesterday it was needed, but many years ago.  The public were not getting <Col N="2367" /> proper value and opportunists got into the industry and held control. They were not there for the good of the country but were out for quick and easy money.  Too many of them got that and then they cleared out while the going was good.  There are ruins and wrecks of so-called factories which were started by Fianna Fáil when they came into office.  Every back street has its ruins in town and city.  The nation had to pay for that damage.  We should see that Irish capital and Irish management is used almost completely in the development of our industrial arm.</P>
    <P>I do not believe in outside interference in these matters.  There is such a thing as an industrial development which is not capable of being brought about within the country and in respect of which outside guidance is necessary, but, as far as possible, Irish management and Irish capital should be our object in our industrial development drive.  Many of the industries which have been started in this country were started by men, slick men, who will not use their own names, and I believe that no industry should start in this country unless under the name or names of the men or group of men starting them.  There are men using Irish names and using Irishmen as &ldquo;stooges&rdquo;, while they, international hoboes of a type we would be better off without, remain behind the scenes. I believe they should be forced to put their own names over their doors.  It is one of the matters which has been allowed to drift, and I know that there are many industries with Irish names which are being used by international slick boys to get away with rich rewards, and I hope that in future these men will be compelled to put their own names over their doors. Many of us would be unable to pronounce the names, if they were put over the doors, but they should be forced to put them there.</P>
    <P>Many people say that there is so much adverse criticism of Irish industry that it cannot succeed, but it is only right that there should be criticism of industry, if it is not being carried on on the proper lines, and, <Col N="2368" /> over a great number of years, industry here was carried on on lines which were not calculated to create public confidence in them.  Many of the articles produced by Irish industrialists were not of a superior quality and I remember that, when we started making spades and shovels, the articles produced were of very inferior quality, so much so that farmers hated to buy them, but, as the years went on, vast improvements were made and many of these articles being produced to-day are as good as any that can be imported. I saw farmers buying shovels and spades the handles of which were rotten, with the result that, before a cart was loaded, one or two handles had broken.  In addition, one could hear the &ldquo;bothered&rdquo; sound in the spade or shovel, and a good farmer knows by the sound of the metal whether a spade or shovel is good or not.  People were paying dear prices for these articles and they were entitled to be critical of faults of that kind.  The industrial drive under Fianna Fáil was satisfactory, but I feel that they allowed too many outsiders and slick boys to get control of the management of many of the concerns, with the result that there were flops, and there was no need for flops because the tariffs imposed were adequate to prop up the industries.  Many of these men, however, did not want to be propped up; they merely wanted to get out while the going was good.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister cannot do very much with regard to the supply of cigarettes, beyond asking the different manufacturers to help those starting new shops.  In the past six or seven years many small shops&mdash;some owned by ex-Army men&mdash;have been started and the owners find that they cannot get a cigarette quota.  When they ask the manufacturers for a supply, they get the curt reply that they cannot get it.  That is not fair, because I know that many of the people who were getting a full quota, in my area at any rate, were not giving them across the counter to their customers.</P>

      <P>I know that they are controlled by the manufacturers and I want the Minister to try to induce the manufacturers to ease the position because there are many people throughout the country to-day who cannot get a quota.  As I say, many of those who were getting a quota were not selling the cigarettes across the counter.  In the Midlands, vans came down weekly or monthly and went from shop to shop collecting cigarettes, which were then brought across the Border.  There were, and are, men reaping immense profits out of this practice and I think it should be stopped because it is time that such racketeering was stopped.</P>

      <P>With regard to asbestos sheeting, the Minister for Agriculture has embarked on a drive in connection with poultry and nearly every farmer is endeavouring to build a poultry house in his yard.  They find that, when they look for the topping for the house, they cannot get the asbestos sheeting, and I should like to see an effort made to make more of this sheeting available, by importing it if it cannot be provided by a manufacturing process here.  Many of these men have to leave their poultry houses unroofed because they cannot get the sheeting.</P>
      <P>The Minister has a hard task, a thankless task, but I believe he is capable of standing up to it.  It is only a man of his type who can clear up many of the messes created by the war and by the mishandling of industrial matters by some of the Fianna Fáil Ministers in the past.  He has the confidence of the people in doing his work and the confidence of every group forming the Government.  We say to him: &ldquo;Carry on the good work.  You are laying the foundation of a real Irish industrial arm and we hope you will make every effort to see that Irish industrial development is controlled by Irishmen in the interests of Irishmen.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had a strike in the Castlecomer collieries for almost the past two months.  The Labour Court made an effort to settle the dispute and I should like to ask the Minister to use his good offices in an endeavour to have the possibility of a settlement re-examined and not to allow the position to obtain, if it is the position, that matters will be left in the air.  As Deputies have mentioned, these industries in rural Ireland are of the greatest importance to the communities who depend upon them and the fact that there are nearly 500 men out of employment creates a very serious loss not alone for the men affected and their families, but for the traders and the economic life of the district.</P>
      <P>The factory opened in Kilkenny last year for the manufacture of metal products had occasion to have recourse to the Department for certain assistance in regard to the reorganisation of their business, and I trust the Minister will be able to give them the assistance they require.  It would be very unfortunate if, when an industry is started through the enterprise of local people who have shown their interest in the undertaking by subscribing a substantial amount of capital, its progress should be held up through initial difficulties and even its chances of ultimate success jeopardised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>References have been made to the boot and shoe and the woollen industries, in both of which industries I am interested.  I was glad to hear the Minister state that, in respect of boots and shoes, he is examining the possibility of securing an export trade for the over capacity which apparently exists in the Irish boot and shoe manufacturing industry.  There is a very considerable amount of valuable employment for skilled labour and highly paid operatives involved in this industry.  This industry did very good work for the community during the emergency period and I hope that the Minister's efforts to secure an export trade will be successful.  If they are not successful, I hope that any further steps that are necessary and that can be taken for the limitation of imports will be <Col N="2371" /> taken in order to guarantee secure employment to those employed in the boot and shoe factories.</P>
    <P>The woollen trade is one of the oldest Irish industries.  It has a special reputation even outside this country, and I would be glad if the Minister, when he is replying, would let us know what are the possibilities of developing an export trade greater than that which already exists.  In 1947 we exported about 356,000 square yards of woollen and worsted tissues, and in 1948 we exported 403,000 square yards but, as far as I can read the figures, the amount which we received for the 403,000 square yards was £166,000, as against £203,000 which we received for the 356,000 square yards, so that although the amount of our exports increased there seemed to be a substantial fall, in the neighbourhood of 40 per cent., in the amount received per square yard.  Then, in regard to yarns, we exported 886,000 square yards in 1947 and that brought in £286,000.  In 1948 we exported only 564,000 square yards which gave a return of £241,000, so that there was an actual diminution in the return we received.</P>
    <P>When the Minister was recommending the Anglo-Irish Agreement to the House he stated that we would have a considerable free list in the English market, and I think he mentioned that about £750,000 worth at least would be sold.  At a later stage the Taoiseach mentioned that a figure of £1,500,000 worth of exports was being considered. He did not say that that amount had been exported but the implication from his words was that it was expected that about £1,500,000 worth would be exported under that free list. I think the Minister ought to give the House whatever information is at his disposal as to whether the expectations in regard to that free list have been justified or not.</P>
    <P>The House will remember that in regard to the homespun industry the Minister for Lands told us that that industry was practically dead, that it was impossible to find an outlet although, when the Anglo-Irish Agreement was signed, there was very extensive <Col N="2372" /> propaganda in some of the newspapers about the looms being set working and additional factories being started.  I hope that what has happened in the homespun industry is not characteristic of what is happening in other branches.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned seaweed and seaweed products.  He said it would be very valuable for the Gaeltacht.  We would all be glad to help the Gaeltacht if we can get markets for their products.</P>
    <P>The Department of Industry and Commerce is a very large Department and it is, I think, charged with responsibility for the industrial alcohol factories.  I understand that a certain proposal has been under consideration there for the production of sulphate of ammonia and copper sulphate.  I wonder could the Minister let us know whether these proposals are to be implemented and whether the graduates who are expecting to get employment as a result may rest assured that they will not have to leave the country.  The Minister might take a special interest in the position of young Irish graduates who, certainly, if they have to leave the country will not find very much difficulty in getting employment elsewhere. In Great Britain and possibly in other countries there is intense demand for Irish chemists and graduates in engineering and science, and if we cannot hold our graduates, in the first place, by trying to create openings for them, and, in the second place, by assuring them of reasonable remuneration, we shall lose them, and our industries will suffer as a consequence.</P>
    <P>While I am very glad that the Minister has taken up the plans which were there in regard to turf and means to go ahead to the fullest possible extent, using all the resources necessary to exploit the bogs so far as the machine-won turf programme is concerned, I am sorry that he had no word to say about the hand-won turf.  Even though the concentration is to be almost entirely upon machine-won turf, the hand-won turf industry is of such importance in a large part of the country that I think the Minister might at least have given Bord na Móna some kind of controlling <Col N="2373" /> influence, some kind of supervisory duty in regard to that industry, that he might have asked them to encourage the formation of co-operative societies or, at least, to see that producers will feel that the Government have not entirely lost interest in the hand-won turf.  Even if it were only from a token point of view, some responsibility should attach to the organisation which is charged with control of machine-won turf to review the position in the hand-won turf areas occasionally.</P>
    <P>Naturally, in these machine-won turf projects certain parts of the country will not benefit.  I think we can all agree with Deputy Lemass that there is a great deal that could be done by voluntary effort to encourage local authorities to provide turf for their institutions, as they have been doing, to encourage State Departments&mdash;the Army has always given a very good example in that matter&mdash;to get their fuel requirements as far as possible from the turf areas, and also to try and get the local authorities to do their share.  It was the intention that, where State assistance was being given to industries or institutions or local authorities, the State should endeavour to see that, in so far as was possible, home-produced fuel would be utilised. I am sure it is only necessary to mention that matter to get the Minister to take an interest in it.  Otherwise, if home-produced fuel is to disappear completely nobody is going to have any responsibility in regard to the matter.</P>
    <P>I notice that in Westport when the Minister was addressing the chamber of commerce&mdash;I did not know they had a chamber of commerce in my native town, but apparently they have&mdash;one of the statements he is reported to have made was that</P>
    <P>&ldquo;the need for considering carefully the wider implications of major proposals was the main reason for the apparent slowness in making decisions which the public found so hard to understand.  The development of industry came within that category.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not know exactly what that means.  It seems to me that Government policy in general in regard to <Col N="2374" /> larger issues has to be determined and decisions have to be come to in regard to larger issues before smaller issues dealing with industrial development can be reached.  The general complaint we have of the present administration of the Department is that it is lacking in that drive and enthusiasm and that capacity for quick decisions which is necessary if industrial development is to proceed as speedily as Deputies from all sides of this House seem to desire.  In setting up this Industrial Development Authority, as Deputy Lemass has pointed out, it is surely obvious that instead of speeding up industrial projects there is the greatest likelihood that they will be further delayed.  As Deputy Lemass said, it is like adding a fifth wheel to a coach.  I do not intend to go into the question of the industrial authority very fully at this stage.  I simply want to remind the House that its terms of reference are as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  to initiate proposals and schemes for the creation and development of Irish industries;</P>
    <P>(ii)  to survey possibilities of further industrial development;</P>
    <P>(iii)  to advise on steps necessary and desirable for establishing new industries;</P>
    <P>(iv)  to advise on steps necessary for the expansion and modernisation of existing industries;</P>
    <P>(v)  to investigate the effects of protective measures, with special reference to employment, prices, quality of goods, wage levels and conditions of employment;</P>
    <P>(vi)  to examine, if and when required, any proposals submitted to the authority by the Government relating to the imposition or revision of tariffs, quotas or other protective or developmental measures;</P>
    <P>(vii)  to give advice and guidance to persons contemplating starting new industries or expanding existing industries, and</P>
    <P>(viii)  to advise on any other matter relating to industrial development referred to the authority by the Government.</P>
    <P>We had a full-time tariff commission <Col N="2375" /> here and I think most of the time of the commission was occupied in dealing with matters which came before them.  In regard to any one of these eight headings which I have read out I think it would nearly take a full-time body to deal with them adequately.  It is obvious that unless this authority is going to have quite a large number of officials and a great many specialists to hand&mdash;if they are given work to do under all of these headings or even under most of these headings&mdash;there is bound to be considerable delay.  When the authority reports to the Minister, obviously, no matter what Deputy Larkin or others may say, there will be questions of Governmental policy.  It will not be entirely, I presume, a question for the Minister although the principle of collective responsibility is not always strictly adhered to in the present Government.  There is also the question of the personnel of the authority.  In appointing representatives to commissions or authorities which are going to have executive or advisory powers, I think we will all agree that it is not advisable that those appointed should be said to represent specific particular interests. There can be no objection, I think, to putting a banker or an industrialist or a labour man or a civil servant on an authority.  It does not matter what particular interest the individual may come from, but if the individual feels that on that authority he is there to represent that particular interest, obviously difficulties may arise.  Take, for example, the appointment of a labour representative on a concern dealing with banking.  He goes on to that banking concern, not by any means giving up his own particular point of view, but simply acting as he thinks right in the general national interest. He does the best he can from day to day, as matters arise, and he deals with them, like his colleagues, having regard to the general interest.  He does not come to the decisions he has to make hampered by previous announcements and statements in which he expressed definitely particular points of view.</P>
    <P>For example, let us take the question of nationalisation.  If a person who is <Col N="2376" /> appointed to a particular authority of this kind has definitely and publicly proclaimed in his former capacity that he stands for nationalisation, and that certain industries in the country should be nationalised, are we to take it&mdash;if the question of the future of these industries is referred to the industrial authority&mdash;that they are to be considered from the point of view of nationalisation, having regard to the former Party programme of a member of the industrial authority or have we any assurance that such a person will forget his previous predilections or previous pronouncements in regard to nationalisation?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given the Central Bank as an example.  In that case, so far as I know, we had not, as we have in this case during the past few months, pronouncements with regard to nationalisation.  However, I do not want to be in any way unfair.  We shall have another opportunity of discussing the matter.  We have had references to private enterprise in this matter of industrial development. Until this question of nationalisation began to loom so largely in connection with Córas Iompair Éireann and other industries, I assumed that the main Party in the Government stood for <Col N="2377" /> private enterprise and for the encouragement by every means possible of private undertakings.  It is quite obvious that you either stand for private enterprise and are going to encourage private individuals to establish business, to extend them, to give employment, or else you believe in State ownership.</P>
      <P>In other countries we see that the whole position is drifting towards complete control by the State of anything that can be described as being necessary in the public interest.  Only time will show whether or not that is a good policy.  It may be that it has very strong social grounds behind it and that in the long run it will benefit the community socially.  From the point of view of those employed in the industry, it may be a much better solution. But, from the point of view of the ultimate economic independence of the community and their ultimate prosperity, I doubt very much if, after a period of years when the present boom conditions and high prices pass away, all these huge schemes of nationalisation and so on will be found to be as attractive as they seem to be at present.</P>
      <P>Whether we are to have a certain amount of nationalisation, a certain amount of these State corporations or not, I think it is rather a pity that Ministers have given the impression in the country that they feel that a great many of those who are interested in tariffs and industrial development are really only anxious to feather their own nests.  I think men like Deputy Hickey will admit that we have always had patriotic Irish citizens who put their money into Irish industries very largely for the purpose of giving employment. That was true of Cork City; it was true also of Dublin City.  When Ministers like the Minister for Industry and Commerce tell us that there are certain people fleecing the public, would it not be better to take action against these persons in whatever way the Minister thinks appropriate rather than have the public treated, as they have been treated on so many occasions, to lectures in which, apparently, a large proportion of Irish industrialists were being put in the dock?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2378" /> Whether Deputy Hickey likes it or not, profit is the reason why people go into any kind of business; self-interest is the governing motive.  If Deputy Hickey wants to do away with profit altogether, well and good.  But so long as we give allegiance, or maybe only lip-service, to private enterprise, we have to recognise that people are entitled to reasonable profit, and on other occasions Ministers, from the Taoiseach down, have recognised that. Probably in order to justify their past utterances and their attitude to the protection policy when they were on these benches, they have, however, stressed very much the defects and deficiencies of certain industrialists who are nameless and the numbers of whom we do not know and have given the impression to the country that the thing is, as they used to argue, very largely a racket.</P>
    <P>Is it not the position that many millions of pounds have been put into Irish industry?  When the head of the Irish hosiery manufacturers, Mr. O'Higgins, said that £43,000,000 was invested during the war in Irish industry, was he speaking for some body of persons who are not entitled to consideration from the Irish public or on behalf of persons who, as the Minister for Education said so far back as 1946, deserve the thanks of the Irish people for the work they have done during the emergency?  This is the statement made by Mr. O'Higgins which was published in the Press on 17th December last:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;From 1933 to 1945 they had under a native Government the very heartening spectacle of new industries springing up like mushrooms all over the country.  In those years over £43,000,000 sterling which would otherwise have left their shores had found its way into Irish industries, and these, with existing industries, had surely kept the country both from starvation and complete emigration, as well as providing the Government with practically its total income from taxation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Very many millions of pounds in that way were repatriated and invested in Irish industries.  This is forgotten by the Taoiseach when he refers to the <Col N="2379" /> under-capitalisation of Irish industry and the under-employment in the Irish countryside.  So far as industrialists generally are concerned, it can be claimed that, like other sections of the community, they have, in the main, acted up to their responsibilities and obligations and, on the whole, they carried out a very good job of work for this country during the emergency.</P>
    <P>We are now faced with the position that the buyers' market, so long threatened, is actually in operation. According to the president of the Distributive Workers' Union, speaking a few months ago, we have slump conditions; we have the position that trades people find that they are stocked up with goods which they are unable to liquidate or realise.  In these circumstances, business people, whether they be industrialists or distributors, are entitled to all the consideration and encouragement possible from the Government if they are to give employment and to contribute to the revenue of the country in the way in which they have been doing.  When charges are being made against the industrialists, it is forgotten that they have had very great difficulties to contend with even since the war period.  Wages have been substantially increased.  As far as essential raw materials like wool are concerned I think there is no great reduction.  There is even a likelihood of an increase in respect of some of the more important ones.  There have been increases in rates and in regard to other services.  In fact, the Minister for Finance pointed out recently that the State is absorbing about 25 per cent. of the total national income for administration.  Therefore, it can be said that industry is contributing a very large share of that.  I think, therefore, that industrialists are entitled to consideration. Nobody thinks they should get more than they are entitled to but if we believe that private enterprise should be encouraged I wish that Ministers would say what they have to say to industrialists directly and deal with them as they think appropriate, if they consider they are deserving of punishment or of reprimand.  Those general <Col N="2380" /> statements do not get us anywhere and are really a clog in the way of progress.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce told us in his opening statement that there had been certain reductions in regard to the prices of certain commodities. In regard to the staple foods like beef, mutton, bacon, butter, milk and bread, I do not think that he can point to any reductions.  In fact, as we know, there have been increases.  I do not know whether it is a tribute to Deputy Cowan or my colleague, Deputy Crotty, who wonder that we do not refer to the cost of living.  It seems unnecessary for us to belabour the question any further when we have the Minister for Finance in his Budget statement announcing that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;... the cost-of-living index, which averaged 183 for 1948, as compared with 178 for 1947 and 100 as at mid-August, 1938.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Dealing with the position in 1948, he said that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Wholesale prices advanced 5.8 per cent. between 1947 and 1948 under the influence of the increase of 10 per cent. in agricultural prices.  Import prices showed an increase of about 3 per cent, and retail prices, as already indicated, of less than 3 per cent.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The most that he can say is that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On the whole, it appears that the upward surge in prices has spent itself and that, if the forces making for inflation are held in check, further increases will be avoided.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As Deputy Traynor reminded the House we were told definitely by the Government in the clearest and most emphatic terms that their chief purpose as a Government was to reduce the cost of living.  There was no question of stabilising the cost of living or maintaining it even at the position it had reached before he left office.  The Taoiseach said that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;All other considerations must be subordinated to the overriding necessity of reducing the cost of living and increasing the value of the people's incomes.  The first task of the new Government will be vigorously to grapple with and provide a solution for the problem of <Col N="2381" /> the soaring cost of living which is menacing the economic life of the State and the happiness of the people.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When the Government took office they definitely laid down in their ten points a reduction in the cost of living.  I do not know whether they claim now that the reduction in the beer and cigarette duties represented the reduction they had promised.  It seems to me that it is a commentary on the Government that they have no excuse to offer or no justification to put forward to the country for their utter failure to carry out their promises in that respect.</P>
    <P>The Bishop of Limerick, speaking some time ago, referred to the fact that a year ago the Irish Bishops had referred to the emigration problem as constituting one of the gravest evils with which the country was confronted. He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Over a year ago the Bishops of Ireland expressed their grave concern at the continuance and growth of emigration.  It still continues and gives cause for apprehension.  It would be possible to view the matter with greater equanimity if one could be sure that the young people who leave our shores are always bettering themselves materially, and incurring no grave dangers to their faith and morals.  But it is questionable if very many of them ever succeed in saving a penny for a future day and few return home in better circumstances than when they left.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not concerned at <Col N="2382" /> the moment with what Deputy Lemass, who is not in office, has said, but I am concerned with what the Minister for Industry and Commerce did say.  He has found out now that there is a reluctance to take up employment on the electric schemes and the turf schemes, and presumably the excuse that the Fianna Fáil organisation is swelling the numbers of the unemployed who have registered is going to be offered as an anathema.  It seems to me, considering the arguments that we hear in this House year after year regarding emigration, how the life blood was pouring out of the country and nothing was being done about it, that the Government have very little to show.  I see by the figures for emigration for the past year that in the western counties to which the Minister has directed the attention of the new industrial authority, we had an Emigration Commission set up also, presumably largely to deal with the problem in those areas.  In all the western counties, practically, the number of young men who left during 1948 increased from 50 per cent. to 70 per cent. over the figures for 1947.  In the City of Dublin and in Limerick the figures were well over 100 per cent. greater in 1948 than in 1947.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told that the Government are going to spend large sums of money on capital expenditure, but in view of the attitude of the present Ministers for Finance and Agriculture to the tourist industry and to the development of aviation in this country, I am really astonished that the Taoiseach, or the Minister for Industry and Commerce, or whoever may be responsible, has succeeded in persuading these Ministers that it is to the national advantage to spend these large sums of money on these industries. The argument two years ago, in the words of the Minister for Finance, was: what do we want roads for, what do we want telephones for, and why do we want tourists coming into the country consuming our limited food supplies?  Now all that has changed. The Minister tells us, in his opening statement, that he is going to do everything possible to develop the airport so that the greatest possible facilities <Col N="2383" /> will be made available.  The chiefs of the E.C.A. tell us over the radio of the importance of the tourist industry, in fact, they definitely assure us that it is the only way in which we can earn dollars and that, after a period of a few years, it is difficult to know whether we will be able to carry on unless we do something to secure dollars either by exporting commodities or by getting American tourists into the country.</P>
    <P>Mr. Taft is reported in the news papers of the 3rd May last, in a broadcast address, to have stated that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Ireland had cut her dollar imports from 1947 to 1948 more drastically than any E.R.P. nation, except Sweden.  However, it would be especially difficult for Ireland to cut her dollar requirements further in the final years of the recovery programme and find a satisfactory substitute elsewhere in the world.  Her increased dollar earnings would not be sufficient even in four years to make the change an easy one.  The E.C.A. was anxious that money to Ireland should stimulate permanent projects to improve living standards. If, after four years, the money was absorbed in consumer goods, E.C.A. would not be happy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;All must realise,&rdquo; said Mr. Carrigan, in the same series of broadcasts, &ldquo;that they have been living on what was being produced plus borrowings and savings.  Such a programme, if long continued, would lead to disaster unless eventually the answer was to produce more or consume less.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mr. Carrigan stated that the chief way in which E.C.A. thought that we could earn dollars was by the encouragement of our tourist trade with the United States of America.</P>
    <P>We are, at the present time, according to the trade figures, importing about £5,750,000 of goods per month more than we are exporting.  Reports have appeared in the newspapers of trade agreements with a large number of continental countries.  I would ask the Minister to let us know, when <Col N="2384" /> replying, whether his anticipations have been fulfilled in regard to the export of Irish manufactures under the British free list to the British market. I should also like to know what he has to say with regard to the export of linens and other commodities to the United States, France, Holland and the various countries with which trade negotiations went on during the year.</P>
    <P>Finally, since the Minister for Industry and Commerce is responsible for the administration of the Apprenticeship Act, I would like to ask him whether he intends to do anything to try and bring conditions regarding apprenticeship into line with the position that now obtains in regard to industries in this country.  When the Apprenticeship Act was originally passed we had not a great deal of experience of industries in this country.  I think the time is ripe for a review of the position and that with the co-operation which the Government can&mdash;and which I know from experience the trade unions will &mdash;give in the general examination of that question, better results can be secured.</P>
    <P>We have heard complaints of a shortage of skilled labour.  The late Minister for Local Government, God rest him, referred to this matter shortly before his untimely death.  On various occasions references have been made to the shortage of skilled men.  If the Minister would take the representatives of the building unions into consultation, I think it ought to be possible to work out an apprenticeship scheme which would bring a larger number of operatives into industry.  I notice that in Great Britain this matter of apprenticeship is not regarded as a question between the individual employer and employee.  It is regarded as a question for the industry as a whole, and in regard to the printing trade, the building trade and engineering trade national bodies have been set up, representative not only of the employers and employees in a particular industry but of all other interests concerned. Joint apprenticeship boards have been set up, and local bodies, duplicates of the national body, have been set up to keep in close touch with the technical schools.  In that way, <Col N="2385" /> they have evolved a scheme by which the apprentice has the advantage of working under the most up-to-date conditions possible in industry, while at the same time he has the benefit of the exactness, theory and the necessary additions that are made to his skill and training in the technical school.</P>
    <P>When the building drive was started after the war, I know that a section in the Department of Industry and Commerce was entrusted to an officer who had long experience of this matter of apprenticeship.  He was entrusted with the duty of dealing with priorities for the building industry.  Unfortunately, that officer, I think, has now left the service.  I wonder whether any steps have been taken, in view of the very serious situation in the building industry, to discuss this whole question of new entrants to the industry, and the possibility of securing greater numbers of young people with a relaxing of the restrictions that already exist &mdash;whether any conversations have gone on, or whether it is proposed to take any steps in the future?  I know, from my own experience, that in cases in which apprenticeship committees were set up it was not the unions' or the men's representatives who were in any way to blame for any slowness there was, or for any lack of progress.  It was rather on the employers' side, but the need in the housing industry being so great and so urgent, I feel that both the employers and the unions would be anxious to come together to try to improve matters from the point of view of providing skilled workers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSheehan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>The two main problems confronting this country to-day are housing and unemployment.  Housing, I am glad to say, is moving in the right direction, due largely to the efforts of our late Minister for Local Government&mdash;God rest his soul. At the same time, the Government must keep pressing; they cannot afford to relax, because it will take a number of years before we have the housing problem solved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This debate has taken quite a long time and almost all the problems of our national life have been discussed. I heard a reference made to culm by <Col N="2386" /> Deputy Halliden.  He said there was a scarcity of culm for lime-burning and a scarcity of anthracite.  I have heard a lot of Deputies speaking about developing our own resources, but when we have them developed they all seem to close down.  I have in mind the colliery at Castlecomer, which produces anthracite and culm for lime-burning purposes.  I happen to be in the coal trade and, with others in the South, I bought British anthracite.  I am glad to say that Irish anthracite is quite as good as British.</P>
    <P>Whatever is wrong, whether the workers or the directors are responsible, something should be done to reopen the Castlecomer colliery.  We all look to the Minister for Industry and Commerce to solve our problems, but he needs co-operation, and I think if people looked on these things from a national rather than an individual point of view, they would see how desirable it is to co-operate and try to compose their differences.  This strike must be settled sooner or later.  I understand there are 200 men employed there.  It is not 200 who should be employed in Castlecomer, but 400, 500 or 600.  I understand there is enough anthracite in this country to supply all our requirements and I appeal to the Minister to see if it is possible to develop the anthracite position.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ben Maguire spoke last night and he made a brilliant speech.  He dealt with Irish coal mines.  I would be prepared to give wholehearted support to Irish coal mines, even though the coal may not be up to the standard of British coal. We have been importing a type of British coal for the past six or seven years and it really was disgraceful. What we have been importing from Britain in recent years is not coal at all but rubbish, the washings of the collieries.  Before the war they washed their coal and the washings were dumped.  Thousands and thousands of tons of that stuff have been imported during and since the war, and it is even still being imported.  I must pay a compliment to the Minister for giving permits to me and to other coal <Col N="2387" /> importers to bring in Polish coal.  If it does nothing else, it will help to bring the National Coal Board to their senses.  We bring in small cargoes and in those cargoes there are five or six types of coal.  One householder may get good coal while another householder may get a quantity of slates. Now that we have permission to import Polish coal, we can bring the National Coal Board to their senses and perhaps they will export coal of a better quality.</P>
    <P>The Polish coal costs Irish merchants a few shillings more than the British, but it is far superior.  It is being sold at the same price all over the country. It is definitely superior in size and quality.  We got it analysed and we found that the percentage of ash was only 2 per cent, or 3 per cent, as against 10 per cent, for the British coal.  The Minister is to be complimented on issuing the permits for the Polish coal because, up to that, the nation was being robbed through the importation of British coal.  We should not have all our eggs in the one basket.  We have been tied to the British coal too long and I think we could go further afield.</P>
    <P>A good deal has been said about the American coal, but I will say that the ex-Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Lemass, did a good day's work by bringing in American coal.  The only fault that I might find with him is that he brought in perhaps a little too much of it, but, of course, it is very easy to comment the day after the fair.  He certainly did good work when he brought that coal in.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies from the turf areas spoke eloquently about hand-won turf. I say that turf will never be an economic proposition because you have to depend too much on the weather to save it, and then you have difficulties with transport and other things. It is not all a question of transportation. You bring the turf to the cities and store it in dumps.  In Cork, we have had it stored that way for two or three years and the same applies to Dublin, Waterford and Limerick. It has to be re-handled, and if the weather breaks it is as bad as ever. <Col N="2388" /> Perhaps it might be better if the stuff we have dumped were left there. Thousands of tons have been dumped already.  You simply cannot compel people, especially in the cities and towns, to burn turf.  During the emergency they were compelled to buy and burn it, but we cannot expect them to continue doing so, particularly in the cities.  Turf is all right in the rural districts, but not in the cities.</P>
    <P>Another matter I would like to refer to is the pottery industry.  If you go into any restaurant or hotel and look at the delph ware, the cups and saucers and plates, you will see from the stamp that they are British made. That should not be so.  I appeal to the Minister to encourage the pottery industry because it could be made an important industry.  I know the Minister is doing his best, and so did the previous Minister do his best, and I am sure future Ministers will do their best.  Some people say that the present Minister for Industry and Commerce is not interested in Irish industry. That is not so.  He is interested very much in the progress of Irish industry. He has been only one and a half years in office and in that time he has made great strides.</P>
    <P>As regards the woollen industry, in Cork we have 70 per cent, to 80 per cent. of our people employed.  At the present time, I am sorry to say, a number of people are disemployed at the Blarney Woollen Mills and in the Sunbeam Wolsey Mills.  That is due entirely to the dumping of British-manufactured goods in our stores.  I daresay the same applies to other parts of the country.  I was speaking the other evening on the telephone to Mr. Dwyer and I asked him what was the position at the Sunbeam Wolsey Mills.  He said that there was a slump due to the dumping of British goods. I think that instead of putting a tariff on those imported goods the Minister should work on the quota system.  I feel that the British manufacturers will import stuff into this country even at a loss in order to open an export market.  During the emergency Mr. William Dwyer built and opened three new factories.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2389" /> That in itself was a great achievement at a time when no one else could get building materials.  The late Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Lemass, opened these factories. While Mr. Dwyer may differ at some points from the present Government, I think, nevertheless, that he is one man who should be accommodated in every way.  He has done more for industry in County Cork and for the country generally than has any other man.  He has his failings.  But so have we all our failings.  I ask the Minister to come down to Cork some time and put in a day or two going around these industries.  He can be quite sure that he will be welcome and Mr. Dwyer will be glad to show him over his premises.  Any encouragement or help that Mr. Dwyer wants should be given to him.</P>
    <P>Some points have been made with regard to the scarcity of labour for building.  That scarcity is due, as Deputy Maguire said, to the policy of the &ldquo;closed door&rdquo; followed by the trade unions.  I hope that will be remedied very soon so far as the carpentry trade, plasterers, masons and so on are concerned.  The unions at the present time are not taking on enough apprentices.  I believe the matter will be remedied fairly soon.</P>
    <P>With regard to shipping, we have made good strides in the building up of a mercantile service.  I hope the Minister will go further and procure more new ships.  It is very essential that we should have a good merchant navy and it means that we shall save freight which is now being paid to foreign shipping companies.</P>

The Government as a whole is doing well and, if the Government gets co-operation <Col N="2390" /> from both sides of the House, I am sure that the twin evils of unemployment and emigration will cease and we shall have a better standard of living for our people and a better national economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody remembers the great industrial drive that was started by Fianna Fáil in 1932 and everybody remembers the way in which that drive was slowed down by the outbreak of war in 1939.  There is very little use in people talking about the little factories in the back lanes in the City of Dublin and elsewhere.  There is abundant evidence to show the strides that were made during those seven years from 1932 to 1939.  I think most people anticipated a continuation of that progress as soon as the war was over and as soon as raw materials became available again.  But, as far as I can see, we are not making the progress that we should be making. The unemployment figure still stands at 80,000.  In the City of Cork between 3,400 and 3,500 people are signing on at the labour exchange.  I worry more about these people than I do about the manufacturers, though the Minister may think otherwise.  I see no schemes in preparation that would absorb these unemployed.  I do not know what will become of them.  Deputy Sheehan knows as well as I do that every hour and minute of every day people are coming to him looking for work.  As part of the development of Cork port it was necessary to reconstruct one of the quays.  That work started a couple of weeks ago.  Every unemployed man was looking forward to getting employment on it.  We all gave letters to the labour exchange, to the managers of the port and to the contractor but there were so many unemployed a man had to have a wife and five children and be in receipt of the maximum amount of dole before he would be considered.  I know that has been done by Governments in all these schemes where Government grants are given.  I think the system is wrong.  I think young men leaving school or men with Army service during the emergency should get employment on schemes of this kind and they should not be placed in the position of going to Deputy <Col N="2391" /> Sheehan, Deputy Hickey and others asking them to find work for them.</P>
      <P>There is no use in talking about full employment.  We all know that full employment and no emigration were merely vote catching devices.  That fact has come to many people since the election.  Last week, while Deputy Corry was speaking, the Minister said that he had work for so many thousands if they would take it and so many thousands refused.</P>
      <P>I am sure that the Minister was not referring to the unemployed in the city when he spoke about that particular work.  Deputy Larkin answered him very effectively by saying that one cannot expect a man to break up his home and go away to work on a turf bog because the money he would get would not provide for himself and for his wife and family.  Many single men living in towns have dependents. They are supporting widowed mothers and sisters.  They all hope that something will turn up in their own neighbourhood.  They are not anxious to work under conditions which, according to the members of the present Government when they were in opposition, were not too healthy at all. We were told on several occasions by Deputy Flanagan that conditions on the turf bogs were a disgrace.  I am afraid that that sunk into the minds of a lot of our people and the young men are not a bit anxious to work in the turf bogs now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister says that he was referring to rural workers only, that does not affect my constituency very much, although part of my constituency embraces a rural area.  I am sure he would not suggest that rural workers in Cork should have to travel 100 miles away to look for work because many rural workers have homes and families to keep and they could not maintain two households out of what they would get.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the woollen industry. Deputy Lynch went very fully into that matter last week and he gave the Minister many details which were supplied to us by Sunbeam Wolsey.  Deputy Hickey, speaking to-day, said that the woollen manufacturers seem to have tackled the job in such a way as to be unable to supply the complete demands of the nation.  I wonder would anybody in business start out to supply the complete demands of the nation if their surplus stocks on hands were increasing day by day and they were not able to sell what they had on hands, due to the fact that people were using certain means of getting around <Col N="2393" /> the quota system?  Suits are being made up of material of a certain weight, this material being just under the seven ounces per square yard which would have made it liable to a tariff.  Material which they call gaberdine was imported ostensibly for weatherproofs, but was afterwards made up into suits.  All that is still happening.  What I am concerned with is the fact that workers have been laid off.  These workers come along to me and to my friend over there, to ask us to try to get them jobs, a thing which we cannot do.</P>
    <P>In the finishing woollen industry there are also immense surplus stocks which cannot be got rid of.  Many workers in one of these factories have been laid off and there is another which is working only every second week.  The Minister, at an earlier stage in this debate, intervened to state that he had looked for certain information from the proprietors of these industries and he had not got it yet.  I would like to know, if these people do not give the information, is the Minister going to take no steps to see that the people formerly employed in these industries get back to their work?  Is he going to wait until he gets the figures which he has asked for?  I am almost certain that figures were submitted to his Department showing the surplus stocks of woollen materials. I think that if the home manufacturers are in a position to meet all the demands of the nation no foreign stuff should be allowed in.</P>
    <P>The prices charged by the home manufacturers are controlled by the Department of Industry and Commerce. These prices, I understand, are equal to, if not lower than, English prices, but the unfortunate feature is that the drapers or the distributors, when they hear of the English goods coming in, will rush for them was to have something newer than the man next door.  A couple of years ago drapers were anxious to collar all the stocks they could as the supply was hardly equal to the demand, but the situation has changed now.  There is a plentiful supply and nobody is anxious to buy more than he can easily sell.  I suggest to the Minister that <Col N="2394" /> until manufacturers can get rid of their surplus stocks he should take steps to ensure that there are no further imports of these goods.  As I stated before, the Minister can control the prices of these goods.  He can stop any attempt at profiteering, although to my mind there has been a good deal of exaggeration in the allegations as to profiteering.  We heard some references here a short time ago to the fact that the sugar company were paying 6 per cent., but is it not much better that people should put their money in native industries than that they should be investing it in foreign industries? It is my experience that firms that are able to pay 6 or 8 per cent. generally give better conditions of employment than people who are only just trying to keep their heads above water. I should also like to ask why some of the big labour unions do not invest some of their money in industry themselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>They take very good care to invest it in good, sound investments and they are probably right. Any man who invests money in industry has to run the risk of loss as well as looking forward to profits.  We hear Deputies here talking about the cost of living and about profits and at the same time they were ready to vote to increase the interest on housing loans from 2½ to 3¼ per cent., thus increasing the cost of living because the increased cost of houses adds to the cost of living.</P>
      <P>When I went back to Cork last Saturday, I saw the report of an interview with the managing director of St. Patrick's Woollen Mills, Mr. Murphy, who had just returned from America. In the course of that interview he said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;My visit to America was to increase our outlet for Irish-made tweeds and I found that there was a ready market there.  With so many Irish people and people of Irish descent in America, there is quite a demand for goods bearing an Irish label.  But I am only one individual, <Col N="2395" /> and one person cannot do a great deal on his own.  If Ireland had a trade commissioner in the States, our exports could be increased considerably, for the prospects are very good.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister was over in America not so very long ago, and I would suggest that he should investigate the suggestions made by this industrialist, who is a very enterprising gentleman, and is doing a good business.  As a result, we might be able to increase our trade there.  We all know the importance of dollars at the present time and it is quite possible that an outlet could be developed for other industries if we had a trade commissioner there to represent us.  I was also asked to suggest to the Minister that if we have any trade agreements with Holland or similar countries, he might endeavour to develop an export trade for motor tyres with these countries.  The factory in Cork at the present time is in a position, I understand, to cater for an export trade, if they had it.  I move to report progress.</P>

Land was not defined as widely as the Deputy would have it defined in the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, nor in the Relief Works Act, 1940.  He raised the question of conacre rights and that would be included under amendment No. 21, but as far as compensation is concerned&mdash;and I think that is the Deputy's main anxiety&mdash;he need not have any fear in view of amendment No. 21.</P>

      <P>We are in the very fortunate position of having in the <Col N="2397" /> Government a number of Ministers who have a very extensive knowledge of law and this amendment of Deputy Lynch's is an important legal amendment. This is an important Bill which will affect rights and which is required for the purpose of easing a difficult situation all over the country and I think it would only be right if, in addition to the Parliamentary Secretary who is handling this measure, some of the other Ministers, particularly those who have a good knowledge of law, were present in the House.</P>

      <P>Since amendment No. 21 is bound up with another matter in respect of which there is at least one and possibly more amendments, I seriously suggest that the Minister accept this amendment.  It is simply a definition and since there are other definitions in Section 1 of this Act he should accept it.  It does not widen the scope of the Bill and in case amendment No. 21 is not accepted I think he ought to accept this definition of the word land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>The mover of this amendment might consider whether by actually defining land he does not thereby defeat his own purpose.  The purpose of a definition is to restrict the application of a word and, if he seeks to broaden the scope of the <Col N="2398" /> compensation that may legitimately be claimed by those who suffer damage under the operation of any section of this Bill, surely his purpose would be to have the idea of land as broadly based as possible and to have it open to the widest possible interpretation.  As it stands it is restricted to &ldquo;all privileges, casements, profits, rights and advantages whatsoever appertaining to, enjoyed with or appurtenant to land&rdquo;.  That seems to be very extensive to the lay mind, but perhaps when the legal gentlemen get it, it may be found that some set of circumstances may arise under which certain damage will not come under this very wide definition; whereas if the word &ldquo;land&rdquo; itself is understood in its normal meaning the lawyers can extend its definition to include probably any given case that arises requiring the operation of any clause dealing with compensation.  It appeared to me, from that reasoning, to be unnecessary. I suggest that the Deputy would achieve his purpose by considering that aspect of it and, if he is so convinced, it might serve his purpose better to withdraw the amendment.</P>

I do not presume to have the knowledge that he has, but &ldquo;land&rdquo; is a very wide interpretation.  Deputy Lynch should be able to tell us where in any Act, for the purpose of Acts of Parliament, the word &ldquo;land&rdquo; includes these things that he wants to bring in. That is why I made the suggestion when speaking a few moments ago.  I intend to follow the advice of Deputy Sir John Esmonde on the previous stage of this Bill in regard to it.

There is no definition of &ldquo;land&rdquo; in this Bill except the one which the Minister is suggesting in amendment No. 21.

Any previous definitions of &ldquo;land&rdquo; will not cover some of the matters that may arise in the way of damage to easements, rights of water, rights of way, and so forth.

      <P>I suggest that Deputy Lynch should withdraw this amendment and allow it to hang on amendment No. 21, because, if you put a definition of land in the definition section, it gives rise to all sorts of complications. Obviously, the Deputy's intention is in regard to compensation, which is covered in Section 5 and amendment No. 21.  If his amendment were accepted, it would throw entirely out of gear the right of entry in Section 4.  Land is visualised in Section 4 as land in the accepted meaning of the term, and, if you try to read Deputy Lynch's amendment in with the wording of Section 4, it would obviously be ridiculous.  I think the Deputy intends it to apply only to questions of compensation and consequently it should be dealt with on Section 5.</P>

      <P>There is this difficulty tied up with the amendment introduced by the Minister that, in accepting that amendment, we accept not only his definition of land, but another principle altogether in connection with compensation. There are other amendments to be discussed dealing with the liability for the payment of compensation. The Minister's amendment, in addition to defining land for the purposes of the section, provides that a claimant will be entitled to be paid by the local authority concerned, but there are other amendments designed to provide <Col N="2402" /> the very opposite&mdash;that local authorities will not be called upon to pay compensation under the section, so that in accepting the Minister's definition of land, if we are prepared to accept it, we are automatically driven to accepting this other matter which we cannot accept.</P>

His anxiety is to have the word &ldquo;land&rdquo; defined to include certain things, such as an easement or a <i>profit-a-prendre,</i> with a view to making the position quite clear when it comes to the right of compensation in Section 5.  Amendment No. 21 goes much further than defining the word &ldquo;land&rdquo;&mdash;it gives a specific right to any person who owns a <i>profit-a-prendre</i> or easement to compensation, and, when the Deputy refers to the Minister's definition, he is not quite correct.  Amendment No. 21 is not a definition.  It gives the owners of certain properties, such as an easement or <i>profit-a-prendre,</i> a right to compensation, and, in these circumstances, it is not necessary to define the word &ldquo;land&rdquo; to include an easement or <i>profit-a-prendre</i>, apart from any other consideration whatever.</P>

      <P>In line 20 after the word &ldquo;thereof&rdquo; to add the words &ldquo;and shall also include any road (whether vested in a local authority for maintenance or not) over which a public right of way exists.</P>
      <P>The amendment is designed to widen the definition, such as it is, of roads in the Bill.  We can visualise different roads which may not be roads maintained by a local authority, on which there may be serious flooding, or a subsidence, or other matters that may have to be dealt with.  There are other amendments suggesting that the definition should include bog roads or cul-de-sac roads, but I think that the definition of roads should be as wide as possible in order to leave a local authority free to deal with this particular type of flooding on roads.  I think the Minister should accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>If I thought it necessary I would accept the amendment, but I do not think it is at all necessary.  The definition of &ldquo;road&rdquo; is taken from the Local Government Act, 1925, and it is as set out in the Bill.  The Deputy would limit the work which local authorities could undertake in this respect, <Col N="2404" /> because his amendment refers to a road over which a public right of way exists.  If it is not a road which comes within the jurisdiction of a local authority, or which a local authority has responsibility for maintaining, it can be regarded as land.  Any road which is not a public authority road may be regarded as land and it may be relieved of flooding under sub-section (3) of Section 2.  In short, a road which is not a road may be considered as land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the Parliamentary Secretary's interpretation. In the first place, in the definition section, the word &ldquo;road&rdquo; means a public road and a public road only.  You may have just as difficult and just as urgent a problem with a bog road which serves quite a number of people&mdash;it may be subject to annual flooding, with the result that people cannot use it&mdash; or with a cul-de-sac road or other types of roads which would not be classified as public roads.  I am not prepared to accept the argument that, if it does not come in under &ldquo;public road&rdquo;, it can be regarded as land.  I cannot see, in view of the other terms of the Bill, what the objection is to bringing in all roads, because there is still the discretion of the local authority and the discretion of the Minister to deal with the matter, as well as the different checks and safeguards provided further on in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Why should we limit ourselves, as I suggest we are limiting ourselves, by tying ourselves to public roads?  Why not be able to deal with every one of these problems, which may be just as vital in case of a bog road as in the case of a public road?  I do not see how the Parliamentary Secretary can convince me that these roads can be dealt with under the definition of land, and, even if that were so, if the Parliamentary Secretary accepts that position, what then is the objection to the definition of roads which I suggest? If the Parliamentary Secretary is prepared to agree that this kind of work which I have in mind can be done under the definition of land, why then should there be this objection to defining roads to include all types of roads as I suggest?</P>

      <P>It does not seem to make a lot of difference one way or the other because, as I read the definition of permanent construction in the Bill and the provisions of Section 2, sub-section (3) (b), it appears to me that there is already provision in the Bill to provide for what the Deputy has in mind.  In sub-section (3) (b) provision is made whereby these works can be constructed on any permanent construction in the functional area of the local authority which they are not under any liability to maintain if they consider it is in the public interest and &ldquo;permanent construction&rdquo; is defined by the Bill as including any public road. A public road is not necessarily a road in respect of which the local authority have any liability to maintain.  It is merely a road over which the public have a right of way, whether it is a bog road or a mountain road, as another amendment already suggests. In my view, the matter being dealt with by the Deputy is already provided for in the Bill.  I do not exactly follow the reason given by the Parliamentary Secretary but I assume it could also be treated as land.  In any event, the road could be dealt with under the provisions in that sub-section.</P>

We all know that extraordinary steps had to be taken in order to enable people in backward localities or living at some distance from what was known as a public road on cul-de-sac roads or roads which were not maintained by the public authority to get these roads put into a state of repair and up to now it had to be done out of the unemployment relief scheme.

      <P>There is a great deal of confusion here and perhaps I might make a suggestion so that the House would appreciate exactly what is referred to as a public road. Deputies may be under the impression that the local authority owns the road in question if it is a public road.  The local authority has power to acquire the property in a road but the majority of the roads referred to as public roads are only vested in the local authority for the purpose of maintenance and the ownership of the soil of the road remains in the particular person upon whose land the road was built and, therefore, so far as public roads are concerned, namely, those roads the maintenance of which is a charge on the local authority, they are covered by the particular section in the Bill. So far as any other road is concerned, if it is a road over private land on which there is a public right of way, that is covered by the definition of the word &ldquo;land.&rdquo; In other words, the fact that there is a public right of way over a person's land does not mean <Col N="2407" /> that the ownership of that land is taken away from the person who owns it.  Therefore, an entry on the land would be an entry on the public right of way over the land.  I do not see any difference whatsoever between that and entry on the land which happens to be the subject matter of a right of way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">

      <P>Let us get this clear. Where is the definition in this Bill, under which you can bring a road within the definition of land?  As Deputy Sir John Esmonde has pointed out, land has not been defined in this Bill but a certain right of compensation has been given in respect of lands owned or occupied by somebody, or any easement, <i>profit-a-prendre</i> or other right belonging to him, who shall, subject to the provisions of the Act, be entitled to be paid compensation.  That does not and cannot deal with the matter that we are dealing with in this amendment. That deals with the specific matter of compensation in connection with land.  How it can be argued by the Parliamentary Secretary that this definition of land would cover roads outside public roads is beyond me.  I cannot see it.  I do not understand it. If you limit your definition here to public roads you are limiting it to roads vested in public authorities for the purpose of maintenance.  The effect of my amendment is to put a local authority in a position to deal with all roads.  I do not see why that should not be accepted because, as I have said, many of these matters possibly would be much more urgent in connection with some of these roads to relieve flooding than some public roads that we will be dealing with.</P>

      <P>It appears to me that the main question on this amendment is as to whether there is in existence a well-defined definition of what a public road is, if that definition is clearly understood and expressed in certain terms in a code of law and it is understood that where compensation lies the term &ldquo;public road&rdquo; carries a certain connotation, one that can be quoted within the local government code.  I suggest that Deputy Moran's amendment would be restrictive in character if, as I say, there is a widely <Col N="2408" /> understood and well expressed definition of what a public road is.  Is there?</P>

      <P>I cannot find a definition of &ldquo;public road.&rdquo; There does not seem to be such a definition of &ldquo;public road.&rdquo;  There is a definition of &ldquo;a road,&rdquo; of course, and it is as defined in this Bill.  Again I would suggest that, if it cannot be ascertained that a road is a public road or if it is not a road where the local authority have responsibility for its maintenance, it still can be regarded as land because, inasmuch as the local authority does not own it and has no responsibility for it, it must belong to somebody; it could be regarded as a field.  In many cases we have roads that are merely tracks across fields.  They are in some, cases accommodation roads, in some cases bog roads, and can be treated as land, being part of the field.</P>

      <P>What the Parliamentary Secretary does not seem to quite accept is that the first part of this Bill is dealing in the main with local authorities' own property and the relieving of flooding, landslide, subsidence and so forth.  If there is this doubt&mdash;and the Parliamentary Secretary appears to accept that there is this doubt about the question of defining a road&mdash;what is wrong with giving this definition to it for the purpose of this Bill?  As the Parliamentary Secretary knows, the definition will be limited to the Long Title of the Bill. It will be for the purpose of doing particular work&mdash;affording relief or protection from flooding, landslide, subsidence and so forth.  The definition of a &ldquo;public road&rdquo; at all events has been accepted by local authorities as a road that is maintained by the local authority.  That is the definition that county surveyors throughout this country and local authorities have been going on as a matter of practice.  If we are prepared to bring in the bog roads and the accommodation roads and the cul-de-sac roads that are subject to flooding, why not accept this definition which is confined to work to be done in this particular Bill?  What is the objection to the inclusion of all these roads where flooding and so forth may occur?</P>

      <P>The Deputy is anxious to give us the widest possible scope for operating this very useful measure.  I think he should see that if his amendment were accepted it would not be helpful.  If it were accepted, roads other than public roads would be defined, whereas in the measure they would be left untouched&mdash;perhaps roads that would not be covered by the amendment.  Anything that is not a public road will be treated, whereas the Deputy makes a specific definition of roads and rights of way over them. In the measure there is wider scope. I think it is much safer as it is.</P>

      <P>A test could be made as to whether there is already power in the Bill to cover roads other than roads maintainable at present&mdash; roads to which Deputy Smith has applied the term &ldquo;public roads&rdquo;.  Take Section 2 (3)&mdash;having first looked at the definition of &ldquo;permanent construction&rdquo;&mdash;and taking merely the word &ldquo;roads&rdquo; in what is included in &ldquo;permanent construction&rdquo; we have the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;3.  Where a local authority to whom this section applies are of opinion that&mdash;</P>

      <P>they may then go on to do certain works on that public road.  I think Deputy Moran will agree that that shows clearly that public roads not maintainable by the local authority may still become the subject of works under this Bill.  That is in accordance with the definitions already contained in the Bill.  I appreciate quite clearly what Deputy Moran and Deputy Smith have in their minds.  However, it seems to me, from reading the definitions of the Bill, that provision is already there, and I think we are wasting time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole difficulty arises here as to what class of property the local authority is given power to enter on and do certain work, not having that power at the present time.  If Deputies will look at Section 2 they will see that the local authority is given power to enter on land, not being land owned by them, or on any permanent construction in their functional area, not being a permanent construction which was constructed by them or which they are required by law to maintain.  That means that they are entitled to enter on land which they would not heretofore be entitled to enter on and, secondly, that they are entitled to enter on a permanent construction which they were not entitled to enter on before.  In order to find out what they are entitled to do with regard to &ldquo;permanent construction&rdquo; you must come to Section 1. You find the expression &ldquo;permanent construction&rdquo; defined to include roads. Then you come to the next paragraph to find out what &ldquo;road&rdquo; means and you find it means a public road.  Accepting the proposition put forward by Deputy Smith and other Deputies that the generally accepted meaning of &ldquo;public road&rdquo; is a road for which the local authority is liable for maintenance, you have all those categories covered. Then you want to know what is going to happen and what right you have to enter upon a road which is not a public road in the accepted sense of the term, namely, a road maintained by the local authorities.  For that, <Col N="2412" /> there is clear and obvious authority given in this Bill under Section 3 (a). And, because there is a public right of way over land, I think Deputies opposite who know something about this will agree with me that that does not cause land to disappear.  It still remains land.  Therefore, the two classes of cases which are envisaged in this Bill are completely covered.</P>

      <P>Having listened to the very interesting observations by Deputy Esmonde, it occurs to me that the lawyers are going to have great fun over this Bill.  As mere laymen, we hear that under this Bill a local authority has a right to do something in regard to a permanent construction and that is dealt with in Section 2, sub-section 3 (b).  Then we go back to find out what is the meaning of &ldquo;permanent construction&rdquo; and in Section 1 we learn that a permanent construction includes many other things than a road. We then go further to the interpretation to find out what &ldquo;road&rdquo; means and we find that it means public road and several other things.  It appears to me that the draftsman should have gone a little further and given us an interpretation of what a public road means.  If he had done that, we would have had no discussion on the matter at all.</P>
      <P>I suggest to Deputy Moran that, in the interest of getting the work started for those who are waiting anxiously to get this work done, instead of adding a few more words to it, even with the best of motives, he should subtract some so that there would be less work for the lawyers and more work for the men who urgently need it.  It appears to me that the amendment is a restrictive, as well as, in a sense, a broadening amendment.  If it were to say it shall include &ldquo;any road&rdquo; and leave it at that, whether vested in a local authority for maintenance or not, it certainly would have a broadening effect to include much more than is intended in the interpretation in the Bill itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bringing in the question of a public right of way restricts it so that public authorities evidently will not be able, even if necessary for the performance of the work, to enter on private roads <Col N="2413" /> or roads over which a public right of way does not exist.  In some places, in order to carry out the work that is to be done, they may require to go over a road on which no public right of way exists and, therefore, the restriction in the amendment seems to me to defeat the object which Deputy Moran had in mind, namely, to give it a broader definition.  We would have to have another amendment to define what a public road is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary in his definition of road dropped the word &ldquo;public&rdquo; and left it to read &ldquo;the word &lsquo;road&rsquo; means any road&rdquo; and includes bridges, etc., that would meet any objections I have to make.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary will find out on inquiry in his Department that public roads have always been regarded by county councils and others as those roads maintained by county councils and not any other road.  Members of local authorities have been told that time and time again.  If you want to get in these other roads suggested by Deputy Esmonde, you are still driven back to this definition of road in the Bill.  It is defined as a public road.  The definition of public roads applied by local authorities and county surveyors all over the country is roads that are maintained by the local authority.  If the Parliamentary Secretary will give an undertaking to do one thing or the other on the Report Stage in order to remove doubts, I would be prepared to withdraw the amendment; I mean if he is prepared to go into it from the point of view of ensuring that those roads which have been mentioned will qualify under the Bill.</P>

      <P>I am not a legal man and I have not a legal mind.  I think we are creating a lot of difficulties for ourselves.  As far as I can see, every square inch in this country is land. Public roads are roads, in my opinion, which are dedicated to public use.  If you want to define a public road as a road over which a local authority has responsibility, I think the definition as expressed by Deputy Smith is correct also.  Under one sub-section the local authorities have power to relieve flooding <Col N="2414" /> and do other things so far as public roads are concerned.  Anyhow, public roads are land and houses are land, according to the interpretation Act of 1937.  Therefore, what is left, in my opinion, would also be regarded as land and that would include an accommodation road or any other type of road that you care to mention.  But if the Deputies opposite think that it would make it simpler, I am prepared to delete the word &ldquo;public&rdquo; before road.</P>

    <P>The amendment is designed to ensure that before a local authority arrives at a decision they will have a report from the chief engineering officer to show that damage was likely to be sustained from flooding, landslide, subsidence or other similar occurrence.  I think it should be provided that the local authority would have this information before them in a formal way from the chief engineering officer before they arrive at a decision that there is likely to be damage.  Otherwise it will simply mean that a member will say that it is likely that damage will be caused and other members may not know anything about it.

      <P>I am not prepared to accept the amendment, as such provisions are not included in other legislation of this kind.  I do not think it is necessary for us to embody in legislation the administrative duties of any officer of a local authority, because the duties of a chief engineering officer are defined on his appointment the same as the duties of any other officer.  In this particular case I think the duties of a chief engineering officer broadly are to advise the county council on any schemes or works which they propose to undertake.  I am prepared to believe, as <Col N="2416" /> I have always believed, that the local authority will act, especially in cases like this, in accordance with public interests as they always have done.  It is not usual in legislation of this kind to provide for such duties for any officers of local authorities.  As a matter of fact in their conditions of appointment, the duties which are given to them by regulations, such matters as these are very well covered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say that in my opinion these two amendments contain very dangerous conditions.  I do not know what prompted the Deputy to put down these amendments or what his intentions were.  First of all, I agree with what the Parliamentary Secretary has said, that it may be assumed before a local authority comes to any decision concerning any works under this Bill that it will get the report or opinion of its proper officers.  That seems to be eminently reasonable.  What we are asked to do by these amendments is to provide that, if an essential precedent must be taken by an official of the local authority, before the local authority can do anything they must have a report from their chief engineering officer and that if they do not have a report from this officer, then they are absolutely powerless under the Bill.  I should like to have the opinion of Deputies who are members of local authorities as to what might be likely to happen if, as happens from time to time, a chief engineering officer has a particular view himself about works which the members of the public want carried out.  Remember, that under this amendment the sole power is given to the county surveyor or county engineer to authorise the work to be done.  If he disagreed with the work nothing that the local authority could do, if this amendment was passed, could force him to report in favour of the work to be carried out.  You would find if that amendment was passed that you might as well tear up this Bill altogether.  It completely restricts the powers given under the Bill to local authorities.  It is almost a dangerous amendment to the Bill, in my view, and I cannot appreciate the motive which prompted its introduction except that it is an effort to prevent this Bill being <Col N="2417" /> of assistance to the people it is designed to help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say that I am glad the Parliamentary Secretary is resisting this amendment. As far as the ordinary administration is concerned we give powers to the local authority and we have to accept that the local authority in general acts in a reasonable manner.  The local authority acting in a reasonable manner will, on every occasion, before they decide to take any action under this Bill when it becomes law, undoubtedly have the advice of their experts.</P>
      <P>Unlike Deputy O'Higgins, I can see what prompted Deputy MacEntee to put down this amendment.  I think that Deputy MacEntee was concerned with the public interest.  I think he had in mind that if the chief engineering officer&mdash;I do not know exactly what a chief engineering officer is; I do not think it is a usual phrase in connection with local authorities and it is not defined in the Bill&mdash;reported to the local authority that damage was likely to occur and the local authority then decided that they would take certain steps, that in the event of any court action arising out of that the court would undoubtedly hold that the public authority was acting in the public interest because they took those steps on the recommendation and advice of their chief engineering officer.  I take it that that was the motive that prompted Deputy MacEntee to put down that amendment. However, I agree with Deputy O'Higgins.  It would be a dangerous precedent to create that in the case of damage likely to occur the local authority could not move unless they were satisfied on a report of the chief engineering officer that damage was likely to be sustained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is well that the fullest possible powers should be given to the local authority as such, depending upon them in the ordinary way to do their work and carry it out in the best interests of the public.  Of course, there is always this limitation.  If the local authority acts improperly, there is always the law court, where they can be brought to book.  If they are <Col N="2418" /> brought to book and certain of them nominated as special defendants, there will be no danger that they will act improperly.  For that reason I think the principle of the amendment is a bad one.  While I can see the motives-behind it, I agree with the Parliamentary Secretary that the House should be asked to reject it.</P>

      <P>Some of the Deputies opposite have read something into these amendments that is not there at all.  They suggested that this would solely depend on the whim of the chief engineering officer or the county surveyor.  That is not so.  All that each of these amendments provides for is this: that before they go ahead with this work they would have the benefit of the chief engineer's or the county surveyor's report before them.  The first amendment, No. 3, is designed to deal with the land or works owned by the local authority.  However, when we come to the proposed works dealt with under amendment No. 4, that is:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;any land in their functional area not being land owned by them, or any permanent construction ... not being a permanent construction which was constructed by them or which they are required by law to maintain,&rdquo;</P>
      <P>we can visualise some of the claims that may arise, that, mark you, under this Bill the local authority will have to pay for.  We can very well visualise, when we come to questions of drainage, cases arising where members of a local authority would come to agreements about some local jobs in their areas, saying: &ldquo;If you let my job through, I will let your job through irrespective of what the resulting damage may be or what it may ultimately cost the ratepayers of any particular county.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of these amendments is to ensure that, before a local authority will go ahead with a work, it will have a full report from its engineer giving an estimate of any damage that may be done.  If the local authority goes ahead with the work it will, in that event, do so with its eyes open.  If these amendments are accepted it will prevent the members of a local authority <Col N="2419" /> undertaking some job in their own area irrespective of the damage that might be caused by carrying it out. Before a council decides to go ahead with a work, it should know from the report of its chief engineer the possible damage that is likely to be done.  The amendment does not limit in any way the right of a local authority to go ahead with any particular job.  All it provides for is that the local authority will know where it stands before it starts the work.  I think that, in the public interest, this is a very necessary safeguard, one for which provision should be made under this Bill.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary should reconsider the matter from that point of view so as to ensure that local authorities, before they commit themselves, will know where they stand.  I think he would be wise to accept these amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we ought to give the local authorities credit for having some sense of responsibility.  No local authority would engage on a housing scheme, for example, or on the making or repair of a road without first consulting its county engineer.  The people who elect the members of local authorities are the very same people who elect us to represent them in Dáil Éireann.  Surely no Deputy assumes for a moment that a local authority, before engaging on a major work of any kind or even before effecting any changes, does not avail of the expert advice of its principal officials.  It is reasonable to assume that a local authority, before engaging on any of the types of works covered by this Bill, will seek the advice of its chief engineering officer and of any other official who can give advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to point out to Deputy Moran that the amendment speaks of &ldquo;a report from their chief engineering officer&rdquo;.  Does that mean that if the amendment were accepted and that if, say, the chief engineering officer were ill for three months, no work under this Bill could be done during that period? I do not think the Deputy is serious in suggesting that we should embody an amendment such as that in legislation. The duties of a chief engineer <Col N="2420" /> are defined and are made known to him before he takes up office.  They are defined to be &ldquo;to give to the county council such engineering service of an advisory, supervisory or executive nature as is required by the council in the exercise of its powers, including the duties of a county surveyor&rdquo;.  I do not think any local authority would be so foolish as to start the building of houses, the making or the maintenance of roads or the execution of drainage works without first consulting its county engineer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timoney</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that Deputy Moran, when arguing this amendment, did not quite appreciate the effect of it.  As has now been pointed out by the Parliamentary Secretary, its acceptance would have this further effect that, assuming the chief engineering officer were ill and that the local authority on the report of his deputy went ahead with some work, the local authority in that case would be doing something that was <i>ultra vires,</i> something that it would have no power to do.</P>
      <P>It is quite clear from the amendment that, in a case which is foreseen, &ldquo;where the local authority are satisfied upon a report from their chief engineering officer that damages are likely to be sustained&rdquo;, they cannot take action unless they are satisfied, and they cannot be satisfied unless they get a report from their chief engineering officer.  Deputies can visualise the case put by the Parliamentary Secretary where the chief engineering officer is ill.  A report from his deputy would be of no avail under the amendment as it stands.  If a local authority were to act upon his report, they certainly would leave themselves open to an action for damages.  The amendment creates restrictive conditions which, I think, would cause very considerable difficulty for local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the further objection that I have to the acceptance of the amendment, that it would put too much power in the hands of the chief engineering officer.  It would put the public in the position that there would not be very much use in their making their representations to the local authority, <Col N="2421" /> assuming that a member of the public foresaw damage in a particular case and reported it to the county council. The whole thing would have to be done through the chief engineering officer and through him alone.  I would not be satisfied at all if these amendments were accepted.</P>

      <P>If we assume, as I think we are entitled to, that local authorities will, in the main, behave as the Parliamentary Secretary has described, why should we see any danger in inserting this provision in the Bill?  We are entitled to assume that the local authority will seek a report from its engineering advisers.  If we regard that as a natural, reasonable approach, why should we object to this amendment? Suppose we do not, and that, in spite of its non-insertion the majority of local authorities will behave as the Parliamentary Secretary has described but that one local authority may act as Deputy Moran has said and that, as a result, demands come before the court that is to determine questions of compensation, and suppose further that these questions of compensation arise as a result of work on which that local authority had engaged without getting the prior report and advice referred to in these amendments, I wonder what would be said of that local authority by the court that is to determine questions of compensation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a lot of argument advanced about the title of the chief engineering officer referred to in the amendment.  In some places he is called the county surveyor.  I think that, in the Department of Local Government he is usually referred to as the county engineer.  Whether he is called the county engineer or the county surveyor the term, in my view, does not mean what it is alleged to convey by Deputy Timoney.  It does not follow that because this official is described as the chief engineering officer that he will report in all cases on the works which are carried in the county. He is, of course, the person who is responsible for all engineering works, but he may delegate his duties.  He is authorised under the terms of his appointment, as far as I know, to delegate part of his duties to other officials. <Col N="2422" /> Naturally, if he is ill a substitute is immediately appointed.  The principal assistant or some other person is authorised to undertake his work.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in that argument at all, good or bad.  There is no question of works being held up because he might be ill or absent.  There are two points to meet the arguments advanced by the Parliamentary Secretary.  Local bodies will behave in a sensible fashion and, in doing so, naturally they would get a report from the chief engineer or the county surveyor before they engage in any work.  If that is the natural thing to do, what is the objection to having it put in this Bill?  If you do not put it into the Bill there is the possibility that one local authority might happen to do as Deputy Moran described. It is then you will see the mess in which that body might find itself.</P>

      <P>There is no point in this amendment and there is no safeguard for even one local authority.  The amendment sets out that where damage has been sustained, or where the local authority are satisfied, upon a report from their chief engineering officer, that damage is likely to be sustained, they may execute such works as they consider reasonable.  They need not accept the advice of the chief engineering officer.  Deputy Smith talks about safeguards, even in respect of one local authority.  It means nothing &mdash;there is no safeguard.  And why are we so careful about the local authorities now?  There have not been similar provisions in the Housing Acts or in other Acts where it is definitely stated that the local authority is required to consult any officer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not correct to suggest that this would not provide a safeguard.  There is a very obvious safeguard.  If the engineer to a local authority says to them: &ldquo;You will be lunatics to go ahead with this scheme; it will run you into thousands of pounds by way of damage through flooding and it is a dangerous thing,&rdquo; the local Press will publish that and the ratepayers will know about it and it will act as a good check on the local authority.  If we are to assume that the local authorities are not going to <Col N="2423" /> go wrong, why is there a section in the Bill which sets out that where the Minister is satisfied that the local authorities are unable or unwilling to execute works, he may nominate a person to execute them?  You are taking power there to send people down over the heads of the local authorities. Does not that section presuppose that he will have to exercise some power over the local authority? Is it not abvious that the Minister is making provision for a situation where a local authority will act unreasonably?</P>
      <P>We can safely assume that local authorities will act in the way I suggest. I am sure everybody will agree that a prudent local authority will consult its officials and find out what will be the effect before they embark on any scheme.  What is the objection to making provision so that a prudent local authority can be advised through its engineer before proceeding with any undertaking?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">

      <P>The suggestion in this discussion is that the chief engineering officer will report to his county council or other local authority that damage amounting to thousands of pounds will be done if a certain scheme is embarked upon.  Deputies should realise that this Bill seeks not to do damage, but to carry out improvements.  But the attitude of the Opposition seems to be that the damage will outweigh whatever benefits may accrue through these schemes.  Is the position to be that we cannot trust the local authorities unless they go through the conduit pipe of a chief engineering officer? The fact is that the people, through their county council representatives, have been clamouring about the damage that has been taking place for years, and they are still restricted from carrying out the improvements which this measure will authorise them to carry out.  Surely we will act in consultation with the chief engineering officers, but why should we restrict the power of the local authorities themselves, who are the people who will eventually make the decision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot see the purpose of these amendments.  I do not know what is in Deputy MacEntee's mind.  Deputy <Col N="2424" /> Cowan endeavoured to interpret him, but I cannot do so.  On the Second Reading&mdash;Volume 114, col. 2157, 31st March, 1949, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We are now at the stage, therefore, at which it will be possible for a local authority to benefit a friend of a friend of an officer of that authority, or the friend of a friend of a member of the local authority, with sufficient influence to persuade whoever is going to be the responsible executive officer under this Bill, by making it possible for that authority under this Bill to remove, say, a weir in order to improve the drainage of a certain stretch of land along a river and, at the same time, do a great deal of damage to the private property of some other man.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He would not be a very responsible officer who would allow himself to be pulled to do some work for a friend and in so doing destroy the property of somebody else.</P>
    <P>I think this approach on the part of Deputies opposite is wrong.  This measure seeks to do a reasonable job of improvement and any compensation that may be awarded will be infinitesimal in comparison with the improvements it will make.  Why should we have to intimidate county councils or other local authorities and put them in such a position that they can do nothing unless through the conduit pipe of their engineering officers?  I say that if we were to adopt these amendments we would hamper and clog the operation of this measure and prevent these schemes being undertaken speedily.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says that this Bill is designed to give benefits and not create damage.  What we want to ensure is that if it gives benefits, those benefits will not be outweighed by the damage that will be caused in certain cases.  On the Second Reading I instanced a case which came within my own knowledge where £5,000 was spent and damage to many times that amount was caused down the river.  If water is doing damage to some person upstream it may do a lot more damage to valuable land downstream if it is let down before the river bed is cleaned <Col N="2425" /> out and prepared to take the extra water that will be let down upon it. Every individual would like to see the water taken off his land and brought somewhere else, but all the individual is concerned with is: &ldquo;Get it off my land no matter whether or not it causes damage downstream.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>County councillors have the same idea.  Some ratepayer will approach them and say: &ldquo;My land is being flooded and I wish the county council would get the water taken off.&rdquo;  What we are concerned with is that the county council will take a decision after considering a report from their engineers rather than have the council merely acting upon the motion of some member.  Some counties you will find 50, 60, 100 miles in length or breadth. How can county councillors go around to see whether some man's land is relieved of excess water and that it will not do greater damage downstream. Surely, in such a case it is absolutely essential that county councillors, for their own protection and for the protection of the ratepayers, should, before undertaking a certain job, find out if any damage is likely to be caused.  We urge the Minister to accept these amendments because they are a safeguard and the procedure is very normal.  There is no reason why the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary should not accept the amendments.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Because in Drainage Acts there is a long procedure to be followed which gives everybody a chance to make an objection.  There are surveys made which show the state of the land before drainage is undertaken and these surveys help to reinforce a claimant for any damages that may be caused through a scheme. There is no such provision in this Bill; and the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary can see from the amendments that they were forced to introduce that this was a very hastily drafted measure and did not take cognisance at all of the damage that might be done beyond even the £10 that would be upheld in the District <Col N="2426" /> Court.  The Government have had to mend their hand in this regard in several amendments but we are not satisfied, even though they have put in amendments which are longer in sum total than the original Bill, that they have yet introduced the safeguards necessary if damage is to be prevented.</P>

      <P>Deputy Moran seems to have no faith whatever in public authorities.  He seems to think that a member of a public authority will come into a county council meeting and suggest that certain things, of which no county council could approve, should be done for his area.  That is exactly what the amendments say. They lay it down that any county councillor can come and suggest the carrying out of improvements which would land the county council in the law courts with heavy damages awarded against it.  Has anybody with any experience of local authorities or of county councils ever found those bodies doing anything like that in respect of their districts.  I have been in public life for 20 years.  I know county councillors of all Parties and I know county councillors who belong to no Party.  I never knew a county councillor to come into a county council meeting and suggest against better judgment or advice that work should be carried out which would land the county council in a court of law and involve it in the payment of heavy damages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What happens in respect of works that county councils have to do?  Let us take sudden damage.  What does a county council do in respect of that? Does a man to whom sudden damage occurs outside his gate and who is thereby caused considerable inconvenience say that the work of repairing that damage must be done in a certain way and that it must be done at once?  No.  The chief engineering officer reports upon the damage done and the county engineers carry out the necessary repairs.  In the case of new works, who examines new works for the county council?  Is it not the chief engineering officer who examines them and reports thereon?  Is it not he who <Col N="2427" /> recommends as to whether or not these new works should be carried out?</P>
    <P>Why is it suggested by Deputy Moran and Deputy Aiken that county councils would act otherwise in respect of the particular works now under discussion? Is it not the chief engineering officer who will survey, report and supervise any such works?  Does anybody suggest anything else?  Surely, one has there the very safeguard that Deputy Moran wishes to put into this Bill. Safeguards are already there.  No county council has ever acted or will ever act in a different manner.  They will send out their chief engineering officer to examine the works and, if those works are approved of, they will be carried out under his supervision.</P>

The chief engineering officers.  Who will carry them out? The chief engineering officers.  Deputy Smith knows that as well as I do.

      <P>Deputy Aiken did not even bother to do that.  I at least can say that I have read Deputy MacEntee's speech on the Second Reading of this Bill.  I also read Deputy Moran's, Deputy Aiken's and Deputy Smith's speeches.  In all charity I do not think it would be fair to read out any extracts from Deputy Aiken's speech, but Deputy MacEntee dealt with the section on the Second Reading in order to show that this House was in some way abrogating its constitutional authority and its duties.  According to Deputy MacEntee, the reason why the House was doing that was in order to give county councils the right to decide what was in the public interest.  According to Deputy MacEntee the Dáil is the only body in the country which is entitled to so decide and for that reason the Dail has no right to say to county councils:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We will pass this authority on to you so far as these works are concerned and you can make up your minds about them because you are the people with the local knowledge.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In column 2153 of Volume 114, Deputy MacEntee says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Do Deputies not think that the House in this section is being asked to abrogate one of its major functions? We are here, in general, supposed to be the ultimate judges of the public interest.  That is why we have <Col N="2430" /> the law-making prerogative.  When we pass legislation to limit the rights of property in certain ways, or do other similar things, we do it as judges of the public interest.  We are, under the Constitution, the judges of the public interest; and one of the points that may arise in the courts&mdash;if people can ever get to the courts under this Bill&mdash;for the consideration of the judges, is as to whether we have any right to constitute the local authority as the unrestricted and unqualified judges of the public interest.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now Deputy MacEntee, in face of that speech which he made on the Second Reading of the Bill, wants to go even further than the Minister was going and wants to give to one individual in the employment of the local authority the sole right to judge what is or what is not in the public interest&mdash;that, despite the fact that also on the Second Reading of the Bill, as the Minister has said, Deputy MacEntee felt that under this section an officer or a member of a local body was going to be activated in carrying out these works because of pressure or influence brought to bear on him by a friend or a friend of a friend.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowan showed a very charitable disposition in his interpretation of what Deputy MacEntee intended by these amendments.  I confess that in face of the spoken word of Deputy MacEntee on the Second Reading I entirely fail to understand these amendments.  They are entirely against what Deputy MacEntee was pleading then.  Deputy Moran thinks that there is a safeguard and that is Press publicity. I had the interesting experience of reading some of Deputy Moran's recent speeches at the Mayo County Council.  I think Press publicity did not deter him, but I shall have an opportunity of dealing with him later and in another manner.</P>

      <P>If, as Deputy Hogan has stated, it is the practice of every local authority to follow the normal procedure of obtaining such a report, what is the objection to inserting this in the Bill?  Deputy Hogan says that it is unnecessary, that it will, in his opinion, do neither good nor harm.  We say it will do good and since his views and the views of those for whom he speaks are that it will neither do good nor harm, why not let us put it in the Bill?  Can the Parliamentary Secretary cite any case where a drainage authority, whether it be a local authority or a State Department, will proceed with work, even work involving only an expenditure of £100, without first obtaining a report from some person whom it regards as qualified to give a report, setting out what improvements are likely or what damage is likely to accrue, from the carrying out of the work.  The suggestion put forward by Deputy O'Higgins that we, in asking the Government to accept the amendment, are transferring from the local body to one individual the right to make a decision, of course, does not stand a moment's examination.  The fact that Deputies are afraid to have that stipulation contained in the measure conveys to my mind that what they are afraid of is that the local body might be hampered by the report and that if the report containing something that some members of the body did not desire, it would be better not to have it there at all.  There is no suggestion in the amendment that we are transferring the decision from the local body to the individual who is the chief engineer.  What we are leaving to the local authority is complete power to decide for themselves but only after they have before them a report which this Bill, after it becomes an Act will oblige them to have, rather than leave it in the loose open fashion suggested by Deputy O'Higgins:&mdash;&ldquo;Well that is what they will do anyhow.&rdquo;  If that is what they will do anyhow there can be no possible objection to our saying &ldquo;Let it be clearly and definitely inserted in the measure.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I am surprised that <Col N="2432" /> so much time has been spent on this matter.  I tried to defend Deputy MacEntee's motive in putting down this amendment because I could see what he had in mind, interpreting it from the printed words on the Order Paper.  Any interference with the rights of an individual is a serious matter and under the law, as I understand it, such interference can only be justified in the public interest.  Consequently I am satisfied that before a local authority can decide to enter upon a man's land for the purpose of doing certain works, they must be satisfied that it is in the public interest and they must so declare it in their resolution deciding to do the work. That being so before a local authority is going to take the risk of interfering with the rights of an individual, they will take all the steps necessary to see that their interference is in accordance with law and in accordance with the public interest.  For that purpose they will in the ordinary way consult their county surveyor and other officers. They will be advised by their law adviser, as he is bound to advise them, as to the possible legal effect of the decisions they will take.  Consequently I am satisfied that under the particular section as here drafted the local authority will in the ordinary way go through all the procedure that is necessary to ensure that the decision which they take is a proper decision which cannot be interfered with by any person who may go to the courts for the purpose of upsetting it.  As the Parliamentary Secretary has said the people who elect the local authorities are the very same people who elect us and send us here to make laws, and they are not going to stand over local authorities involving them in very heavy damages and very heavy costs.  I am perfectly satisfied that local authorities will, as always, act with the greatest sense of responsibility and the greatest discretion.  I think it is an insult to local authorities to say &ldquo;you cannot do such-and-such unless your paid official, your county surveyor, advises you to do it.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>If it does not say <Col N="2433" /> that it says nothing at all.  Here is what it does say: &ldquo;where local authorities are satisfied upon a report from the chief engineering officer that damage is likely to be sustained from flooding.&rdquo;  There is no doubt about it; that is the whole purport of the amendment. Where damage has occurred they can, by resolution and without a report, decide to go in and do the work, but where damage is likely they can only do it on the report of their chief engineering officer.  In this Dáil for a period of 25 years responsibility has been given from time to time to Ministers. To the Minister for Local Government responsibility is given by law and I think it would be an extraordinary thing if we were to write into an Act of Parliament that the Minister for Local Government may, if he is advised by a chief engineering officer, his Secretary or his Parliamentary Secretary, do certain things.  That would be an insult to the Minister and no Minister would accept a position in which his rights or his responsibilities would be limited by the advice he was to get from his paid officials.  I am quite sure, if it was written into an Act of Parliament that Deputy Smith, when he was Minister, could only do certain things if certain officials in his Department advised him to do them, he would say: &ldquo;You can get somebody else to act as Minister under those conditions. I would not do it.&rdquo;  And if an individual, a Minister, would not tolerate that sort of restriction, I think it is an insult that we in this House should say to local authorities who were elected by adult suffrage, by the very same people who elected us: &ldquo;You must have a report from one of your paid officials, your chief engineering officer, before you do this.&rdquo;  I think there is no necessity for us to insult local authorities in that way.  The whole history of local government for the past 25 years indicates in the main that local authorities have acted with responsibility and due regard to the public interest.  I am perfectly certain if we give them this authority, having behind it, as there is, the full power and authority of the courts of justice if they do not do what is right, the local authorities and every member of the local authorities will act very responsibly <Col N="2434" /> and sensibly in every decision taken regarding the powers and responsibilities vested in them by this section as drafted.</P>

      <P>I do not know why Deputy Cowan says that there are no cases in which Ministers have not to get a report from certain named officials before they can make up their mind.  It has been held in the courts that where a Minister signs some document without having had recourse to officers referred to in a statute his decision is null and void and that, in fact, he did not take the proper care, care imposed upon him by law, before he arrives at his decision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>All we are concerned with is that before a local authority can decide to do something which may do damage they must have before them a report from their chief engineering officer.  We know perfectly well that county councillors are not paid public men and cannot spend their time going around the 101 schemes proposed at the county council.  The local man alone will know the circumstances, that flooding affects certain lands or buildings. If the rest of the people from other parts of the county have not a report from the engineer they will have to make up their minds upon the speech of somebody who is interested and who knows nothing about engineering.  We want the local authority to take their decision after having received, and addressed themselves to the terms of, a report of a man qualified to give advice, a man who will have a certain permanent interest in the thing because his reputation will be based upon his report.  No engineer will report that 200 or 300 acres of land can be drained by spending a couple of thousand pounds if damage of tens of thousands of pounds is going to be done without at least calling the attention of the county council to the fact that damage of tens of thousands of pounds might be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins said that we should probe into motives.  I do not want to probe into motives very deeply, <Col N="2435" /> but to whom is the Minister proposing to give the power to decide to drain land without even the report of a county council engineer?  It is not the members elected by the voters of the county council area, but it may be under Section 3 a nominee of the Minister's.  Under Section 3 where the Minister is satisfied, perhaps by the report of a deputy or by a letter from somebody down the country, that certain work should be done and if the local authority are unable or unwilling to execute the works he may nominate a person to carry them out and give to that person in relation to these works all the powers local authorities have. If we pass this particular clause without the amendment suggested by Deputy MacEntee, that individual will have power to execute works of all kinds which come under this Bill without even getting a report from a county council engineer.</P>

We are not even asking that they shall not go ahead with the work, even if the engineer indicates that damage is to be done, but that at least before they decide to do it, and to do the damage, they will have before them and address themselves to the terms of an engineer's report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I will say something new now.  The most important thing to keep in mind in discussing this amendment is that, in sub-section (3) of this section, local authorities are being asked to take over and perform a new function not hitherto performed by them.  That must be kept in mind, as it is fundamental to the whole argument. Under Section 2 of the Bill, you can have any machinery you like.  The machinery is there to do it.  It can be done in the future as in the past, under sub-section (2) of Section 2. There is no necessity to have this amendment at all in respect of that sub-section, but in sub-section (3) of <Col N="2437" /> Section 2 a very important matter comes to be considered.</P>
      <P>We all know in our own areas the work that will fall to be done under that sub-section.  We realise quite well the work that local authorities will be called upon to perform under it.  All possible safeguards are necessary to safeguard the ratepayers of a particular area, to safeguard the people in general and to safeguard also the people on whose lands the local authority must enter.  There are many people to be safeguarded under that sub-section.  A huge amount of work will fall to be done in every county in Ireland under that sub-section.  The whole function this Bill is meant to serve is all in that sub-section.  That must be remembered. There was no necessity whatever&mdash;I said that on the Second Reading&mdash;for any legislation to give local authorities power to safeguard their own property. I never saw the necessity.  They could carry out any work on any property or buildings they had, without legislation. Under this sub-section, there will devolve on local authorities matters and work which the Board of Works, in the ordinary course, if they had time to reach it, would be doing.  They were organised to do it and have machinery and power under the 1945 Drainage Act to do it.  They might not reach it for the next ten or 25 years.</P>

Every possible safeguard is necessary.  I want to put this to the Parliamentary Secretary and to the Minister for Local Government: is it the local authority in council, the elected members of the local authority, that will determine any particular matter in connection with this Bill, or is it their executive officer?  There is nothing in this Bill and nothing in any Ministerial amendment to show that. Is all the work under this Bill not an executive function?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Let the Parliamentary Secretary not walk into it for a moment.  It is clearly admitted now that it is an executive function, that the elected members of the local authority, the democratically elected members, have no say, good, bad or indifferent, in this Bill except with the goodwill or otherwise of the manager. Is not that so?  Let us be honest and frank about it.  Let us realise what we are doing and understand that, in asking that, before the county manager undertakes to carry out the drainage work in any county, he must have the report of the chief engineer before him. Will the Minister say who will determine the order of priority in which any of the works, listed and already in the Minister's Department from all over the Twenty-six Counties, are to be carried out?  Who will select the works in the particular areas and who will determine the amount of money to be spent on each work?  That is a most important matter and we would like to have these questions answered. Is there anything unreasonable in suggesting&mdash;even if the county councils, that is the members of the county councils, had the determination of this matter, as to whether work is to be carried out or not&mdash;that before determining it, they should have the report of the chief engineer before them?  Is there anything unreasonable in asking a sensible body of men to have the report of their chief engineer before they decide whether it is feasible, sensible and justifiable to carry out a particular work?  I cannot see in what way bringing in the engineer into these two sub-sections is going to hold up the work.  It will not hold it up in the slightest.  Every local authority in Ireland wants to go on with the work that has to be done.  We object in principle to more work being thrown over on local authorities and their staffs.  I said on the Second Stage that they were ill-equipped to carry out <Col N="2439" /> the work they were going to be called upon to carry out under sub-section (3) of Section 2.  However, they will take on this work willingly and members of local authorities will put their full weight and influence behind it to get as much as possible done.  They may have to neglect other work.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>It arises under this amendment because the amendment says the report must be made to the council by the chief engineer before a work is undertaken and in order to get that report he will need assistance&mdash; and very substantial assistance&mdash;that he may not have available at the moment. I hope the Minister will see the wisdom of accepting this, or even agreeing to consider the matter for the Report Stage.  I do not know whether that will be satisfactory or not.  He might give it further consideration and tell us now whether it is the members of the local authority, by a majority or unanimously, in a functional area, that will have the determination of these matters or whether it is their chief executive officer.  It does not make any difference, on this point.  I have every confidence that the county managers all over Ireland will do the work honestly and well.  I have no objection to their doing it, but there need not be so much talk here about local authorities, in some instances, hindering this work.  So far as I know local authorities, the members are the same as ourselves&mdash;no better and no worse&mdash;and they will do any job they are asked to do as honestly as any of us on any side of the House would do it.  I suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary should accept the amendment in principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hard to understand the contradictory lines of argument put forward by the Opposition. Deputy Smith and Deputy Moran were very fearful about the actions of certain local authorities&mdash;or of one <Col N="2440" /> local authority, as one of the Deputies said&mdash;in the matter of carrying out works which would cause a great deal of damage.  It is hard to reconcile these statements with the generally accepted principle by the Fianna Fáil Party of county management.  It is not news for members on this side of the House to say what their general attitude towards the members of local authorities is and always has been. Shortly after the new Government was formed, we announced that it was intended to amend substantially the County Management Act.  We are not going to be forced, on this amendment, into a position in which we will change it in any piecemeal fashion.  The county manager, as the law stands, is responsible for the control and direction of staff, and surely, therefore, no member of the Fianna Fáil Party, which has always been such a champion of the County Management Act, and county managers in general, will think other than that the manager, in respect of such works as these, will advise the local authority and direct that the county engineer will give the benefit of his advice before schemes like these are carried out.  Deputy Smith started off by asking how could a local authority make up its mind to carry out a certain scheme without having the chief engineering officer's report before it. How can a local authority engage in any housing scheme without having the report of the chief engineering officer or town surveyor before it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>There is, of course. Local authorities do not engage in any work whatever&mdash;and the Deputy knows it&mdash;without first having the report of the town surveyor or county engineer. I do not think there need be the slightest fear that local authorities will not, as they have always done, and as we expect they will do in the future, take the advice and guidance of their <Col N="2441" /> expert advisers.  As Deputy Cowan said, and as I repeat, it is reasonable to assume that the Minister, before he proposes to effect a change or to carry out any scheme of works, will take the advice of his Departmental secretary, of his legal advisers and of his technical advisers; but there is no provision to that effect in any Act which went through this House.  I do not think there is the slightest necessity at all to have such a provision in the section and I do not see why we are arguing about it, because, under the County Management Act, which we propose to change substantially, this power is vested at present in the county manager.  We do not, however, propose to amend it in any piecemeal fashion.</P>

    <P>Amendment declared lost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision, I assume, governs the cognate amendment No. 4, which was discussed with amendment No. 3.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 4 not moved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (4) to insert two new sub-sections as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>( )  The expression &ldquo;permanent construction&rdquo; in the foregoing sub-section shall include piers, marine works, sea walls and embankments and any roads, causeways, road foundations or passageways between the mainland and any island or islands adjacent thereto.</P>
      <P>( )  Subject to the provisions of this Act a local authority may proceed to repair, reconstruct, enlarge or raise any permanent construction described in the foreging sub-section of this section irrespective of any sailing or navigation rights or any <i>profits-a-prendre</i> or easement alleged to be in existence over any channel or passageway between the mainland and adjacent islands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The definition of &ldquo;permanent construction&rdquo;, as contained in this Bill, is limited to roads, bridges, houses, buildings, walls and embankments.  To <Col N="2445" /> my mind, that definition would not cover marine works, piers or embankments in maritime counties where the danger of subsidence, flooding and so forth is much more serious in some of these cases than it actually is inland. There is another matter which I should like to point out to the House, namely, that a work under the Bill may mean the building of a house that is, for instance, undermined, in a town.  If through undermining, due to flooding or subsidence, a house inland is or may be injured there is provision in the Bill to deal with that matter and to provide for it.  If there is provision to deal with matters of that kind which occur inland, there is all the more reason why similar provision should be made with reference to inundation by the sea.</P>
    <P>Those of us who come from maritime counties know that we have several instances of houses being undermined due to erosion and flooding by the sea where proper embankments are not provided.  So, when we are making this provision for the people who live inland, there is the very same reason, if not a much stronger reason, I submit to the House, for making similar provision for the people who are living around the coast.  In addition, you have a peculiar position arising with reference to roads or the making of roads and passageways between some islands in maritime counties and the mainland.  There is one particular place which I have in mind in my own county in which a sum of money was expended by the Board of Works on the construction of a road between an island known as Inishnakillew in Clew Bay and the mainland.  All the people in this island gave their consent for the work to be done but the Board of Works did not finish the work that particular year.  Then an agitation was started by a gentleman on the mainland. He got some of the people to go back on the consent they had previously given.  The result now is that that work is there and it is half submerged. It is all right when the tide is out but when it is in some of the people claim navigation rights.  One solitary individual has been responsible for all that and his sole purpose was obstruction.  I think that that is a <Col N="2446" /> matter that should be covered.  I have tried to provide for it in this particular sub-section so as to enable the local authorities to go ahead with works of this kind&mdash;and not be held up by the frivolous objection of one particular individual&mdash;where it is a matter of public policy in the interests of the people concerned.</P>
    <P>These are the main purposes of the introduction of these two amendments. First, to provide through &ldquo;permanent construction&rdquo; that we will be able to deal with serious questions of flooding and inundation and in some cases to build embankments to stop encroachment by the sea, particularly where houses are endangered.  As I have said, we are making provision for that in regard to houses inland and there is no reason why the people on the coast should not be entitled to those same facilities we are providing in principle under this Bill.  Secondly, to deal with the question of works which are quite important to the islands adjoining the mainland.  We have a number of these small islands in coastal counties that have to be provided for and whose roads may be flooded or wiped out or interfered with as a result of inundation by the sea.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order. May I ask if this amendment is in order, having regard to the fact that we have already passed Section 1 in which the term &ldquo;permanent construction&rdquo; had been defined and that term is used only, as far as I can see, in Section 2?  If we have already defined it in Section 1, are we entitled to put in a second definition after Section 2?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It should more properly go with the interpretation section.  Whether it would be in order, therefore, is another question.  It would, in the interpretation section. Does the Deputy mean the second portion of this amendment?</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point.  Since the amendment says that &ldquo;The expression &lsquo;permanent construction&rsquo; in the foregoing sub-section...&rdquo; is it not quite proper that such a special definition may appear elsewhere than in the interpretation section of the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The same applies to the next one.  It might be where it is, but I think it would be more proper in the interpretation section.  I see the Deputy's point, too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>We may take it that, as the Ceann Comhairle has ruled, we cannot raise the matter again with the Leas-Cheann Comhairle? I do not want to do that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>On the other hand I think that the second sub-section is out of order.  I submit that the amendment is completely outside the scope of the Bill.  If one refers to the Long Title it will be seen that this is an Act to enable certain local authorities to execute works affording relief or protection from flooding, landslide, subsidence and similar occurrences and to provide for matters connected with <Col N="2448" /> the matters aforesaid.  There is no reference at all to that in the amendment. It would appear to me that the object is to enable local authorities to construct, enlarge, repair or raise causeways and piers, namely, causeways leading to the sea.  It was not intended that such matters be dealt with in this Bill.  I think it must be agreed that such works would be more appropriate to a Coast Erosion or a Marine Works Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that this amendment is quite in order.  I respectfully point out to the House that the amendment starts: &ldquo;Subject to the provisions of this Act...&rdquo;  That means that the work that would be done under this section is subject to the provision, including the Long Title.  What I have in mind would be damage as a result of inundation by the sea, subsidence due to the sea or erosion due to the sea.  It is flooding, at all events, and it is subject to the provisions of this Bill.  I am suggesting to the House that it is very important that, when we are providing this relief for houses collapsing in inland areas, for instance, it is just as important that damage by the sea should be dealt with too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that the words &ldquo;Subject to the provisions of this Act&rdquo; refer to the actual carrying out of the scheme rather than to the method of entering on land, claims for compensation and things like that which are mentioned specifically in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Subject to the whole of the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Subject to the provisions of this Act&rdquo; seems to make the amendment in order.  It provides a saving for the work which the amendment proposes to carry out.  I am ruling that the amendment is in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>In any case, I am not prepared to accept the amendment inasmuch as it involves the big problem of coast erosion which would require a rather lengthy Bill.  Works to prevent coast erosion and other matters <Col N="2449" /> mentioned in the amendment could not be dealt with effectively under the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I again urge on the Parliamentary Secretary to consider these amendments?  We had it on the last section that a local authority in its discretion can proceed through the county manager, or however it may work out, to pick and choose works in one form and another. The mere fact of accepting the amendments does not mean that every single piece of coast erosion will be dealt with.  Can the Parliamentary Secretary not see that we are making provision in this Bill for the repairing of walls and embankments, that there are many roads on the sea coast which badly need walls and embankments and that there are many houses on the sea coast that badly need protection.  I know of some houses that have had to be abandoned owing to the action of the sea.  We will be coming up against these difficulties on the sea coast more than inland.  For instance, if a house in any town or its foundations are threatened by flooding, we are making provision to deal with that.  Are not ratepayers in a coastal area entitled to as much attention as people in the towns?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>As it is, that type of person and that type of construction are covered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot see how they are covered.  If they were covered, I would not be moving this amendment. The Parliamentary Secretary says it is possible to deal with erosion.  If he can satisfy me that matters of the kind I have mentioned can be dealt with under the Bill without this amendment I am quite satisfied, but I cannot see that from the Bill.  I suggest that, as the Bill stands, marine works or anything of that nature are not covered. I am giving the Parliamentary Secretary an instance of a house built beside the sea which is threatened by coast erosion.  Will the Parliamentary Secretary assure me that under the Bill we are entitled to build an embankment against the ravages of the sea in order to protect that house?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="2450" />
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no idea of the place the Deputy has in mind, but I can conjure up a picture of the sea eating into the foundations of a house. The provision of an embankment in my opinion, and I expect in the opinion of a local authority, would not be sufficient to ensure that the same thing would not happen again.  Dealing with the flooding of roads or the flooding of lands is entirely different from dealing with the force of sea water and consequent flooding.  If a local authority considered it was feasible and that the work undertaken would be permanent, I would imagine they would carry it out.  If a local authority feel that a pier or embankment is in danger from sea flooding, they can undertake works under this Bill to prevent that.  It would, however, be hard to include other things which the Deputy has in his amendment, such as passageways between the mainland and any island or islands adjacent thereto.  He will readily appreciate that local authorities will be very reluctant to accept the slightest responsibility for coast erosion.  As a matter of fact, I do not think any Department of State at present has any responsibility for coast erosion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot follow the Parliamentary Secretary, because in one breath he says that we cannot go so wide as to take in coast erosion under this Bill and, in the next breath, he says that protection can be given by means of embankments and so forth against the action of the waves which cause coast erosion.  On which leg is he standing?  We have just turned down an amendment to Section 3 which gives to the Minister's nominee and to the county council's manager, if the section goes through, the right to carry out works even without receiving a report from an engineer.  Damage may be done through such procedure. One thing in regard to which you can safely give a county manager or an non-technical man the assurance that he could not do any damage is protection against the force of the waves. Small coastal works have been carried out in the way of embankments and so forth to protect roads against sea erosion.  I know of one case in County Louth where a road was being undermined <Col N="2451" /> and certain houses were threatened and under the minor improvements scheme the Office of Public Works carried out protective embankment works.</P>
      <P>The difficulty about this Bill so far as I can see is that it is going to replace the minor improvements scheme and the rural improvement scheme and we will not be able to get as much done under it as we were able to do under these schemes.  The whole tendency will be to carry out employment and relief works under the provisions of the Bill rather than under the minor employment branch of the Office of Public Works.  I think we should make provision, therefore, in this Bill to ensure that the local authorities or the Minister's nominee, if he appoints a substitute for the local authorities, should have the power to do what the Board of Works have done for the relief of employment and for the improvement of drainage and transport facilities for the people and also protective embankments against the encroachment of the sea.  The county manager or the Minister's nominee cannot do any harm even if he proceeds without the report of the engineer.</P>
      <P>There are several other matters that are mentioned as well as the protection of piers and sea-walls and embankments. There are also causeways between the mainland and islands off the west coast.  I think it is important that where the roads were half-built and were held up because some people withdrew their consent to a work which they had originally consented to, we should, when passing a Bill like this, give the local authority power to go ahead and complete the work and put it into such a state of repair as to enable the people to get from the mainland to the islands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>It must be very obvious that this is not a serious contribution to the Bill.  One wonders if it is even intended to be a serious contribution. It envisages completely new departures from the work envisaged in the Bill itself.  Deputy Moran admitted that he was asking for something outside the scope of what the Bill is intended to do.  It is clearly shown that it is:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2452" />&ldquo;An Act to enable certain local authorities to execute works affording relief or protection from flooding, landslides, subsidence and similar occurrences and to provide for matters connected with the matters aforesaid.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The intention of the amendment is to tag on to that measure appeals for piers, marine works, sea-walls and embankments and so on.  It is obviously a matter that would call for completely new legislation outside the scope of this Bill.  Some of the piers are State owned, some are privately owned and there is such a welter of possibilities in my mind suggested in this amendment that one might wonder if he wanted this Bill to go through for the purpose intended.  I think we should overthrow this attempt to overload the Bill by the introduction of matter which is completely irrelevant to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether these amendments in connection with this question are proper or not I leave it to any member of this House coming from a maritime county to decide.  I suggest to the Minister that subsidence of these piers and marine works due to the action of the sea would possibly occur quicker than it would occur through the action of a river in connection with some inland works.  Again, I appeal to the Minister on this question.  Does he not realise that under this Bill we propose to take on work that was never done by a local authority before, that was never owned by a local authority and that a local authority had nothing to do with?  To anybody who comes from a maritime county these are some of the matters that are just as urgent as the flooding that you have inland. As a matter of fact, in some cases they are much more urgent.  I have in mind cases in which houses are gravely threatened on the edge of the coast by the action of the sea.  I cannot see the cogency of the argument that that should not be done in that case, whereas a similar subsidence due to the action of fresh water can be done.  If they do it in one case they are entitled to it in the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As for the other amendment I have down here I can assure the Minister I was not wasting my time drafting <Col N="2453" /> amendments without having some idea behind them.  I am telling the Minister now that the Parliamentary Secretary in charge of the Board of Works can tell him the truth of what I have stated before in this House in connection with some of the causeways between the islands and the mainland in Clew Bay. I refer specifically to one, and that is the causeway road from Inniskillew Island to the mainland.  It is quite obvious to any Deputy in this House that you are liable to have subsidence and erosion much more in the case of a road that is subjected to flooding by sea water than you will have inland. These are matters that we are coming up against down the country.  I think this is the proper Bill to provide for these matters.  I am not suggesting that under this amendment you should pass outside the scope of the Bill.  In other words, relief would be given where you have subsidence or the wiping out of roads or embankments due to sea action.  This is due to flooding, too, and is a matter which is being dealt with by this Bill.  When we are making these provisions for inland people the same thing should be done for the people on the coast.</P>
    <P>I quite agree with the Minister that possibly many local authorities would not take on the responsibilities contained in this Bill at all; that is, as far as all the sections following sub-section 2 are concerned.  Local authorities, in the main, if any other Department or the State would carry out drainage, would not be anxious to take on this work.  I am sure many members of local authorities listening to me tonight hold that view just as strongly as I do.  However, we are assured by the Minister that the funds are going to be provided by the State for works under this Bill.  When that is being done, if local authorities are going to carry out some of the jobs of drainage and so forth that have been thrust on them for the first time, there is no reason why they should not take on the responsibility of dealing with these matters that arise along the coast as well.</P>
    <P>Of course, there is this.  We will come to these points later on, as to who is going to pay for the future <Col N="2454" /> maintenance of these works.  This is a question which will agitate the minds of many members of local authorities here and throughout the country.  At all events, if we assume that the State wants to have this work done and that the State is now going to push over on local authorities the duty of doing these works that were formerly carried out by the Board of Works or some other Department of State, when they are taking on the responsibility of one type of work I do not see any reason why they should not also be prepared to do the other works of a similar nature that are provided for in my amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point I should like to make.  According to the design of this Bill as introduced, where work is carried out by a local authority or the Minister's nominee and causes damage the damage will have to be paid for by the local authority.  We are moving later on in this Bill that the damage should be met by the State.</P>
      <P>In this particular section moved by Deputy Moran there is going to be no damage.  Are the Parliamentary Secretary and the Government relying upon the fact that local authorities will have to pay the damages to influence them not to carry out work?  Why is the Parliamentary Secretary in this particular case, not accepting the amendment when the works can be carried out without doing damage to anybody, because nobody can hurt the sea?  If we keep it from sweeping away a piece of land it is not going to hurt people over in America.  They cannot claim damages for it.  I think that, under a Bill of this kind, we should give the people along the seacoast some benefits. They will have to pay when works are carried out for other people in their area.  Everyone acquainted with our seacoasts knows that quite an amount of damage is being done by coast erosion.  In some cases the expenditure of a few pounds would help to stop that erosion.  By the erection of very slight works you can use the power of the sea to sweep in sand and rocks and so help to defend the land against the further encroachment of the waves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2455" /> I would appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister to accept this amendment and make it quite clear that this is a type of work that can be proceeded with.  It is more urgent to protect good land or a good building from attack by the sea than it is to relieve some classes of land from water.  We all know that there is a lot of land that is high and dry above water that is being flooded and cannot be drained.  We also know that there is a lot of land under water <Col N="2456" /> which, if it were drained, would be as useless as some of the land above water.  In this case there is no question of the county engineer or the Minister's nominee going to engage on works to protect land against sea erosion unless it is worth saving.  A calculation can be made as to the value of the land and the cost of the works.  I think that the Deputy's amendment is a very reasonable one, and that it should be accepted by the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7, on behalf of Deputy MacEntee:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (4) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>( )  Should a local authority execute works under this section no liability of any kind shall attach to the local authority in respect of such works.</P>
      <P>This Bill, which was announced to the country as a Bill to do a lot of ameliorative work, drainage and so forth, at the expense of the State, was promised when the Government withdrew a couple of million pounds for the reconstruction of roads.  It was the Central Authority that was giving this money to the local authorities to build the roads and our contention is that whatever work is carried out under this Bill, it should be on the responsibility of the central Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had a couple of amendments turned down already by the Government, amendments which were designed to secure that where damage was done in an attempt to give benefit to certain districts or to certain people, that that damage should be minimised by having proper inquiries made before the work was undertaken.  The Government did not agree to our amendments and we hold that if a county manager or a Minister's nominee is to proceed with work which may cause grave damage and be of very little benefit, the Minister and the Government should guarantee the local authority against any action for damage.  I know one case where a Government Department urged on by a Minister spent a few thousand pounds in an attempt to drain poor, marshy land.  The result was that good land further downstream was flooded.  There was agitation in the district adversely affected by those flood waters for a number of years and all sorts of steps had to be taken in order to relieve the local authority so that they, in turn, would relieve the farmers adversely affected by the flood waters let down. <Col N="2459" /> The Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary refuse to accept an amendment which will give the local authority, the Minister's nominee, power to carry out works where no damage could be caused.  It appears to me that they are insisting upon keeping this penalty upon the local authority by way of compensation for damage done so that there will be a break and an impediment upon such authority in the carrying out of these works.</P>
    <P>We have had numerous instances of where the present Government has postponed or put into abeyance schemes which were doing good work and have substituted therefor a nebulous promise that they will do something better in the future.  We had that experience in connection with land improvements.  It looks to me as if the Government are going to insist that the local authority bear the cost of all the damage that may be done under this Bill in substitution for their promise to do something better in the knowledge that the local authorities will not undertake the risk involved in the carrying out of whatever work might be done.  I hope that the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary will agree that when this Bill was introduced it was represented as something which would fulfil a long-felt want and do great good in relieving lands subject to flooding and that the entire cost would be carried out at the expense of the State.  It was claimed that this was very much superior to the rural improvements scheme and minor relief schemes and other measures under which improvement works were carried out in the past.  This was supposed to be a Bill that would cut out all red tape and white tape and green tape and get on with the work.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that, as the Bill stands, with the penalty upon the local authorities in attempting to carry out the work of an unknown amount of damage for which they will be responsible, very little work will be done. Certainly less work will be done under this Bill than would have been done had the Government carried on in a <Col N="2460" /> normal fashion with the minor relief schemes and the rural improvement scheme.  Under the rural improvement scheme everyone affected knew what they were facing and what they had to pay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Ceann Comhairle has ruled the amendments are in order. My point is that under these other schemes the limit of payment on the part of the local beneficiaries was 25 per cent. of the work carried out.  In this particular case work may be carried out and money may be spent on work which may cost many times the money spent in compensation.  If that is going to be done in order that this Government may show a &ldquo;new look&rdquo; I think the Government should pay for their &ldquo;new look&rdquo;.  Under the old schemes the central Government paid.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has said that before and I have warned him.  He must not contrast this amendment with any other scheme.  He <Col N="2461" /> must argue as to whether this amendment should or should not be accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>We have five amendments being discussed at the one time and all of them are designed to limit the liability on the local authorities and on the farmers concerned and to get the State to carry out the promise which it made, through the mouths of its Ministers, when this Bill was first mooted.  This Bill was supposed to be some compensation to those people unemployed because of the cut in the road grants.  It was to do great work for the farmers.  If the farmers whose lands may be flooded owing to lack of proper precautions&mdash;even the lack of a report from the county engineer before the scheme is decided upon&mdash;have to pay portion of their own compensation I do not think this is a proposition which would have the consent of the House or those people in particular who are frightened about all the improvements that are going to be done on the land and all that is going to be done for the relief of unemployment. It is of little good to a farmer to have Ministers making fine speeches about the improvement of his land if, instead of improving that land, they flood good land and compel the farmer to pay for it.  If they call the tune they must pay the piper.  Our suggestion is that the State should ensure the local authority will not be mulcted with heavy costs and compensation on foot of this Bill</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, it is hard to understand the approach of the Opposition to this Bill.  I have a very distinct recollection of Deputy MacEntee saying on the Second Reading of this particular Bill that it would not give 1,000 men work for one week and now we have Deputy Aiken afraid we are going to do too much work under this Bill. So far as compensation is concerned, the local authorities were aware three months ago that they would be liable for compensation.  Despite the fact that every single local authority knew that they would be liable for compensation they have submitted to the Department for approval by the Minister schemes amounting to £2,000,000.  No matter what Deputy Aiken may think of local authorities, they are not such <Col N="2462" /> fools as he would have us believe they are.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I can say &ldquo;local authorities&rdquo;, because it was Deputy Aiken and the present critics of this Bill who introduced the County Management Act under which the county manager was to be regarded as the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but the County Management Act will be repealed in due course and I do not know whether Deputy Aiken will support that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>They will come home very quickly so far as Deputy Aiken is concerned.  The local authorities have submited schemes amounting to £2,000,000 and they are fully aware of the fact that they will be liable for compensation.  So far as the Bill generally is concerned, it is an enabling Bill and there is no obligation on any local authority to engage in any works provided for under the Bill but, in conjunction with the introduction of the Bill, an announcement was made by the late Minister that 100 per cent. grants would be given for these works.  I do not think that that is unreasonable and I do not think that any member of a local authority who is a member of this House objected very strongly on the Second Reading to the fact that local authorities would be liable for compensation. In any case, if Deputy Aiken wants to take it that way, it is a safeguard. If a local authority or as he likes to call it, the county manager, knows that it will be liable for compensation, that is an adequate safeguard.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>You should have told that to Deputy MacEntee when he was introducing his County Management Act.  They are fully aware that they have to pay compensation.  The very fact that compensation has to be paid by the local authority is a safeguard. No local authority is going to engage in any scheme which will involve it in any colossal expenditure.  Deputy Aiken also suggested that works under this Bill were being substituted for rural improvement schemes and minor relief schemes.  Of course he knows that provision has been made in the Estimates for rural improvement schemes and minor relief schemes and that these schemes will be carried out as usual.  He mentioned that this was another attempt to bind local authorities with red tape legislation, but I suggest that all these amendments are so much red tape and white tape&mdash;the Deputy mentioned every single colour in the rainbow&mdash;the only intention of which is to make it impossible for local authorities to carry out any works under this Bill.  There is a complete change of front so far as this Bill is concerned on the Opposition Benches.  There is no similar provision, as the Deputy suggests should be inserted by this amendment, in the Local Government Act of 1925 which places the responsibility for the construction and maintenance of roads on the local authority. In that particular Act, responsibility is imposed on local authorities to maintain and construct roads and there is no question of the money involved at all.  The grants are announced from year to year.  In conjunction with the introduction of this Bill, it was announced that 100 per cent. grants would be given and from the returns we have received from local authorities we believe that they are well satisfied with the Bill.</P>

      <P>These amendments get down to the whole kernel of this Bill and the Parliamentary Secretary let the cat out of the bag when he suggested that the fact that local authorities would be saddled with the payment of compensation would discourage them from going ahead with the schemes permitted under this Bill.  The Parliamentary Secretary said something to the effect that the Opposition were changing front in connection with this matter.  If he was listening to the Second Reading of this Bill he will remember quite well&mdash;and the House will remember quite well&mdash;how strenuously we opposed the suggestion that local authorities and the ratepayers throughout the country should become liable for some of the charges which will arise under this Bill.  This Bill at that time was held up as the be-all and end-all of the Coalition Government's policy to provide employment.  It was announced here from Ministerial level that all the people who had become disemployed on the roads would find work under this.  We now find that the Parliamentary Secretary has announced this evening that it is only intended to do very small jobs.  But let the jobs be small or large, I think that what members of local authorities who are members of this House are interested in is this: if there is going to be no damage or if the damage is going to be negligible, why not provide for the payment for that damage?  Why put it on the local authorities?  Who is going to pay the necessary officials who will be required by the local authority for the administration of works under <Col N="2467" /> the Bill if any work is going to be done?  Every member of a local authority knows that officials' time, particularly engineers' time, is already fully occupied and is it not obvious that if any work is going to be done it will involve the employment of quite a number of engineers?  With the salaries these gentlemen receive at the present time that will be no joke for the local authorities.  In addition to that&mdash;again if any work is going to be done&mdash;a considerable amount of clerical staff will be needed to work with the professional gentlemen to supervise and prepare these schemes for the local authority.</P>
      <P>Another matter that is really as important as the damage that might be done is the maintenance of these works. We all know that it is a waste of time to spend money on compensation for damage unless money is provided for maintenance.  Who will bear the cost if, as the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister have said, a considerable amount of work will be done under the Bill with relief to farmers all over the country as a result?  Those of us who are members of local authorities know already that the rates have reached a very high level.  On local authorities we deal with matters of urgent importance and we know that we have to put off many schemes because we feel that the ratepayers would not be able to provide the additional rates necessary to carry them out.  In addition to paying for the damage and for the necessary officials, it is proposed to provide in the Bill that the local authorities, or the ratepayers through their local authorities, will have to pay for the future maintenance of these works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of us who are members of local authorities know that a number of works done under the 1935 drainage code had to be taken over by local authorities under the 1945 Drainage Act.  They had to take over the upkeep of them and, although provision was very limited, we had to keep them at the same level as that at which we took them over, but even that&mdash;I know in my own county&mdash;involved a very, very heavy burden indeed on the ratepayers to meet that annually recurring expenditure.  If, as the Minister would have us believe, a lot of drainage will <Col N="2468" /> be done under this Bill and if the local authorities have to accept responsibility for its maintenance, it will be a crushing burden on them.  When the Parliamentary Secretary made that statement he let the cat out of the bag because he knows that when local authorities know that they are going to be responsible for the raising of these moneys they will say: &ldquo;We cannot bite off more than we can chew. We will not do the works we could do under this Bill because it is beyond our capacity to pay for them.&rdquo;  The Minister is taking power, under Section 3 in connection with any works which he considers should be done by local authorities if the local authorities even on grounds of expense turn it down having examined the question on its merits, to send John Brown down from the Department&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>These are matters of vital importance as far as local authorities are concerned.  We can visualise the type of work that will be carried on, say, drainage.  If, as was pointed out on the Second Reading, fishery rights are interfered with you could run into very heavy damages. You could have serious flooding, as was pointed out by, I think, Deputy Aiken, between one county and another.  If more water is released than the main waterway can take you may have serious consequences.  Before a local authority could embark on schemes of that kind they would have to see where those schemes would lead them and I want to know where the Minister's proposal comes in that all the unemployed are going to find employment on them.  The rights of mill owners on rivers are also concerned if they are interfered with, because, you must remember, under this Bill we take the power of diversion of water.  It would <Col N="2469" /> mean that very heavy damages would be incurred and the ratepayers, under this Bill, are left with the responsibility to pay for all that.</P>
      <P>If these amendments, or at least some of them, are not accepted&mdash;the first amendment is rather a general one, the second provides for the work plus the damage, and the third for the works if the Minister is not prepared to pay for the damage&mdash;this Bill will be completely illusory.  Local authorities will have no scope to do the work they want to do, as they will be scalded with the charges that will arise.  Members of local authorities know that every year different councillors put in a number of works which are dealt with at the annual meeting&mdash;the taking over of roads, and so on&mdash;but these are always put on the long finger and put off to the following year, when it is pointed out that they would cost thousands of pounds, as the local authorities are not prepared to undertake such cost.  In the same way, if the local authorities are to be responsible for damage caused in doing these works, for the payment of the officials, administrators and clerical staffs, and above all for the maintenance, they will not be prepared to face the ratepayers with those high demands and the Bill will be illusory and futile.</P>
      <P>If the Minister is sincere in trying to get local authorities to go ahead with the drainage we all want done and if there is not going to be much danger of great damage, why spoil the ship for a ha'port of tar?  If he is providing money for the actual works and there will be little or no resultant damage, why not throw in the cost of the damage?  Why not accept responsibility for that very small minor issue &mdash;which he suggests it is&mdash;when he is accepting responsibility for the major issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no word in the Bill to support the Minister's statement that the full amount of money necessary will be provided.  The Minister undertook that, but that may be for this year only.  Next year we may find a local authority asked to put up 10 or 15 per cent. locally, as in the case of road grants.  Other Acts state that the money will be provided by the Oireachtas. <Col N="2470" /> This Bill contains no suggestion as to who will provide the money or what amount will be given.  We have nothing but the Minister's statement when introducing it.  He said he would give the full amount for the actual execution of the works, but there is no provision there for the future.  This Minister may not be there next year and his successor may ask the local authority to provide 40 or 50 per cent. locally.  Local authorities should be assured of full protection against claims for damage and should be assured about future maintenance, if they are to use this Bill fully.  It is incorrect for the Parliamentary Secretary to suggest that the members of local authorities, as we know them, realise that they will have to pay for the maintenance, the officials and the damage.  The members know no such thing and will not know it, probably, until after this discussion here to-day.</P>
    <P>This Bill was held up as one under which the Government would provide everything and there would be no charge on local authorities.  The members of the council to which I belong&mdash; and the same applies to other Deputies I know of on this side of the House&mdash;were never consulted, this Bill was not discussed with them and they do not know its implications regarding these payments.  I would impress particularly on Deputies who are members of local authorities that to get the best out of this Bill the Minister should accept these amendments.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Moran's latter prophecy comes true and local authorities fail to avail of this Bill to its fullest extent unless compensation claims are withdrawn, he should withdraw the amendment.  It is particularly clear that no one would be more disappointed than Deputy Moran if any full employment is given.  Deputies Aiken and Moran indicated very clearly their minds on the matter&mdash;this was going to be the cure-all for all unemployment&mdash;and their determination is that there will be no such cure-all and that this scheme will not see the light of day.</P>

      <P>They say this Bill should never have been introduced, that other Bills were the proper ones. It is perfectly clear that they have no intention of helping the Bill, but desire by opposition to kill it before it sees the light of day.  When Deputy Moran talks of protecting the interests of local authorities from compensation claims, he admits the 100 per cent. grant to be given and asks the House that, in an enabling Bill of this kind&mdash; local authorities are not compelled and do this of their own iniative and there is a 100 per cent. grant&mdash;the local council still must be asked to pay no compensation for any damage ensuing from entering on any works or land. No such provision was introduced before. The county council which we were told before was irresponsible, is, for any further irresponsibility in doing unnecessary damage, to be exempt from liability to pay compensation.</P>
      <P>Deputies moving the amendments do not seem to believe a word they are saying.  They are not sincere.  The steps being taken under this measure have been conveyed generally throughout the country by publication.  It was made abundantly clear that compensation would have to be paid by the local authorities.  They submitted their schemes in the light of that information. I do not know where Deputy Moran got his statement.  Explanations of the Bill have been published in the Press and local authorities could make any inquiries about it.  They submitted works up to £2,000,000 in the full knowledge that they would be asked to bear any compensation.  There is too much stress being laid on compensation. The Opposition seems to indicate that the Bill is one to do damage rather than to help the farmers, that the destruction will outweigh any benefit that may accrue.</P>

      <P>I am not in a position to give any guarantee to Deputy Smith. I am not an engineer who is conversant with all these works, but I suggest there is nothing in the Bill which is not capable of being dealt with competently by the local authorities with their advisory experts in regard to carrying out these works with the minimum damage and compensation.  In regard to such damage as is essential and incidental, ample provision for compensation is <Col N="2473" /> being made, and we suggest that the reasonable people to pay this compensation are the local authorities, having regard to the munificence of the grant being given for the relief of unemployment, the improvement of the conditions of farmers, and the relief of flooding by dealing with roads which are perennially flooded, so that children cannot get to school, as I know is the position in places within my own knowledge. The local authority is not entitled to go in to repair the eye of a bridge and prevent that flooding.  These are the things which this Bill attempts to deal with it and it is utterly unreasonable on the part of the Opposition to say that the local authority should bear no responsibility whatever, that they should do the work at their own discretion, get a 100 per cent. grant and have no responsibility, and that the State should pay whatever compensation has to be paid.</P>

      <P>If I had an open mind about these amendments when coming in here, it certainly would be open no longer, because the arguments advanced by the Opposition members who spoke so far, by their insincerity and weakness, have convinced me of one thing, that these amendments were put down purely from the point of view of obstructing the passage of what the Opposition know is going to be a highly popular measure.  That is the reason for these cunctatorial tactics, if I may so describe them.  I should like to ask Deputy Moran, in the light of the speech he made, if it is his opinion and the opinion of Deputies opposite that we have not got in this country any competent engineers, because that is really the effect of the arguments put forward.  The answer to the objections made that local authorities will not engage in these works is what has already been stated by the Parliamentary Secretary, that £2,000,000 worth of schemes have already been submitted. I think the Opposition are engaging in purely delaying tactics.</P>

I asked, in the course of the Minister's statement, for an assurance as to whether or not, in submitting £2,000,000 worth of works in a couple of weeks&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I asked for an assurance that, in submitting £2,000,000 worth of works from different parts of the country, the engineers who submitted these proposals sent with them to their county councils or to the Local Government Department reasonable assurances that every engineering precaution had been taken&mdash;you cannot have everything perfect and some damage may arise&mdash;and that every step which engineers could reasonably take had been taken to ensure that they were not walking local bodies into a responsibility for the payment of damages which might far exceed the value of the work undertaken.  I am satisfied, from my contacts with county surveyors who acted on the request which was sent out by the Department of Local Government for the submission of schemes, that, if we were in a position to bring these gentlemen before us and to ask them a few questions as to what they thought of some of the schemes submitted, on the basis of the amount of damage that would arise if the work proposed were carried out, they would, in the case of almost 90 per cent. of the submissions made through local authorities to the Department, refuse to take responsibility for them.</P>

I am perfectly satisfied from what I know of the proposals which must have gone in that they have been sent in, not because of any irresponsibility on the part of these gentlemen and not <Col N="2475" /> because of any irresponsibility on the part of the local bodies, but because they knew that these schemes were being &ldquo;vetted&rdquo; by the Department. As a matter of fact, the Parliamentary Secretary has admitted here, as proof of my contention and their belief, that a letter went out yesterday to local bodies asking them to re-sort the schemes, which conveys definitely and clearly to the local bodies that they have not got the final say in the schemes to be selected, and that therefore they have a fairly loose and free hand to submit any scheme, in the knowledge that it is Local Government which will decide ultimately the amount of money to be provided for these works and therefore that the money must fit into a certain type of proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot speak for what is in the minds of members, even of my own Party.  I can to a certain extent, but I cannot speak with the same confidence as that with which I can speak in regard to what is in my own mind, and, to the extent to which I am supporting these amendments, to the extent to which I am advocating some safeguard for a local authority in regard to the payment of compensation, it is because I know that, in sending forward the schemes which have been submitted, it could not be expected that engineers would have been able to &ldquo;vet&rdquo; in a proper way £2,000,000 worth of works in the course of a couple of months, when work which is now being carried out under the other drainage code has taken years.  Although £1,000,000 are invested in that work, it has taken years to satisfy these engineering people as to what will result, what benefits will accrue and what damage may follow from the execution of the works.  Yet we are told here that under a Bill which has not yet become an Act, county engineers have been able, in the course of a few weeks, to fire up £2,000,000 worth of schemes and we are asked to regard that as an indication that the local bodies are prepared to go ahead with this work and that the works have been &ldquo;vetted&rdquo; in such a way as to enable county councils, county managers or county <Col N="2476" /> engineers in the knowledge that they would have to be responsible for the compensation, to know what these schemes involve.  To ask us to accept that as a serious proposition is carrying things a little too far.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaking for myself, and I believe I can speak for other members of the Party, I want to say that in asking the Parliamentary Secretary to accept this amendment, or some amendment that would cover the point, we are doing so because we know that schemes that have already been submitted are not in the main schemes that could be carried out without exposing the local authority to the payment of unreasonable compensation later.  We feel that the State and the Government is trying to shirk its responsibility, trying to transfer its responsibility, trying to put itself in the position that it can in future say: &ldquo;We will give you full cost State grant although we know <Col N="2477" /> that, by making the local body responsible for payment of compensation, we are giving you something that we know in our hearts you cannot use.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I repudiate the suggestion by Deputy Smith that the county engineers in this country are not competent men.  There is not the slightest doubt but that a substantial amount of money will be paid on works as envisaged under this Bill and as prepared by the county engineers.  I do not know whether Deputy Smith knows it or not, but it was mentioned here that on the 25th February every county engineer in the whole country attended a conference at which were also present the chief engineering officers of the Department.  This Bill was discussed in full and the works which they could undertake or which they might undertake were also discussed in full.  The county engineers are aware of the type of schemes which they could well engage in without causing serious damage or without causing damage which would mean substantial amounts in compensation. At a recent conference of the county engineers they reported that there would be some claims for compensation but that the compensation would not be heavy and that the works engaged in, when completed, would be fully justified even in view of the small amount of compensation which would result.  My information from the county engineers is that approximately 80 per cent. of the work proposed to be done under the provisions of this Bill and with the aid of the 100 per cent. grant will relate to roads, that is, the protection of roads from flooding; another percentage within the remaining 20 will go for the protection of houses and there are other schemes, a very small percentage, which will be rejected.  These schemes will be sent up from the county councils after being thoroughly examined by the county engineers and they will also be examined by the engineering officers of the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to give an example of the type of schemes that one particular county proposes to engage in and this, incidentally, is a county which has submitted schemes to an amount of <Col N="2478" /> £75,000: the improvement of drains, streams, etc., which cause flooding of roads; the raising of the road surfaces at the points where they are liable to flooding; the alleviation of hardship to landowners whose lands have to take considerable quantities of road surface water by improving existing watercourses through their land or by the provision of adequate soakers or new watercourses in their lands; the provision of side sub-drains to roads where these are incut or where, for other causes, the water table is too near the surface of the road; to pipe and close in existing road side drains where these are in the nature of dykes which, by virtue of their size and proximity to the road margin, constitute a hazard to road users; to improve and enlarge road gullets and culverts which at present impede in any way the free flow of water in minor streams and drains. Also, to eliminate any road hog-backs caused by such gullets and culverts; to provide suitable impervious side channels to roads, particularly on embankments and on slopes, where the ordinary road run-off is liable to cause surface scour or sub-surface damage by seepage under the sides.  Also to provide adequate and suitable collecting points for the draw-off of such water from the side channels.</P>
    <P>That is just an example of the type of schemes which the different county councils propose to engage in and I think the Deputy ought to be assured that these county engineers know their job and have not selected schemes indiscriminately. Also, I would like to remind him that the circular which asked that such schemes be prepared was sent to the secretary of each county council and to the town clerk of the urban councils and corporations.</P>

      <P>10th March.  The county engineers, of course, were aware of this and were asked to prepare schemes on the 25th February, but this circular setting out the type of schemes that may be engaged in was brought before the members of the local authorities and the circular to which I referred previously, which was sent out yesterday, asked that first preference be given to simple schemes, not requiring <Col N="2479" /> elaborate surveys or preparation, which can be undertaken without delay, within an appropriate period of the present financial year.  As a matter of fact, members of local authorities and, for that matter, Dáil representatives, have themselves submitted schemes to the local authorities.  I was reminded that in some counties&mdash;I think Mayo happens to be one of them&mdash;the nature of the schemes to be engaged in or, at least, this particular circular was not discussed by the local authority.  That may have happened only in a few counties but, generally speaking, the terms of this circular were very well known to the members of the local authorities themselves and they were fully aware of the fact that the local authority would be liable for compensation. Again I repeat, despite that fact, they know they could submit certain schemes for this 100 per cent. grant, bearing in mind that they would be liable for compensation but knowing also that they could have a substantial amount of work done which would not result in compensation.</P>

      <P>Deputy Moran deliberately suggested that the schemes already submitted to the Department of Local Government by the various county councils were submitted under the wrong impression that not alone the full costs of carrying out the schemes but the cost of administering these schemes would be included in the 100 per cent. grant.  I am not a member of a local authority but I have some knowledge of what is going on in my area since the circular of the 10th March last was sent out to the local authorities.  I have personal knowledge, <Col N="2480" /> from conversations I have had with the county engineers concerned and with several members of the two county councils in my area&mdash;and I am not confining my conversations to the Labour members of these authorities &mdash; that when these schemes were being prepared by the county surveyors and by their assistants in the two counties they knew perfectly well that the cost of any compensation that might be involved would not be included in the 100 per cent. grant.  If Deputy Moran and his colleagues on the Mayo County Council did not understand that, well, Deputy Moran has a big responsibility for it, because he was here in this House listening to the discussion on the Second Reading of this Bill.</P>

      <P>I would not have taken part in this discussion were it not for the speech made by Deputy Moran.  If he did not listen to the speeches in this House on the Second Reading of the Bill&mdash;and I listened to most of them &mdash; and, in particular, if he did not hear the speech which was made by his colleague, Deputy Corry, I would advise him to study the Offical Report carefully. Deputy Corry welcomed this. Bill with enthusiasm and said that immediately he read it he proceeded to his own constituency in Cork and got the county surveyor on the job.  He indicated that before the proposals were completed, in so far as his constituency was concerned, the cost of the schemes involved would be somewhere in the vicinity of £250,000.  When Deputy Corry went to Cork&mdash;before the Second Reading of this Bill was passed&mdash;he knew perfectly well that the cost of compensation would not be included in the 100 per cent. grant.  The circular that was sent out on the 10th March, <Col N="2481" /> nearly three months ago, made quite clear to the county managers and to the members of the county councils concerned the types of schemes that would be provided for under the terms of this Bill.  I feel very proud to be able to say that, so far as my constituency is concerned&mdash;and my colleague, Deputy T.F. O'Higgins, will confirm my statement&mdash;Fine Gael, Labour and Independent members, and so forth, drafted the best schemes that could be drafted and sent them along to the Department of Local Government, where they are now awaiting sanction.  I warn Deputy Moran and his colleagues that his attitude of obstruction is holding up the day when these schemes can be put into operation.</P>

Withdraw your amendments. Take responsibility and thereby withdraw your obstructionist attitude.

      <P>It is unworthy of Deputy Davin.  There are three amendments here that propose, in effect, that the local authority shall have no responsibility for compensation that may arise out of damage that may occur as a result of the passing and putting into operation of this Bill.  If the county councils are only to be allowed or asked to carry out the schemes just mentioned a while ago by the Parliamentary Secretary, no Bill at all was needed.  He mentioned the type of roadwork &mdash; nothing but roadwork, completely on roads&mdash;and it is work for which the county councils already have full authority to carry out.  They are already fully covered by law in every possible respect.  No Bill whatsoever was needed and no compensation was payable either if they were going to be kept to the roads.  Further, it is significant that the schemes which the local authorities have prepared amount to a sum of £2,000,000.  It is a very significant amount.  A figure of £2,225,000 was mentioned very often in this House early this year.  It represented the amount by which the road grants this year were reduced.  I hope, for the sake of the lot of us and for the sake of a lot of people outside this House, that it will be possible to spend that £2,000,000 in the present financial year.</P>

I think I am entitled to refer to the approximate cost for engineering and clerical services as distinct from labour on the particular works.  I suggest that it will be approximately 30 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that in connection with roads the cost is roughly 70 per cent. for labour and 30 per cent. for other costs.  I see no reason why the Government should resist these reasoned amendments which will enable more work to be done.  There are several ways of damaging schemes that might otherwise do a lot of good. Much more work will be done under the Bill if such a provision as is mentioned in these amendments is inserted.  The engineers and the manager of local authorities will be very careful to safeguard the council and the ratepayers. They will be most cautions in advising their councils to undertake any scheme.  That is the danger I see in the Bill.  The greatest danger under the Bill, from the point of view of getting work done, is that the advisers of local authorities may be too cautious and too careful.  They will act as prudent men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>You will not put me off that way.  There is no responsibility put on any one for any action they may take.  If the advisers of local authorities see a danger to their local authorities or the ratepayers in giving certain advice, I am sure they will be very slow to give it.  It is quite possible that many otherwise sound schemes may be left out because of the over-caution that may arise on the part of advisers to local authorities under the Bill.  The safeguard suggested here will improve the Bill and enable it to work much more smoothly in any local authority area.  Personally, I am not afraid that a big amount of compensation will fall to be paid in the area I am acquainted with because of the <Col N="2486" /> coming into operation of the Bill.  It is quite possible that a big lot of compensation may not have to be paid for all the works that are being recommended, but it might happen that a very considerable amount of unforeseen compensation may have to be paid on one scheme.</P>

No member of any local authority was ever informed by circular from the Minister or his Department that the council would be liable for compensation for damage done under the Bill.  I challenge anyone to show that any circular was sent down to local authorities to the effect that they would be liable for compensation under the Bill or even for the cost of the engineering and clerical assistance necessary to carry out the work.  I do not know whether the fact was conveyed to their officers.  I know that the officers of the local authority of which I am a member did not convey it to the local authority.</P>

If, as they claim, little or no compensation will fall to be paid, there is no reason why they should not propose putting in some safeguard that will satisfy the minds of local authorities and that will leave them more inclined to undertake certain types of schemes.  It is all according whether this Bill, when it comes into operation, will do the work it is supposed to do, enable the local authorities to spend the money provided for them by the State.  It is all-important that the works needing to be carried out should be carried out.  There is no need for this Bill to carry out the works indicated by the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>

      <P>I listened here to Deputy Corry who spoke on the Second Reading of this Bill.  I listened to other Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party who spoke on the Second Reading of this Bill when it was clearly explained by the then Minister that this compensation clause would be in the Bill and, in fact, it was in the Bill &mdash; Section 5.  That Bill was welcomed by all those Deputies containing as it did that particular section to which these amendments have now been put down.  We saw that after certain attacks had been made on the Bill Fianna Fáil Deputies had gone to the country and found out that their action was not approved.  We then saw the change of front there was.  However, these amendments in the name of Deputy MacEntee who is not here, and in the name of Deputy Moran were put down deliberately for no other <Col N="2489" /> purpose than to obstruct the passage of the Bill through this House.  That is the purpose of the speech that was delivered on this Bill by Deputy Moran this evening.  A more disgraceful speech I never heard.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Delivered by Deputy Moran on this amendment.  I say, a more disgraceful speech I never heard from anybody than I heard from Deputy Moran.  We had two points of view expressed.  Deputy Smith expressed one of them when he said that engineers and local authorities are so irresponsible that the bill for compensation is going to run into an enormous sum.  Then Deputy Allen said, and I think he is very near the truth, that the amount of damage that will be done by carrying out the works envisaged in this Bill will be almost negligible.  Now I want to know which side is being put forward here.  Is it the point of view that, because the irresponsible engineers and irresponsible county councillors are going to do an enormous amount of damage, this House is going to provide the compensation involved; or are we to take the other that there is going to be so little damage that, having provided 100 per cent. grant for carrying out the work, we should go the whole hog and provide the very small amount that is needed in compensation?</P>
      <P>I think Deputy Davin was perfectly right in his approach to the measure. This Bill is needed, containing as it does the section dealing with compensation. The amendments that are now under discussion are not genuinely put forward at all.  They are put forward, as I have said, for no other purpose than to obstruct the passage of the Bill. I would ask Deputy Moran, Deputy Aiken and Deputy Smith who are leading the Opposition now, to withdraw those amendments and let the Bill pass through the House so that the people who are unemployed or who will be unemployed very soon will get a chance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilbride</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of a local authority, I want to say that I believe that if the Bill is passed as it stands very little useful work will be done under it.  As Deputy Allen has pointed out, the works outlined by the Parliamentary Secretary could be done without the Bill.  When speaking on the Second Reading of the Bill I asked for certain information.  I gave the example of a minor river being drained into a major river, and asked the Minister if work such as that was going to be done under the Bill and, if it was, who was going to pay the consequential damages.  I got no reply to my question, and so I do not know if work of that kind can be done under the Bill. I did say that when that scheme was sent to the Board of Works they would not pass it without a recommendation from a county surveyor.  He would not give the recommendation until he was satisfied as to who was going to pay for the damages that would occur on the main river.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That position still obtains.  That is a class of work the people are anxious to see done under this so-called Drainage Bill.  That position is not being remedied under this Bill.  I maintain that there is too much of a burden being thrown on the local authorities.  In the case of almost every Bill passed here, extra burdens have been thrown on the local authorities, so that the rates have gone up to such an extent that the local <Col N="2491" /> authorities are beginning to wonder where all these extra demands are going to stop.  There is also the question of minor rivers draining into other counties.  In Sligo we have the position that there is a minor river draining into the River Moy, which is in the County Mayo.  Suppose that work is undertaken under this Bill, who is going to pay the consequential damages that will arise in the case of the River Moy?  What I see is going to happen under this Bill is this: that if, in the case of any of these works the county surveyor is not prepared to make a recommendation to undertake the work, some man who is in favour of the Government or the Minister can come up here and get an order from the Minister to proceed with the work.  If the Bill is passed without these amendments, the result will be that the local authorities will be saddled with additional burdens.  They will be obliged to undertake works that they are not prepared to undertake. No local authority will be prepared to embark on any scheme that would be worth twopence without these amendments.</P>

      <P>These amendments could not be accepted by any Government with any sense of responsibility at all.  I am perfectly sure that if Deputy Aiken, Deputy Moran and Deputy Smith were on this side and were in charge of this Bill they would not accept one of these amendments. The effect of their acceptance, particularly in cases where a majority on a local body was opposed to the Government in power for the time being, would be to put into the hands of such a local authority a dangerous and a fatal weapon.</P>

For that reason I am altogether opposed to these amendments.</P>

Deputy Moran made a very useful contribution when he asked the Parliamentary Secretary if he did not consider that it was equally important to save land from being flooded by the sea.</P>
