      <P>I am not aware that the carrying out of repairs to Cooninna Harbour is being impeded as suggested in this question.  I should like to explain that the functions of my Department in connection with the filling of vacancies are confined to the submission of suitable persons registered at its local offices for vacancies <Col N="718" /> notified to those offices.  Vacancies for six men for work at Cooninna Harbour were notified to the local office at Cahirciveen in the first week of this month.  These vacancies were filled immediately from the register of that office, and I am informed that no further workers are required at present.</P>

      <P>I have received a report from the Commissioners of Public Works on the sanitary conditions at this school.  While it would be feasible to provide water-flushed sanitation at the school, I am advised that the cost would be high, and that the expenditure involved would not be warranted, having regard to the fact that the schoolhouse is over 100 years old and that it falls far short of present-day requirements.  It is considered that the proper course to take would be to erect a new school on a new site within the course of the next few years and the Department is pursuing the matter with the manager.</P>
      <P>The Department is also in communication with the manager with a view to having the existing latrines maintained in as satisfactory a condition as possible pending the provision of a new school.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department has sanctioned a grant towards the cost of the new <Col N="719" /> Meelin National School and the arrangements for the erection of the building are in the hands of the Commissioners of Public Works.  I understand from the commissioners that the working drawings and specification are almost completed and that they expect to be in a position to invite tenders at an early date.</P>
    <P>The necessary preliminary steps in the case of the proposed new Rockchapel National School have been completed and a grant towards the cost of erecting the new school has been sanctioned by the Department.  It will now be necessary for the Commissioners of Public Works to prepare working drawings and specification, and there will be no avoidable delay in having the new school erected.</P>
    <P>The necessary preliminary steps towards the erection of a new school to replace Clashbee National School are nearing completion, but certain arrangements have still to be made as regards the local contribution and the production of evidence of title to the site for the new school before a grant can be sanctioned from State funds. Every effort is being made, and will continue to be made, with a view to securing that the new school will be provided as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>As I pointed out in the course of my reply to a question asked by the Deputy on 7th April last, an essential feature of the procedure for the preliminary investigation by the District Court of indictable charges is that the deposition, when recorded, must be read over in the presence of the accused and the deponent and then signed by the latter.  This requirement rules out as impracticable the use of various kinds of mechanical devices which have been suggested from time to time.  It likewise rules out the use of shorthand which would involve at least as much delay for all concerned and probably more inconvenience, as witnesses, for example, would either have to wait in court or return later on, when the transcript of their evidence had become available.  After the fullest consideration. I am satisfied that, within the frame work of the existing system which I am advised on the highest judicial and legal authority should not be departed from, there is no practicable alternative that would be an improvement on the method of recording depositions in longhand.</P>

    <P>With the death of Dr. Douglas Hyde there has passed from the Irish scene one whose name will occupy a permanent and unique place in the records of Irish history.  Dr. Hyde's life was a very long, very full and very varied one.  No Irishman of our time, or indeed of any time, played a greater part in shaping the history of his own age and few men have ever carried so many distinctions with so much modesty.</P>
    <P>My first personal acquaintance with the late Dr. Douglas Hyde was made in the lecture rooms of University College, Dublin, where he had dedicated himself to the task of reminding his students that a country that forgets its past deserves no future.</P>
    <P>From his youth he had embarked on a course which, contrary to his origins or his upbringing, led him into the struggle to save for posterity that distinctive Irish culture of which the native language of Ireland was the repository. His resources in this struggle were few, but his will was strong and his capacity for inspiring support and enthusiasm immeasurable.</P>
    <P>In 1892, addressing the Irish National Literary Society, Douglas Hyde declared <Col N="738" /> that in recent times the Irish people were ceasing to be Irish without becoming English.  That was the position in which he found Ireland immediately after the death of Parnell.  The following year, with the establishment of the Gaelic League, what appeared to have been a lost cause was becoming a living movement.  From the moment he undertook that work it became his whole life work.</P>
    <P>The founding of the Gaelic League was largely responsible for influencing the course of subsequent Irish history. It aroused the dormant spirit of the people and stimulated their intellectual, social, political and artistic activities.  The league brought together the best minds of the younger generation and created the outlet for which they had long been seeking.  A new generation came to realise the value of their own language and culture in reawakening a people's spirit to a realisation of an ancient and separate nationhood.</P>
    <P>In paying tribute to Dr. Douglas Hyde it is not enough merely to recount his great services to the Irish language and its literature.  It would be to fail in our appreciation of the full extent of his services to Ireland if one neglected the part he played in creating in his own time a distinctive Irish culture in the English language as well as in the Irish language.  Even if Dr. Hyde had never established the Gaelic League he would still occupy a remarkable place in the history of Ireland's civilisation for the part he played in opening unknown vistas of their own land, their own people and their own civilisation to John Millington Synge, to William Butler Yeats, to Lady Gregory&mdash;to all these great Irishmen and women who, with Douglas Hyde, created the Abbey Theatre.</P>
    <P>In 1938 the nation expressed its gratitude to Dr. Hyde and its appreciation of his life work when he was unanimously elected first President of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I ask you, a Chinn Chomhairle, to convey to his relatives the sympathy of Dáil Éireann.</P>

      <P>Bhí sé d'ádh ormsa aithne a bheith agam ar an gCraoibhín le blianta fada agus, as m'eolas féin, tuigim fírinne an méid adúirt an Taoiseach.  Chuireas aithne air ar dtús, i gConradh na Gaeilge.  Na daoine a bhí sa ghluaiseacht sin roimh 1916 tá fhios acu go maith gurbh é bun agus barr an Chonartha é, ní hamháin gurbh é bunaitheoir an Chonartha é ach ba é an sprid a choinnigh beo é.  Bhí buaidh aige chun daoine a mhealladh isteach sa Chonradh. Spreag sé chun oibre iad agus mhúin sé dhóibh cén chaoi an teanga d'fhoghlaim i gceart.  Gídh gur scoláire é, thuig sé gurbh é an rud is mó a bhí ag teastáil uainn an uair sin agus anois an teanga a chleachtadh mar ghnáthurlabhra. Thuig sé gurbh í an tsimpliocht an ní is mó a bhí ag teastáil uainn.  Bhí sé lách simplí ann féin agus thug sé misneach do na daoine a tháinig isteach sa Chonradh an uair sin.</P>
      <P>San Ollscoil, freisin, lean sé den nós céanna mar thuig sé nach é an scoláireacht is mó a bhí ag teastáil ach an teanga a chleachtadh mar theanga labhartha.</P>
      <P>Bhí áthas ar chroí gach duine againn nuair a toghadh é d'aon ghuth mar Uachtarán i 1938 agus bhí brón orainn uilig nuair nár fhéad sé fanacht san oifig sin, nach raibh an tsláinte sáthach maith aige le haghaidh cúraimí na hoifige.</P>
      <P>Tá cumha orainn go léir go bhfuil sé ar lár ach, fhaid is mhairfidh an náisiún beo beidh cuimhne ar an saothar a rinne sé.  Bhí sé ar dhuine den dream sin ar féidir a rá ina dtaobh go rabhadar &ldquo;níos Gaeilí ná na Gaeil féin&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Déanaimid comhbhrón le na iníon agus leis an mnaoi uasal, a dheirfiúr a chuidigh leis nuair a bhí sé in Áras an Uachtaráin agus a thug aire agus cúram dó ó shoin.</P>

    <P>That the Dáil approves of the Statute of the Council of Europe signed at London on the 5th May, 1949, a copy of which was laid on the Table of the Dáil on the 23rd <Col N="742" /> June, 1949.&mdash;(Minister for External Affairs.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Minister for External Affairs (Mr. MacBride) Seán MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. MacBride)</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I was dealing with the functions of the Council of Europe in relation to economic matters. I pointed out that, at this stage, it was not quite clear whether these functions would be taken over by the Council of Europe or would remain vested, as they are at present, in the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation.  It is a matter which has been touched upon only very slightly in the discussions which have taken place in connection with the Council of Europe. One of the difficulties, of course, of the present era is the number and multiplicity of international organisations. At first sight, one might feel that there would be a good deal to be said for transferring the functions of the O.E.E.C. to the new Council of Europe. However, I think that that is a rather superficial view.  I feel that the economic problems that confront Europe, and Western Europe in particular, are of such a nature that they cannot be dealt with adequately on a purely regional basis and that therefore the O.E.E.C. might be a more potent organisation for dealing with such problems. In that way, the Council of Europe would merely deal with economic problems that are incidental to the over-all problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main economic problem that faces Western Europe and, indeed, the world at large, is the lack of economic integration and planning on a worldwide scale.  I feel that there is not very much value in Western Europe planning by itself for increased production unless the result of that increased production can be distributed and can find outlets in other portions of the world.  One of the difficulties of the present situation is that industrial production and, to a certain extent, agricultural production as well, has increased very rapidly in the western hemisphere.  You could say that the production of the United States has been nearly doubled in terms of prewar quantities.  Likewise, the production of Europe has increased rapidly in the last two or three years.  The problem, therefore, is to find an outlet <Col N="743" /> for that production.  The only alternative to the finding of an outlet for the increased production of both the United States and Europe is what, in effect, would be the slump policy of reducing production, causing consequent unemployment and depression.</P>
    <P>At the moment, the United States is entering on a very serious period of economic readjustment.  I feel that the economic problem of the United States is one which cannot be dealt with on a purely regional basis, that it is a matter of the utmost concern to Europe as well as to the United States. For these reasons, we have suggested that there should be an over-all discussion between the countries who form part of the O.E.E.C. in Western Europe on the one hand, and the United States together with the other large producing nations of the western hemisphere, on the other.  In particular we have mentioned that these discussions should embrace Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and also such countries as India and Egypt that are undeveloped in the ordinary sense of the word.</P>
    <P>We feel that surplus products should never be considered as a problem so long as the populations of any part of the world are living in sub-normal conditions and that, therefore, instead of advocating a policy of, if you like, a tightening of belts, when surpluses are being produced, the function of the producing countries is to plan for the utilisation of surplus production so as to ensure full production and a higher standard of living not merely in the producing countries but in the undeveloped areas of the world.  I merely mention these matters to indicate that there is a good deal to be said for not limiting the economic planning of Europe to Europe itself but rather to use an organisation such as O.E.E.C. which has already contacts with the western hemisphere.  I mention these matters now so that they can be considered and discussed by the House at a later stage.</P>
    <P>Statements were made by the Leader of the Opposition and by Deputy Cowan yesterday expressing certain hopes and certain fears as to the <Col N="744" /> attitude of the Government on economic and other matters.  One thing I should like the House to realise is this: the Council of Europe, if it works as it is intended to work, will provide a forum for the representatives of the various Parliaments of Europe to discuss these problems themselves.  I should like, therefore, the House, and the different Parties in the House, to examine these problems, to consider them so as to be in a position to instruct their delegates to the Consultative Assembly on the various major world issues that are likely to be discussed there.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera asked whether the Government had yet considered the method of representation which was to be adopted for Ireland's representatives. The matter has been discussed and considered very carefully and fully by the Government in the last few weeks.  The position is this: Ireland is entitled to send four delegates and four substitute delegates. The substitutes, as I visualise the position,' will not merely act in the absence of the delegates themselves, but will probably deputise for the delegates on various commissions and committees that will inevitably be set up. The Government proposes to divide the representation coming from the Oireachtas in the following proportions: three from the Opposition and five from the Government side of the House.  In relation to delegates and substitutes, the Government proposes that the division should be: two delegates from the Government side and three substitutes; two delegates and one substitute from the Opposition side.</P>
    <P>The method of selection was also considered and it was decided that the selection would be left to the individual Parties, at least in practice. Theoretically, the position is that the Government appoints the delegates. Therefore, what I propose to do in relation to the two delegates and the one substitute to be nominated by the Opposition is to ask the Leader of the Opposition to be good enough to let me have the names of the two delegates and the substitute that he proposes <Col N="745" /> so that the Government may then appoint them.  To a certain extent, the same procedure will operate in relation to the Parties that compose the Government.  It is very hard to lay down a hard-and-fast rule as to the method of selection beyond general acceptance of the principle that the representation should be proportionate between the Government side and the Opposition side and should seek, as far as possible, to enable each of the Parties in the House to be duly represented at the Assembly.  It would then be a matter for each of the Parties to decide whether the delegates they select should be members of the Dáil or members of the Seanad.</P>
    <P>I hope that it will be possible to arrange for the selection and appointment of Ireland's delegation as soon as possible.  I feel there would be a certain advantage if they could be appointed rapidly so that they could meet and discuss the various items that are likely to be on the agenda and make themselves familiar with the statute and the rules which are at present being drafted.  It would be of assistance to me to have the benefit of the advice of the delegation as soon as they are appointed.</P>
    <P>The Government has also decided to pay the expenses of the delegation which goes to Strasbourg.  I expect it will be necessary to provide at least one officer from my Department to be available to them during the course of the Assembly meeting.  On all these matters it would be of great help to me if the delegates were appointed in the near future so that I can ascertain their wishes and their requirements and make all the necessary arrangements.</P>
    <P>I hope that the delegation going from Ireland will be able to act, as far as possible, on all major issues as a national unit; that it will be able to discuss, aside from Party issues, major questions that are likely to come up in the course of the Assembly meeting, and, if any questions arise upon which a difference of opinion prevails, that at least these questions will have been discussed by our delegation in their committee room in advance among themselves.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="746" /> Deputy de Valera also asked me the basis upon which the delegates had been selected and the basis upon which the contribution of the various countries was being assessed.  I am glad to say that the number of delegates allocated was not based on population or national income figures. It was intended, and I am glad to say that effect was given to that intention, to give adequate representation to small countries irrespective of their size, population or wealth.  To that extent, I think that the small nations of Europe have benefited.  As to the contributions payable by the different member nations, these contributions are to be based upon the populations, not upon the number of delegates.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera also asked me some questions in relation to the secretariat.  The secretariat is appointed by the Consultative Assembly on the advice of the Council of Ministers.  Article 36, paragraph (b), deals with that and provides that the secretary-general and the deputy secretary-general shall be appointed by the Consultative Assembly on the recommendation of the Committee of Ministers.  Apparently, the procedure will be that the Committee of Ministers will make the recommendation and that the Assembly will adopt or reject that recommendation.</P>
    <P>Questions were raised as to the use of the term &ldquo;Irish Republic&rdquo; in the course of the text of the statute.  I agree that the description is not possibly as accurate as we would have liked it to be.  The draft was prepared before the Republic of Ireland Act came into operation.  Deputies will have noticed, of course, that the term is used in a general sense in the way the State is described: the French Republic, the Irish Republic, the Italian Republic, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, and so on.</P>
    <P>I also sympathise fully with the point of view put forth by Deputy Cowan in relation to the description of Great Britain as &ldquo;the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.&rdquo;  I do not know whether it may be some consolation for members of the House to know that, <Col N="747" /> in point of fact, I understand that the proper title of the King of Great Britain is still &ldquo;the King of Great Britain and Ireland.&rdquo;  No doubt, in the course of time that will be adjusted in the same way as the claim of the British Monarch, in relation to France, was adjusted.  If my recollection is right, the King of England described himself as &ldquo;the King of France&rdquo; until the year 1814.  There are still some instances of monarchs who claim in their titles to be Kings of countries that have long ceased to be under their regency or tutelage.  I noticed, while the point was being made in the House last night, that in Article 26 where we are referred to as &ldquo;the Irish Republic,&rdquo; Great Britain is referred to as &ldquo;the Kingdom of Great Britain&rdquo; without any reference to Northern Ireland.  However, these are points of detail, that, no doubt in a very short space of time, we will be able to surmount.</P>
    <P>I think these are the main matters that were raised by Deputies in the House.  I think I indicated clearly in opening this debate that I cannot claim that this statute is anything more than a compromise between different viewpoints.  I cannot make any grandiose claims as to its likely achievements.  I can even say that it is extremely badly drafted, but nevertheless, it is the beginning of an attempt to secure co-operation on planes other than military planes in Europe, and to that extent it is good and to that extent we are in favour of it.  With the Leader of the Opposition, I regret that, in some respects, it does not go further.  I am glad, however, that, for the first time I think, in one of these international agreements, recognition is given to the importance of establishing and strengthening the moral and ethical basis upon which European civilisation is based.  In the final analysis, however, our point of view of European civilisation as we know it, is based on Christianity.  We would have liked to have a recognition of that in the statute, but, for one reason or another, that was not possible. At least, we did secure a recognition of the importance of rebuilding <Col N="748" /> moral and ethical values in Europe. That, in itself, I think is good.</P>
    <P>The value of the Assembly will largely depend on what the members of the Assembly will make of the Assembly.  It will largely depend on the activities of the members of the Assembly, including the members of the Assembly that, I hope, will come from Ireland.  To a large extent the statute which is presented to the House is designed to shackle the members of the Assembly but I feel that, with the passage of time, the members of the Assembly themselves will take things into their own hands. I feel that it is even quite likely and quite possible that the members of the Assembly will combine together against the Foreign Ministers' Committee, and that they will feel that the Committee of Foreign Ministers is an instrument designed for the purpose of preventing them from reaching decisions themselves. They may therefore combine to free themselves from the constraint placed upon them by the Committee of Foreign Ministers.  That may be bad for the Foreign Ministers concerned, but it may be quite good for the development of the idea of European federation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Minister for External Affairs (Mr. MacBride) Seán MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. MacBride)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This Bill is intended to provide for the creation of an Irish news agency.  I think it <Col N="749" /> might be well if, at the outset, I gave some indication to the House of the various considerations which prompted the Government to take this step.</P>
      <P>During the last century, until nearly the end of the last century, international affairs were the preserves of Governments and of diplomacy.  The ordinary public of different countries had little knowledge of international affairs and could exercise little influence over their development.  The change that has taken place since the end of the 19th century was largely due to the advent of the printing presses, the coming into existence of newspapers, first of all periodicals and then daily newspapers with local circulation, and, finally, national newspapers as we know them now.  At first newspapers used to gather their information from special correspondents or qualified writers with specialised knowledge of international affairs, who used to write feature articles on international affairs once a week or once a month.</P>
      <P>News agencies came into active operation in the early part of this century. The oldest news agency is what is now known as Reuters.  It was founded by Julius Reuter, who was a clerk in a commercial firm in the City of London in the 1850's.  It was founded then purely as a one-man concern for the purpose of obtaining commercial intelligence and of distributing that commercial intelligence to various business firms in the city.  In a short space of time the value of the commercial intelligence supplied by this young man, who grew rapidly in stature and wealth, was appreciated in the business circles of London.  Around 1858 he branched out into general news, but it still remained a private concern until 1865, when it was formed into a private limited company.  It remained a private limited company until 1926.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The growth of news agencies can be related, firstly, to the growth in literacy and in the development and circulation of newspapers as a medium of information and, secondly, to the development of means of communication. As I indicated in referring to the growth of Reuters, originally a large portion of the work of news agencies was related to the dissemination <Col N="750" /> of business information, stock exchange prices, and even racing information.  Of course, the development of means of communication was a very important feature, because it increased the value of the stock exchange and racing information that became available.</P>
    <P>But, if the origin of news agencies can be traced to business, stock exchange or even racing reasons, it had a profound influence on the development of democracy.  Democracy could only function properly if the people of the country had sufficient information on current matters to enable them to exercise judgment.  In the last century, and even in the begining of this century, the man in the street had little or no opportunity of obtaining information or keeping himself <i>au fait</i> with international affairs. As a result of the development of national newspapers and of news agencies, gradually public opinion came to be more influential in relation to foreign policy.  The advent and development of the wireless also intensified the improvement of public thinking. Now, the supply of accurate and objective information concerning news and developments in other countries has come to be an essential part of the democratic system.  It is quite obvious that without the supply of projective and reliable news, public opinion would not be in a position to exercise its judgment on public affairs and on foreign policy.  And so we have reached the stage where practically every country in the world has its own news agency.  The closeness, or otherwise, of the relationship which exists between the different national news agencies and their Governments varies. Some have been very closely related to their Government or directly run by their Government; others have had a very much more remote control operated through special facilities of one kind or another.  We, here, have been the exception.  We have had no independent Irish news agency.  To a certain extent that has been due to our historical development.  To a certain extent it is only in the last 25 years or so that we have gained control of our own affairs and we have had many preoccupations, political and otherwise <Col N="751" /> since, which probably precluded us from devoting the time and attention we should have devoted to matters of that kind.</P>
    <P>As to the importance and function of national news agencies and of sources of news, I should like, with the permission of the House, to quote one or two references that may be of assistance. There is a very interesting article published in <i>The Round Table</i> in June, 1937, dealing with the importance of British news agencies abroad. If I may read to the House some extracts from it, it will illustrate more clearly than I can the importance of these news services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I cannot. There is no author's name to the article.  It quotes mainly from a number of other authors.  I am quoting from page 543 of the June, 1937, issue of <i>The Round Table:</i>&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The problem of British publicity in the Far East does not stand alone. It has its counterpart in South America, and it is repeated in some form or another in North Africa, in the Middle East and on the Continent of Europe.  The corollary of the open door in China was the open door in South America.  But transmission costs and other conditions were adverse there to anything more than a very limited British service.  Here is an extract from the speech delivered by the Prince of Wales after returning from his tour in 1931: &lsquo;I would like to say a word about the position of the British news services to foreign countries, and I will, for example, take South America, which was the last of the great Continents I visited this year. There is no actual shortage of news in South America dealing with events in Great Britain and Ireland, and this country gets a very fair share of the space in the important newspapers, but, with the exception of a limited service of news sent to Argentina by Reuters, and except for a few special messages by their own representatives to a few papers, all <Col N="752" /> news sent from England to Latin America is transmitted by non-British agencies.  What is the result of this?  The result is that by the time this news reaches the Latin American reader he sees us and our affairs through spectacles which are neither ours nor those of his own country.  I most sincerely hope that some means can be found to increase the volume of purely British news to South America and I commend this particular matter to the attention of this Association.&rsquo;  In consequence of the Prince of Wales' intervention, a sustained effort was made to remedy the deficiency to which he drew attention, and some time later in another public speech, His Royal Highness was able to say: &lsquo;I took the opportunity on my return last May to express my views to this country, and I emphasised the importance of supplying the great South American Continent with fuller and more accurate reports of what is going on here.  Reuters have now established a daily news service to South America and, as regards Argentina, I am grateful to my friend, Jorge Mitre, of <i>La Nation,</i> and to the <i>Buenos Aires Herald</i> for co-operating most heartily in this scheme.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The author of the article goes on to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;But alas in spite of heavy financial sacrifice by Reuters, persisted in for nearly three years, the experiment in the end had to be abandoned; to-day South America is very little better off in the matter of British news and world news carried through British channels than it was ten years ago.  On the other hand, thanks to the French official facilities it enjoys, the Havas Agency transmits to South America some 15,000 words a day on world intelligence, which includes British news as seen through French eyes.  The Havas telegram, quoted earlier in this article, from the <i>North China Daily News</i>, provides a fair idea of the risk to which this exposes British prestige.  It is not necessary to impute base motives to Havas.  It is enough that the agency should be an honourable exponent, <Col N="753" /> as undoubtedly it is, of French policy and a sympathetic interpreter of the French point of view.  But its very zeal and efficiency in that rôle must render Havas unsuitable as a provider and editor of British news in any foreign land.  Within the last few weeks, the secretary of the British Chamber of Commerce at Sao Paulo, in Brazil, referring in the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> to the Italian propagandists who, in the Levant and elsewhere, &lsquo;are assiduously spreading the doctrine that Britain is &ldquo;on the run&rdquo; everywhere, and that the Empire will shortly break up&rsquo;, drew attention, as many have before him, to the highly unsatisfactory British news situation in South America.  He said: &lsquo;News of Britain and things British comes, for the most part, to the South American countries via non-British Press agencies, whose news, to say the least, is often biassed.  In Brazil, for example, the only British news service is a partial one picked up from the air by one newspaper in this city.  All the other foreign news in Brazil is received from American and French agencies who, naturally, are not interested in presenting facts favourable to British prestige, but are more concerned with serving up news of a sensational nature (not infrequently detrimental to British interests).&rsquo;  For years the British Chamber of Commerce have urged the need for British news services, inaugurated, if necessary, with official backing in their early stages.</P>
    <P>Of news of a sensational nature, detrimental to British interests, a typical example was provided at the time of the Invergordon trouble. That episode was seized upon by at least one American agency distributing a big service in South America. It was presented to its clientele throughout the Continent as a flaring narrative which magnified out of all proportion what had happened and which could only leave the average reader under the impression that the British Navy was rotten with unrest and a spirit of mutiny rampant.  One need not attribute to the men responsible for this narrative any hatred of Britain or any desire to hurt us abroad.  They probably were <Col N="754" /> animated by nothing worse than an excited impulse to produce &lsquo;a colourful story&rsquo; and &lsquo;to play up the high lights.&rsquo;  But in doing so they were undoubtedly guilty of misrepresenting grossly this country and equally grossly misleading the people of South America.  None could condemn this more readily than responsible Americans.  Within the past few weeks the United States Ambassador in London, himself an important newspaper proprietor, spoke at a public luncheon of the unfortunate fact that newspapers were often propagandists of evil.  Their disposition &lsquo;to play up to what is sensational instead of sound and usual, and what is remarkable and extraordinary instead of what is the habit of the people, is one of the things that tend to mislead the American public about Great Britain and the British public about the United States.&rsquo;  The evil here rightly condemned by His Excellency was the evil inherent in the telegrams to South America about the Invergordon trouble.</P>
    <P>The American services in South America, however, are not so prejudiced to Great Britain as the French.  The not unnatural disposition of Havas day by day and week by week is to give to the people of South America, no less than to the people of the Far East and of the Continent of Europe wherever the Havas service circulates, the French aspect of international politics, and to wrest from the British the function that hitherto Reuters have in the main fulfilled as the international supplier of world news. Its growing activity in this respect has excited the misgivings even of Americans, and within the last few years both President Roosevelt and the Secretary of State have commented adversely upon the character of the French news services in South America.</P>
    <P>Much might be said about the French, German, Italian and Russian wireless services in Egypt, the Levant, Afghanistan, and elsewhere, all of them working to Great Britain's disadvantage and designed to supplant or discredit British news <Col N="755" /> and British influence.  Still more might be said about the growth and the effect of these services on the continent of Europe.  Both Havas and the D.N.B., by means of their subsidised wireless broadcasts, are supplying newspapers of all nationalities in Europe at nominal, not to say derisory, rates, services embodying not only their own national news, but also news from the rest of the world, most of which they have acquired from Reuters but which in the process of relaying loses its Reuter complexion and takes on that of the distributing agency.  The scope for mischief here can easily be seen. That it does not escape attention is clear from an article by a Norwegian journalist of standing, Mr. Henry Rsoch, who, writing in the Oslo <i>Aftenposten</i> as recently as 24th April last, remarked upon the growth of the D.N.B. and Havas services to the detriment of Reuters and struck a note of warning.  In Mr. Rsoch's opinion, the Reuter agency, which, to use his own words, has pumped more material into the international news stream than any of its rivals, now works with great and evergrowing difficulty, and month by month it is harder for news from British sources, and news of British affairs, to find their way into that news stream.</P>
    <P>That is the conclusion reached by a detached observer, one, presumably, more friendly than otherwise towards this country.  It is a conclusion compatible with the facts, and it is one that we cannot ignore with impunity.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I merely quoted this article at some length to the House to adopt from it the arguments and the conclusions that it reached; that, undoubtedly, the viewpoint of a country must become distorted if it is presented through a channel other than a national channel, if it is presented through the spectacles of another continent.  I would refer the House to some other shorter and possibly more recent references illustrating the importance of news in other spheres.  There is a book written in 1946 by Mr. Francis Williams who <Col N="756" /> was British war-time Controller of News and Censorship.  The title of the book is <i>Press, Parliament and People.</i> On page 213 it deals with the importance of news from a trade point of view.  He says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Trade was said in the days of imperialist expansion to follow the flag.  To-day it tends to follow the news.  If the newspapers of a foreign country which is an actual or potential market for manufactured goods take only, shall we say, an American news service, which quite naturally includes a high proportion of news concerning American developments or news written with an American slant, there is a strong possibility that the merchants and people of that country will become more conscious of American enterprise than that of other countries and will place orders for goods with American manufacturers.  The same is of course equally true of the long-term effect of British news services to foreign countries.</P>
    <P>And, since the possibility of severe competition in export markets is a factor very present in the minds of all Governments, the commercial value of a successful international news service is a factor that has to be taken into account.  It has undoubtedly played some part in the battle for territories fought between the great news agencies in the past, particularly in the struggle for South American territories.  It is almost certainly one of the important factors behind the big expansion of American news services which is now taking place and their drive to secure a predominant hold in the European newspaper market.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There has been, and I think there still is, quite an important struggle in South America for the South American news market.  Until the recent war the French news agency had practically a monopoly of South American news markets.  I do not know to what extent it has been able to maintain its hold on the news market of South America but the influence of the French news services in South America has been, and still is, a matter of grave concern to British foreign policy. <Col N="757" /> Here in Ireland we have no Irish news agency.  Because of transmission difficulties, because of our unimportance, if you like, in the stream of world affairs, all the news that emanates in Ireland is canalised through London.  It may be prepared here by correspondents but finally it is canalised through London offices.  In our case the need for an independent source of news about Ireland, which will not be canalised through any foreign channels, is particularly important from a number of different points of view.  First of all, unlike most other countries we have a national objective to achieve. We still have to gain full control of our own country.  We still have to assert the rights of the Irish people to determine their own form of Government and their own affairs without outside interference.  In the second place, for one reason or another we have to counteract a good deal of hostile propaganda, unfair propaganda about Ireland that is published constantly in the Press of the world.  From the third point of view, we need news channels of our own in order to encourage the development of our industrial life, of our foreign trade, of our tourist traffic, to make known our cultural developments and also to make known our viewpoints in the field of international affairs as the need arises.</P>
    <P>It is only, as I pointed out, in the last 25 years or so that we have got control of our own affairs.  In that period of time we have not been able to develop the international trade that we should normally have had, having regard to our size and importance in the economic life of Europe.  Likewise, probably because of lack of development here of one kind or another, we have not developed a tourist traffic of the magnitude which we could have developed if we had been independent economically before.  I feel to a certain extent that it should not be necessary for me to justify the need that exists for the creation of this news agency, because I feel the Leader of the Opposition himself set out last year in the course of a debate in this House many of the reasons which make it imperative.  I may refer the House to the speech made by Deputy de Valera, reported in Volume 112, No. 5, column <Col N="758" /> 883, and made on the 20th of July last year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me quote the reasons given by your own Leader and I hope you will take it to heart.  Deputy <Col N="759" /> de Valera, speaking in this House on the 20th of July last year, said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We have, in our struggles in the past, been supported by the goodwill of people of our race all over the world.  These people are good citizens of the countries in which they dwell.  Nobody can point a finger at them but they have an affection for the land from which they themselves and their forebears sprung.  Because of that, it is desirable that we should keep in touch with them.  We can do that best through a short-wave station.  It is only those who have been away from this country for any length of time who realise the importance of that contact.  Newspapers in other countries, if they carry any information at all about this country, it will be, you may be sure, information in the main that is to our detriment. It is about something sensational that has happened in this country and the unfortunate thing is that those who get only the sensational are inclined to think that the sensational is the normal, as it is the only information that they get.  They get some wrong impressions of this country just as we might, for instance, get a wrong impression of a city like Chicago from the way in which certain happenings in that city were depicted here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Apart from the accidental circumstance, due to the nature of news, that it is only sensational things as a rule that are sent abroad, there is the fact that in the past there has been deliberate propaganda against our country.  It was one of the means by which the Power that held this country in the past tried to justify its hold on it.  For that reason we are in a worse position than most people would be.  Surely, then, it is to our interest to keep in touch with our people abroad who, we can believe, will be, of all others, the most understanding and sympathetic to our cause.  We will have a good case in our fight for liberty.  We had a good case in fighting for the amount of liberty we have got and we will have an equally good case in fighting for the rest of it.  Surely that is a <Col N="760" /> reason why we should see that our contacts with our people abroad should not be cut.  These contacts in the past were largely maintained by the fact that new people were going every year from this country into these other countries.  They were able to supply our exiles abroad with up-to-date information as to feeling at home, but that channel of information is rapidly drying up.  There are not so many of our people nowadays going to these countries which were most sympathetic to us in the past and for that reason you are not going to have the same freshening of contacts as you had in the past.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that these reasons are admirable reasons in support of having our own news channels to reach the outside world, to reach our own people who are settled in America, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and throughout the world.</P>
    <P>Indeed, the idea of a news agency is not really a novel one here.  Since this matter first came up for discussion and for mention in the Press, someone very kindly sent me a letter written in 1906 by Roger Casement to the late Professor Donovan in which he himself puts forward a suggestion&mdash;in 1906&mdash; from Belfast for the creation of an Irish news exchange service.  I need not trouble the House with the letter beyond one rather amusing reference in the course of it in which Roger Casement makes an allusion to a possible person who might be useful in it.  He says: &ldquo;There is here in Belfast a very promising young man, Bulmer Hobson, who has been the prime mover in founding the &lsquo;Dungannon Club&rsquo; and getting its views on Irish affairs circulated&rdquo;, and he suggests that he would be useful in helping to establish such a news exchange.</P>
    <P>I noticed the other day that a person who writes under the name of Nichevo, whom I suspect to be one of our ablest and most experienced journalists in this city, wrote in a column that he had many years ago contemplated the starting of an Irish agency but for financial reasons he and others of the journalists then associated with him had to give up the project as they did not think it could exist without some financial support.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="761" /> I myself on a number of occasions have also examined the possibility and indeed, I think, discussed it with the Leader of the Opposition and officials of the last Government both before the war and since the war.</P>
    <P>One may well ask, then, why this was not done before.  The answer is quite simple.  It is mainly a financial reason.  We are a small country. There are no matters of international importance regularly happening here. A news agency, to be a commercial proposition, must develop an international service which is able to receive and send out news.  Our importance and the size of our population preclude us from setting up a news agency on a commercial basis on the same scale as countries like France, or Belgium or America or Switzerland, wealthier countries than we are.  No Irish News Agency could be a financial success, certainly, at least, for the first few years.  We must face the fact that it will have to receive financial support from one source or another. Properly administered, properly organised, intelligently run, it might become a paying proposition but I would not like to present this proposal to the House on the basis that it could become a paying proposition.  I would rather present it to the House candidly as a service that will require State aid for a number of years at least.</P>
    <P>In dealing with the functions of the proposed news agency, it might be well if I approached it first on the basis of what the Irish News Agency is intended not to be.  First, it is not intended to be a propaganda machine or a machine which will present news other than in an objective, truthful and accurate way.  It may be said that it will serve as a propaganda medium in so far as one of its main functions will be to place Ireland on the map and that to that extent then it will be serving a propaganda service by making Ireland known throughout the world in different spheres.</P>
    <P>Secondly, it is not proposed that the news agency should enter into the field of &ldquo;hot&rdquo; news.  To non-journalist members of the House I might elaborate that.  It is not intended that the news agency should supply reports <Col N="762" /> of accidents, crimes, racing, Dáil Debates or stock exchange reports.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, it is not intended that the news agency should be the official mouthpiece of the Government.  That function is being very efficiently and very well performed by the Government Information Bureau.</P>
    <P>Fourthly&mdash;a point I should like to make clear at this stage to avoid a great many disappointments among the journalistic professions, among many friends of my own and among members of the public&mdash;it is not going to be a huge organisation and it is not going to be in a position to employ a great many people.</P>
    <P>Now, having stated the things that the Irish News Agency is not intended to be, let me state briefly the function and the purpose of the Irish News Agency.  Its function will be to put Ireland on the map by supplying to the Press of the world accurate information concerning matters of cultural, trade and general interest calculated to promote tourism, trade and cultural relations.  That will be its steady function. When necessary, it will give Ireland's viewpoint on political matters, but only when necessary.  It is not going to be a political propaganda machine.  Its third function will be to negative, again when necessary, unfriendly, hostile or sensational propaganda about Ireland.</P>
    <P>Let me put the problem this way to the House.  There are in America some 3,000 or 4,000 newspapers, 700 of which are important newspapers.  One of the principal functions of this news agency will be to place on the news desks of these 700 newspapers news of political, cultural, trade or tourist importance that would not otherwise be supplied to the news desks of these papers.  There is no intention to enter into competition with existing news channels.  The Irish News Agency will willingly make available to existing news channels the news that is at its disposal.  Its aim will be rather to supplement existing news channels and to ensure that, at times of crisis, any newspaper editor, sub-editor or political commentator will have ready at hand a statement of Ireland's viewpoint that will have reached these <Col N="763" /> papers through Irish spectacles and not through the spectacles of Fleet Street.</P>
    <P>The Bill which is presented to the House for Second Reading is mainly an enabling Bill following the pattern of most Bills of a similar nature.  It provides for the formation of a company, for drawing up Articles of Association, for the alteration of Memorandum and Articles of Association. Section 10 provides that the Minister may, out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, lend to the agency, upon such terms and conditions as may be decided, sums for the formation of the company.  Section 11 provides for advances by the Minister for Finance to the agency.  Section 12 and 13 deal with the power of the Minister for Finance as shareholder.  Section 14 contains the usual obligation to hold shares in trust for the Minister for Finance.  Section 15 provides for the possibility of dividends becoming payable.  Section 16 contains the usual provisions in relation to the drawing up and presentation of balance sheets.</P>
    <P>Section 17 deals with the creation and appointment of an advisory board. That advisory board should be representative of newspaper editors, journalists, correspondents and broadcasting authorities.  This news agency, in addition to disseminating news about Ireland, should also be able to be of assistance to Irish newspapers and Irish newspaper men generally.  It should be able, from time to time, to provide Irish newspapers with news concerning events of Irish interest abroad.</P>
    <P>I should like to see this news agency run, as far as possible, on a co-operative basis between the newspapers, the journalists and the Government.  It is very hard to evolve a completely satisfactory machine for doing that.  It took Reuters more than 100 years, I think to reach that stage.  As I told the House, Reuters started in the 1850's and it was only in 1941 that a trust was formed between the Press Association and the newspaper proprietors in England.  I hope that at some date in the future, when we have all gained a certain amount of experience <Col N="764" /> in the workings of the news agency, it may be possible to make it an entirely co-operative medium.  Difficulties will exist in the way of doing this until such time as the news agency is able to earn sufficient revenue itself, because, until it is able to do so, it will have to depend upon financial assistance from one source or another. It is quite obvious that if such a news agency has to receive financial assistance from some source, it should receive that financial assistance from the State rather than be for sale to the highest bidder, because, if it were for sale to the highest bidder, it would probably cease to serve the function it was created to serve or it might go completely out of existence.</P>
    <P>I have given the House as much information as I could.  There are a great many quotations that I could read, but I am afraid Deputy Boland would not be able to contain himself and, perhaps, I had better refrain from reading them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>As I was saying, from the extract which the Minister read out from my speech of last year it must be clear to him as it will be clear to other members of the House, that, if there was being presented to the House a sound, practical proposition so as to put the news of this country on a proper basis abroad, he would get hearty support from this side and would certainly get hearty support from me.  The need of putting Ireland's case before the world and of having <Col N="766" /> Irish news objectively reported, is very real.  My objection to the Minister's proposal is that it is not a practical proposition.  In the quotation given by the Minister I was speaking of what was practical, and in my opinion that was the radio, a short-wave wireless that would take the news over the air so that our people who would want to listen to it could listen in.  In that way they would get a corrective for the false news that they get from the newspapers.  Now to try and get that corrective into the newspapers directly is quite a different proposition.</P>
      <P>When first I saw this Bill I thought that the intention was to go into competition with the existing news agencies on what the Minister has referred to as &ldquo;hot news.&rdquo;  If it were that I came to the conclusion that the competition would be too severe for us, and that it was not likely that the newspapers that subscribe to a news service of that sort would be likely to subscribe to our news service.  I believe they would rather depend on the sources of getting news which they have such as special reporters and correspondents here than pay definitely for a service which they would rarely use, because it is unfortunately true that it is only the very exceptional and very extraordinary things that have an interest for these newspapers.  I then realised that the Minister did not want to enter into that competition, and that the Bill was not intended for that purpose. I agree that the Minister was right in thinking that he would not be successful in it.  However, it was a line of country well worth looking into and exploring to see what the possibilities were.</P>
      <P>I may say that I myself had been thinking, when I was in charge of External Affairs, of trying whether such a proposition was possible.  I referred it to some one of the Departments, and having given it some thought myself, I did not see how we could make it a success or how we could make it a practical proposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, if we were to go out with &ldquo;hot news&rdquo;&mdash;news of the competitive type &mdash;it would mean that we would have to go out against those long established news services which are subscribed to by the various newspapers in the <Col N="767" /> different countries.  What have we left if we set that aside?  We have what the Minister has referred to as cultural news, certain trade news and so on. What does that bring us down to? It brings us down to the fact that there is some sheet to be issued at intervals, either daily or weekly, to be distributed gratis, I take it.  I do not think that, if you are going to achieve your purpose of correcting wrong news, you can restrict it to subscribers.  If you do not restrict it then no one will subscribe, obviously.  Therefore, you will be compelled to have this as a free service.  Now, it is one of the unfortunate things in the world that people have no regard for what they get for nothing, and they will believe that it is not being given to them for nothing except for propaganda purposes, and so they will treat these as propaganda sheets.</P>
    <P>The best thing, in my opinion, that the Minister could do with this proposition is to withdraw the Bill.  I say that as one who is very anxious that the truth about Ireland should be known abroad.  There is no use in all this hugger-mugger, all this hocuspocus and the forming of a company when, in reality, it is a Government agency in the long run.  It would be far more effective and far simpler to work if the Minister were to set up some particular section in the Department of External Affairs which would issue, at such intervals as were found feasible and convenient, something on the lines of the &ldquo;Swedish News&rdquo;.  I think that, from our point of view, a sheet or bulletin of that sort, giving information of the type that people would be interested in and frankly sent out by our representatives in the various countries would be a better way of meeting the situation.  I think the proposal in the Bill is completely woolly, and the moment you have a lot of wool knocking about people will think that the wool is there to be pulled over their eyes.</P>
    <P>I think that the Minister is approaching this question from a completely wrong angle, and I am speaking as one who is anxious to have something done. If the Minister were bringing forward a Supplementary Estimate asking that <Col N="768" /> provision be made in his Department for the preparation, publication and distribution of a sheet or bulletin of the sort I have been speaking about, I would be inclined to support it, provided I was satisfied with the details.  I am sorry that I have to oppose this on the grounds that, in my opinion, it has not been thoroughly thought out, that it is completely impracticable, and that it does not deserve, and should not be given, the name of a news agency with a company behind it.</P>
    <P>I, therefore, will have to oppose this proposition.  I am opposing it objectively and on its merits, although I would like to see some feasible scheme put forward by which we would be able to get news about Ireland of the restricted type, such as the Minister has referred to, over to the people who require it.  If you distribute this news to 700 newspapers, the expense is going to be very great.  I do not see any hope of getting any income from it.  The expense of putting that news on the desks of 700 newspapers alone every day will be very great.  Mind you, if you want to be really successful you will probably not wait for the post at all.  You might have to use instruments by which you might be able to send the news at once, the teletype, or some mechanism of that sort; but even that had better be worked from the offices of our representatives abroad, than to have it done in this particular way. My fear is that you will get but trifling value for the expenditure in either case.</P>
    <P>I see no point in having a company; I see no chance of an income; I see the expense, the amount of it I do not know.  I do not know what sum will really be involved, but I believe that if it is to be successul the amount will have to be very great indeed.  If you were, instead, to try to concentrate on having a good news service through a short-wave wireless, that would be far more effective.  Accordingly, I am opposing the Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read this Bill and it is not altogether the innocuous measure that the Minister has described it to be, because Section 7 states that the principal function of <Col N="769" /> the agency shall be to ensure the collection, dissemination, distribution and publication of news and intelligence inside and outside the State.  That is something different from what the Minister said in his opening speech. But, accepting what the Minister said &mdash;and the Minister spent over an hour of Parliamentary time justifying this Bill, reading extracts from an unsigned article published 18 years ago and published for the purpose of creating or improving British prestige in South America and other countries&mdash;we cannot, and I think the Minister admitted it, enter into competition with the big news agencies.  I think that is perfectly clear.  We are unable financially to do it.</P>
      <P>One of my big objections is this: that I was sent into this House, and the Minister was sent into this House, for the purpose of doing something realistic in regard to employment, something realistic in regard to housing, something realistic in regard to hunger&mdash;and there is quite a lot of hunger in the constituency I represent. We were sent in to do those things and, I think, if we had made some serious effort to deal with these problems, then we could waste Parliamentary time on a toy Bill such as this.  I asked the Minister for Local Government to-day how many houses had been built in Dublin City.</P>

      <P>My first, objection to the Bill is that it is unnecessary, that it has been introduced at the wrong time, that there is time devoted to it that could be devoted to more important matters that affect our citizens.  The Minister has said that one of the reasons why this Bill is necessary is because we have a national objective to achieve, that we still have to gain control of our own territory.  I see in this Bill one great danger, regarding the problem of Partition that faces us.  There is very serious consideration being given to that problem all through the country. Enthusiasm has been worked up in big demonstrations all over the country, enthusiasm with reference to the ending of Partition; but I see in the introduction of this Bill a douche of cold water thrown on that enthusiasm, and our people who are anxiously looking forward for leadership in the matter of Partition are getting this Bill that proposes to tell the world about the evils of Partition.</P>
      <P>I think it is unfair to create that spirit of enthusiasm and produce this Bill as the means by which that enthusiasm can be ulitised for the purpose of ending Partition.  The Minister for External Affairs, at one of these big demonstrations that I mentioned, talked about the necessity for national discipline.  Undoubtedly, we would be a very disciplined people if we were to accept this measure as the method by which our energies could be devoted towards the ending of Partition.</P>

Newspaper men and experienced journalists working both on our city and our country newspapers know that day after day a flood of news comes pouring in from government news agencies all over the world.

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>We all got it this morning.  That is what happens and the Minister himself has some experience of journalistic work.  He knows that nine-tenths of the stuff distributed by this type of agency is never opened in the newspaper office.  I hope that Deputy Lemass will take part in this discussion and tell us of some of his practical experiences in regard to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we intend to set up a form of organisation which will send out in envelopes or wrappers daily, weekly or monthly, some document which will ultimately be dumped in waste-paper baskets in 90 per cent. of the newspaper offices, I don't think either the time or money involved in this Bill can be justified.  Our journalists here are doing a good job of work and a very fine job of work in so far as they represent foreign newspapers.  They submit to those newspapers very fair reports of what is happening here. They may be paid for that service.  Is <Col N="773" /> it suggested that this free service we intend to provide will, if the newspapers go to the trouble of opening the envelopes or wrappers, be accepted instead of the service that is now rendered by experienced foreign journalists here?</P>
    <P>I have seen some criticism of this Bill in our own newspapers.  I have seen it criticised in a newspaper that cannot be described as unfriendly to the Government.  I do not think I can be called unfriendly to the Government, but I still feel that it is necessary to criticise this Bill and I criticise it for the reasons I have given. In so far as its purpose is directed towards the dissemination of news in relation to Partition, I think it will have the effect of weakening the national resolve in that regard.  If the Minister cannot say at the moment whether it is to be a daily, weekly, monthly or quarterly production, I would like to know what consideration has been given to that aspect of the matter.  If it is only intended that this news should be distributed to foreign newspapers, why was it specified in Section 7 that its purpose would be to distribute and publish news and intelligence inside and outside the State.</P>
    <P>I am inclined to agree with Deputy de Valera that this Bill ought to be withdrawn and reconsidered.  The Minister said that he wants to tell the truth about Ireland.  What truth is he going to tell?  What truth is to be told about Ireland?  Is it the truth of the things that I see every day in my constituency? Will we send out pictures of the slums, which ought to be removed? Will we send out pictures and reports of the unemployed assembled at the labour exchanges or in mass meetings demanding work?  Is that the truth that will be circulated?  Or is it the old Kathleen Ní Houlihán stuff?  I commenced my speech by saying that I objected to Parliamentary time being devoted to this measure while urgent problems remained unsolved.  I appeal to the Minister to be realistic.  I appeal to him to withdraw the Bill.  When we have solved these urgent major problems and when he and his Department have had time to think over this Bill and to reconsider it, then in a <Col N="774" /> different atmosphere we can consider the new draft of the News Agency Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few things I would like to say in relation to the measure introduced by the Minister for External Affairs.  First of all, I think the idea which has prompted the Minister to introduce this Bill is a commendable one.  It is one which should commend itself to all sections of this House with, possibly, a question mark opposite Deputy Cowan.  Nevertheless we have, for a great number of years now and certainly since the foundation of the State, been very conscious of the fact that the Irish point of view abroad and Ireland's position in relation to certain matters have consistently been misunderstood as a result of lack of information emanating from Ireland.  If the purpose of this Bill is to endeavour to remedy that, then it is commendable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome Deputy de Valera's contribution to the debate in so far as his opposition to the measure itself is concerned not with the object or aim but merely with the means suggested by the Minister towards the accomplishment of an agreed object of purpose. When I say that I welcome Deputy de Valera's contribution, I mean that I can understand that portion of his speech in which he doubts the usefulness of this news agency in this particular matter.  But I do take exception to Deputy de Valera when he gives as one of his reasons for opposing this Bill that there is no chance of an income from this particular news agency.  In other words, one of his grounds of opposition is that there is no money in it.  There are many things which comprise the national aspirations of this country from which no dividends in hard cash can ever be drawn; many things on which each year we spend considerable proportion of our national income&mdash;the preservation of the Irish language and other matters like that&mdash;from which no side of the House expects an immediate return in money.  Nevertheless, there is no member of this House who grudges in any way the money spent. As I understand the Minister's remarks when introducing this Bill he does not propose this measure as being in any <Col N="775" /> way an income-making company, a company that is likely in any way possible to meet its own liabilities.  It is an investment of the income of the people of this country for the purpose of ensuring that that desirable object of making our point of view known abroad is attained.  To that extent I endorse and agree with the reasons which have prompted the Minister in introducing this measure.</P>
    <P>I can see objections to it.  I suppose we are starting more or less on a new field, completely uncharted and, naturally, any beginning must be imperfect. It is possible that there are other ways in which this objective can be attained but I do think that if we are serious about getting the Irish point of view understood abroad it should, if at all possible, be transmitted and distributed abroad by some association or organisation that is not identified with the Government here.  For that reason, I do not see any real grounds in the suggestion made by the Leader of the Opposition, that possibly some sheet issued by the Department of External Affairs would fulfil this purpose.  I do not think it would.  If such a sheet were availed of at all, it would, in America and other countries, be classed straightaway as propaganda and dealt with as such.  It is possible that news or information coming from an Irish news agency may also be treated purely as propaganda but there is at least a chance that in the world we want to approach, which presumably is America, it will be treated as news coming from a reliable source in this country and dealt with as such. I do not believe that such information coming from any purely Government source would have the opportunity of achieving its purpose.</P>
    <P>I do not think that this is a measure that should arouse much opposition in the House.  We have, I think, reached a stage now in the development of our country and in the development of our efforts towards unity when we must strike abroad and we must arouse public opinion throughout the world in the accomplishments of our outstanding national aspirations.  It is only right and proper that in that particular task we should avail of each and every <Col N="776" /> opportunity of affecting world public opinion.  In so far as I believe this measure has in it the possibility of doing that I think it is a measure that should be endorsed by this House. The Leader of the Opposition has expressed disagreement, for certain reasons, to the proposal.  He has suggested the alternative of using the Department of External Affairs.  I do not think that his reasons for suggesting that are such that should commend it to this House.  Unless there is some reasonable alternative to the organisation envisaged by this Bill I think it should be passed by the House.</P>

      <P>Deputy de Valera paid the Minister the compliment of regarding his proposal as a serious one and taking it as such he gave serious reasons why it should be withdrawn. I think it is a fake and my purpose in intervening in this debate is to try to find out why the Minister is trying to perpetrate this fake on the House. This proposed Irish news agency is a fake.  This Bill, which purports to set up a company under the Companies Acts and makes elaborate provisions for the utilisation of the profits which the company is going to earn, is a fake. The speech with which the Minister recommended his proposal to the House was the largest and final part of the fake.  Deputy de Valera and Deputy Cowan have suggested to the Minister that he should withdraw this Bill.  He has no intention of doing that.  He knew it was a fake before he brought it here.  I do not think it will be possible for us to extract from the Minister the real reason why he devised this fake and why he is trying to put it across the House.  He knows that he is not going to set up a news agency.  He knows that this company under the Companies Act is not going to have any profits to allocate, much less any hope of repaying the advances and loans that are to be made to it. He knows quite well that he has decided to call this a news agency and to set it up in the form of a company under the Companies Acts for ulterior motives.  I propose to suggest to him what these motives may be and I think that some Deputies, at least, will find them convincing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="777" /> There is going to be no Irish news agency.  Do Deputies here know what a news agency is?  It is an organisation which collects news and sells it to newspapers.  A newspaper contracts with a news agency to take its service of news and the news supplied by that agency flows into the newspaper office every day.  The newspaper taking the service may or may not use the news. It may be of no interest to its readers. It may be so coloured as to be incapable of being properly interpreted. The work of a news agency consists in selling a service of news to newspapers and the news agency makes a profit through the fees paid by newspapers for that service.  This news agency is not going to have news.  Is that not what the Minister says?  It is not going to be interested in news.  It is going to be concerned with supplying the Press of the world with information about Ireland of general interest.  It is going to give Ireland's viewpoint on political matters when necessary, presumably in the form of reports of speeches by the Minister, and it is going to negative hostile propaganda. How is it going to do that?  Is there going to be any result from the activities of this Company called the Irish news agency, than the issue of a bulletin, which Deputy de Valera called a sheet, containing general information about the country or reports of political activities which are so old when they reach the readers of the sheet that they are not likely to interest them unless the subject matter is of more than usual significance.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera made it quite clear, and I want to make it quite clear, that I see no objection to the publication of such a sheet, journal or periodical through the Department of External Affairs to influential people and newspapers in other countries. That is done, as we all know, by several European countries.  We ourselves get these publications, sent to us usually through the resident Minister of the country concerned.  Some of them are quite good.</P>
    <P>The Swedish publication has been mentioned here.  It is one which is so excellently produced that we all find it of interest and very frequently get <Col N="778" /> from it ideas which are applicable to our own circumstances.  Others are not quite so good or, rather, should I say, deal so exclusively with matters of general cultural concern that they are less interesting to us than those whose main concern is with political ideas and political events.  The publication of a bulletin of that kind and its circulation through our embassies is something which has been considered. One could exaggerate enormously the value of it.  It is something which may produce some results, but what I want to know from the Minister is: will this so-called Irish news agency do anything else than produce such a bulletin?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Such a bulletin is being produced at the moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore we are going to have two bulletins, one produced by the Department of External Affairs and another by this so-called Irish news agency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Will you explain what it is going to do?  I am asking the Minister to give us some information on that point.  He made a speech in which he detailed at great length the history of a news agency which was started by a penniless young man named Reuter who was anxious to sell commercial information in the City of London. He told us how that little organisation, which was concerned mainly with circulating information concerning the value of shares and the movement of prices throughout the world, gradually grew to be a great commercial news agency.  He told us how important it was for Britain with her world-wide interests, her imperial possessions distributed over all parts of the globe, to have news from the British capital transmitted throughout the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy answer me one question?  Can he name one European State that has not got a news agency, apart from Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say what this so-called news agency is <Col N="779" /> going to do?  That is what we are discussing. If we have not got a commercial news agency the reason for it is obvious.  It is not financial.  A news agency exists to serve the papers of the country in which it is established.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two practical objections to running a news agency in this country.  One is that, as the Minister mentioned, events of international significance are not happening here regularly.  The second is that there do not exist here newspapers with financial resources sufficient to support a news agency established here to serve them.  What is this so-called news agency going to do?  One thing the Minister did not tell us: where is it going to get the money which the Minister has spoken of?  What has it to sell and who is going to buy it?  These are questions which Deputies want to hear answered, not what was written in the <i>Round Table</i> eighteen years ago.  The Minister has come in here with the proposal to set up a company under the Companies Acts and he is coming later with the proposal to extract £25,000 from the pockets of the Irish people to establish this news agency.  What are they going to do with it?  These are the questions which he did not answer and these are the questions which he should answer.</P>

The question of payments to the chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann, notwithstanding the lies that are being told about him by the Minister and his colleagues, and <Col N="780" /> which are being circulated throughout the country, is completely irrelevant to this discussion.

We are setting up here a so-called Irish news agency. Is it going to have any news to sell? To whom does the Minister hope it will be able to sell that news?  What is it going to produce?  Where is it going to get a revenue?  Surely we were entitled to be told those things by the Minister when he was submitting to the House the motion that this Bill should be read a Second Time.  Why do we have to drag it out of him?  Is he trying to avoid having it dragged out of him by his irrelevant abuse of private citizens?  This Irish news agency is a fake.  It is called an Irish news agency as part of the fake.  It is not going to be a news agency.  It is not going to sell news.

Some of these companies with only nominal capital, established under previous legislation, have assets of millions of pounds now and were highly successful in developing the activities entrusted to them.  This particular type of legislation is produced here as part of the whole process of fooling the Dáil into the belief that something serious is intended.</P>
      <P>Might I suggest one reason why this weekly bulletin or monthly news sheet which is to be issued is not to be issued by the Department of External Affairs but, instead, is to be produced by a bogus company?  It is because the appointment of salaried personnel will, under this Bill, be at the discretion of the Minister whereas, if staff were to be recruited in the Department of External Affairs to do the same work, they would have to be recruited under the Civil Service (Regulations) Acts.</P>
      <P>Is there any other reason why this bulletin is going to be issued by a bogus company instead of by the Department of External Affairs?  May we be told something about the personnel?  There is a remarkable silence in this Bill about the persons who are to be appointed to salaried positions in this company or how much they are to get.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is to be a company and there are to be subscribers to the capital of the company&mdash;the £100 capital&mdash;but in case they might not like to take any financial risks in connection with their association with the company, the amount that they are to subscribe for the shares is to be given to them by the Minister for Finance.  That does not <Col N="785" /> mean by the Deputy who now holds the position.  It means by the ordinary working man of this State, the farmer, the farm labourer, the individual who pays taxes every time he smokes a packet of cigarettes or buys a pint. He is going to provide the money.</P>

The money which is to be provided by the Minister for Finance shall come out of the Central Fund.  The capital, of course, can be increased but not without the consent of the Minister for Finance and there is no indication whether, if it is to be increased&mdash;I cannot think of any reason why it should be&mdash;it is to be expanded through contributions from the Minister for Finance or from private individuals.

      <P>So long as we are honoured, as we are in this case, by the presence of a Minister, I have no complaint.  When we were discussing the Budget the Government Benches were empty and not only was it commented on on this side but at least one of the gentlemen on the benches opposite commented on it.  The company is to have as its principal function the collection, dissemination, distribution and publication of news and intelligence inside and outside the State.  The Minister himself in introducing the Bill told us it was not going to have as its principal function the collection, dissemination, distribution or publication of news in the sense that a journalist uses that term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="786" /> Deputy Cowan referred to Section 7 and he was anxious about the significance of the expression &ldquo;inside or outside the State&rdquo; because he presumably saw the possibility of this fake news agency interfering with the ordinary collection and distribution of news by professional journalists in Ireland but I think he missed the significance of the term &ldquo;principal function.&rdquo;  Will the Minister for Justice be good enough to take a note of one other question?  I want the Minister for External Affairs to answer in replying to the debate: What other function is it intended that it should have and to what extent is it possible for him or the Government, by Ministerial direction, to extend the functions of the so-called news agency beyond those set out in Section 7?  How much are the directors going to be paid?  Is not that a question which the Dáil is entitled to ask and to expect an answer?  How many directors are there going to be? What are they going to receive?  Why all this codology about making money available to this fake news agency in the form of repayable advances?  Is there the slightest prospect that this news agency will be able to repay any of the advances?  Why all this codolgy about the payment of interest?  Is there the slightest prospect that this company will be able to earn a penny with which to pay interest upon the advances it receives from the Central Fund?  For what reason is this elaborate fraud being built up for presentation to the Dáil&mdash;the picture of a company with subscribed capital, getting finances by means of repayable advances upon which it will be obliged to pay interest, and with provision for the control and allocation of profits when the Minister himself made it clear and everybody here realises that there is no means whatever by which this organisation can get money and that there is no likelihood that these sections of the Bill will ever become operative?</P>
    <P>Reading down the Bill, in Section 14 I came in contact with other associates of the agency that we did not hear about in any of the previous sections, that is, members of the agency.  What precisely is a member of the agency? <Col N="787" /> We learned already that there are to be subscribers to the memorandum of association, that these subscribers shall contribute to the capital of the agency on the understanding that the money is put up by the Minister for Finance. Then there are to be directors.  The manner in which these directors are to be appointed by the subscribers is not stated in the Bill.  That is all to be settled in a document called &ldquo;articles of association&rdquo; which has yet to be prepared and which is to be approved by the Minister for Finance.  But the subscribers having come together, they appoint their directors, and the directors may be not less than three or more than five.  Behind that there is some type of individual who is known as a member of the agency.  What is a member of the agency?</P>

      <P>Could we get a picture of the organisation?  There is a foundation of members.  Amongst these, or perhaps including these, or coincident with these, there are subscribers to the articles of association.  There are directors to be paid something&mdash;we do not know how much.  We know that they may not be less than three and cannot be more than five.  Associated with these there is to be an advisory board, and all this to produce a weekly or a monthly bulletin which is to contain no news, which is to be directed mainly towards supplying the world with information of a general character about Ireland, information which the Minister tells us is already made available through the Department of External Affairs and which we know is also distributed by the Irish Tourist Board; which is to contain the reports of speeches by the Minister dealing with political matters which he deems <Col N="788" /> it necessary for the world to be informed about, and which is to negative hostile propaganda.</P>
      <P>Everybody here knows that the net result of the work of this elaborate organisation will be the production of something akin to what we are now receiving from other Governments, which is of no use whatever to newspapers, which is rarely if ever used in relation to the presentation of news in newspapers, and which, as Deputy Cowan said, is not infrequently deposited unopened in newspaper wastepaper baskets.  Seven hundred newspapers in the United States are to be informed about Ireland by means of this organisation which will carry on news, which will not collect news, which will not enter into competition with other news-gathering agencies in this country or outside, and which is going to confine its activities to that type of general propagandist work.</P>
      <P>Do not Deputies opposite know that it is a fake?  Do they not know that behind this fake there must be some reason?  Are they not as interested as I am in extracting from the Minister what that reason is?  If he wants to give a few jobs to people and if his impediment is that he cannot get them into his Department without getting them by means of the Civil Service (Regulations) Act, he can go to the Government and get them appointed under a section of that Act which refers to the public interest.  That would be an honester way of doing it than going through the &ldquo;hocus pocus&rdquo; of setting up a company under the Companies Acts, with share capital, and repayable advances and making all this provision for distribution of profits which it is not going to earn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have said that I think some useful work can be done by the preparation and distribution throughout the world of a periodical journal containing general information about this country. I think that that journal is likely to be more effective if distributed to persons known to be interested or persons in positions of influence and authority in other countries than if it is distributed to busy newspaper editors.  If that is what the Government want to do, let them go and do it. But let us not have this pretence that <Col N="789" /> they are doing something else by setting up this so-called news agency and going through the fake and the farce of producing a Bill and asking the House to pass it.</P>
    <P>If the Government are anxious to make the pretence of doing something useful regarding Partition, they are not going to succeed by the introduction of this Bill.  The Minister asked Deputy Cowan what he would do in that regard and pressed him for an answer knowing the answer he was going to get and hoping he could turn it to some advantage to himself.  Let me give the Minister one piece of advice which I have already given to him in public and which I want to repeat&mdash;stop stunting, stop all this make-believe, all these pretences and fakes that the Minister delights in. Let him get down to realities and face the problem, and we know there is a problem, of breaking down the barriers to the distribution of news about this country to the world, and not pretend to be dealing with that problem by introducing a Bill of this kind.  Let him tackle it seriously and, as Deputy de Valera said, if he produces a serious proposition intended to deal seriously with that issue, he will get support from this side of the House.  But, to fakes and frauds of this kind, we promise continuous and undying opposition.</P>

      <P>Deputy de Valera approached this Bill in what seemed to me a reasonable and unbiased frame of mind.  I do not find myself in a position to agree with the conclusions which he came to, but there did appear, and he so expressed himself, to be a certain objectivity in his criticism of the Bill.  It was at least calm, reasoned and dispassionate.  One of the things which surprised me somewhat was the criticism that he offered, that if the proposed agency were to be successful, it would necessarily be expensive.  On the correctness of the statement as to the expensiveness of such a proposed news agency, I do not propose to comment.  But what does strike me as amazing is that the question of expense should lead Deputy de Valera to a decision that the news agency therefore should not be proceeded with.</P>

      <P>It appeared to me that the Deputy was dealing with the question of a news agency which would put the Irish point of view, which would give Irish news with an Irish slant and make it available for newspapers the world over.  If I understood Deputy de Valera correctly his attitude was that, even granting that it would be successful, it would be too expensive to do it properly.  The only point I am making is that it surprises me that the Deputy should have given expression to that point of view.</P>

      <P>Deputy de Valera was critical that, even if this was a start, it was a start on such a small scale that it would be ineffectual.  I am not concerned and neither do I think Deputies should be unduly concerned with anything save what appears in the text of the Bill.  What it may be possible to do by this news agency in the immediate future may be limited.  I approach the consideration of this Bill on the basis of what the Bill proposes to do and as regards what the Bill proposes to do the kernel and the central point of it is contained in Section 7 where the type of agency supposed to be set up is described.  Any discussion of this Bill which ignores sub-section (2) of Section 7 must be merely a discussion or a consideration not for the purpose of critically appraising the Bill, but of attacking it no matter what it contains. <Col N="791" /> Sub-section (2) of Section 7 sets out the object of the agency which &ldquo;shall be so stated in the memorandum of association that the principal function of the agency shall be to ensure the collection, dissemination, distribution and publication of news and intelligence inside and outside the State.&rdquo; If this Bill proposes to give us a new and better vehicle for so disseminating news about Ireland inside and outside the State and of collecting that news, then I think the Bill should secure the support of any Deputy who approaches it in an objective or honest manner.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy de Valera again suggested that the Minister was approaching this from the wrong angle but, as far as I could understand from him, he did not enlighten the House as to what he thought would not be the correct angle.  This Bill may not be perfect, but at least one can say that in this Bill an attempt is being made to do something which, I think, all of us will readily admit requires to be done.  Arthur Griffith talked about the paper wall round Ireland, the paper wall which shut out news from us from the outside and which prevented us from telling our story to the rest of the world.  This Bill, to my mind, is an attempt to batter down whatever remnants of that paper wall are left.  I think that perhaps the mistake the Minister made&mdash; it is typical of everything the Minister does&mdash;was that he erred on the side of modest understatement in respect of what he thought might be achieved under this, and because the Minister did not come in here prepared to launch on the heads of Deputies a torrent of ballyhoo about the wonderful things that were going to be <Col N="792" /> achieved, he is attacked by the Deputies opposite.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cowan, to my mind, did not discuss the terms of this Bill at all.  Deputy Cowan utilised the occasion for a piece of gratuitous stunting.  It is not pleasant for any of us to say these things about a colleague but I feel that any Deputy with any honesty in him must reprobate the stunting carried out by Deputy Cowan. He told us that he was sent here to consider the problems of unemployment and hunger.  What does he think the rest of us were sent here for?  He talked about the waste of Parliamentary time.  I think that came ill from a Deputy who has wasted more of the time of this House than any Deputy on these benches.  I do not think Deputy Cowan's contribution to the debate merits serious consideration at all.</P>
      <P>Then we had Deputy Lemass.  The Deputy frequently brings to the consideration of matters in this House a point of view with which many of us on these benches feel ourselves in sympathy; but Deputy Lemass, in approaching this particular measure, did so from the point of view that he was using this opportunity for making a personal attack on the Minister.  I took a rather unusual course after Deputy Lemass had used the word &ldquo;fake&rdquo;.  I am not quite sure how many times he used it, because I was not, up to that stage, counting, but I took the unusual course after that of counting the number of times in which he used the word &ldquo;fake&rdquo;.  He used it 11 times.  He availed of this opportunity to get out of his system some of the pique, spleen and bitterness that apparently he feels for the Minister and which is shared by most of his colleagues&mdash;for the Minister and for the members of Clann na Poblachta in particular.  Remember that in the eyes of the Fianna Fáil Party the members of Clann na Poblachta Party are the principal enemy.  Clann na Poblachta are people who draw forth all the vitriol and all the venomed bitterness that is in Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister had brought in this <Col N="793" /> Bill in any other form, would he not also have been open to criticism?  The machinery which this Bill proposes makes it possible to set up a company, not controlled solely by the Government, but a company in respect of which there are certain safeguards.  I think the mistake that Deputies opposite made, and I think the mistake that Deputy Lemass made, was the mistake of imagining the worst of everybody.  I believe he should have waited a little bit longer until he would find out more about this measure.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is prepared to support the Bill in its present form.  There was one point made by the Minister and there was no attempt made to answer it.  It carries complete conviction and it is this, that ours is the only country in Europe that has not got a news agency of this nature.  Do Deputy Lemass and his colleagues suggest that we are in a position different from any of the other small European countries?  He quoted the Minister as saying that there was not in this country a frequency of events of international importance.  That would apply equally to other small European countries, yet they have their news agencies.  Why do Deputy Lemass and Deputy de Valera and other members of the Fianna Fáil Party want to stifle, to gag, this country and prevent the people having at their disposal the facilities available to every other country?</P>

      <P>Perhaps that explains the attitude of the Party opposite, but it does not condone it.  I suggest that if this Bill were approached objectively, dispassionately and calmly, even if it were taken on the lines of the approach of Deputy de Valera, we could have a real discussion, but from the moment the Minister introduced the Bill it was obvious there was an atmosphere about to be created which would make a dispassionate and a calm consideration of the Bill impossible. In conclusion, let me quote an old Irish proverb: &ldquo;Bíonn gach tosnu lag&rdquo;.  Well, maybe it is a weak beginning, but it is a beginning and as such it should not be opposed in the manner in which it has been opposed by Deputies opposite.</P>

      <P>Very well, Sir.  What is this Bill for?  This is a Bill to provide, out of public funds, extra assistance for the Minister for External Affairs to do the job he should do.  We have heard a lot about paper walls.  The last Minister for External Affairs, the present Leader of the Opposition, succeeded, during the emergency, when it was difficult if not practically impossible to get news out of this country, in getting the news out with regard to our attitude to the European struggle and the reasons for our neutrality.  He got that news disseminated to the four corners of the earth without any of those new fangled news agencies that <Col N="796" /> will now be clapped on the backs of the people.</P>
      <P>Only last week I met a doctor of a mental hospital who had gone abroad. As an excuse for getting £100 a year extra for two other doctors to do his work while he was away, he told us that there were ten men in Switzerland doing the same amount of work as he does.  Apparently that is the ground for this Bill introduced by the Minister for External Affairs; he wants to get somebody else to relieve him of the work that the State pays him to do.

      <P>The Deputy does not seem to be in much of a hurry at any time.  Even when the bell rang the other night he was late for &ldquo;supper&rdquo;. I certainly have a very definite objection to occupying the time of the House on a Bill of this kind and I have a very definite objection to this proposed news agency.  What is its purpose?  It is an excuse for laziness in the Minister's Department.  I can see no other justification for it.  The Minister seemed to be anxious this evening about my attitude towards Partition.  I was honestly amazed at <Col N="798" /> the Minister.  I throw my mind back to the one occasion on which I dealt with what I thought would be a cure for Partition.  I drew down upon my head the wrath and anger of all the gods here.  The only crumb of comfort I was offered was when the present Minister for External Affairs met me outside, clasped me by the hand and said: &ldquo;Good boy, Martin, I am glad you had the pluck to tell the truth.&rdquo; The Minister has managed to cash in very successfully on the republican ideas he had then.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disagreeably surprised at the attitude adopted towards this machinery measure&mdash;for that is all it is&mdash;by Deputy de Valera, because nobody knows better than he does himself that while he was head of the Government for a period of 16 or 17 years he received what I would describe as &ldquo;slavish&rdquo; support from all opposition Deputies for his method of presenting the foreign policy of this country both <Col N="799" /> at home and abroad.  Naturally one would expect that now, when he is in opposition and with the experience that he himself has had and the knowledge that he has acquired, he would at least adopt the same generous attitude to the Minister who has replaced him in this Government.</P>
      <P>I have always taken a very keen interest in the statements made by the Minister for External Affairs on his annual Estimate in regard to foreign policy.  I always took it that it was proper for a back bencher to sit tight and make it appear to the world, as I think we have done up to the present, at any rate, that there is unity amongst all Parties on the foreign policy of the Government of the day; and that, as there is unity on the question of policy, there is naturally unity in the manner of presenting that policy both at home and abroad.  I take it that it can be assumed that our policy must be explained to the people across the Border as well as to America, Australia and elsewhere.  I take a keen interest in talking to people who travel round the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my pleasure to know and talk very often with Irish officers who man Irish ships and who also serve on foreign ships.  There is no more interesting conversationalist than the intelligent seaman who travels to countries like Australia, New Zealand, the United States of America, Canada and elsewhere.  I have received many letters from and I have had recent conversations with such people stating that our position in relation to recent events, particularly the passage of a certain Bill in the British Parliament, is very much misunderstood and misrepresented in foreign countries. It is imperative that Deputies on both sides of the House should understand that and it is imperative that there should be unity as to the method to be adopted by the responsible Minister in helping to remove these misunderstandings.  I received a letter, which I have in my possession at the moment, from a family relative in New Zealand.  I could read it to the House but I would not do so because I do not think it is right to <Col N="800" /> put what is in that letter on the records of this House.  I received a similar point of view from an officer of an Irish ship.  He was recently in Canada and the United States and he is going back to the United States again.  As a result of these conversations I think it is extremely desirable that some manner of machinery should be adopted by the Minister of the day in order to get our foreign policy on our present position explained, not alone to the native citizens of foreign States but to the Irish in many of the countries that I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable, therefore, that we should have this attitude adopted by Deputy de Valera who must know from his own experience and his contacts&mdash; perhaps as many and may be more than the contacts of the Minister&mdash;the necessity and desirability of doing these things.  It is stated at home and abroad, in my constituency as well as everywhere else, that if Deputy de Valera was in office to-day and holding the position that is held by Deputy MacBride as Minister for External Affairs, the so-called misunderstanding with our neighbouring nation would not have been created and would not have arisen.  It is desirable that that atmosphere of suspicion and misunderstanding should be removed.  Deputy de Valera can play a very great part in helping to remove that misunderstanding by endeavouring to agree with the responsible Minister as to the policy to be put across and the machinery to be used in order to explain our present policy and remove these misunderstandings.</P>
    <P>I was forced to my feet&mdash;I am a bit nervous in taking part in any discussion on foreign policy&mdash;by the bringing into this discussion of the question of the best method to be used for the removal of Partition.  If it is not out of order for me to say that, I had a recent experience in my constituency which I am sure I will never have again in connection with this matter. I am referring to what took place and to the speeches that were made at a meeting held in my constituency under the auspices of the Anti-Partition League.  I confess, to Deputy Cowan <Col N="801" /> in particular, that I went rather reluctantly.  The Tánaiste will confirm that.  I agreed to go with others to address this meeting and to take part in the proceedings.  I understood and I found I was wrong that the Anti-Partition League in this country was carrying out a policy that was in accordance with the wishes of the Mansion House Unity Committee. When I arrived at this town in my constituency with another colleague, who sits on this side of the House, I asked the secretary of the Anti-Partition League, to make sure of my ground&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Cowan repeated, apparently in response to a query by the Minister, his proposal for the removal <Col N="802" /> of Partition.  That was quite in line with the speech that was delivered in my constituency on the occasion referred to, namely, that the Army at this stage should be used to march across the Border and that automatically the Border would then be removed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I took a note of the words used by Deputy Cowan and another Deputy on that matter.  I want to say in conclusion that having listened in, I hope, a dispassionate way to some of the speeches from the Opposition Benches I can only come to one conclusion, that the opposition of a number of the Deputies and particularly Deputy Lemass to this measure is not opposition to the contents of the Bill itself so much as it is opposition to, and a lack of confidence on the part of Deputy Lemass in, the Minister for External Affairs.  He will have to administer this measure when it comes into law.  I am not going to share the opposition to a measure of this kind for personal and spiteful reasons and I have no hesitation whatsoever in saying that I shall give my unqualified vote for the Second Reading of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>No matter how one tries to be constructive in a Bill like this it is very difficult on account of the confirmed suspicions that are in one's mind.  However, I will not emphasise or delay in speaking about the convictions that we have of the Party bias which has been used in external propaganda as well as at home.  The first principle which I must say we always tried to enforce&mdash;I am sorry the Minister has gone out&mdash;was that as a sacred trust the propaganda carried on outside this country should always observe silence with regard to differences between Parties at home.  I myself had the experience of seeing how the Irish race abroad suffered when they had to take part in controversy at home.  For that reason, one has to speak with a good deal of care and caution about <Col N="803" /> how propaganda should be carried on abroad and one naturally distrusts any machine that is going to be used outside this country when we have had evidence already of these attacks being made upon the Leader of the Opposition and the Fianna Fáil Party outside Ireland.  That is a sacred trust which I would even now impress upon the Government to observe.  However they may use the machinery of the short-wave station or their diplomatic channels, they should observe that sacred trust of remaining absolutely silent on questions of domestic difference and deal only with national issues with the object of raising the national prestige of Ireland abroad.  You cannot raise the national prestige by talking about domestic quarrels any more than you can expect neighbours to respect your family if you talk about your private quarrels outside.</P>
      <P>Apart from that, on the practical side, I was very interested in the quotations that were made because they referred to countries of which I have had experience.  On the practical side, I think that that work should be done by our representatives.  I do not know what some of our representatives would be doing if they were not doing that work.  The problem is not the issue of a news sheet of any sort; the problem is to get the ear of the papers.</P>
      <P>The way in which the British publicity people managed during the war was to get hold of the editors and proprietors of papers in Britain.  That is the problem in Britain with us to-day. Anybody with experience of propaganda in Britain will know that the doors of the great newspapers are shut against us.  If the editors and proprietors are against us, as Deputy Cowan said, the news sheets will go into the waste paper baskets, unless by some means through diplomatic channels or otherwise, contact is made, with the proprietors, especially because they pay the piper and naturally they will call the tune.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to publicity in other countries, South America for instance, we were able to carry on a very effective and considerable publicity from Buenos Aires with all the other countries at a <Col N="804" /> very small expense because we had friends in Chile, Uruguay, Brazil and Bolivia.  When we got bulletins from home we were able to turn them into bulletins suitable to the place of publication. We had them properly translated, sent out to these countries and in a week or two afterwards we would get the papers in Spanish back again with our news prominently displayed, because we had friends there and they did it for love of the country.  You can always get honorary consuls in these countries because they have a patriotic feeling which sometimes grows more intense the further they are away.  They are men who are prominent citizens in these countries, who have the ear and the friendship of the editors of these papers.  Spending money on a news sheet is quite useless unless you have that other machinery which I have mentioned.  I take it that would be the normal function of our consulates and Ministers in these countries so that really I do not see there is any particular need for the expense involved in the creation of a newsagency.  I am sure if there were fees to be paid for special writers that could easily be dealt with.</P>
    <P>The present time is not like the period when the struggle in Ireland was passing through its bitterest phase, when the propaganda was of a sensational nature and it was so vital that news should be given to the world of the fighting that was going on at home.  At present it is a matter of trying to answer hostile and ignorant criticism of the country.  It is a question of putting the qualities of our culture, our interests and so on before the people of the world, not necessarily in the daily papers but in the reviews and papers which contain serious studies and articles.  That is the way in which we should be able to get at the ear of the influential world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>You must have an answer to the whispering campaign that is going around.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>The only way you can do that is by personal contacts and by bulletins.  That should be the first and most important work of our consuls and honorary consuls and we need not <Col N="805" /> spend a great deal of money on them. Again the approach must be to different sections of the public.  The most difficult to get at are the British.  The non-British are easier to get at.  I was very amused to hear the quotation from <i>The Round Table</i> about the leading newspapers in Buenos Aires because I must say I used to enjoy the un-British and unbiased news which came through from Havas and other agencies which were not under British control.  I do not know of any papers in these countries which are in advance of <i>Prensa</i> and <i>La Nacion</i> in Buenos Aires for a really high-minded view of international affairs.  In some ways you get a better picture of European affairs from these papers than you would get if you were at home.  There is also this fact to be considered. There are big commercial connections between firms in Great Britain and firms in centres like Buenos Aires who advertise largely in these papers.  In that way the British have a certain amount of influence and the papers have to be very careful not to offend the British beyond a certain point, as we found out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These difficulties are not going to be met by the establishment of a news agency such as the Minister has foreshadowed. I think they must be met in a more detailed way.  They must be dealt with through the machinery of the Department, through Minister, consuls or honorary consuls.  If you publish a good bulletin dealing with trade matters, cultural matters, history and with the misrepresentation which exists in regard to this country, those bulletins going out from here could be adapted, as we used to adapt them, to local circumstances and could be published in the local papers abroad. Again, the matter might be dealt with by getting articles into the papers through personal contact, or else by letters to the papers which sometime foreign papers are ready to publish. The <i>Buenos Aires Herald,</i> for instance, was always very fair to us in that way even though it was not always our way of thinking.  I think that is the only method by which we can carry on propaganda abroad judging by the experience which we have had in the past.  I hope the Minister will take <Col N="806" /> our advice from this side of the House. There are these practical difficulties that the papers sometimes will not publish what is circulated by news agencies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I notice that the Deputy has a most reasonable approach to the whole matter and I want to be absolutely reasonable with him in setting out very briefly the problem. There are, for instance, as I indicated earlier, between 3,000 and 4,000 newspapers in America and before you can expect any of these newspapers in the United States, in the Argentine, in Australia, or even in Europe, to publish Ireland's viewpoint you must make material available to them in a news form that they can publish.  That is the problem that has to be got over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>One can only speak about this matter from one's own experience and I think the sheet that would be issued, such as is issued by Sweden and other countries without having any elaborate machiney behind it, would be more effective and more valuable, because my experience was that the bulletin I would get from home would have to be adapted to local circumstances so that we could use it.  A very moderate increase of expense in the Department of External Affairs should be able to supply the necessary machinery so that the contacts would be made.  You can hardly reach all the thousands of papers but you probably can reach syndicates which syndicate to those papers.  It depends very largely on the personal influence of individuals in towns.  I think it should be possible to get honorary consuls or even patriotic people of the Irish race to help in that way without any unnecessary expense at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>It is useless to go out first to the non-Irish people, especially to the British.  You have to operate through the Irish race.  We tried all this.  We burnt our fingers by going to the wrong people.  First you have to get the Irish race to do it.  There is one thing I would impress upon the Government and the Minister&mdash;I <Col N="807" /> mentioned it in the beginning of my speech&mdash;that is, to regard it as a sacred trust to be absolutely silent on questions of differences in politics at home.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>It is absolutely necessary to avoid any statement about an attack upon one's political opponents. I had experience of it, because I was in Buenos Aires when the Treaty was signed and I could see how our own people there were scattered and confused and embittered by what had happened at home and they had no leadership which could hold them together.  For that reason, I would impress on the Minister that that is absolutely essential.  I think there is a very grave suspicion, with evidence to support it, that so far, that principle has not been properly observed but it is the one principle in this case that I would impress upon the Minister.  I do think that before he goes further with this Bill he should at least postpone it for the time being and try the other method first and see how that works out.  Certainly, the criticism made by the Leader of the Opposition was made in the spirit of really practical experience and it was not made out of any sense of wishing to be destructive of anything that would be for the good of the nation as a whole.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>With a certain amount of deliberate intent, I kept myself free from most of the discussion in this House on this particular measure, because I hoped to view it in an earnest and abstract way.  I look upon this Bill purely as an enabling Bill and that the purpose that will ultimately be served by this news agency is at the moment in embryo.  I am not going to offer any criticism of the past and I might say initially that I thoroughly and absolutely agree with the sentiments of Deputy Little that, no matter what purpose this news agency may ultimately serve, it must serve the purpose of disseminating throughout the world a united Ireland <Col N="808" /> as far as external affairs is concerned.  I think we have had too bitter a history in this country of the reverse.  We should by now have learned the lesson that whatever Parties we may believe in in this House, internationally, we must face the world as a united Ireland, on common issue where our external relations are concerned.</P>
      <P>I have said that I view this Bill purely as an enabling Bill, an enabling Bill to do this much&mdash;to disseminate throughout the world in a reasoned and authoritative way the views of Ireland on certain issues.  It will have a second side to it.  It will have there ready at hand prepared information to counteract some of the many stupid, malicious and foolish statements about Ireland that appear in many of the newspapers of the world.  I cannot understand people being overtly suspicious of something that has not been tried.  I feel sincerely that the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy de Valera, is as anxious as any member of this House that the full impact of the Irish point of view in an Irish way should be placed before the world and I think that our purpose would be far better served in this House if we were to give the Minister and his effort a hearty blessing and a good wish rather than a type of biased and bitter criticism.</P>
      <P>I am, fortunately, removed by my extreme youth from differences and bitternesses that may have upset people in the past, but I do think that before we embark on criticism of this Bill we should view it for what it is and not for more than it is.  It is an enabling Bill to allow the Minister for External Affairs to set up a type of news agency.  It may be that that news agency may do this country a world of good.  Why do not we, in a manly and straightforward way, give it a chance before we try to damn it, either with faint praise or queer suspicions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a peculiar view.  I have only a very limited knowledge of people throughout the world but I have a fair knowledge of certain people of my own age throughout the British Isles and part of Europe.  I am not saying this in any spirit of criticism but in a <Col N="809" /> spirit of interest and from my own experience, but no matter how we may gull ourselves into the belief that our point of view has got across to the world, it has not.  There is no good in trying to tell me that the Irish point of view has been put in an Irish way to the world.</P>
    <P>I am going to pay this tribute and pay it unashamed to the ex-Minister for External Affairs, Deputy de Valera, that he did his honest best in a courageous way to get his point of view across.  He had to meet many difficult circumstances and it may have been that in those peculiar circumstances the full benefit of his efforts was not felt throughout the world.  I think he did that in a genuine way.  I think we should view the efforts of the present Minister for External Affairs in the same way.  It may be that this may not succeed to the extent the Minister for External Affairs hopes it will succeed, but, at least, let us get together here in a manly and friendly way to give it God speed and a fair chance.</P>
    <P>Nothing is more needed at the moment than that the world should know the grievances and the bitter grievances that this country labours under.  There is no man in this House who is not extremely conscious of the cancer and rot that Partition is creating in this country.  There is nobody in this House who is not anxious that the Irish point of view should be disseminated throughout the length and breadth of the world.  I think there is a chance that through this Bill that may be achieved.  I say to this House, in an earnest and manly way, let us give it that chance, let us all give it that blessing rather than come here in any spirit of suspicion or criticism of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass was talking about articles of association and memoranda. I will give the Opposition a present of all the articles of association and all the memoranda of companies that they like if this Irish news agency goes a part of a foot forward towards putting the Irish point of view to the world. This is a matter in which there should not be an effort at either Party politics or cheap gibes.  This is a matter that is going, at least, to make an earnest effort to do something that <Col N="810" /> we all believe in.  Let it be a failure but give it its chance before we call it a failure.  It is no good, and it is not in the interest of any of us and it is not a credit to any of us, to make any kind of an issue out of this.  It reflects no credit anywhere if members of the Opposition are trying to nail this as something to benefit Clann na Poblachta or if, as Deputy Little said, there are a whole lot of suspicions about it.  There is no benefit in that. In my opinion, it is rank dishonesty, because we are by this going to try in this country a new experiment, an experiment which has been carried out successfully by many countries in Europe.</P>
    <P>Why are we not big enough and men enough in this House to give it a chance?  Why do we have to make it a political issue?  I am quite sure that the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy de Valera, in his heart of hearts is really anxious that this should serve the purpose for which it is designed. Let us all get together behind it and give it a chance.  It is not going to redound to the credit of any individual or any Government.  This country and the interests of this country must be put first.  If, through this medium, the least bit of benefit can be done to the Irish cause and to the ultimate reunification of the country, I think the Minister is justified in every action he has taken; I think this Government and this Parliament are justified in saying &ldquo;God speed to that effort&rdquo;.  Do not let us kill it before it starts.  Do not let us enter into criticism about what could have been done and was not done.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to concede with absolute sincerity that the best possible efforts were made by the late Government to disseminate the Irish point of view throughout the world.  I think the best possible advance was made by the honest statements made by Deputy de Valera when in charge of the Department of External Affairs.  I think he made that effort and that he will be unworthy of himself and the national service he has given to the country if he does not now give his blessing at least to this effort.  Let us forget suspicions and give this agency a chance to disseminate the Irish point <Col N="811" /> of view to the world.  Let us keep Party politics in Dáil Éireann and let our news go out from a united people determined to reunite the whole of Ireland.</P>

      <P>I think it is a great pity that Deputy Collins did not tender some of the excellent advice he has given us to some of his colleagues over there, particularly when holding forth to this House and to the public that Deputy de Valera was an old man and that nothing was done by the Fianna Fáil Government about Partition.  It was very nice to hear Deputy Collins holding forth now with regard to what was done, but it is very hard to remove the mud which was slung at the Fianna Fáil Party and Government on the ground of alleged inactivity about a question like Partition when they were in office.</P>
      <P>Let us take this Bill as it stands. What exactly is behind the Bill?  Is it a prestige measure?  I think we shall all have to agree that, whatever may come out of it, nothing else except some prestige for the present Minister for External Affairs can emanate from the results of this Bill.  The preamble to it provides for the promotion by the Minister for External Affairs of a limited company for the collection, dissemination and publication of news and information inside and outside this State and to provide for other matters connected therewith.  Why inside the State?  What necessity is there for a news agency to disseminate news inside the State unless that agency wants to disseminate news of the type which the Minister for External Affairs wants to edit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been stated that one of the necessities for the success of a police State is to get control of the Press in some way.  We were not told by the Minister in introducing the Bill what are the implications of this business of the dissemination of news inside this State.  Where is the necessity for the dissemination of news inside this State, outside the existing organisations that we have, to a free Press?  Are we going to have a further turn given to the official news disseminated by the Government Information Bureau?  For <Col N="812" /> instance, are we going to have it suggested that when certain events take place, even in this House, they are not of sufficient news value to be given over the radio to listeners throughout the country?  Are we going to have the free Press in this country put in the position that they cannot publish anything from an official point of view except what may be provided by these unknown gentlemen that we are going to have under Section 17, or Part III, of the Bill?</P>

      <P>&ldquo;The objects of the agency shall be so stated in the memorandum of association that the principal function of the agency shall be to ensure the collection, dissemination, distribution and publication of news and intelligence inside and outside the State.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>As I indicated in introducing this Bill, I hope that this news agency may, from time to time, <Col N="813" /> be able to be of assistance to our own newspapers by giving to them news of Irish interest in countries abroad. That is one reason.  The other reason is, as the Deputy knows quite well, that the memorandum of articles of association of a company and likewise the Act, limits tightly the function of any company.  The news agency will, I take it, make available to all the newspaper correspondents that are here, to the news agencies that are here, and to the newspapers that are here any of these genuine releases so that they may have them and so as not to put them at any disadvantage in regard to other countries.  Therefore, it is essential to enable the news agency to give to foreign correspondents here and to news agencies' representatives here copies of whatever has been sent out.  Unless that is provided for in the Bill, it would be <i>ultra vires</i> on the part of the news agency to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister can talk about the articles of association which we have not got.  We do not know what is proposed to be incorporated in them. It is all very well for the Minister to say that the company will be limited by what appears in the articles and memorandum of association.  The Minister, however, has thought fit to keep the House in the dark as to what is going to appear in the articles and memorandum of association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">

He has not told us what their salaries are going to be.  Is he asking the House to accept the proposition that, at this stage, he could not put before it the proposed articles and memorandum of association of this company?</P>

      <P>The Minister is well aware that there is nothing to prevent him from putting before the House the provisional articles and memorandum of association, so that it and the country would know what the obligations are going to be as a result of the setting up of this company.  The Minister is cutely providing that the powers of this company will be determined by the articles and memorandum of association, and he is going to keep them in his pocket until the Bill is passed.</P>
      <P>The Minister told us that this proposed agency is not going to be a news agency.  As I understood him, he said its functions will be to provide information of a cultural and possibly trade nature, with some general information about this State.  Deputies get that sort of stuff in the circulars which they receive week after week from other Governments and other sources.  The Minister says that this agency will not deal with &ldquo;hot news&rdquo;.  He did make the statement, a significant one, from the point of view of Deputies on this side, that from time to time, and as occasion may warrant it, there will be comments issued on the political situation here.  These comments will be made by the Minister, and will be sent out by a body which, under this Bill, will be the creature of the Minister. They will be sent out as the official view of this State, irrespective of what the local situation may be. Anybody who has had experience of the Government Information Service since the present Government came into office will have good reason for viewing with suspicion official statements of that kind which may be sent out.</P>

The Minister deliberately stated that political comments may be made from time to time, and these, as I say, will be sent out by a body which will be the creature of the Minister.  It will send out the statements which the Minister wants made.  These are not the type of statements that I, as one Deputy, want to go out as representing the <Col N="815" /> views of the majority of the people of this country.</P>
      <P>I think that some of the supporters of the Bill have claimed that it will raise the prestige of this country abroad.  What is the record of the Party opposite on this question of prestige?  How many lectures have the people generally and this House heard from them about Fianna Fáil squandermania? How many lectures have members of the Government opposite given us about the Constellations with which we had the prospect of earning some dollars for this country?  The Irish taxpayer will be bled white under this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Chair so rules, I cannot pursue that.  I can ask this: if the Minister and his colleagues were anxious that the Irish point of view should reach people outside this country, why did they stop the erection of the short-wave radio station?  Why did they consider that project Fianna Fáil squandermania, a station that could have served this purpose far better than this Bill proposes to do? Why did all of them consider that it was national squandermania to erect that short-wave radio station?  Is the Minister just bringing in this Bill to try and cover up the attitude of the Government which spiked that Fianna Fáil project?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and his colleagues are well aware that they are now going ahead with that project because the public have demanded that they do so. Was it to cover up their blunder in that regard that they decided to bring in this Bill?  If the Minister was sincere in his opening statement, both he and his colleagues in the Coalition <Col N="816" /> Government would admit that to be so. Does not the Minister know&mdash;every journalist knows it&mdash;that even though the body proposed to be set up under this Bill sends out articles to the world unless they have some news value the newspapers in foreign countries will at once refer those articles back to their correspondents here and ask &ldquo;is there anything in these, or are they just more of the Coalition Government's ballyhoo?&rdquo;  Is not that what will happen in practice?  The Minister knows quite well that it is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must know quite well that, even though a weekly or monthly bulletin is published dealing with matters of general interest to Ireland, unless it contains something in the nature of hot news, no newspapers outside are going to bother their heads publishing what it contains. Has the Minister considered the cost of this?  There have been some sneers at what the Leader of the Opposition said about the cost.  If we are going to spend money on it, then we certainly should see that we will get value for our money.  If we consider that there is a better way of spending this money and of achieving the object which the Bill is supposed to have in view, then that is something which the Dáil could take a note of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard very many lectures about squandermania in the matter of public money, particularly by the previous Government.  I think we should examine the Bill carefully to see how far we are committed to expenditure under it.  The Minister has been notably silent on that.  It is significant that, under Section 3, the Minister is taking power to see that any money that is required shall be provided out of moneys voted by the Oireachtas.  Is it not rather strange that a section of this sort should find its way into this Bill without any difficulty?  A couple of weeks ago we tried to get a similar section inserted in the Works Bill to meet the cost that would fall on Irish farmers, but the Government would not agree to it.  The Minister for External Affairs, however, is now able to commit the House under Section 3 to <Col N="817" /> provide him with any money that he may require for the purposes of this Bill, and we do not know how much money he is going to require.</P>
    <P>When we come to Part III of the Bill we do not know what the directors are to be paid; we do not know what the advisory board will be paid, if they are paid at all.  In fact, we do not know who most of those gentlemen are going to be.  If the Minister, when he was introducing the Bill, wanted to get the confidence of the House, he would have been well advised to put his cards on the table and produce his memorandum and articles of association and he would have told the House who these wonderful pressmen will be who will break through this paper wall.</P>
    <P>Section 17, which leaves the whole matter in the dark as to who these people will be, must necessarily create an air of suspicion.  If the Minister has certain people in mind, why not be open with the House?  Why should he not make the case here &ldquo;I am going to provide A, B or C in this service&rdquo;?  If the Minister so wishes, let him have the courage to stand up and say: &ldquo;The managing director will be Noel Hartnett and the assistant director will be Roddy the Rover&rdquo; and let him nominate the other people he proposes to put on this board.  If he took the House into his confidence the House would consider that the Minister was genuine in the job he is setting out to do, and that he was asking the House to accept what is set out in this Bill as being something worthy of acceptance.</P>
    <P>In my submission, the Bill as introduced has been introduced in a weak way.  The Minister is a very able operator and if he had a case to make he is more capable of making one than any other member of the House.  In this instance his case is weak because the whole structure of the Bill is weak. The Minister knows that it will not achieve the purpose he has suggested to the House.  We all know that it will be a financial disaster.  We all know that all that will be done will be to set up some kind of news sheet along the lines of what is issued by the Tourist Board.  We all know that the <Col N="818" /> main object of the measure is to make provision for unknown gentlemen at unknown salaries.  The Bill should be rejected.  If the Minister is well advised he will withdraw it before it goes to a vote.</P>

      <P>I think it seems to be generally accepted by all Deputies that the main purpose of this Bill is to do something with regard to the problem of Partition, to do something active, something which was left undone for a very considerable time. Deputies, no matter whether they are on this side or the other side of the House, are perfectly entitled to voice their objections regarding the particular method adopted by the Minister, and, if they can, put forward some concrete proposals; but I think it is very mean of Deputies on the opposite benches not to extend at least some measure of congratulation to this Minister for endeavouring to do something in the direction of removing the Border.  For too long have we in this country, all of us, north and south, put up with a situation where there was a policy north of the Border of &ldquo;not an inch&rdquo; and south of the Border a policy of &ldquo;not a word&rdquo;.  That is exactly what the position was up to this and every Deputy, whether new or old, is very well aware of the attitude taken up by the Leader of the Opposition when he was on this side of the House and in charge of External Affairs.  Deputies are well aware of the attitude taken up by former Fianna Fáil Ministers&mdash;that it was embarrassing to them to have Opposition Deputies talking about Partition.</P>

      <P>I have no desire to touch on any of the tender spots of Deputies opposite.  Still less have I a desire to follow in the same bitter, ill-tempered, waspish style, such as was adopted by Deputy Lemass when he was dealing with this Bill.  The Minister is entitled to some sort of reasoned and reasonable approach from the Deputies opposite.  For many months I have been sick and tired of the type of speech coming from the Fianna Fáil Benches&mdash;that everything Fianna Fáil mooted was undone by this <Col N="820" /> Government and that the whole approach of this Government was deliberately intended to destroy anything built up by Fianna Fáil.  It is now perfectly obvious that Fianna Fáil are determined as best they can to hinder this Government in building up any kind of edifice which may help in the solution of the Border question.</P>
      <P>Deputy Moran made one remark with which I agree&mdash;I think he only made one with which I could agree. He said that&mdash;referring to Fianna Fáil &mdash;if they considered there was a better way of approaching this problem, a better way of doing things, that that method deserved consideration by the Minister.  I think that is so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but the Leader of the Opposition told us what it was.  The method suggested by the Leader of the Opposition, the only alternative put up from the Fianna Fáil Benches up to this stage at any rate, was that instead of having an Irish news agency and instead of doing the work contemplated in this Bill, a particular section of the Department of External Affairs should be set aside and told off to deal with this work; that they should issue monthly or quarterly what, I think, Deputy de Valera referred to as a news sheet of some description, and that they should confine their activities to seeing that that sheet was sent to influential people in various countries abroad.  I think that is a fair summary of document No. 2 put up by Deputy de Valera.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister has said already by way of interjection, that is already being done by the Department of External Affairs and this is an effort to push the work further.  In so far as that type of work is already being done by the Department of External Affairs, I think Deputy de Valera will agree that his alternative suggestion&mdash; and it is the only alternative that has been suggested in this debate&mdash;falls to the ground.  I think that the reason why it is necessary that this Bill should be introduced and should be accepted by the House is because the method which was recommended and <Col N="821" /> relied upon by Deputy de Valera is obviously not a good one and is obviously not a method which will obtain any results.  Captain Cowan, opposing the Bill, said that news sent to newspaper offices from official Government agencies was put into the waste-paper basket without being opened.  I think that is much more true of news, propaganda, news sheets or bulletins, sent out directly by a Department of State, particularly by a Department of State in a country which has a grievance that it is trying to impress upon the world is a legitimate grievance and one that must be remedied.</P>
    <P>I had some small doubts as to the merits, or otherwise, of this Bill. Having listened to Deputy Lemass, Deputy Moran and other Opposition Deputies I have no doubts left as to the merits of the Bill.  Having listened to them, I feel it is my duty to support this Bill.  I am very well aware of the fact that there are people both inside and outside this House who may not feel that this is the best method of approach.  I do not know whether or not I am in order, but it is difficult to address one's mind to this particular Bill if one must exclude the problem of Partition from one's considerations. It is perfectly obvious that this Bill is a step towards the solution of that problem.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera and Deputy Aiken have been severely criticised, mainly by persons outside this House.  I have heard them criticised inside the House, too, because of the efforts which they, as individuals and as members of the Opposition Party, have made on their own initiative to pierce what has become known as the &ldquo;paper wall&rdquo; which surrounds this problem.  There is no doubt since the change of Government both Deputy de Valera and Deputy Aiken have expended a great deal of effort and energy in endeavouring to pierce that paper wall.  Again, it is a matter of opinion&mdash;contrary opinions have been expressed&mdash;as to whether their method of approach was a good one, as to whether it was the best or the worst method.  To-day expressions of opinion will again be forthcoming with regard to this Bill. People are quite legitimately entitled <Col N="822" /> to say that this is not a good method of approach and to maintain that there could be a better one.  I think any Irish newspaper and any member of this House is perfectly justified in adopting that attitude and holding that the money to be expended on this agency will be money wasted and that another method should be found. Deputies, however, are not entitled to stop there.  It is the duty of Deputies in considering this measure to point out what the alternative methods are and to endeavour to be in some degree constructive in their criticism.  It should be their endeavour to assist the Minister, who, after all, whether one agrees or disagrees with his political Party, has a very heavy responsibility.  Certainly he is active in his Department.  I think no Deputy can quarrel with me if I say of him that he is devoting all his energies towards the solution of a problem which has so far defeated the best brains of this country for a considerable number of years.  I think he is entitled to our sympathy.  He is also entitled to constructive criticism and assistance and help in his task.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Corry who taunted the Minister with cowardice and weakness in so far as he was holding out his hand and asking for the co-operation of Deputies in seeking a solution of that problem.  I think that is a particularly despicable type of attack.  I think Deputies on the Opposition Benches would be perfectly entitled to complain if the Minister, on a question so vital and important to future generations of Irishmen as this question of Partition is, were to come into this House and say: &ldquo;This is my method; these are my objectives; I shall go forward in this way in spite of you.&rdquo;  But, instead of that, the Minister comes into the House and says that he has a proposal to put before the House for its consideration.  He recommends its acceptance to the House and he asks for the assistance and co-operation of Deputies in the work he is proposing to do.  The outstretched hand of friendship and co-operation is spat upon by Deputies such as Deputy Corry.</P>
    <P>I think that Opposition Deputies are <Col N="823" /> in the main people who have a sincere desire to see this country progress towards unity and strength.  In their future conduct in these proceedings I appeal to them to keep that ideal and these aspirations in front of them.  I appeal to them to endeavour to assist the Minister.  If they have something constructive to put forward, let them put it forward.  I appeal to them not to talk for the sake of talking, for the sake of opposing and wasting time. This may not be the ideal method.  It may not be the ideal solution.  If Deputies have reasonable alternatives why not put them forward now and give the Minister an opportunity of considering them?  Why merely oppose and merely criticise?  It is, of course, the duty of an opposition to be wary and watchful and to oppose when opposition is necessary.  But I do not believe that it is the duty of an opposition to oppose indiscriminately on every occasion and to do it in the vexatious, ill-tempered way in which it has been done in this debate.</P>

      <P>The Minister, in introducing this Bill, left me, at any rate, under the impression that we were going to supply &ldquo;hot news&rdquo;. He started off with a long discourse on the rise of the famous Reuter News Agency.  He went on to tell us about Havas, and so on.  We all expected that that was the type of service we would have because of the case he built up.  The thought entered my mind as to the capital involved in an agency like Reuters.  I daresay it is nearer to £25,000,000 than £25,000. But that was the impression given to me by the first part of his speech.  At the end then he told us we were not going to deal in &ldquo;hot news&rdquo; at all. He did not describe it as &ldquo;cold news&rdquo;, but he said news of a cultural kind and with relation to trade.  I was not at all surprised to hear him say that one of its purposes would be to encourage tourism.  He actually did say that.  He has changed radically from his original attitude towards tourism during the by-election and the subsequent general election when he referred to us as feeding spivs and <Col N="824" /> demanded that there should be a tax upon them.  It is one of the advantages of having a change of Government that people learn something. The Minister, of course, has learned a little bit.  He knows now what the responsibility of office means.</P>

      <P>Anything I might be taught by that family I certainly would not want to learn.  This is not going to be &ldquo;hot news&rdquo;.  It will be about trade and so on.  It is hoped that this information about Ireland will find its way into 700 first-class papers in America.  As Deputy de Valera pointed out, if it is to be of any value at all, it will not suffice to have an ordinary bulletin once a week or once a month. It will have to be a daily bulletin and a daily bulletin will be a very expensive process.  Certainly, £25,000 will not cover it.  The Minister quoted a particular friend of his who goes under the pen-name of Nichevo.  My recollection of that article, if it is the same one the Minister referred to, was that the ultimate destiny of these bulletins was what he called the W.P.B.&mdash;the waste-paper basket.  Deputy Cowan said something of the same nature.  I have been talking to journalists who have had experience of this type of propaganda.  They say that they do not need to open them at all, they can actually smell them.  They know they are propaganda.  We want news that is not sticking out as propaganda so that it is going to be entirely ineffective. From that point of view the waste-paper basket will be the destination of practically every bulletin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One way that we can get over censorship, where there is no censorship possible except that exercised by the individual himself, is the radio.  People who do not want to listen in can switch off.  If we had gone ahead with our <Col N="825" /> short-wave station and let it be known to our people in America and other parts of the world, and perhaps to other well-wishers, that we had this radio station in full operation and that this question we are all so anxious to have understood abroad was to be fully explained to the world, the only censorship that could be applied to that would be the censorship of the individual who did not want to listen.  Of course, somebody could get up a counter station to jam it.  That could be done, I admit, but that would be a regular news war on a very large scale. I certainly think that if this £25,000 and something more, which is proposed to be expended on that&mdash;I do not know whether that is the annual cost or if it is only for the remainder of this year &mdash;were devoted to a very powerful station we would do far more good in making our case known.  Another thing in which the Government have changed their policy during their 18 months is in agreeing that there is a necessity for that.  Although we have lost 18 precious months it is good to know that even at this late hour they are going to proceed with it.  The Minister is probably right in saying that I have a personal animosity against him.  I do not deny that at all.</P>

I read some of the Irish-American Press and I have seen references in that Press, written by a person who now, at any rate, is employed by the Government and who happens to be a defeated candidate.  Whether he is still writing I cannot say.  Whether he has written since he became a civil servant I do not know.  I read some of the most objectionable stuff in certain Irish-American papers from that gentleman and I certainly would agree that if this agency is to be set up it would be most desirable that there should be no Party politics, whatever there may be here, when reports went abroad.</P>

I should like everyone to feel like that.  A little practice would be worth a lot of precept.  We have heard a lot of good suggestions made by the Minister who is a very bad example himself.

      <P>These are the objections I have.  The Minister when speaking was a long time in coming to the Bill itself.  He took about 50 minutes to come to the Bill.  The strangest way I have ever known of recommending a Bill to the House was to quote what the Leader of the Opposition said, not on a Bill to set up a news agency, but on the necessity for a short-wave station.  In my experience most Ministers of this House, when bringing a proposal to the House, first made their case for that proposal and then if they were able to quote some member of the Opposition in support of that case, they would do so. But the Minister quite obviously saw that this thing was a fake and he tried to give the impression that the Leader of the Opposition had pointed out the need for such a newsagency.  He actually went so far as to ask was I ashamed to hear the opinions of the Leader of this Party.  Of course I was <Col N="829" /> not.  I did not know exactly what the remarks he quoted had relation to at the time but they were about a short-wave station and not about a news agency at all.  I thought it was an extraordinary thing that the Minister should quote from <i>The Round Table</i> of 12 years ago.  He read from that for about 20 minutes.  Was that not what the Minister was quoting?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood it to be a ruling of the Chair formerly that Deputies coming in here would not be allowed to quote at such length from newspapers.  I had plenty of Irish-American papers from which I intended to quote, but I decided not to bring them in, because I thought I would not be allowed to quote from them at length and I did not want to give a mere excerpt.  Yet 20 minutes of the time occupied by the Minister were taken up in quoting from <i>The Round Table.</i>  We were told about the news stream of the world and the difficulties which the British were experiencing in getting into the world's news stream.  The British, with their powerful financial backing, and their experience of 100 or 150 years, were, we were told by the Minister, experiencing some difficulty in getting into the world's news stream. I do not know exactly what the Minister said about Reuter, but I think he said that he started somewhere in the beginning of the last century.</P>

That organisation has found the greatest difficulty in <Col N="830" /> getting into the world's news stream, and here we are with our little puny efforts of £25,000 trying to put it across on these people.  What chance have we of getting into the world's news stream when an organisation like that finds so much difficulty in entering it? If the Government are really serious about this matter it is not on a project of this kind they should be spending the money.  I think the Minister should go back to the Government and tell them: &ldquo;I am quite convinced that we made a capital mistake in February, 1948, when we scrapped the short-wave station.  We shall spend this money and some more in addition in setting up a powerful short-wave station which cannot be censored by any newspaper clique, which can be censored only by the person who switches off his set&rdquo;.  That is the way to approach this problem in the modern world.  The air is there and we should take advantage of it and utilise it to the best of our ability. The introduction of this Bill merely shows how well-founded was my suspicion when I asked the question as to whether this Bill was intended to provide jobs for the defeated candidates of the Clann na Poblachta Party.</P>

What happened in 1915 is within the memory of most of us, when the famous Hearst Press of America was absolutely pro-German and, if I may say so, a little bit pro-Irish.  Some of us remember reading <i>Scissors and Paste, Sparks</i> and <i>Honesty</i> where excerpts from the Hearst Press were frequently published, but all of a sudden there was a remarkable change, I should say a <i>volte face.</i>  The principal reason was that a gentleman called Balfour went across and purchased the Hearst Press, lock, stock and barrel.  I believe that until such time as we establish a Press agency, particularly for the United States of America, to give publicity to the cause of Ireland, we shall be just as we are at the present moment.  Some of the ex-Ministers over there may treat this as a laughing matter but I am sure it is not much joy they are having.  Poker faces have been given, from time to time, to the people so that they can laugh when they want to cry and cry when they want to laugh.</P>

      <P>I believe that Deputy Burke wants a handkerchief.  We have been hearing from him since February, 1948, about poor widows and people out of employment.  I heard an ex-Minister stating that he had a private animus against the Minister for External <Col N="832" /> Affairs but so far as I could gather, he was prepared to give vent to that private animus even if the Irish race were misrepresented.  It is about time these people thought and thought in such a way that they would become nice, sensible people.  Not alone have they command through &ldquo;Truth in the News&rdquo; of every bit of propaganda that they would want to put at their Party's disposal but even in very simple matters they utilised their paper when they were in power.  Of course, at the moment they cannot at all imagine that we people here could start a paper, not for political propaganda, not for personal propaganda, but for propaganda which would uplift the Irish race.</P>

I believe this is a Bill on which we should get the co-operation of the Opposition and I believe that when this news agency is operating it should as far as possible express the opinion of a united Irish race.  I think the Opposition may give their benediction to the Bill at some time or another.</P>

      <P>I will not detain the House very long on this question.  I am not so much concerned with whether it is right to establish this form of Press bureau or whether another form should be established, but I feel it incumbent upon somebody in this House to say a few words to the Minister about one matter of vital importance to the Irish people.  I gather that the Minister is not going to give out &ldquo;hot&rdquo; news to the world at large and that, therefore, any statements made on such matters as Partition will be very carefully considered and edited, and, whether we like the Bill or do not like it, I have at least some small consolation in that the Minister has told us there will be no &ldquo;hot&rdquo; news issued about Partition. I want to state my own point of view on this matter.  Ever since about July of last year the propaganda that has been issued from this country on the general question of Partition has been, taken large and wide, extremely unwise and <Col N="833" /> in many cases disastrous.  I make that statement deliberately.</P>

      <P>I am not accusing the Minister even of making any statements of that kind.  I am simply saying that the Minister has an opportunity, now that he is considering propaganda, to consider whether the kind of propaganda that has emerged from this country since August last is going to help our friends to help us to end Partition and whether it is going to assist generally in the campaign for unity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard statements made by people who went forward in the name of this country as a whole during a recent election which were not desirable statements to make.  We have had what I should say would be a sort of optimistic atmosphere engendered in connection with the problem of Partition that has only resulted in the situation being more serious than it was before.  I say in all seriousness that if the Minister should receive in his new Press agency statements and speeches made by people, perhaps, of all Parties, <Col N="834" /> by the Head of the State, by people who are related to propaganda agencies of other kinds, dealing with Partition, he would do well to edit them most carefully.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever the intentions of the Minister are in regard to Partition, I am quite sure he wishes to see unity established, but, from my knowledge, the way the facts of the situation have been expressed, even though the facts have been correct, has been unhappy in many instances.</P>
      <P>I am not trying in any sense to divide the House on this matter.  I am not even making individual members of the Government responsible for this.  I am simply saying that now we have an opportunity to review the situation.  We are now an independent Republic of Twenty-Six Counties outside the Commonwealth of Nations. The fact has been established.  We have time now in which to ponder upon how our propaganda in regard to Partition should be carried out, and if one were to read the newspapers abroad since the declaration of the republic, one would find that millions of people in the world who never heard of Ireland, who know very little about us, have now an impression that something of note has taken place and that there is no further problem to be solved.  They have been told about the advance the Minister believes he has made towards independence and they have not received any news at all about the problem left to be solved and the fact that this is a partitioned country.</P>
      <P>I notice that.  I have actually received copies of newspapers from countries such as France and Italy where that has been more than evident and it would seem to me that any attempt to rush the ending of Partition by unwise propaganda should be countered by the Minister by whatever form of propaganda agency he uses, whichever form he employs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="835" /> I must say that, looking back at the speeches that have been made in the last nine months, a great deal of the work of any news agency in this country in regard to Partition should be in the nature of a censor's office rather than in the nature of broadcasting. A great deal of the work of any kind of Press bureau, in relation to the kind of things that were being said about Partition during the last six months in general, should be in the nature of the work of a censor rather than in the nature of accepting everything as it comes in and then broadcasting it.</P>
    <P>It does not matter whether we believe in the establishment of the 26-county Republic or whether we do not.  There are common ideas attaching to the ending of Partition.  There are certain problems to be faced. There are certain friends to be kept throughout the world.  There are certain people who will be interested in helping us to solve our problems only if we approach the matter in the right way, and all that, I think, should be considered by the Minister very deeply.</P>
    <P>We have to rely on our kith and kin abroad to help us in this matter.  A great deal of propaganda can be done by Irish people living in remote parts of the world.  They have to be kept in touch with events here.  A great many of them, for one reason or another, have a certain loyalty to the British Commonwealth.  If they are going to help us to end Partition, they have to be approached and encouraged in the right way.  They have to be encouraged to take a part with us in ending this problem and not encouraged to stay away from it, not encouraged to take no interest, indeed, to eschew it, if they possibly can.  All these things have to be considered very seriously.</P>
    <P>It is quite obvious that at times a situation may arise when the heat that is engendered is inevitable.  I am very well aware that in the course of any particular set of political discussions people say things they regret afterwards. I am very well aware it is impossible for us to restrain ourselves when we see abuses being created in <Col N="836" /> regard to our national position.  All that I accept and appreciate but I do hope that the Minister, if he does establish a bureau of this kind, whether we approve of it or not, will bear that in mind.  It will be no harm for us all to review our whole attitude towards the solution of the Partition problem in relation to our propaganda abroad.  I might add that the same would go for the people of Northern Ireland.  The people of Northern Ireland and the Government of Northern Ireland, from their own point of view and in their own regard, could do exactly the same thing with advantage to both countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that such a large portion of the debate was taken up, not in discussing this Bill on its merits, but in attacking me principally. It is unfortunate that the members of the Opposition do not realise the amount of damage they do to themselves by failing to approach various problems, various questions that come before the House, on their merits. They could serve a much more useful function; their views would count for far more.  It is also unfortunate that a greater measure of agreement does not exist on the Opposition Benches as to the line they are going to take on a particular measure.</P>
      <P>Deputy Childers, who has just sat down, suggested that I should exercise a censorship on the news that was to be issued in future, that I should even censor statements made by the Head of the State.  I would suggest to Deputy Childers to use his influence on people like Deputy Corry of his Party, like young Deputy Blaney of his Party, who go round stunting and, just in order to raise a little bit of trouble, suggest that the only way to solve Partition is to get guns out now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lemass, of course, adopted his usual bellicose and, if I may say so, rather dishonest method of argument. He raised a tremendous fuss and pother regarding the drafting of the Bill because it was a £100 company. The Bill is a replica of many of the Bills that the Deputy himself had drafted.  Practically all the provisions were copied by the Parliamentary draftsman from some of Deputy <Col N="837" /> Lemass's own Bills when he was on this side of the House.</P>

The whole work was done by officials of my Department, in conjunction with the Parliamentary draftsman and the officers of the Deputy's ex-Department.

      <P>Deputy Lemass and Deputy de Valera both gave tremendous praise to the Swedish bulletin which is issued.  I agree entirely with that.  I think there are very few of these publications so well and so interestingly prepared as the Swedish bulletin.  But they held up Sweden as being an example of a country which <Col N="838" /> was doing what it should without a news agency.  In fact, Sweden has two news agencies of this type.  It has one for America by itself which is called the Swedish-American News Agency.  I have the particulars here if the Deputy would like to see them.  It has also another news agency and, in addition to that, the Swedish Legation circulates these extremely interesting bulletins which are a credit to Sweden.</P>
      <P>A lot of the remarks of Deputies on the other side of the House were devoted to suggesting that there was some ulterior reason for including in the terms of reference of the company to be formed power to distribute news inside and outside the State.  In some extraordinary fashion, Deputy Moran went to the extent of suggesting that that would vest in me the power of censorship, although a few minutes later Deputy Childers asked me to exercise the power of censorship.  There is no power of censorship in this Bill and I do not want any power of censorship. I think it is really unworthy of Deputy Moran to make a suggestion of that nature which he must know is unfounded.  It does not do him any credit.</P>
      <P>Provision was made in the Bill for the formation of a company.  Unless the matter was to be left at large, the terms of reference of that company had to be set out.  Once they were set out, the company was limited by those terms of reference.  Provisions were included in the Bill to enable the company to collect and disseminate news both inside the State, because the operative words are:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the collection, dissemination, distribution and publication of news and intelligence inside and outside the State.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unless the company were empowered to collect and disseminate news inside this State they could not do it. Obviously, the company has to collect news if it is to send out news.  As I explained in the course of an interjection, it is my hope that this news agency will be of assistance to our own newspapers and to our own newspapermen here.  It will make, I hope, its news service available to the newspaper correspondents who are <Col N="839" /> here representing the news agencies and newspapers of other countries.</P>

      <P>That is a matter to be settled.  As I indicated at the beginning, there can be no question of this news agency being a paying proposition, certainly for a number of years to come.  Various suggestions were made by Deputy Cowan and by some Deputies on the Opposition Benches to try and suggest to journalists and to newspapermen here that the creation of this news agency will in some way interfere with their livelihood. Of course, I take it that the journalists and newspapermen here are sufficiently familiar with that type of insinuation to know its purpose.  It was intended to try and secure a little bit of publicity&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>A good deal of criticism was levelled on the basis that this work could have been performed by the short-wave station.  Of course, that is quite ridiculous.  I do not think it could have been advanced seriously by any Deputy who used that argument. I put this simple test to any Deputy: how often does any member of this House himself, or any member of his family, ever listen to a news bulletin emanating, say, from an American or an Australian wireless station?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no purpose in reading circulars.  The purpose of the news agency is to supply news concerning Ireland to the Press of the world.  There is one function that I visualise will arise in connection with the news agency and the radio, and that is that, to a large extent, the news which will be suitable to the news agency will also be the same type of news bulletin that will be published through the short-wave station.</P>
      <P>A great deal of the suggestions of one kind or another that came from the other side of the House with the exception of Deputy Little's and, possibly Deputy Childers's, were not, I think, intended to be of a constructive nature.  I have, personally, acquired a good deal of knowledge in relation to this project of a news agency, not merely since I became a member of the Government but for a great many years back.  I myself worked both here and in other countries for news agencies, and I acquired a good deal of knowledge in the course of my work.  The first essential, before we can have anything published in a paper, is to make the news available to it.  For one reason or another that cannot be done through consular or diplomatic offices.  For instance, they cannot engage in ordinary trading transactions.  As I indicated in the course of the debate, we already issue weekly and bi-weekly bulletins through some of our main offices.  I consider that the news agency, when in operation, should aim at issuing approximately anything from 500 to 1,000 words a day, reckoned with a view to the particular market where it is directed.  The news items should be selected to be of interest in the particular part of the world to which they are being sent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I visualise that the news agency will be organised somewhat on the following lines: there will be a small office here whose function it will be to select and rewrite items of news that are likely to be published, say, in America. Those particular items will then be transmitted to a small distributing office in the United States.  The function of that distributing office will then be to transmit the news so received to the <Col N="842" /> newspaper desks and news agencies in the neighbourhood.  Likewise, in London I visualise a small receiving and transmitting office.  According as news is received from here, from the small central office here, news, say, for Australia or New Zealand, it will be transmitted to the London offices of the Australian and New Zealand Press. The same will apply to India, the British newspapers, the Canadian newspapers, and so on.</P>
    <P>I do not see any insuperable difficulties, and I speak with a certain practical experience of these matters.  I am quite prepared to be ready to change as we go along.  Many changes may be found necessary before this news agency works ideally from our point of view.</P>
    <P>I am sorry Deputy de Valera is not here.  I am sure if he were here he would remember many of the difficulties he had at various times in relation to the publication of false and misleading reports in the Press abroad concerning Ireland.  Many times Deputy de Valera himself was foully slandered in the Press abroad, usually in reports emanating from London.  During the war there was, and even yet there is, in many parts of the United States and in many parts of the world, a belief that the Japanese here had a legation consisting of several hundreds; that the German legation here was a centre for spying, with a huge staff and wireless stations.  Despite every effort that was made by Deputy de Valera and by our Legation in the United States, and despite letters written by the Minister in the United States to newspapers, no denial of these stories was ever published. Likewise, I have seen reports published in foreign papers, possibly based on some speeches made by Deputy MacEntee, suggesting that this Government was a Communist Government. We can laugh at this here.  It is a joke to us here.  It is not a joke to somebody reading it in Canada or in some portion of the world where they know little or nothing about Irish Parliaments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, the people of the world do not know Deputy MacEntee as well as we know him.  Another instance of the same kind of thing, if instance be needed, can be got from the last Six-County elections in Belfast.  Deputies will remember that a number of meetings held by Labour candidates were broken up by English Communists and in some cases razor blades and other things of that description were hurled at speakers.  Believe it or not, it was represented throughout the Press of the world for one day that these were Unionist meetings broken up by wild Nationalists.  Those reports circulated in the Press of the world.  We caught up with them and we tried to get them to deny it.  We succeeded in some instances, but once a lie is published the damage is done, and people usually do not see the contradiction that appears afterwards.  Those are concrete instances of the kind of thing with which we have to deal.</P>
      <P>Now, as to the type of news, I agree entirely with every Deputy who said that it should be non-political from the point of view of our own internal Party politics.  I agree entirely, and, in so far as I can exercise any influence on the development of this news agency, I will exercise it so as to ensure that it will represent the point of view of Ireland, irrespective of Party politics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one thing I want to make clear in that connection and, when I am making it clear, I do not want any Deputies on the opposite benches to take it that I am detracting from the statements I have just made.  I want to make it quite clear that it is inevitable that in any publicity, inside or outside the country, statements made by the Taoiseach or by myself, as Minister for External Affairs, are bound to get more publicity than other statements, and statements made by the Government, representing Government policy on various questions, be it Partition or external relations generally, are bound to get pre-eminence of place in the matter of news distribution. That happened with the last Government and it continues to happen with <Col N="844" /> this Government and it is a matter which cannot be escaped.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera, in effect, said that he agreed with the proposal, but that he thought it was unworkable.  He said he certainly agreed that there should not be any distribution of what I termed &ldquo;hot news&rdquo;.  I believe I should explain in a little more detail the type of news I visualise as emanating from the news agency.  I visualise sending out the kind of news and information that is not normally covered by existing news agencies.  We have here, for instance, fairly frequently, especially in recent years, cultural congresses of one kind or another and scientific congresses of one kind or another.  All these things have a certain news value. We have passing through the country vast numbers of people of political and cultural importance all over the world. We are not exploiting these.  Photographs of Ireland are seldom published in papers abroad.  Take up any American newspaper, running into 48 or 60 pages.  Go through it and you will find in that paper photographs of certain European countries appearing regularly therein, purely and simply because they are supplied by the news agencies in these countries.  Switzerland is an outstanding example of that.  In any big American newspaper on any day you will see at least one photograph of Switzerland officially supplied by Switzerland.  These are not photographs of news events.  These are usually photographs of scenery, or something like that.  A paper that publishes 50 pages every day, running into 20 editions per day, takes a lot of filling.</P>
    <P>Apart from Deputy de Valera saying that he did not think this was workable, he agreed with the idea generally. I think I indicated to the House in my opening speech that on a number of occasions in the past I had discussions with the last Government and I put forward a suggestion to that Government in relation to the setting up of such a news agency both prior to the war and after the war.  I always felt that Deputy de Valera and the last Government were in complete agreement with the idea of forming such a news agency for the purpose of disseminating <Col N="845" /> Irish news abroad.  The last letter I have in relation to the matter is dated 30th November, 1945. That letter says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the present state of politics it is obvious that, no matter how right the intentions of the Government are, there will be those who will denounce everything they do. The help given to any Irish news agency would be so misrepresented publicly as to kill all hope of the agency ever succeeding.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the view of the last Government in November, 1945.</P>

      <P>&ldquo; Dear Sean,</P>
      <P>I agree with most of your letter. The fundamental difficulty is this: the expenditure of public moneys must come before the Dáil.  In the present state of politics it is obvious that, no matter how right the intentions of the Government are, there will be those who will denounce everything they do.  The help given to any Irish agency would be so misrepresented publicly as to kill all hope of the agency ever succeding. It is for that reason that another course must be taken.  The agencies abroad to which you refer were helped either without public debate or at the time when the state of politics in the particular countries left the Government free to do a good, national act without it being made into a crime.  If you think of any real way around this difficulty be sure it will have attention.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding £138,760 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1950, for the Salaries and <Col N="850" /> Expenses of the Office of the Minister for External Affairs, and of certain Services administered by that Office (No. 16 of 1924), including a Grant-in-Aid.</P>
    <P>I should like again this year, at the outset of this debate, to urge that, in relation to our external affairs, we should develop, as far as possible, a non-Party approach.  Fundamentally, there is no difference of policy between the Parties in the House in relation to our external policy.  My function, therefore, is to give effect to the best of my ability, to the general policy upon which the Government and all Parties in the House are agreed.  In doing so, I shall always welcome suggestions from Deputies as to the best means of achieving this purpose.  Likewise, I shall always be prepared to give the Leader of the Opposition any information which he may wish to have; or to discuss with him any aspect of the work of my Department he may wish to discuss.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of the Department of External Affairs, this year has been one of tremendous importance in many fields.  Events of paramount importance have occurred in the course of the year, both in our relationship with Britain and in the international field generally; the passage of the Republic of Ireland Act, the Atlantic Pact; the passage of the Ireland Act in the British Parliament; the launching of the Council of Europe; the increasing importance of the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation; the making of trade agreements and the development of cultural relations.  These were all events that cast tremendous work and responsibility on our small Department of External Affairs.</P>
    <P>Before proceeding further, I should like to pay special tribute to the staff of the Department for the manner in which they responded to the extra calls which are being constantly made upon them by the pressure of events and by the resulting additional burdens.  They work with untiring energy and are always prepared to sacrifice their own time in order to carry out the additional burdens that have fallen on the <Col N="851" /> Department.  Indeed, for many officers of the Department it has become routine matter to have to work until the late hours of the night, as well as during week-ends.  I cannot praise their self-sacrificing enthusiasm and devotion to their work too highly; many times I have been reminded of the spirit and enthusiasm that prevailed in the national movement.  It is, of course, this type of spirit that should prevail in a small foreign service such as ours at times of crisis. In present circumstances I see no hope of the work of the Department becoming lighter.  On the contrary, if we are to perform our functions effectively in regard to the Council of Europe, the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation and Partition, as well as the many other functions which fall on the Department, the work is bound to increase.  In these circumstances, additional staffs are essential.</P>
    <P>In the midst of all the work that has had to be performed by the Department in the course of the year, I have been very thankful indeed that the Russian veto on our admission to the United Nations Organisation has been maintained.  Frankly, the prospect of having to provide representatives at another international body such as the United Nations Organisation and to have to attend yet another series of international conferences, was frightening in existing circumstances.</P>
    <P>I need hardly refer in any detail to the events leading up to the passing of the Republic of Ireland Act.  The House is already fully informed on all these matters.  This period was a crucial one from the point of view of the Department, as many steps had to be taken, very often in a non-spectacular way, in order to ensure that on and from the 18th April last the Republic of Ireland would be internationally recognised.  As the House learnt, official recognition was accorded, and in every case messages of recognition and welcome to the Republic of Ireland were received.</P>
    <P>Arising from the passage of the Republic of Ireland Act, a number of matters still remain to be dealt with <Col N="852" /> concerning the exchange of citizenship rights.  In particular, in the case of South Africa and India, special agreements concerning the exchange of citizenship rights still remain to be concluded.  I hope in the near future that we may have an opportunity of opening discussions concerning these questions.</P>
    <P>Since the passage of the Republic of Ireland Act, a number of countries have expressed their desire to extend diplomatic representation to Ireland. In particular, the Government of India propose to open an embassy in Dublin. Discussions are also proceeding concerning the opening of diplomatic or consular missions here by Norway and Egypt.</P>
    <P>I do not think that it is necessary on this Estimate to deal with our attitude to the Atlantic Pact and to the Ireland Act which was passed by the British Parliament.  The Government's attitude on these matters has already been made clear to the House on other occasions. To a certain extent, the introduction of the Ireland Bill in the British House of Commons exactly one month after the signature of the Atlantic Pact emphasised the wisdom of the Government's decision in declining to adhere to the Atlantic Pact without a clarification of the attitude of the other nations concerned regarding the territorial integrity of Ireland. As the House knows, the Atlantic Pact was intended to guarantee the territorial integrity and political independence of the participating nations.  It is, I think, of some significance that within one month of the signature of the Atlantic Pact, Britain should have, unnecessarily and without justification, introduced a statute in its Parliament reasserting her claim to a portion of our territory.</P>
    <P>In our view, and I think I can say that I am speaking for every member of this House, the essence of democratic rule lies in the right of the people of a nation to determine democratically by their free votes, their form of Government and their internal affairs, without outside interference.  It was the infringement of this rule which was largely responsible for the last war and which is now responsible for much of <Col N="853" /> the tension existing in Europe to-day. Interference in the affairs of another nation, whether it be by Germany, Russia, or Britain, is destructive of the basis upon which democratic Government rests and can only lead to friction.</P>
    <P>Our sole claim is that the Irish people should be allowed to determine their own affairs democratically and of their own free will, without interference by Britain.  The fact that Britain succeeded, over 25 years ago, in retaining a corner of our island and that she has since occupied it, in no way entitled her to divide the historic Irish nation and to pretend that our island now consists of two separate nations.</P>
    <P>British propaganda often seeks to justify Britain's attitude on the ground that Britain is merely protecting a minority.  This, of course, does not bear examination.  In the first place, in an area approximating four of the six counties which have been cut away from us, there is a majority in favour of unity with the rest of Ireland; the nationalist population in these areas is coerced, undemocratically and against its will, to remain separated from the rest of Ireland.</P>
    <P>We have no wish or desire to in any way penalise or interfere with the civil or religious liberties of those who in the north-east corner choose to describe themselves as the &ldquo;British King's men&rdquo;.  On the contrary, as has been repeatedly stated, we are quite prepared to afford them any constitutional guarantees that may be reasonably required to allay any fears, real or imaginary, that they may have.  We cannot, however, accept the claim of a small minority supported by Britain, to divide our nation in defiance of the express will of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>The continuance of Partition and of Britain's support of it is a constant indictment of democratic rule in this part of the world.  We urged that this was a matter which should be discussed between Ireland and the nations participating in the Atlantic Pact.  We felt that, if the concept of co-operation and democracy was to be given any reality, one of the first essentials was to remove from the midst of Western Europe this dangerous undemocratic anomaly.  The first <Col N="854" /> essential of co-operation is obviously the removal of causes of dissension. We regret that, no doubt through Britain's influence, our suggestion even to discuss these matters was not accepted.</P>
    <P>I have noticed in the papers recently reports to the effect that the State Department of the United States in Washington had stated that American policy would not allow President Truman to intervene between Ireland and Britain in order to secure the ending of Partition.  I am fully aware that that has always been the attitude of the State Department; indeed, it is a matter about which I cannot complain, as the question of American policy is essentially one to be decided by the American people.  I cannot help, however, regretting that the leading democratic republic in the world to-day should not at least take an interest in and assist in ending a situation which, in addition to being undemocratic, is dangerous and damaging to the unity which should exist in the democratic world.</P>
    <P>While I know that the United States Administration did not intentionally desire to do so, its attitude of indifference in the matter has been and is being construed by the British Government as a definite encouragement for Britain's interference in our affairs and for the continued denial of the right to self-determination by the Irish people.  That is evidenced by the fact that before the ink on the Atlantic Pact was dry, the British Government felt at complete liberty to reassert by statute its claim to interfere with the territorial integrity of Ireland.  It is even being suggested now that the United States have, under the provisions of the Atlantic Pact, undertaken to defend Britain's invasion of our territorial integrity. In these circumstances, it would not seem unreasonable that the United States should at least offer its services for the purpose of bringing about a discussion and an ultimate solution of this question.</P>
    <P>Partition is the sole remaining issue between Ireland and our neighbouring isle.  Its solution would end the century-old <Col N="855" /> struggle that the Irish people have waged for liberty and self-determination. It is obvious that, by bringing about a solution of this question, the United States would render a service, not merely to Ireland and Britain, but to the democratic world.</P>
    <P>It does seem extraordinary that in this era there should be a reluctance even to discuss grave problems that mar the enthusiasm and unity of the democratic peoples.  I know that we are but a small nation and that Britain is a powerful one, but I cannot believe that that consideration alone should stand in the way of a democratic solution.</P>
    <P>One of our most important tasks in relation to Partition and to Britain's interference in our affairs is to make our point of view known in America, in Australia, in New Zealand, in Europe and in Britain itself.  I have no doubt that if the issues involved were clearly explained to world opinion and particularly to those who help to form world opinion, this denial of democratic rule could not survive.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, we have suffered from a wall of silence and often, indeed, from misrepresentation concerning Partition and matters which so frequently marred Anglo-Irish relationship in the past.  As we are not and can never be &mdash;at least in any foreseeable future&mdash; stronger militarily or economically than Britain, our only weapon in present circumstances is world opinion.  A portion of work in relation to Partition falls, naturally, on the Department of External Affairs, and for this reason, as well as because of the growing volume of work in the other spheres of the Department, it has been found necessary to increase the staff, both in the Department itself and in some of our posts abroad, particularly in the United States.</P>
    <P>An indication of the inadequacy of the provisions we are able to make can be obtained by the comparison of the expenditure by Britain on her foreign representation and public relations services overseas.  This year sums amounting to nearly £26,000,000 have been allocated for this purpose <Col N="856" /> in Britain.  I know that Britain's expenditure is not comparable because of the disparity in size and population, but the comparison of our expenditure on external affairs with that of comparable countries such as Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Switzerland, South Africa and New Zealand shows that our expenditure is much lower, very much lower indeed, both in relation to Government expenditure as a whole and to the national income of these countries.</P>
    <P>One of my main staffing difficulties has been due to the lack of recruitment in the past.  We have taken into the Department a number of new young third secretaries in the course of the year, and a further examination is to be held shortly for some additional third secretaries.  Unfortunately, because of pressing staffing needs, many of them will have to be assigned to duties without having gained the experience which I would have liked them to have gained in different divisions of the Department.  We are trying to make up for this lack of experience by arranging a series of lectures in the Department.</P>
    <P>The main Estimate for External Affairs for the year 1949-50 shows an increase of expenditure of £20,225 on last year.  Apart from increases in Civil Service remuneration, the additional expenditure arises almost entirely on three heads.  In the first place, a full year's provision is now made for certain posts (in the European Recovery Programme section and at The Hague) for which only partial provision was made in last year's Vote.  In the second place, provision is made for the creation of certain new posts at home and abroad and for the filling of vacancies in existing posts.  Finally, there are the normal salary increments and minor increases in allowances abroad to meet higher living costs. These three heads between them account for over £16,500 of the increase in the Vote.</P>
    <P>In addition to the main Estimate, I am also asking the Dáil to approve a supplementary provision covering an expenditure of £53,800.  This Supplementary Vote provides for the making <Col N="857" /> of Grant-in-Aid advances up to a total of £25,000 to the proposed Irish News Agency.  The rest of the expenditure is required to cover certain important additions which I propose to make to the staff of the Department, as well as to the staffs of the legation and the consulates in the United States and the High Commissioner's Office in London.</P>
    <P>Taking the main Estimate and the Supplementary Estimate together, I am asking the Dáil to provide for an expenditure on external affairs higher by £74,025 than that provided last year.  I should say quite frankly that I do not feel called upon to make any apology for this increase.  We cannot expect to make political headway abroad and attain our national aims unless we are prepared to tackle the task of putting our point of view across much more actively and vigorously than we have done in the past.  I hope that the Irish News Agency will prove an effective and valuable instrument for this purpose. But our official missions abroad have also a useful and important role to play.</P>
    <P>Nowadays there are very few diplomatic missions which have not a Press attaché or an information officer or a member of the diplomatic staff specially detailed to deal with Press and public relations.  Some countries, in addition to providing special officials for this purpose at their embassies and legations, maintain elaborate information services in foreign countries for the same purpose of making their policies and points of view better known.  When I came into the Department of External Affairs I found that this country, which has an important national objective to achieve and requires for its successful attainment all the sympathy and moral support that it can rally throughout the world, had none of these things.  We had not as much as one Press attaché, one information officer or one public relations officer abroad.</P>
    <P>Some of our most important missions abroad were so understaffed that their members were unable to get away from their desks to maintain essential contacts <Col N="858" /> with the outside world.  The headquarters of the Department itself was in the same position.  The staff were overwhelmed with the mass of work arising in the ordinary course of Departmental duties, and there was little or no provision for the steady systematic work which must be done if our major objectives in the political field are to be achieved.</P>
    <P>In this connection I was interested recently to read in the current report of the Canadian Department of External Affairs several references emphasising the functions of diplomatic missions in regard to public relations. Indeed, I could do no better than to quote from this very excellent report to give to the House an indication of some of the work which I hope that our Department will be able to undertake in the near future.  I am quoting from the current report of the Canadian Department of External Affairs:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The main responsibilities of diplomatic missions abroad are to inform the Government of events in the country in which they are situated and to interpret their significance; to safeguard Canadian interests; to conduct negotiations with the Governments to which they are accredited; to assist in spreading accurate information about Canada; and to represent the Government of Canada formally and informally on all occasions....</P>
    <P>Information about Canada distributed from Ottawa is effective only if it is brought before the people in other countries for whom it is intended. In large missions, the information officer, and in small missions the head of mission and diplomatic secretaries, must maintain constant liaison with the agencies of Press, radio and film.  They must be ready to answer any demands for information about Canada and, when necessary, must try to stimulate such demands.</P>
    <P>Foreign affairs to-day are not the exclusive preserve of Government, but are of direct and vital public concern.  The provision of public <Col N="859" /> information about Canada to other countries is therefore an integral part of the conduct of Canada's foreign relations.  There is a similar need to provide information within Canada on Canadain policy in international affairs.</P>
    <P>Through the Information Division, the Department facilitates the flow of information about Canada to other countries.  To assist diplomatic, consular and trade officers abroad in meeting the needs of the Press and public, daily, weekly and monthly bulletins and other special publications are compiled and distributed. Photographs and graphic material are supplied for Press, display and educational use.  The Department also has a reference service to deal with inquiries of a general nature from abroad, and is responsible for certain aspects of educational and cultural relations with other countries. Information services are provided for important international conferences, and close liaison is maintained with other public information services of the Government in relation to information abroad.</P>
    <P>News about Canada is disseminated abroad through the Canadian diplomatic missions.  This is of particular importance in the world news centres of New York, Washington, London and Paris, and occupies a considerable part of the time of information officers at these posts.  Press releases are issued by all missions on Canadian subjects of special interest to the countries concerned, and arrangements are made for Press, photographic and film coverage of national events.  The Department and missions abroad also make arrangements to facilitate tours of Canada by prominent foreign journalists. Such arrangements include advice on itineraries, distribution of documentary and illustrative material, and assistance to the visitors in making contacts with Government officials and private individuals.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have quoted this to indicate the scope of the work which the information section, which is about to be set up in <Col N="860" /> the Department of External Affairs here, will have to cover.</P>
    <P>I have now drawn up a scheme of staff reorganisation designed to restore these deficiencies.  I propose, in the first place, to create a third post of assistant secretary at the headquarters of the Department, and to add to the four existing divisions, concerned with economic and commercial affairs, European Recovery Programme, consular matters, and general administration and protocol respectively, two entirely new divisions&mdash;one to take charge of political questions&mdash;to be known as the political division&mdash;and the other to take charge of information and publicity&mdash;to be known as the information division.  As regards our diplomatic and consular representation in the United States, I am proposing to make substantial additions to the staff of the legation in Washington. In addition to staff required to deal with European Recovery Programme work, which has grown to considerable proportions, I propose to add to the legation a new post of counsellor, with a third secretary to assist him, to deal exclusively with public relations work.  The Supplementary Vote also provides for the creation of a new post of public relations officer at the Consulate-General at New York, and for the appointment of vice-consuls at the consulates at Boston, Chicago and San Francisco, where the existing pressure leaves the consuls in present circumstances with no time for anything except office work.  As regards London, provision is also made for a new post of counsellor rank, the occupant of which will be concerned exclusively with public relations work and will have a third secretary to assist him.</P>
    <P>As I said, I do not feel called upon to apologise for these staff arrangements. To my mind, they are greatly overdue.  We are only doing what other countries have done years ago. Nor, I think, can the proposals be criticised on the ground of economy, for the falsest economy in the world is to establish an official machinery and then to fail to get value out of it by starving it of the funds required for its full and effective functioning. <Col N="861" /> That is, I am afraid, what we have been doing in the past.</P>
    <P>In introducing this Estimate last year, I pointed out that our expenditure on the Department of External Affairs represented less than one-third of 1 per cent. of our public expenditure, and that it has been less than the expenditure incurred by some great Powers on one individual mission. I think that the total cost of our Department of External Affairs is certainly much less than the cost, say, of the British Embassy in most of the big capitals.  In my view, it was the paucity of our expenditure on representation abroad rather than on its size which called for explanation or defence.  I feel that that position still holds good, even with the increase which I am now proposing.</P>
    <P>I should add, of course, that, in addition to the work to which I have so far referred in my statement, a tremendous amount of additional work has been cast on the Department in the course of the last year or a year and a half on account of the Economic Co-operation Organisation, and that the Department had to handle a considerable volume of work which it had, not to handle heretofore and which, of course, overburdened the existing staff in the Department.</P>
    <P>As the House will have learned, the establishment of the Advisory Committee on Cultural Relations at the end of January last has filled a void in our relations with other countries.  Practically every country has various official bodies whose function it is to make known to other countries the cultural life of its own country.  We have suffered in the past from not having any such body.  I should like to take this opportunity of expressing my deep appreciation to Mr. Justice Gavan Duffy, who is the chairman of the Advisory Committee on Cultural Relations, and to each of the members of the advisory committee, for their public spirited work on this committee. This voluntary committee has worked untiringly in the discharge of its functions and has been of very considerable assistance to me.</P>
    <P>It is a new experiment in the administration <Col N="862" /> of Departmental work, but one that has worked very successfully.  I feel that in many other spheres, Government Departments might well avail of the voluntary services and advice of public spirited citizens with a specialised knowledge.  The advisory committee has not merely tendered advice, it has also undertaken actual work.</P>
    <P>Expenditure out of the Grant-in-Aid for 1948-49 totalled £2,600.  This included an advance subscription (roughly £1,790) for 20 copies of the reproduction of the <i>Book of Kells</i> which is being prepared by an eminent firm of Swiss publishers; a grant of £250 to the Gaelic League of London towards the expenses of installation of new premises; a grant of £300 towards the publishing expenses of the <i>Review on Celtic Studies</i> published in Paris and edited by Professor Vendryes; and some preliminary expenditure on photographs which are being selected by the committee for exhibition abroad and for general publicity purposes.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that this photographic exhibition, containing a general survey of present-day Ireland, should be sent to the U.S.A. in the autumn for display in the principal Irish centres.  The committee is also working on a scheme for the issue of a series of pamphlets on Irish cultural activities, beginning with one on the theatre by Michael MacLiammóir.  Professor Denis Gwynn has agreed to act as general editor of this series of pamphlets.  It is hoped that it will be possible to publish French and Spanish, as well as English editions of these pamphlets.  A book on Ireland for schoolchildren in the U.S.A. and Commonwealth countries is also being planned.  Another long-term scheme is the building up of a library of short documentary films on Irish life and activity.  Arrangements for the production of one such film are at present under consideration.</P>
    <P>Other schemes in hand include arrangements for Irish participation in the International Folk Music Festival to be held in Venice next September: the encouragement of the production of better gramophone records of traditional Irish music; the donation of books to foreign libraries; and the issue by the committee of monthly <Col N="863" /> notes on cultural activities in Ireland, for distribution to Irish societies and other appropriate organisations abroad.</P>
    <P>A grant was also made to the Royal Society of Antiquaries this year to enable it to invite distinguished scholars in other countries to its centenary celebrations, which have been held, and a grant is also being made for the purpose of organising a summer school for foreign students coming to Ireland.</P>
    <P>That is a summary of the principal activities of the Cultural Relations Committee.  From the experience I have gained of their work, I am satisfied that they are fulfilling a useful function.</P>
    <P>There are so many matters of practical concern to be dealt with on this Vote that I cannot prolong my remarks by attempting to deal with political developments taking place in the world to-day, unless they affect us in a special way.  There is one development, however, to which I must refer, and that is what appears to be a concerted attack on religion generally in the Communist-dominated States of Central Europe.  As the House knows, many Church dignitaries have been subjected to what can only be described as persecution, in both Hungary and Czechoslovakia.  The campaign against the Churches has not been limited to an attack on the Catholic Church but, of course, the Catholic Church has been the principal victim of this persecution.</P>
    <P>The House is already aware of the steps which were taken by me in relation to the arrest and imprisonment of His Eminence Cardinal Mindszenty. The refusal of the Hungarian Government to allow any representative of the Irish Government to have access to the Cardinal was, in itself, proof, if further proof were required, of the methods which were being used in relation to the arrest and trial of Church dignitaries.</P>
    <P>The refusal of our request can only have been dictated by a desire to conceal the circumstances surrounding the arrest and trial of the Cardinal.</P>
    <P>I feel that, in voicing our abhorrence of this religious persecution, I am <Col N="864" /> expressing the views of every member of the House.  In addition to the fact that we are a predominantly Catholic nation, our whole history has been one of struggle for the achievement of civil and religious liberty.  Civil liberty and religious freedom are the essential pillars of democratic rule.  No nation, therefore, has a greater right to make its voice heard in this matter than Ireland.</P>
    <P>There is another development to which I feel I should refer, because although it is taking place on the other side of the world and may appear to many people of no direct interest to this country, it does concern us in a very special way and creates anxieties and problems for my Department.  I refer to what is taking place in China and in the Far East generally.</P>
    <P>As most Deputies probably already know, the Far East is a great field of Irish missionary endeavour.  Not only in China, but in Korea, Hong Kong, Burma, Malaya and other parts of the Far East, there are hundreds of Irish priests and nuns carrying on the work of spreading the gospel for which the people of this country have, from the earliest times, had such a strong vocation.  The spread of Communist influence throughout the Far East is a most grave development from the point of view of these Irish missions. It is not merely that from the point of view of the conduct of their churches and schools and the freedom of movement they require for their work, the future is becoming increasingly uncertain. We know that, from the point of view of the missionaries themselves, this must be the most grievous prospect. There is also the fact, however, that, having regard to what has happened elsewhere, the personal hazards which missionary work must always involve, to some extent at least, must be greatly increased.</P>
    <P>Anything that my Department can usefully do to help in this situation will be done at once.  I am at present considering the possibility of appointing consular representatives, at least on an honorary basis, at one or two points in the Far East with a view to bringing the usual passport and consular facilities <Col N="865" /> within closer reach of our citizens in the Far Eastern zone.  I am only too ready to consider any other form of official action which would be likely to prove of advantage.  I know, however, that what will always come first with those who have devoted their lives to this work will be, not their own personal safety, but the possibility of continuing the work of their missions as long as it is possible for them to do so. We can only hope that the danger which now seems to threaten them will not materialise and that the prognostications of those who expect that it will still be possible to carry on the missions satisfactorily under the new circumstances may prove well founded.</P>
    <P>There is one other political development also far away&mdash;this time, in the Middle East&mdash;to which I would like also to refer.</P>
    <P>On the 15th June last Deputy Cogan asked me a question about our attitude on the question of the protection of the Holy Places in Palestine.  I told him in reply that I had had the matter under constant consideration for a considerable time but that I was not in a position then to make any detailed statement about it.  I informed him, however, that the Irish Government strongly support the demand which has now been voiced so clearly and widely throughout the Christian world that the Holy Places in Palestine should be suitably protected, that free access should be ensured for all religions and that, with a view to guaranteeing the attainment of these aims, the whole area of Jerusalem should be placed under international control.</P>
    <P>I doubt whether I can add much to that statement at the moment, beyond stating that we are consulting other like-minded States which, like ourselves, are not members of the United Nations, on the question whether there is any action which we can usefully take to support and advance the demand for the protection of the Holy Places which has already been made within the framework of the United Nations Organisation.</P>
    <P>As Deputies already know, the General Assembly of the United Nations passed a resolution on the 11th <Col N="866" /> December last setting up a conciliation commission consisting of representatives of the United States, France and Turkey to make detailed proposals for a permanent international régime in the area concerned, including recommendations concerning the Holy Places. The commission were asked to request the political authorities in the area to give appropriate formal guarantees as to the protection of the Holy Places and freedom of access to them and to present these undertakings to the General Assembly of the United Nations for approval.  The commission is due to report to the General Assembly at its next session in September. The conciliation commission is still negotiating with the Arab and Israeli authorities so that, so far as the United Nations Organisation is concerned, the whole problem is for the moment <i>sub judice.</i></P>
    <P>Before the Government accorded <i>de facto</i> recognition to the State of Israel last February, I asked our representatives both in London and Washington to approach the diplomatic representatives of Israel in those capitals and to acquaint them with the degree of concern felt by the Irish Government as to the future of the Holy Places.  The replies of the Israeli representatives in both places were reassuring and justified the hope that, when final details of the peace in Palestine came to be settled, the Government of Israel would agree to the putting of the Holy Places under an international régime affording the guarantee to which Christian feeling throughout the world attaches so much importance.  I feel that I may properly take advantage of this occasion to make a special appeal to the Government of Israel on this matter.</P>
    <P>We know how cruelly and unjustly the Jewish people have suffered from intolerance and persecution throughout the centuries.  I, personally, am glad that the pages of our history have never been stained with anything of the kind.  On the contrary, I think we can claim that our common suffering from persecution and certain similarities in the history of the two races create a special bond of sympathy and understanding between the Irish and <Col N="867" /> Jewish peoples.  Speaking from that point of view, I venture to make a special appeal to the Government of Israel to meet the just claims of the Christian world for an international régime guaranteeing the safety of the Holy Places and freedom of access to them.  I make this appeal in the certain feeling that an act of generous statesmanship by the Israeli Government in this matter will do more than anything else could to bridge the gulf between Christian and Jew which has been responsible throughout the ages for so much hatred and suffering and which we in Ireland can, I think, justly claim to have been more successful in closing than most other Christian countries.</P>
    <P>In conjunction with the other economic Departments concerned, a special effort has been made in my Department during the year to expand the outlets for Irish exports abroad by means of trade arrangements and agreements with a foreign countries. Having regard to our participation in the European Recovery Programme, this effort has been particularly directed towards the expansion of our trade with the other participating countries in Western Europe.  The results have been encouraging, and justify the hope that, given the necessary effort and enterprise on the part of Irish exporters, outlets can be developed and maintained which should be of great value, especially to our expanding industries.</P>
    <P>In addition to the trade agreement with Great Britain signed last July, which has already been discussed in detail by the Dáil, we concluded a trade agreement with France last June and another with the Netherlands in September.  Both agreements provided for the supply of certain essential commodities to this country, and for the admission into the countries concerned of specified quantities of Irish industrial and other products.  In addition to these two agreements, we had trade discussions with Sweden, Italy, Spain, Belgium, Western Germany and other countries in Western Europe&mdash;all with the same purpose of ensuring supplies essential to our economy at the best obtainable <Col N="868" /> prices and of developing outlets for our own goods abroad, particularly the products of our manufacturing industries.</P>
    <P>The trade discussions with Sweden resulted in an agreement which was signed about three weeks ago.  A new agreement was also entered into with France last week.  I hope that an agreement with Western Germany will be signed in the very near future. Although our discussions with some of the other countries I have mentioned did not&mdash;and, indeed, were not expected to&mdash;result in formal trade agreements, it was possible to make with some of them informal arrangements designed to expand our trade exchanges on a mutually satisfactory basis.</P>
    <P>The statistics of our exports to Western Europe reflect the results of these negotiations and agreements. Taking the figures in round thousands, our exports to the Netherlands, which were valued at £26,000 in the first five months of 1939 and £309 in the first five months of 1948, rose to £494,000 in the first five months of this year.  Our exports to France, valued at £8,000 in 1939 and valued at £63,000 in 1948, respectively for the first five months, rose to £85,000 in the first five months of this year.  Sweden and Italy furnish further examples.  Our exports to Sweden, which were only £8,000 in 1939 and £31,000 in the first five months of last year, exceeded £87,000 in the first five months of this year.  The corresponding figures for Italy are: £5,000 in 1939, £11,000 last year and £74,000 in 1949 for the first five months.  The figures for Spain are £4,000 in 1939, £36,000 in 1948 and £67,000 this year; and for Belgium £27,000 in 1939, £361,000 last year and £387,000 in 1949 for the five-month period in each case.</P>
    <P>In other words, the general picture of our trade with the other Western European countries participating in the European Recovery Programme is one of development and expansion. Merely taking the six countries for which I have given specific figures, the expansion during the last year represents a new market of roughly £400,000 for a five-month period, or £1,000,000 in the year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="869" /> No doubt, some of these additional exports consisted of cattle and other agricultural products for which we have normally no difficulty in finding a market.  But they also included substantial quantities of textiles, plasterboard, industrial abrasives, smoked fish, and many other manufactured and mineral products.  The importance of the facilities so gained was that they enabled these products for the first time to enter and gain a footing in markets which had hitherto been closed to them.</P>
    <P>I am glad that Irish exporters have already been able to take as much advantage as they have of the new opportunities secured for them in this way.  But, of course, the value of these openings must ultimately depend on the Irish exporters themselves.  The supply of Irish goods available for export is increasing in range and quantity. I realise that this imposes a responsibility on my Department and the other Departments concerned to ensure that our exporters are not denied the outlets abroad to which they are fairly and justly entitled by the operation of official restrictions.  But for the rest the country must depend on the effort and enterprise of the exporters themselves. Given that effort and given that spirit of enterprise, I am confident, on the basis of the experience we have already gained, that, by careful study of the requirements of foreign markets, by close attention to costs and quality, and by business-like methods in dealing with foreign customers, we can ensure the continuance of the tendency which has already established itself in our export trade and consolidate our position in these new foreign markets to the advantage of our whole economy.</P>
    <P>As I have already indicated, the work related to European Economic Co-operation has cast a very heavy burden on the Department.  The work under this heading falls under three main heads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Economic Co-operation in Europe generally&mdash;These involve, in the main, the subject matter of the discussions which take place at meetings of the Ministerial Council of the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation, on which I represent Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="870" /> We have played a fairly active part on this council and have, throughout, urged that the function of the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation should be to plan production and distribution in Europe so as to avoid many of the economic conflicts which have disrupted European economy.  Largely because we are a small country with no axe to grind in the economic field, and with an independent viewpoint, we have been able to be of some service both to the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation and to the concept of economic co-operation.  Very often it has been my lot to be critical of the lack of progress made on the broader issues of policy.  I have felt throughout that the tendency was to concentrate on the division of American aid and that it overshadowed the real problems which should be examined.  Events have, I think, justified the fears which we have so frequently made, publicly and privately, at council meetings.</P>
    <P>The second division of this deals with the division of aid and programme. Our economy was not organised for this type of work and it has entailed a heavy burden on the economic Departments and on my Department.  Forecasts and projections of our imports and of our economic position have had to be made systematically.  Quite apart from the debt of gratitude which we owe to the United States for their co-operation and generous aid, we should be grateful also to them for the mere fact that this economic survey and planning has had to be undertaken. I think that it has made all the Government Departments and the public more conscious of our economic problems.  The work in the economic division of my Department has been extremely heavy and I cannot praise too highly the officials who have had to labour untiringly in order to keep pace with the duties cast upon us by the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation.</P>
    <P>The third portion of the work relating to economic aid in Europe consists of the realisation of targets.  The <Col N="871" /> task of giving effect to the various targets we have set for ourselves falls, of course, principally on the Departments of Agriculture, Industry and Commerce and Finance.  We are merely the channel through which the programmes are centralised and co-ordinated.</P>
    <P>A detailed statements of our activities in connection with the European Recovery Programme from the 1st April to the end of December, 1948, is contained in the first two progress reports to the Economic Co-operation Administration which are being published in the form of a White Paper, and copies of which are being laid before the Dáil and placed in the Dáil and Seanad Libraries.  Our activities for the first quarter of the current calendar year are fully described in the third report to the Economic Co-operation Administration, which is likewise being printed and will also be presented to the Dáil and placed in the Libraries of Leinster House.</P>
    <P>In common with all other participating countries, Ireland submitted to the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation last November a long-term programme covering the period 1949-1953.  This document was published in the form of a White Paper, which was presented to both Houses of the Oireachtas in December.  Its main features and the main conditions necessary for its implementation are set out in the foreword to the published text. Our principal contribution to European recovery is to be made in the field of agriculture.  The importance of this contribution is shown by the fact that, on the one hand, agricultural production in the participating countries has been lagging by comparison with industrial production and, on the other, approximately 37 per cent. of the total import expenditure of all participating countries in the year 1948-49 is on agricultural produce alone (i.e., food and feeding stuffs).  Production of the most important agricultural products during the current year is much lower than in pre-war years, with the exception of a few items such as potatoes, sugar and fish.  It is calculated, however, that even in three years' time, production of most agricultural products in <Col N="872" /> the participating countries will not be sufficient to meet more than the prewar scale of demand (having regard to the increase in population) whereas, if the present level of prosperity is maintained, the effective demand is likely to be considerably higher.  Indeed, approximately 40 per cent. of estimated imports by participating countries from all sources in 1952-53 is represented by food and feeding stuffs; and almost one-half of this percentage (approximately £600,000,000 worth) is estimated to be dollar expenditure.  Consequently, the more agricultural products Ireland can produce and export to participating countries, the greater will be her contribution to the European Recovery Programme.</P>
    <P>I have not dealt with the major world problems in so far as they affect the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation, as I think that, if necessary, this will be more appropriately dealt with separately on the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation Vote.</P>
    <P>At the risk of extending these introductory remarks unduly, I have to refer briefly to some aspects of the Department's administrative work during the year.</P>
    <P>The number of passports issued during the financial year 1948-49 was 15,325, as compared with 14,643 in the previous 12 months.  The increase reflects a tendency towards increased travel to the Continent for holiday and other purposes.</P>
    <P>Freedom of movement between the countries of Western Europe is, of course, not only an objective but an obligation of the countries participating in the European Recovery Programme, who undertook&mdash;in article 8 of the convention signed in Paris last year&mdash;to &ldquo;co-operate in the progressive reduction of obstacles to the free movement of persons&rdquo;.  Our practice and policy as regards passports and visa requirements has been determined in the light of our obligations under this article. When I introduced this Estimate last year, we had already concluded reciprocal agreements for the abolition of visas with eight countries of Western Europe &mdash;Belgium, Denmark, France, Luxemburg, <Col N="873" /> the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland.  During the year, we added a further visa abolition agreement to this list&mdash;that with Iceland.  That brings the total of the agreements we have concluded to nine, but Deputies may notice one omission from the list which will be of practical interest and concern to people in this country intending to visit Rome during the Holy Year.  I mean, of course, the case of Italy.</P>
    <P>We have been in negotiation with the Italian Government for some time with a view to the relaxation of travel restrictions between the two countries. I have had very much in mind, in connection with these negotiations, the fact that there is likely to be a very considerable volume of travel from Ireland to Italy next year and that onerous passport and visa restrictions would inevitably impose a certain amount of inconvenience and expense, not only on members of tours and pilgrimages, but also on those responsible for their organisation.  Our conversations with the Italian authorities, therefore, have related, not merely to the abolition of visa requirements between the two countries, but to the recognition of the collective travel certificates which have been found in practice so valuable a facility in the case of pilgrimages and similar organised travel groups.  I am glad to inform the Dáil that I have recently heard from the Italian Government that the Italian Government are agreeable in principle to the conclusion of agreements covering both these matters, and I hope to be able to make a further announcement on the matter in the very near future.</P>
    <P>There is another country in connection with which I have been giving special consideration to our visa regulations, and that is the United States. As a general rule, visa abolition agreements are reciprocal in character.  I can understand, however, that, in view of their settled immigration law and policy, and agreement providing for the total abolition of visa requirements between the two countries would probably not be a practical proposition for the American Government.  The principle of reciprocity is not sacrosanct, <Col N="874" /> however, and, to my mind, it is becoming more and more anomalous that, at a time when we are all concerned to increase our dollar earnings and to encourage tourist travel from the United States to that end, we should continue to exact visa fees which operate in effect as a tax deterrent to any American tourist contemplating a visit to this country.  No doubt, the abolition of visas or visa fees in respect of American passports would involve a not inconsiderable loss of Exchequer receipts on this Vote, but, taking a larger view, we could reasonably anticipate, I think, that any loss we incurred in that way would be more than offset by the benefits to be derived from an increase in our American tourist trade. I am, therefore, examining our visa regulations in their application to American passports from that point of view, and I hope to be able to make an announcement on the subject in the near future.</P>
    <P>Still dealing with the general administrative work of the Department, I might mention briefly that I have also under consideration at the moment, and have had for some time past, a modification of our procedure in connection with the recovery of estates of deceased persons abroad for the benefit of Irish beneficiaries.  Considerable sums of money are recovered for claimants in this country by the Department each year, but I am not sure that the procedure which has been followed is not unduly complicated, imposing an unnecessarily heavy burden of work on the Department and the consular officers abroad and involving the performance by them of functions which would be better and more properly performed by lawyers.  A scheme to simplify the whole system is now under consideration, and, in connection with this, I am bearing carefully in mind representations on the matter which I have received from the Incorporated Law Society.</P>
    <P>From the foreign affairs point of view, this might be called the multilateral age.  In the past, international relations were mainly conducted by one Government dealing with another&mdash;in other words, by direct dealings between Government and Government <Col N="875" /> on a bilateral basis.  Foreign affairs were a simpler matter then than they are to-day.  You only had to consider the point of view of one Government at a time, the progress of discussions was not unduly hurried and the limitation of the negotiations to two parties kept the connected documentation down to manageable proportions.</P>
    <P>Nowadays international life has become multilateralised.  Literally, hundreds of different aspects of international relations have become the particular concern of special international organisations, each of which has its own secretariat, deals with all its members at the same time and on the same footing by means of conferences, commissions and other kinds of meetings, and, for this purpose, prepares and circulates a considerable mass of documentation which has to be examined, analysed and disseminated in the Government Departments of each of the participating countries.</P>
    <P>Although the new method has, no doubt, its merits, it has, especially for a country like ours, its disadvantages as well.  One of these is the formidable burden of work which the task of keeping up with the activities of these international organisations imposes on the Departments concerned in the participating countries.  In our case, the burden does not fall altogether on my Department.  We share it, according to the subject matter, with the other Departments concerned.  But, whereas each of the other Departments may be concerned with only one or two or three of these foreign organisations, my Department has inevitably to be concerned, in some degree at least, with all of them.  During the year we were represented at 28 international conferences.  We signed or ratified the same number of treaties or conventions. Every conference we attend, and every agreement we sign, imposes on my Department a new accession of work, varying from the examination and consideration of lengthy reports and draft conventions down to the preparation and execution of the documents, required for the accredition of delegates and the signature and ratification of whatever obligations it <Col N="876" /> is decided to accept.  The work involved is not of a kind which attracts public notice or attention, but it represents a material addition to the existing calls on our rather limited staff resources.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with most of the different branches of the activities of the Department.  There are some aspects, possibly, that I should have dealt with at some greater length, particularly those in relation to the present crisis in the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation. However, if Deputies desire further information on any of these matters, I shall be glad to reply to questions in the course of the discussion or to make the information available when replying.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the expenditure on his Department must always be a matter of grave concern for any Minister.  It is particularly so, I would say, in the case of the Minister for External Affairs.  The whole world, in a sense, is his province and he would be very unimaginative, indeed, if, looking out on that wide field, he were not able to see very many directions in which expenses could be incurred and from which he would believe that profit would accrue to the country.  I know that in my time there were a number of projects which would be valuable to the country if I could satisfy myself that the expense could be justified.  I am saying this by way of introduction because I believe that the House and the country have to depend very largely on the judgment of the Minister for External Affairs as to whether expense is reasonably incurred or not.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that at times a miserly attitude in regard to expenditure in external affairs is the worst type of extravagance.  I believe that it is bad economy to have a mission and not to give that mission the staff which will enable it to work successfully. I believe that some of our missions were, in fact, understaffed and I am well aware of the pressure under which the headquarters of the Department of External Affairs is working under the new conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaking of the new conditions, I <Col N="877" /> would like, however, to point out that it is not due, as certain apologists for the increased expenditure in the Department would have us believe, to the fact that we have to do things now for the first time for ourselves which were formerly done by the British Service for us.  That, to my experience, is not true.  We have been for very many years doing the things that are proposed in the main to be done now.  We have been doing these for ourselves and it is not, therefore, a proper ground of apology to suggest that the increased expenditure we have to face in that Department is due to the fact that we have now, for the first time, to do things for ourselves which were formerly done by the British Service for us.</P>
    <P>I think, however, that every conscientious Minister will look very carefully at every proposal to increase expenditure. We are, after all, a small country and, as I have said, there is nothing except his own judgment which can determine for a Minister whether he is under-spending or over-spending. I congratulated the Minister last year on having escaped the axe which was threatened by the Minister for Finance but I am half inclined to think now that he has escaped even the pruning knife.  Properly exercised, the pruning knife can be of advantage because it is no harm for a Minister to be up against the stark realities of raising revenue when taking money out of the pockets of the people.</P>
    <P>The one thing&mdash;and it is my main reason for voting against the proposal for the expenditure on the news service&mdash;that no Minister can defend is the spending of money when he cannot see definitely how the expenditure is to be of real value.  It is on the ground that I believe that there is in that particular proposition, the money for which is included in this Estimate, definite waste, that I say it is not justifiable where we have so many other things calling to be done.</P>
    <P>This Estimate has gone up in the last couple of years.  The total Estimate for this year is a sum of £316,727. That is all in.  That is the amount for which provision is being made, taking into account not merely the <Col N="878" /> direct sum but also the sum that is given in the Estimate for expenditure that is borne on other Votes.  I am taking that deliberately because I want to see the total sum that is involved in the working of this Department. That sum would compare with £234,383 in last year&mdash;I think that is the comparable sum for last year&mdash;and £209,318 for the year before.  These sums show a progressive advance of a considerable percentage.  If you look at the sums that are directly provided, leaving out the expenditure that is borne on other Votes, the sum that is asked for and the expenditure for which provision is made this year is £261,560 as compared with the sum of £187,535 in the previous year.  That represents an increase of very nearly 40 per cent. The comparable sum for the previous year was £161,760.</P>
    <P>The Minister must inevitably look with anxiety and we in passing these Votes must look with anxiety on these increases.  As I say, one can justify them and I could, for example, add to them.  I could, for instance, say that New Zealand is a country that has been very friendly with us, a country with which it would be desirable for us to have close diplomatic contact and diplomatic relations.  I could say that it would be money well spent to establish a mission in New Zealand.  There is no provision made here, I take it, yet, for the establishment of a mission to India.  I think that great country is a country with which it would be in the national interest to be associated but it does mean additional expense.  There are a number of Chargés d'Affaires that ought to be, with all possible speed, replaced by full Ministers.  There are perhaps good reasons why we should establish an embassy in Washington. I am quite willing to say that I myself was considering the matter.  All these are expenditures which one could justify, but you need not stop there.  For instance, the question of bringing the facts of Partition to the notice of the States and peoples of the world is a matter which, if you had a special organisation for it and you could justify it, would cost a very considerable sum of money.  My objection to the <Col N="879" /> News Agency Bill was that I did not think it was going to be effective for that main national purpose.  I am mentioning these to indicate quite clearly that the limit to which one could go with regard to expenditure on External Affairs is a very high one indeed. My view is that we ought to go cautiously and carefully.</P>
    <P>I am not talking about the question of Partition, which is ripe at this moment.  Certain Deputies seemed to suggest that we were unmindful of the question when we were the Government. There is no truth in that.  The Deputies choose to forget that the first part of our period of office was spent, in accordance with our programme put to the people, in getting for this part of the country our full freedom.  For example, just as the United States did not think it was desirable to put all their full strength into two fronts and desired to win on one front before they concentrated with their full strength on another, so we believed that it was good national policy to secure the freedom which we felt certain we could secure here by our own efforts, by unilateral action, if we were bold enough to take it.  We thought it was desirable to concentrate on that in the first instance in order to be free to deal with the remaining problem with all our strength.</P>
    <P>We did not neglect the other problem.  On any suitable occasion on which it was possible to do it we brought the question of Partition to the attention of foreign peoples.  Then the war came on at the time when we had achieved the first part of our task in 1938.  In that year we had got the ports and we had our own Constitution in operation.  For all practical purposes, we had finished the task that should be completed here before we undertook the other.  The war came in the intervening period.  It is very easy for Deputies now, in a time of peace, to forget the problems that we as a Government had to face during that time.  It is ridiculous for Deputies to suggest that during that war period and for a considerable period after it it was possible to make any headway in the campaign of <Col N="880" /> informing either the people of Britain or outside peoples or to make any real progress with the question of Partition.</P>
    <P>I am glad that there is no change of policy, because that is what it amounts to.  There is no change of policy with regard to the effort that has to be made to end Partition.  I believe that the first step must necessarily be to have the facts of that injustice made known, but, of course, it is only a first step.  By itself it may not solve the problem.  But it is certainly necessary that they should be made known to the nations of the world and that we should try to appeal in the first instance to the conscience of any State which has a conscience with regard to a democratic question or the rights of people for their aid and their sympathy. I believe, therefore, that if expenditure on the basis of making those facts known is properly devised and supervised it can be justified, and I for one will not refuse to support the Minister in any demand for reasonable expenditure that is directed definately to that purpose.  But the more willing I am to help the Minister in that way, the more severe will I be in criticising any proposal for expenditure which does not appear to be useful in that direction and in which I think there is likely to be waste.</P>
    <P>Again, I want to repeat that if any of our offices are understaffed, if any of our offices are so badly equipped that they cannot properly perform their functions, or so badly housed that they injure the prestige of our country, that should be remedied.  It is very poor economy to be niggardly in that matter as long as we have them.  But I do think that we ought to proceed with expansion very, very slowly and that we ought to pay attention rather to making as useful as possible the missions that we have rather than extending further until we have these brought to the point at which we are satisfied that they are able to do the work for which they were intended.</P>
    <P>So far as our headquarters are concerned, I believe that, with the best will in the world, with the greatest readiness to sacrifice themselves in the national interest, there is a limit to <Col N="881" /> what any officers in any Department can do in that way; I believe that there are physical limits and that officers of a Department must be able to work with full vigour and must not be tired out. For instance, we are discussing this very important Vote at 11.10 at night instead of doing it at 11.10 in the morning. Human beings do not work with maximum efficiency when they are driven beyond the ordinary limit to fatigue.  It is bad economy, therefore, to have a Department understaffed. But good organisation can very often save.  Looking ahead and making provision in advance for things that are likely to arise can enable the work of a Department to run smoothly without overtaxing the individuals in it.  If there is not foresight, then, obviously, you can strain the officers of a Department and put them in a condition in which they are not capable of the best work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not.  I am simply pointing out to the Minister that he has indicated to us that his staff is overworked.  He speaks of the enthusiasm of the staff, an enthusiasm comparable to the enthusiasm that was there in the days of intense national effort.  If the Minister wanted to increase the staff so that the work would be done efficiently and wanted to see that headquarters was run without an undue strains being placed on the members of the staff in the Department I would be one who would hold, if he satisfied himself on that point and in particular satisfied his colleague the Minister for Finance on it, that this Dáil should give the necessary funds to enable that to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every one of us is in great difficulties in dealing with this Vote from the point of view of expenditure.  We know that the Vote could be expanded many fold, but, when there is a very rapid expansion, I think we ought to see a certain danger in it.  First of all, it means that you have a situation in which you have to take in a number of young people who are inexperienced and put them at work for which they should have years of preparation.  You have to improvise <Col N="882" /> by means of lectures and so on to give them an acquaintance with the nature of their work.  I think it would be far better if they gained that by actual experience in the ordinary way.  As I have said, it is extremely difficult for anyone approaching this Vote from the point of view of estimating what is the sum which we should give, and what is the sum that is within the capacity of the people to bear, to form a judgment on that without having all the facts at his disposal.  It is possible that if I were in the Minister's position, I would be coming to the House with this Vote or with one which might be as large by having some different items to provide for, but, as I have said, the one thing that we ought to be rigid about is not to sanction expenditure that we cannot see definitely producing results.  I have taken up that attitude &mdash;I sincerely believe it&mdash;with regard to the news service, and as long as that item is there I intend opposing it.</P>
    <P>With regard to the major question of our external relations, our relations with Britain, our nearest neighbour and the country with which we have had most conflict in the past, are of primary importance.  I regret&mdash;I am not blaming the Minister for it&mdash;that our relations with Britain have not improved&mdash;the reverse has been the case&mdash;in the last year or so.  When the Minister first came into the office, he gave us a rosy picture of the good relations that were being established with Britain.  His statements, and those of the head of the Government, would lead the people of the country and people outside of it to believe&mdash;those of us who know the problem and its difficulties were not, I must admit, in any way misled&mdash;that we had only to wait a little while, and that this problem of Partition would be brought to and end.  If the Minister believed exactly what he said&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the impression that I got from the statements that were made here when the Minister first came into office.  His leader, the Taoiseach, was very definite in talking that the end would come in nine <Col N="883" /> months or in three months.  He even went to the point of putting a period of time to it.  I think that was completely wrong.  If the Minister and the head of the Government believed that, then they must have been incapable of forming any fair estimate of the situation at all.  If they did not themselves believe it, then I think they should not have said that and cause people who do not understand the difficulties to believe it.  At any rate, the Minister, I think, will admit that his approach this evening to the questtion of the relations between Britain and ourselves was very different from the approach that he made to it here a year or so ago.  Then he was foolish enough to think that some promises which he was making to the people in the Six Counties were going to win them overnight to his side.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>If I read them I do not think I would lose that impression but rather would be confirmed in it. My impression was that the Minister, in approaching this question on a couple of previous occasions, was so optimistic as to be almost absurd. However, I was hoping that perhaps it was I who was wrong and that it was not his facing of this problem that was wrong.  Looking around in various ways. and seeing how this question was going to be solved, trying to lay the foundations as best I could for an ultimate solution of it, I said: &ldquo;Perhaps I have been all the time overestimating the difficulties of this and perhaps the new Minister's approach, the optimistic one, may be better.&rdquo;  I will admit that I had a great deal of doubt as to whether that could possibly be so a year or so ago.  We are now, in my opinion, up against the stark realities which were there all the time but which, perhaps, were better concealed <Col N="884" /> then than they are at the present moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My hope&mdash;I have expressed it in the House already more than once&mdash;in this matter was that, in the first place, the people of Britain and the British Government would realise that it was a British interest no less than an Irish interest that this question between the two countries should be settled.  I had hoped that whatever Government was in Britain would have come to the point of realising that to the extent that they would be prepared to declare that fact, but instead they have turned round and declared the opposite.  They have said in effect&mdash;that is what it amounts to&mdash;that they do not wish to see this country united and that what they have done in the past they intend to capitalise now by trying to make this division of our country permanent.  In the past whenever this question arose&mdash;certainly at the beginning anyhow&mdash;British statesmen of all Parties suggested that it was their desire to see Partition ended. They suggested that they believed that this division of our country&mdash;this temporary division, as they described it&mdash; was the closest way to union.  They have proved the reverse.  They have proved that it is their desire not to see the unity of our country brought about but to see it perpetuated.  They have sought to bring about that perpetuation by pretending that they are working on a democratic principle and by pretending that they will leave it to the decision of the Parliament they themselves have set up in these six counties of ours.  They know full well that the division of our country is a gerrymandered division.  They know full well that the whole country, so to speak, was gerrymandered in order to give a majority to a group in one particular section.  Those of them who have paid any attention to this question know full well that, in saying that the unity of our country is not to come about until such time as a majority in the Six Counties Parliament are willing to vote for it, that they are thereby condemning the inhabitants of the largest part of that area to be governed against their will.  It is on the principle of saving people, so to speak, from being governed against their consent <Col N="885" /> that they originally brought about this division.  It is very difficult for a small nation to know exactly what to do in these circumstances.</P>
    <P>The whole attitude of our people, certainly the attitude of the past Government and, I think, the attitude of the present Government, is to have good relations between Ireland and Britain.  We certainly pursued that ideal from the time we established our own right to govern here, and even before that, because there was nothing behind our efforts except the simple fundamental rights to govern ourselves. We wanted to have a good relations with Britain.  We believed that that was not merely in our own interest but it was also in the interest of Britain. We wanted to have those good relations, believing that out of such goods relations still greater advantages would be achieved than merely the ordinary advantages to be gained from amicable relationship.  We believed that it would help to establish closer relations with Canada, Australia, New Zealand and a number of other countries where the people from these two neighbouring islands have found a common home.</P>
    <P>I do not know what steps the Minister is taking to bring to the British Government a realisation of that.  It is unfortunate that in relations between peoples one has to wait for a crisis before one can make people face up to a particular situation and look for a particular solution.  I do not know whether a crisis in the relationship between the two countries will or will not make the British Government face up to that situation.  It is a situation for which every right-thinking person in these two islands ought to work. As I have said, we are not in a position where we can say with regard to probable future external relations that there has been an improvement.  We have gone back and not forward.</P>
    <P>With regard to the wider question, I do not know exactly what the Minister's view is in relation to the entire European situation.  We have provision made for the Council of Europe. I classed that yesterday as a very hesitating and weak first step.  But, at least, it is something.  Will it be <Col N="886" /> in any way effective in bringing about that peace that is so badly needed in the world to-day?  Will it bring about a proper world organisation?  We certainly want a European organisation. Quite apart from any world organisation, we want a European regional organisation, union or federation of some kind.  But there is a wider question involved.  It is a question that affects world peace.  It is at the root of all our difficulties.  It is the problem of achieving a world understanding. I think everybody knows that the United Nations Organisations, is a failure.  I think everybody believes that it is.  I cannot see any great wish or desire on the part of some of the nations in that organisation to co-operate to-day any more than they were prepared to co-operate two or three years ago.</P>
    <P>It is a very unfortunate situation.  It is very sad for those who look at human affairs to-day to see this conflict.  The basis for that conflict is to my mind very hard to determine.  The whole situation gives rise to despondency.  I do not know what can be done to improve the relations between the different countries comprising the United Nations Organisation.  I do not know if the Minister has any views as to what can be done.  It is abundantly clear that some of the States that form the United Nations Organisation, must be as anxious about this world situations as we are.  My fear is that, no matter what one may do in Europe, if the larger questions cannot be adjusted there will ultimately be disaster.</P>
    <P>In the narrower sphere we have serious economic problems in Europe. These have been only slightly touched upon.  At one time the Minister for Finance made proposals.  I would have wished that these proposals had got a closer examination.  There may have been some defects in them but I think they deserved a closer examination. They may have been lacking in some fundamental points that I and some others could not quite appreciate.  I think in conditions such as those that exist at the present time these proposals deserved a deeper examination. The fundamental difficulty to-day in Europe is the nations are ready to produce <Col N="887" /> and sell their own products in return for the raw materials and other commodities they require.  Yet, they cannot get a proper market abroad.  I think the first essential is to set up some type of machinery through the medium of which nations that are ready to purchase primary exports from those nations that produce them can purchase them in return for the raw materials the latter require in order to keep their economy right.  I move to report progress.</P>

      <P>To-day I put down a simple question about the condition of the west pier in Howth and, as a result of the unsatisfactory nature of the Parliamentary Secretary's reply, I am forced to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  Does the Parliamentary Secretary realise that a number of the replies given to my questions during the past 12 months have been evasive, most of them &ldquo;shilly-shally&rdquo; answers to the effect that we are going to get something in the near by-and-by? Does the Parliamentary Secretary realise that the west pier in Howth is within the corporation area?  Does he realise that a person walking down that pier is in danger of being tripped up by getting into potholes or hitting rough stones along the pier?  Any person riding a bicycle is in danger of falling right over the pier into the water.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to my question to-day I got a statement from the Parliamentary Secretary setting out that the resurfacing of the west pier at Howth is one of the works of maintenance which fell into arrears during the emergency and it will be dealt with when more pressing works have been completed. Will the Parliamentary Secretary guarantee people who are using lorries bringing fish from the west pier in Howth when they break springs because of the condition of that pier? Will he compensate them for any such loss?  If you go down to the wilds of Connemara or some other backward <Col N="888" /> part of the country&mdash;even up on the mountainside&mdash;you will get a better road than there is on the west pier of Howth.</P>
    <P>It was mentioned here that it was during the emergency the surface of the roadway became so bad.  I was down there several times during the emergency, because that is one of the areas that has demanded a good deal of my attention from time to time.  I found when I was going down there a fortnight ago that I had to drive very slowly in the small car I have and, even with that, I very nearly broke a spring. Even if I did break one I would not follow up the matter with the Parliamentary Secretary because he would probably say it was some political stunt if I were to do a thing like that. I can say that numbers of those who are making a living going up and down that pier have broken the springs of their cars.</P>
    <P>This west pier at Howth is very close to Dublin.  The Parliamentary Secretary is aware that it is within the corporation area and he is also aware that tourists visit the place frequently. If you have to walk down that pier you must do so very slowly.</P>

      <P>Deputy Davin has methods of going to Howth Pier that I have not got; he can sail around up to the point of the pier; I have not a boat.  This pier is definately in a bad state and I find it necessary to show up this very inefficient Parliamentary Secretary who was most verbose when he was on this side of the House about getting work done.  When he was over here on these benches he almost swallowed up the Ministers and the Parliamentary Secretaries, but since he went over to the other side of the House nothing has been done by him.  So far as Howth Harbour is concerned he made an effort to dredge it.  They put the dredger there for a short time and it went out with the next tide.  That shows how I have been treated by the Parliamentary Secretary since he took over the reins of office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If he tells me that the road leading to one of the most important harbours <Col N="889" /> in North County Dublin is good enough for people who have to make their living there, and is good enough for tourists, I and those who know the circumstances could not possibly agree with him.  The tourist trade last year was worth £35,000,000 to us and it should be encouraged, and the least we might do is make a decent road for tourists along that pier.  There are many people who would like to walk down there and view the beauties of Howth.  They cannot do so because of the condition of the roadways there. They would be in danger and would risk their lives, all because of the shilly-shally policy of the Parliamentary Secretary.  The roadway there is bad because it has been neglected.</P>
    <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary continues to answer me and other Deputies on this side as he has done, trying to make a sneer and a jeer of it, when we are deeply concerned about our constituents, I am afraid we shall have to take some other measures to deal with that class of hypocrisy.  Does anyone think it is for pleasure that I have had to put down questions dealing with matters that concern my constituents? One of the most important piers in North County Dublin requires immediate attention and yet it is treated in this manner by the Parliamentary Secretary. I challenge him to go out on that pier to-morrow and I will give him £20 if he can drive along it at ten miles an hour.</P>

      <P>It will be just like the Parliamentary Secretary's reply to other questions I have put down.  It will be sheer misrepresentation.  I have given the facts as they are and I want some satisfaction for the question that I have put down.  I am asking the Parliamentary Secretary if he is going to tell me that this is not urgent work.  This pier is almost a quarter of a mile long and it is a <Col N="890" /> very important one.  There is a number of visiting boats and yachts calling there and it gives a very bad impression when material is so plentiful. Possibly it is the Minister for Finance who is responsible for not giving money to the Parliamentary Secretary to carry out that work, because materials are very plentiful now and there is no emergency of any kind.  You can get all the material you want to repair the pier and surely you have enough material to fill some of the pot-holes. Surely you have a roller for rolling the pier.  If you have not, I will try and make representations to the Dublin Corporation asking them to lend you a roller.  Indeed, the condition of the whole pier, generally speaking, is not a credit to your Department.</P>

      <P>Through you, the Parliamentary Secretary told me that he was out there this morning at Howth, and he saw the pier.  If he is going to tell me that he is going to change his mind from the answer he gave this afternoon, I will end this debate very shortly.  If he is not going to change his mind, I am going to talk here for fully ten minutes more.  If the Parliamentary Secretary is going to stand up in this House and state that the pier is good enough and that he is going to leave it as it is for another few years until a few more cars are broken, I am going to advise all my constituents from now on that I have duly warned the Parliamentary Secretary that if any accidents happen to anybody using a lorry on that pier as a result of the condition of it, if there are any true bursts or any springs broken, I am going to ask them to apply for compensation to the Parliamentary Secretary.  I shall go into the public courts and say that I duly warned the Parliamentary Secretary beforehand.  I will also inform the people of Howth that the only excuse the Parliamentary Secretary has for not doing up the Pier is that there is more urgent work in this country to be carried out.  Can the Parliamentary Secretary point out to me where there is <Col N="891" /> more urgent work than that to be carried out?  I want to point out again that from the day the Parliamentary Secretary took office he has put things into abeyance.  That is part and parcel of that glorious conglomeration known as the inter-Party Government on the other side of the House.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to see that Deputy Collins has got back his job in the flower shop.  He had lost it for some time back.  If this work is not carried out and if the people are going to be treated with contempt and ignored by the Parliamentary Secretary and his Department, I am going to give the Parliamentary Secretary all the annoyance and trouble I can until this work is carried out.  When you get a contemptuous answer like the one I got from the Parliamentary Secretary, it is time somethings was done about it.</P>
      <P>I am not in the habit of raising questions on the Adjournment.  I have been in the House now for five years and it is the second question in those five years that I have raised on the Adjournment.  I do not believe in wasting the time of the House.  When the Parliamentary Secretary was on this side of the House he believed in it and many a question he raised on the Adjournment.  I thought that we were going to have a miracle directly the Parliamentary Secretary got over there because he had such wild promises and such wild schemes when he was over here.  We find that he is doing nothing now but carrying out some work that we had already initiated as a Government on the other side of the House.</P>
      <P>There is another matter that I do not want to raise to-night, but I have raised it with the Board of Works before and that is the question dealing with&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is usual when a Deputy of any Party raises a question on the Adjournment to have at least some members of his own Party to listen to him.  On this occasion, when Deputy Burke raised this question, members of the Government Party came in to listen to him because, it appears, they expected to derive some amusement from his performance, while the Deputies of his own Party left the House because they were ashamed.</P>

      <P>The question asked was whether he was aware that the road leading along the west pier at Howth was in a very bad condition and, if so, whether he would have the road repaired.  The reply which I gave to that question was that the resurfacing of the west pier at Howth was one of a number of works, the maintenance of which fell into arrears during the emergency.  I may add that not since long before the war was anything done there.  The concluding part of my answer stated that the work would be dealt with when more pressing works are completed.  Deputies must realise that, leading into that pier, there is portion of a road or a path for which the Board of Works is not responsible.  We have no control over that portion of the road leading to the west pier.  If Deputy Burke is a member of the local authority it is his job to look after the portion of the road that leads to that pier.</P>

      <P>The approach to the pier is not under our control, but may I repeat that it is our intention to deal with that portion of the pier which is under our control as soon as more important works have been completed. Deputy Burke may give expression to foolish statements here to the <Col N="894" /> effect that people fell off their bicycles over the pier and that they were in danger of being drowned or that other people fell off the pier and had their legs broken and that they might have been drowned.

      <P>The Deputy came from Mayo originally.  I know, without being told it, that Howth is very near Dublin.  I went out there this morning to see the condition of the road of which the Deputy complained.  There are many other important places in Ireland in which we are committed to carry out what we consider more important works than this, but when we get an opportunity it will not take us such a terribly long time to come along and deal with this work.  If every other Deputy in whose constituency there are works of this character were to treat me as Deputy Burke did in this instance, I would be here every night in the year to deal with questions on the Adjournment. Certainly I would say there are 300 more important works than the work which Deputy Burke has raised here to-night.  Deputy Burke says that he never raises anything without good cause, but we have had already the question of the widow's oats on the Adjournment.</P>

This Government never used the emergency as an excuse <Col N="895" /> for anything; it was the Party to which the Deputy belongs who used the emergency as an excuse for years.  Before the emergency ever arose, there were questions down about this pier, when Deputy Burke's Party was in power and they did nothing with it at that time.  I am telling the Deputy now that, as soon as we possibly can, we shall go out and repair that portion of the road for which we are responsible <Col N="896" /> but the place where the Deputy alleges people are falling off bicycles and breaking their necks is not our responsibility.  It is the responsibility of the local authority and we cannot do anything about it.</P>
