      <P>When I moved to report progress last night, Deputy de Valera and myself were pondering together as to whether the repeal of the External Relations Act was a good thing or a bad thing.  We were making some effort to elucidate the mystery of Deputy Boland's speech on the subject in Bantry, having regard to an earlier speech which was delivered by Deputy Lemass in Rathfarnham.</P>

      <P>Will the Deputy explain how it arises, because the debate on External Affairs has <Col N="1510" /> already been discussed?  I do not know to what extent it was discussed last night, but in my opinion it should not have been discussed.</P>

      <P>The question was raised yesterday&mdash;I do not think directly&mdash;by the Taoiseach.  I think it was referred to by Deputy Lemass in the course of his speech on the broad question of policy, to use Deputy de Valera's phrase, as to whether it was a good thing or a bad thing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like some direction in this matter.  I understand that the debate on this Estimate was to be concerned in the main with matters of broad Government policy &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and in connection with our relations with Great Britain it seems to be generally accepted that the most important item of Government policy was the repeal of the External Relations Act.  I should like to submit, with regard to the question of policy as distinct from the question of administration, that that can be discussed.  My recollection of the Chair's ruling on the Vote for the Department of External Affairs is that when it was sought to discuss the question of the repeal, from the point of view of policy, the matter was ruled out by the Chair and the attention of Deputies was directed to the fact that only the administration consequent on the repeal could be discussed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>As to whether the policy of the Government in repealing the External Relations Act is a good thing or a bad thing, there was no doubt regarding the unanimous attitude of the House when the repeal was being discussed here.  One or two Deputies felt that they would only adequately and properly represent the people who put them into the Dáil if they expressed their disagreement with the Government policy on the matter. It was conceded by all other Deputies that those Deputies were fully entitled to take up that line of argument and that they were quite entitled to hold that the Government policy in the matter was not best suited to the interests of this country.  However, in so far as the vast majority of Deputies is concerned, the vote actually went through unanimously and practically all Deputies supported by their speeches the Government's decision. Before that had happened at all, sup port of the policy of the Government in the matter had been announced by Deputy de Valera in this House and elsewhere and by Deputy Lemass in Rathfarnham.</P>
      <P>In that atmosphere, with one or two discordant notes from Deputy MacEntee, that portion of the Government's policy was adopted by this House and it appeared that there was a certain amount of rejoicing from Deputies opposite&mdash;rejoicing, I might say, in a rather cheap and sneering manner, nevertheless, rejoicing&mdash;in speeches they made throughout the country at the fact that whatever doubt and confusion had existed in the past now you had a Dáil which was unanimous regarding this particular matter of policy and which was united in expressing what Deputy Lemass described in Rathfarnham as &ldquo;the wishes of the vast majority of the people&rdquo; that the Act should be repealed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not aware that any serious <Col N="1512" /> departure from that approval took place until quite recently.  Circumstances existed then in the south of this country which propelled Deputy Boland down to the southern area. Deputy Boland there raised the first question mark on the subject which came from the Fianna Fáil Benches, when he suggested that the policy of the Government in relation to the repeal was motivated &ldquo;either by deliberate mischief-making or shortsighted incompetent leadership.&rdquo;  That statement, of course, was challenged by speakers on behalf of the Government; and I think I had the pleasure of putting the question directly to Deputy Boland on three or four occasions. I am not sure that he gave any adequate answer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy did not wait for the answer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The only time I did wait, I found him talking about &ldquo;the King in the Phoenix Park&rdquo; and such matters.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy de Valera also made an effort to clear up the mystery and, in his unequalled, decisive and clear fashion, he decided it was time for the Leader of the Opposition to make a spectacular pronouncement on the subject.  So he travelled south also and there he said he did not know whether it was a good thing or a bad thing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday, I had arrived at the stage where Deputy de Valera thought I was taking those words out of their context and I invited him&mdash;as I invite Deputies Aiken and Boland now&mdash;to let us know before this debate concludes whether, in the considered opinion of the Fianna Fáil Party, the Government's policy in relation to the repeal of the External <Col N="1513" /> Relations Act was a good thing or a bad thing.</P>
      <P>We should remember that, despite the fact that Deputy de Valera and his colleagues are now on the other side of the House, they claim&mdash;and, I suppose, rightly claim&mdash;that they have a very considerable following in this country, that a number of people are willing to adopt their political views and their political actions from statements on policy made by Deputy de Valera and Deputy Aiken or Deputy Lemass.  It would be a matter of some interest to find out where they stand now on this particular subject.  Remember, Deputy Little yesterday, in the course of this debate, suggested that after the discordant noises and the original conspiracy of minorities, the Government had now clambered back safely on to the solid ground of Fianna Fáil policy.  If we are back on &ldquo;the solid ground of Fianna Fáil policy&rdquo;, it is even a matter of interest to Deputies on this side of the House to know what that policy is.  I would like if Deputies opposite could see their way to induce their Leader to make another of his clear, decisive pronouncements on this particular subject and if, now that the political flags have ceased to wave down south, and the drums are no longer beating there, in the cool of reflection, having studied the results of his pronouncement down south, he might now give the House the benefit of his up-to-date opinion on the subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lemass, in the course of his speech yesterday&mdash;I am not quite clear, from the ruling of the Chair last night as to how far this subject may be pursued&mdash;undoubtedly suggested, as a matter which the Taoiseach should consider on this Estimate, the setting up of a formal tribunal of investigation, to investigate into the circumstances surrounding suggestions of corruption against the Fianna Fáil régime.  Deputy Lemass advanced that seriously as one of his contributions to this debate.  I take it, a Chinn Chomhairle, that I would be entitled to follow on Deputy Lemass's lines and to suggest also to the Taoiseach that perhaps it is not such a bad idea after all; but I propose differing from Deputy Lemass when he asserts that such a tribunal could not <Col N="1514" /> come to any decision other than that Fianna Fáil were white-headed boys in administration and that any suggestions of political corruption levelled against them had no basis or justification in fact.  I suggested yesterday that they have and that I am not making any suggestions at all of personal corruption, but I am suggesting that, coming towards the end, at any rate, of their 16 years in office, Fianna Fáil had become so accustomed to political corruption that it was treated by them as a matter of routine, as a matter of course, a matter that was expected of them by their own supporters and by their Party, and was treated by them, whenever they were challenged by it, in a very nonchalant manner.</P>
    <P>One Deputy in particular, and perhaps two&mdash;certainly, one who is listening to me at the moment&mdash;was prepared to come into this House and to say to Deputy Costello, as he then was, that he admitted quite frankly that the Fianna Fáil Government went in for a system of political patronage.  He expressed his own view at that time&mdash;I am referring, of course, to Deputy Boland, in case Deputies are in any way puzzled&mdash;that no better system could be evolved and that he would like to know a better system if you could get one.  This was a system of political patronage, deliberately indulged in by the Fianna Fáil Government.  The particular matter under discussion at that time was the appointment of State solicitors and county registrars.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Please yourself&rdquo;. I would like Deputies to realise that if the Chair is making a statement he should be allowed to make it without interruption from any <Col N="1515" /> side of the House.  The Deputy is repeating what he said last night and a review of Fianna Fáil's activities, or alleged activities, back for four years is hardly a reply to a suggestion of Deputy Lemass that an inquiry should be set up.  The findings cannot be considered now, as it has not been set up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I, of course, accept your ruling.  I was going to suggest that Deputy Lemass's suggestion should be expanded somewhat and should not merely refer to the administration of old age pensions, widows' and orphans' pensions and such things as that.  If the Taoiseach is seriously considering adopting the suggestion made by Deputy Lemass last night, I want to plead with him that that investigation tribunal of inquiry, if it is established, should be much more broadly based and should include the matters which I have suggested to Deputy Boland.  I want to be quite clear on this.  I am satisfied from what I have read from Deputy Boland and other Deputies on the far side of the House that what I am saying is fact and fact supported by the record.  It is purely because it would not be in order for me under the ruling of the Chair to give the specific cases and quote Deputy Boland's words to him that I cannot do it.  It is not because I have not got the goods to deliver or that I am in any way reluctant to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lemass also dealt yesterday with the question of Córas Iompair Éireann and he repeated a suggestion which had been made earlier by Deputy MacEntee to the effect that the difficulties of Córas Iompair Éireann were due to deliberate Government policy.  I do not know whether Deputy Lemass' language was quite as strong as that used by Deputy MacEntee, but the suggestions were the same: that this Government, for its own ends, in order to palm off on the people a policy of nationalisation, had deliberately bankrupted Córas Iompair Éireann.  That suggestion, of course, was made earlier in the year by Deputy MacEntee, and in February last he is reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> as saying: <Col N="1516" />&ldquo;The way has been perfectly prepared for these developments.  For instance, Córas Iompair Éireann has been deliberately bankrupted by the Government in order that in desperation the people might acquiesce in the new measure.&rdquo;  He was referring at that time to the question of the nationalisation of transport.  The same suggestion was made last night by Deputy Lemass.  I think it is necessary to remind Deputies of a discussion which took place in this House on 23rd March last in relation to the increased bus fares in Dublin and to point out how intemperate the language of Deputy MacEntee and of Deputy Lemass was on this suggestion.  Before I do that I think it is fair also to remind the House that on, I think, actually the same day as Deputy MacEntee was reported as making that suggestion at the annual Westmeath Fianna Fáil convention in Mullingar a letter appeared in the daily newspapers from the ex-Chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann in which he gave his side of the story.  One of the things suggested by him was that outside assistance to Córas Iompair Éireann was necessary, that outside assistance could be made available by three methods.  I am quoting from a letter written by the ex-Chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann to the daily newspapers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>How is that gentleman responsible to this House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not criticising him in any way.  All I want to do is to point out that a man who was in a responsible position also recommended in this letter that a policy of nationalisation should be adopted by the Government as one of the methods of rendering assistance to this concern and that in the face of that it is surely ridiculous to have Deputies opposite saying that this Government had deliberately bankrupted Córas Iompair Éireann for the purpose of making way for a policy of <Col N="1517" /> nationalisation.  I do not think speeches of that sort are likely to be helpful when we come to discuss the transport proposition in this House. Deputies are aware of the serious position which had been reached in that particular concern, and I do not think it is fair of them to endeavour to panic the people who are employed in Córas Iompair Éireann.  I think that the Minister for Industry and Commerce gave the figures last March that about 20,000 people are directly employed and that the concern has effect on their family connections, and so, approximately 80,000 people in this State.  It has, I think, a wage Bill of over £6,000,000 a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think also that we on this side of the House are entitled to protest against the line of argument which is adopted in relation to every aspect of Government policy by particular Deputies in Fianna Fáil.  It was suggested by Deputy MacEntee time and time again&mdash;and unfortunately, as the Minister for External Affairs stated on his Estimate, this statement of Deputy MacEntee got publicity abroad&mdash;that the Government's policy in relation to the repeal of the External Relations Act was in order to pander to Communist elements in the Government.  A similar suggestion has been made at various times by the same Deputy.  It was made even in relation to the Local Authorities Works Bill when the Second Reading was taking place in this House.  I think Deputies should realise that abroad in Europe there is a serious position with regard to Communism and the clash between Communism on the one hand and the Christian Churches, particularly the Catholic Church, on the other.  I think it is a very great disservice to a State which is predominantly Catholic and practically entirely Christian for a Deputy with years of responsibility behind him such as Deputy MacEntee should endeavour to tar this Government or any section of the Government with the Communist brush.  I think it is a very regrettable, a very deplorable thing, that, for the sake of his own selfish interests in the constituency which he represents or for the sake of <Col N="1518" /> deriving political profit for his own Party, that kind of scandalous utterance should be made by that Deputy.</P>
    <P>I think it is particularly regrettable that on every matter of major Government policy that Deputy should stand up in this House or outside of it and endeavour to use the same brush in order to give the impression to timid people in this country, perhaps not deliberately but at the same time definitely, and to people abroad, that in this country you have the same division in the same proportions as you have in other European countries as between Communists and others.  That type of speech does not deceive the people very much in this country, but it can deceive people abroad.  It will result in encouraging Communist activities in so far as it is a well-known fact and has been for countless generations that this country is predominantly Catholic.  It undoubtedly will encourage Communist elements abroad if the impression is given by a responsible person, or a person who should be responsible, in this country that even here in Catholic Ireland you have the same sharp division between Communists and others and that the present Government is dominated by Communist elements.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope that Deputy MacEntee will think of the country rather than of himself or his political Party and that he will see that the remarks that I am making are justified, that he is treading a very dangerous path and is doing that merely for the sake of trying to boost his own political Party or boost his own vote in his own constituency.  It is true that in certain constituencies more than others that type of propaganda would have a particular effect.  Deputy MacEntee's constituency is one in which it would have that effect.  Deputy MacEntee knows that and I appeal to him, through the Deputies who are sitting opposite to me at the moment, to see to it that this kind of statements are not made in the future.  They are untrue. I think it is unfair that members of the Government should have to stand up in this House or at public meetings outside in order to rebut statements of that sort, which are made purely for the purpose of mischief-making <Col N="1519" /> and of damaging the prestige of the Government.</P>

I do not say that he used those words.  I <Col N="1520" /> said that was his object, and I can say that in speaking at a meeting of the Yeats' Cumann in Jury's Hotel in reference to the repeal of the External Relations Act, Deputy MacEntee is reported as saying&mdash;and he has never contradicted the report&mdash;that the purpose of the repeal of that Act was two-fold: that the first objective was to placate the communist elements in the Coalition Government &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is precisely what I have done.  It is not only in relation to one particular measure that the same type of statement has been made by the same gentleman and the same type of gentleman. I want, as far as I personally am concerned, and as far as the Party which I have the honour to represent is concerned, to rebut emphatically the suggestion that this Government, any part of it, or any member of the Fine Gael Party supporting the Government, had any motive such as that attributed to them by Deputy MacEntee in mind in supporting measures brought before this House.  I suggest that the Deputies opposite should accept that, and should refrain from endeavouring to create mischief in a situation which, in other countries, is particularly serious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think there is anything else that I have to say except to congratulate the Taoiseach personally and the Government as a whole, for the work they have done in the last 12 months. I think the thanks of the nation are due to the Taoiseach in a very particular manner.  The leaders and representatives of other Parties supporting the Government have been unstinting in their tributes to the Taoiseach. Deputy Con Lehane, last night, gave the same picture from the Clann na Poblachta point of view as to how the Taoiseach appeared to them, and I think I am right in saying that the same views will be reflected by all Parties and Deputies who have had anything to do with the Taoiseach during the year.  I think that he, personally, has carried out the duties of <Col N="1521" /> his office in a way which would be expected of him, in a dignified, capable and courageous manner.</P>
    <P>I think that the Government as a whole have done extremely well in face of difficult times and of obstreperous opposition.  They have demonstrated that Irishmen can get together, irrespective of their past differences and irrespective of their sharp differences on political matters in the past. They have socially, economically and nationally improved the position of this country.  They have done that in no small way because of the fact that they were prepared to get together and to co-operate in the best interests of all sections.  As an individual, I hope that we will not see the day when this country will again be governed by considerations of what happened in the past, but rather by consideration of what is best in the present and what is best for the future.</P>

      <P>The Deputy who has sat down has referred to me as the keeper of the Russian jewels.  I cannot claim to have ever had that honour.  Those jewels were never in my custody.  They were brought over by my brother and given to my mother to mind and then to my sister.  I wonder what would have happened to them if the person who raised this matter in Cork during the election had the custody of them?  All that I have to say about them is that they were handed up intact to the Government. Then there is the matter of corruption. The Deputy has been very vocal about that and had quoted me.  I certainly admit that, when it came to the making of judicial appointments, the Fianna Fáil Government did appoint people who were friendly to the Government. I certainly do not deny that. In doing that we merely followed the example that had been set by our predecessors and that has been followed by democratic Governments everywhere. But we did not do it to the exclusion of people who were opposed to us, because several of those people were appointed in our time.  It has been the practice since this State was set up, when High Court judgeships were in the making, that the AttorneyGeneral <Col N="1522" /> was appointed by the Government. The first Government did that by appointing two of their Attorneys-General. We followed that example, too.</P>

      <P>That is questionable, whether it is or not; whether the Bench would suffer more than the country, I do not know.  If he was not appointed, that was his bad luck.  On the whole, I think it would have been a good thing if he had got an appointment; it would have saved a lot of what has gone on for the past 12 months.  We merely followed, in our appointments, what was done by other democratic Governments.  At the present time there are 11 Circuit Court judges. There used to be ten.  Of those, we appointed four who were never supporters of our Party.  We have been told often enough that in these appointments we considered only supporters of our Party.  One of the judges was taken off the Opposition Benches, and a very good judge he is. We had no Party considerations in connection with that appointment.</P>
      <P>In the High Court we made certain appointments.  I went over them this morning, because of the references that have been made.  In the High Court we appointed three judges who were never supporters of our Party.  One of them was taken from the Opposition in Seanad Éireann.  That does not look like corruption.  We promoted judges who were appointed by the last Government, and we promoted them on merit alone.  We appointed the late Chief Justice purely on merit; he replaced Chief Justice Kennedy.  We regarded it from a national point of view, like any Government will do, and like this Government is doing, and we did not turn down people because they were not supporters of our Government. That list will show that what I am saying is quite true.  The Taoiseach will know that it is true and he will know who these people are.  I do not propose to mention their names.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the new Government came in they were in a dilemma because there <Col N="1523" /> was a small appointment to be made in Cork.  Over the wireless, after the appointment was made, we had a statement that a new method of appointment to these positions had been adopted.  I was anxious to know what the new method was and I asked a question of the Taoiseach.  I asked to what office did this new system apply and he told me it applied to sheriffs only.  I asked him would it apply to county registrars, State solicitors or judges, and he said it would not.  There are only three sheriffs in the country, all of whom are part-time officers and the Government have the right to make these appointments under the latest Court Officers Act.  To show how corrupt was the first appointment that we made under that Act, the first sheriff we appointed was a well-known supporter of the Fine Gael Party and a personal friend of the Taoiseach and a friend of mine also.  He is a very capable man.  There was no corruption in that appointment.</P>
    <P>I was anxious to find out the result of the Cork appointment, what sort of a non-Party man we would get.  After all the trouble it turned out that a member of a family that has done very well out of this country got the appointment in Cork.  It might have been an accident, of course, but that is what happened, and, the appointment having been made by this Government, it was not corruption. Another appointment was made that I certainly would not have stood over. The appointment was made in a certain county.  I might have favoured that person myself, but there were very sound reasons why he should not be appointed.  I communicated these to one person especially who is at present a Minister and, in spite of that, that man was appointed.  He is an ex-Deputy of Cumann na nGaedheal.</P>
    <P>In another county there was an appointment of a State solicitor.  A very good man was appointed, but he happened to be an election agent of a Fine Gael candidate at the last election. I am not saying a word about the appointment.  He is an excellent official.  The method of selection is just what it was in our time, only a bit <Col N="1524" /> more so.  I would like to see the time coming&mdash;may be it will or maybe if they will be there for 16 years&mdash;when anyone known to support us will get an appointment.  The only judge they have appointed is a good judge.  I have not a word to say about that, only he was a Fine Gael candidate who was defeated at a couple of elections. There is my answer to the Taoiseach, to young Deputy O'Higgins and to Deputy Collins.  Deputy Collins did not wait to hear it; he knew what was coming and so he went out.  He knows what I am talking about.</P>

You will not get a better selection board in the country than the Government of the day.  Where would you get them?  The Government that are responsible to the whole people and that have to stand over every appointment they make is the best selection board you can get for the high appointments.  If, unfortunately, some appointments do not turn out well, that could happen under any system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, as to this External Relations Act, apparently it has become high treason to criticise the manner in which the members of the Government carry out their work.  A very junior Minister accused me of treason&mdash;a new word now for traitor, a Chinn Chomhairle, is Quisling; that is what they call it&mdash;because I exercised my right as a member of the Opposition to criticise the manner in which they handled the Republic of Ireland Act, which I did not think was a wise thing and still do not think was a wise thing. I made my position quite plain when <Col N="1525" /> I was speaking on that Bill.</P>

      <P>Yes, the Republic of Ireland Act and the repeal of the External Relations Act.  I was against that, as I said, but, as a democratic member of the Party, I accepted the majority decision.  What I objected to in Bantry was not the passage of the Act, but the manner in which the whole matter was handled.  I said there, with full deliberation, that it was done in a spirit of incompetence and mischief-making, and I meant that.  The incompetence was on the part of the Taoiseach, and the mischief-making was on the part of the Minister for External Affairs.  Is that clear?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. G. Boland Mr. G. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did I say that? We are dealing with the Taoiseach's Estimate and we are dealing with Government policy.  I think an important decision, like the repealing of an Act like that, which was going, as we were told, to break the last tenuous link with the Commonwealth, should be announced in this House&mdash;that it is in this House the first statement should be made and not away in Canada.  I never heard of anything like that happening before in any Government.  I never heard of the head of any Government going away to another country and there proclaiming to the world that he was going to take certain action of which his own country has been completely unaware. It is normal for the head of a Government to inform his own people first of any proposed steps his Government intends to take.  That was a piece of incompetence that I consider entirely unforgivable.  That statement came the day after he had made another statement telling the Canadian people that, if Canada were attacked by any Communist State, we would come to its assistance.  The very next day the position was reversed.  I think there is cause for grave complaint at the manner in which the whole matter was handled.  Both those statements were <Col N="1526" /> of the utmost importance.  I wondered what steps the Government had taken prior to that statement being made. Was the other Government concerned acquainted?  The fact is that the Government had taken no steps unless one was prepared to read their intentions into some of the speeches that they made.  The usual method is, as everybody knows, that when a Government contemplates taking a serious step of this nature the other Government concerned is advised of the intention.  The Government proposing to take the step can then feel its way and consider what repercussions are likely to occur.  Having done that, they take the ultimate decision with the full knowledge of what that decision entails.  But that was not done in this instance.</P>
      <P>If we are not entitled to criticise then there is no object in our being here at all.  Why should we be described as Quislings when we give criticism where criticism is due?  If that is the attitude, then I am prepared to be a Quisling.  Last night I listened to Deputy Lehane.  He was busy pointing out how the Clann na Poblachta Party had implemented a number of their election promises and he instanced, amongst other things, the repeal of the External Relations Act.  Up to last night I was under the impression that the Clann na Poblachta Party disclaimed all responsibility for the repeal of that Act.  I was under the impression that they stood over their Leader's statement that they had no mandate for it and they claimed no credit for it.  That was my understanding of the position.  Now we are told that that is not so and Clann na Poblachta are taking credit for the repeal of the External Relations Act.  Some one will have to resolve the situation for us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what the inner workings of the Government Parties are but it is obvious that something must have happened between the time the Taoiseach made the statement that we would go to the aid of Canada and his subsequent decision on the following day which practically reversed his prior promise.  What happened I do not know.  Quite a number of us would <Col N="1527" /> be glad to have some enlightenment on the subject.  It was the general belief that Clann na Poblachta were not prepared to do this.  How then can the Taoiseach claim that he had a mandate for it?  In actual fact his policy, as enunciated by himself, was one of a closer relationship with the Commonwealth and there was no question of an isolated Republic.  Perhaps the Coalition Parties can explain all this to their own satisfaction; but it will take a good deal of explanation to convince me that any of them had a mandate to do this.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins stated that Deputy Lemass said that our Party intended to repeal that Act.  Our Party never had any such intention.  The leader of our Party did say that he had been thinking about it because of the gross misrepresentation of the then Opposition Parties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. G. Boland Mr. G. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know about the intention.  Certainly it never came before the Government.  Our leader did mention that he had been thinking about it.  He never brought it before the Government.  He never said he did.  He may have intended to repeal it in order to get rid of the gross misrepresentation to which we were subjected by the Opposition.  He may have wanted to clear the air.  But it was never decided by our Party when in Government and Deputy Lemass never said that it was.  That is gross misrepresentation.  What might have happened had it come before our Government I do not know.  It never was brought before our Government.  Certainly, as far as I am concerned, I would have taken exactly the same attitude as I have taken here.  First things should come first and the interests of the whole country should come before any truncated republic. That is my policy.  I have been a republican all my life, but I have been a 32-county republican.  The part of Ireland that I was brought up to revere most is that part of Ireland comprising the counties of Antrim and Down.  To <Col N="1528" /> my mind the most historic event which took place in Irish history was the meeting on Cave Hill.  The people whom I have always admired most were a group of people amongst whom there was not one Catholic; I refer to the people of Antrim and Down, on whom Wolfe Tone mostly relied, and not to the people of Tyrone and Fermanagh. They were the people who fought the battle of Ballinahinch and Antrim town.  There was not one Catholic amongst them.  There was Jimmy Hope and Harry Munroe and Henry Joy MacCracken, William Orr and the rest.  The Republic in which I am interested was smashed by British artillery used by some of the people who have been put in power by the Clann na Poblachta Party.</P>

My personal opinion is that we took a retrograde step when it was decided to repeal the External Relations Act, thereby obtaining international recognition for the partition of our country.  We have now achieved international recognition for part of this country as an Irish Republic.  The present situation is an outrage on the consciences of all true republicans.  If I am any judge it will take quite a long time to get that work undone.  The mischief-making of the Minister for External Affairs can be thanked for that day's work.</P>

That is my personal opinion and that is an opinion that is being shared by a growing number of people all over the country.  Naturally, we had to stand together in protest against the action of the British Government in passing the Ireland Act.  We had to stand together against their action in introducing the Ireland Act.  We could not have a debate on that because we had to show a united front <Col N="1529" /> against a common enemy.  But it was lamentable to listen to the kind of speech made by the Taoiseach on that occasion.  I never felt so ashamed for many a long day.  It was a ranting speech.  It was humiliating to listen to the futile threats he uttered, talking about hitting the British in their pride and in their prestige and in their pocket. If he even believed we could do that the matter might be different.  If it was Government policy, of course the Government would follow him.  But where is the use in talking like that when we can do nothing?  Why should he refer in such contemptuous terms to the Prime Minister of the Six Counties?  Why should he describe him as the &ldquo;Squire of Colebrook&rdquo;? That is not the way in which to refer to the head of any Government.</P>

      <P>I am speaking my own mind.  We are not the Government now.  When we were the Government we spoke with one mind.  Any little individual differences that may have existed between us were resolved in the council chamber.  We came to the country united on a common policy. Let nobody have any doubt as to where we stood in that respect.  Not like this Government.  You have one Minister getting up and asking for free transport, for competition with Córas <Col N="1530" /> Iompair Éireann to show them how to make money.  Then the Minister who is responsible for that gets up and contradicts him.  Another gets up and speaks in favour of social welfare and the Minister for Finance attacks that too.  That never happened in any other Government but this one, in the whole world.  We had our differences of opinion about these matters, undoubtedly, like any other Government, but we thrashed them out in the council chamber.  Now we are in opposition and we are not subject to the same restrictions.  All that is required from us is that we accept the majority opinion of the Party, that we discuss our own ideas and try to arrive at the best solution we possibly can in our Party.  We do not try to prevent members from saying what they think about a particular thing.  I spoke for a small minority of our Party, with conviction, about the wrongness of that action.</P>

As far as that is concerned I would prefer&mdash;personally speaking again&mdash;to see the state of affairs that existed here before we were smashed by British artillery in 1922 rather than the position we have to-day with a divided country and, as far as I can see, with very little hope of bringing us together.

      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. MacBride)</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not intended intervening in this debate but I think that in view of some statements made by Deputy Boland it is necessary to clarify a number of points.  In the first place, I would like to say that it is tragic and deplorable that in the year 1949 Deputy Boland should, in this House where there is a certain degree of unity on the national objective, seek to revive all the bitterness of the civil war.  I think that is deplorable and I hope the Deputies on either side of the House will not follow him.</P>
      <P>Deputy Boland devoted a portion of his time to explaining, or seeking to explain, statements he made in relation to the passing of the Ireland Bill by the British Parliament.  I think it is necessary to place the context of Deputy Boland's Bantry speech on the 22nd May last, in relation to the events surrounding it.  Deputy Boland was then talking of a measure which was being passed by the British Parliament. The purport of his speech was to accuse the Government elected by this Parliament of having been responsible, through mischief or blunder, for the action of the British Parliament.  In other words&mdash;a thing that has seldom happened in the history of this country &mdash;a man in the public life of this country sought to justify an act of aggression by the British Parliament against this country on the grounds that they were justified because of the action of the Government elected by this House.  His statement was reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> of 23rd May, 1949:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The deterioration in our relations with the British was due either to short-sighted, incompetent leadership or to deliberate mischief-making by the Government ... Fianna Fail ... had no responsibility for the foolish or mischievous leadership which had resulted in that legislation...&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He was referring to the passage of the Ireland Bill by the British House of Commons.  I do not know whether Deputy Boland realised the gravity of the statement he made.  To anybody with the interest of the country at heart, a statement of that <Col N="1532" /> kind was very little short of treachery to this Parliament and to this Government.  Deputy Boland denied this morning references that were made yesterday by Deputy O'Higgins to a statement made by the Deputy-Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Lemass, at Rathfarnham in October, 1948.  Deputy Lemass's statement was reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> of the 21st October, 1948.  In the course of that statement Deputy Lemass said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Members of Fianna Fáil did not conceal their disappointment that a step which their work had made practicable was not being taken under the guidance of a Fianna Fáil Government.  The general election had deprived them of that opportunity.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A couple of days later on we had a speech by Deputy de Valera, Junior, in Cork.  It was reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> of the 25th October, 1948.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The problem of maintaining neutrality made it necessary to avoid external complications, but the arrangement in question&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the External Relations Act&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;was never more than an instrument of convenience and temporary in its nature.</P>
    <P>It is now ... going to go and would probably have gone some time, in any event.  We do not mourn its passing and will support its removal. But there can be no going back from the stand now taken.  Not only that, but there can be no collateral sacrifice of our sovereignty in consideration of its going.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, Deputy Boland has the audacity to come into this House and to say in relation to a measure which was supported by his Party and which was hailed by his Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It has also been suggested that it had some adverse effect in relation to Partition, that it was a policy other than that which was approved of by Fianna Fáil.  Again let me quote what the Leader of the Opposition said, as reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> on the 6th December last at Buncrana.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It was a glorious thing that all those separated by the Treaty were proclaiming with Fianna Fáil: `We have a republican State as far as the Twenty-Six Counties are concerned.' Was there anyone who thought that that position would have been reached if it were not for Fianna Fáil?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>At that time Fianna Fáil were taking credit for it.  Then he went on.  He said that that was the end of that part of the work which Fianna Fáil had set out to do when it was founded.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The suggestion has been made that we (that is, Fianna Fáil) were negligent about Partition.  If you read the speech that was made at the foundation of Fianna Fáil you will see there definitely outlined the national programme and the course we were going to pursue.  It is not to-day that the policy of isolating Partition as the one remaining cause of difficulty between ourselves and Britain was first put before the people.  It was put before them in 1926.  Six years were spent in getting unity amongst our people; another six in getting rid of the British dictated Constitution.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy de Valera then sought credit for the repeal of the External Relations Act by saying it was the policy of Fianna Fáil, that it was the policy of Fianna Fáil to isolate the question of Partition from all other questions, that that was the policy it had proclaimed so far back as 1926, that that was what was being achieved now and Deputy de Valera claimed that as an achievement for Fianna Fáil.  To-day, we have Deputy Boland coming in to the House saying that it was a bad day's work for the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been suggested that the Party, which I have the honour to lead, has <Col N="1535" /> been in some respects inconsistent in relation to the matter.  When this Government was formed I indicated to the House that, as it was not a Clann na Poblachta Government, I could not undertake to put into operation the Clann na Poblachta policy save and except as it was covered by the ten points which had been agreed to by the different Parties.  That did not alter the Clann na Poblachta policy but I was glad to find&mdash;and I here pay full tribute to every other member of the Government and to every other Party behind the Government for it&mdash;that they, too, were in complete agreement with asserting the complete sovereignty of this country, irrespective of the wishes of Britain.  Now many taunts have been thrown across this House at Deputy Dillon, the Minister for Agriculture, on these matters. If Deputies will take the trouble to read the speech of Deputy Dillon, as he then was, when he supported the election of the Taoiseach in this House, they will find that he made it clear that he was in favour of getting rid of the External Relations Act on that day when the Government was formed an this House.</P>

      <P>He made it clear, not merely when this Government was elected, but when speaking in this House on the Estimate for the Department of External Affairs when Deputy de Valera was Minister for External Affairs.  So did other members of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Boland in some way sought again to justify the action of the British Government in, without reason and unjustifiably, seeking to impose its will on the Irish people, by suggesting that the British Government had no notice of the Government's policy.  The British Government knew, or should have known, the views of this Government in relation to the External Relations Act.  They were made public in <Col N="1536" /> this House at least a year before.  They were made public by Deputy Dillon in this House when the Taoiseach was elected.  They were made public by me when I introduced my Estimate last year.  They were made public by the Tánaiste on the adjournment in this House just a year ago.  So that there could have been no doubt in the British Government's mind as to the views of the Irish Government in relation to the repeal of the External Relations Act. But, is it seriously being suggested by any member of this House that the decision of the Government or the decision of this House concerning the sovereignty of the Irish people was to be determined by reference to the wishes of the British Government?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Boland, who to-day, and indeed when the repeal of the External Relations Act was before the House, expressed views which could only have meant that he considered that we should have remained in the British Commonwealth of Nations, said, as reported on the 28th October, 1948, in the <i>Irish Press:</i>&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;They should tell us what was to take the place of the External Relations Act which would bind us more closely to the Commonwealth.  That question was causing great concern and it should be answered clearly and at once.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputies on the opposite side of the House tramped around the country trying to sow suspicions in the minds of the people that the country was being sold and that there was some other arrangement being come to which would bind us more closely to the British Commonwealth of Nations.  Then we <Col N="1537" /> were told, of course, that it was a Communist measure.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that before the Opposition come into this House to criticise the policy of the Government they should at least agree among themselves on a policy; that instead of having Deputy Boland coming in here and seeking to justify the attitude of the British Government, seeking to attack his own Government on that basis, and Deputy Maguire and some other Deputies coming into the House and advocating that we should break off diplomatic relations with Britain and repudiate all trade agreements with Britain and march on the North, Deputies on the other side of the House should agree among themselves on a policy.  I think it is a pity that there should be divergencies of views among the members of the Opposition on matters such as these.  I think that a time has been reached when it should be possible for the members on both sides of the House to be in agreement on matters relating to the sovereignty and unity of our island.  I hope that the speeches we heard here in the course of the debate on my Estimate will not be repeated, that from now on wiser counsels may prevail, and that on matters affecting the unity and the sovereignty of the country no Deputy will be found who will be prepared to attack his own Government in order to justify the action of the British Government in relation to this matter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>With the Minister for External Affairs, I hope that the time has been reached when, as he said, both sides can agree on matters affecting the sovereignty of the country. Unfortunately, there is a background to the present situation and one of the reasons why it is difficult to get absolute and complete agreement on all matters affecting the sovereignty of the country is that there was such violent and unjustifiable disagreement about such matters in the past.  Let us take just one phrase which the Minister for External Affairs used a moment ago. He said that what Deputy Boland stated could only have meant that he <Col N="1538" /> wanted &ldquo;to keep us in the British Commonwealth&rdquo;.  The fact of the matter is that when the Minister was replying to Deputy Cowan some months ago he told us that we were out of the Commonwealth, that we had left the Commonwealth in 1937.  But he repeats to-day his old canard that was being used over a long number of years after 1937, that we were in the Commonwealth and that, in some way or another, the repeal of the External Relations Act took us out of it.</P>
      <P>When the Republic of Ireland Bill was being discussed here, all who had strong views on the matter said what they had to say.  Deputy Boland took the view at the time that the time for the repeal of the External Relations Act was not ripe, and he said so in no uncertain terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>My recollection of Deputy Boland's speech some time ago was that his speech, in effect, was in favour of the Commonwealth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  In that regard, Deputy Boland has the same sort of view as not only the members of Fianna Fáil but 99 per cent. of the Irish people.  I think it is wrong for the Minister to say that the Irish people have any strong difference of opinion about the Commonwealth.  A certain number of members of Fine Gael were not satisfied with the external association of the 1938 agreement and the External Relations Act and they wanted to throw it aside and go back fully into the Commonwealth, but the Irish people repudiated that policy.  At present we have this fortunate position&mdash;that Fine Gael have thrown over their past and have now accepted the situation that we should be what Fianna Fáil wanted back in 1921&mdash;outside the Commonwealth.  The members of Fine Gael, as the Minister knows, fought a bitter civil war to try to keep us in, but now, thank God, they are all agreed that we should be out and remain out.  If you talked to them privately they would agree with what the Minister for External Affairs said publicly in 1948 before the Republic of Ireland Act was passed or even heard of&mdash;that we were outside the Commonwealth and had been outside it from <Col N="1539" /> 1937.  The Minister will remember when he used these words.  So why does he want to use the phrase here to-day that what Deputy Boland said &ldquo;could only have meant that he wanted to keep us inside the British Commonwealth&rdquo; when the Minister himself said over a year ago that we had left the Commonwealth in 1937?</P>

I for one am delighted to see the day that I hear Fine Gael repudiating the justification that they pretended they had for the civil war.</P>

      <P>The Minister said that Deputy Boland had suggested that the British were justified in introducing the Ireland Bill and that clause particularly in which they sought to make Partition permanent.  There is no one in this country who was ever a Nationalist or had any Nationalist associations who would attempt to justify the British introduction of the Ireland Bill.  Everybody in the country has repudiated it.  Deputy Boland fought against Partition in the Treaty.  He fought against the Partition Agreement of 1925.  His whole history and the history of his family has been of bitter hostility to British domination here over any part of the country and particularly, as he said here to-day, over the six most historical counties of Ireland.  He did suggest, however, that the whole thing could have been handled better.  Surely to goodness we should have progressed beyond the time when a Deputy cannot say, or is accused of being a Quisling if he suggests, that, even though this House had agreed to a policy, the Government has handled it badly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the things that caused me some trouble was that you have certain parties in England, who could not justify the Government's action in regard to bringing in the Partition clauses in the Ireland Bill, who were told by some members of the Government over there that one of the reasons that this Bill was introduced was that they had got no notice.  The British Government made that the excuse. Some of the members of the British Government made that excuse to their followers and it was a bad thing that they should be in a position to do so with some effect.  No matter what reason the British Government had for that act&mdash;and my belief, if the Minister wants to know my belief, is that the British Government passed the Ireland <Col N="1541" /> Bill because they were asked to do so by the British Imperial General Staff and that they made all sorts of excuses and exaggerated various happenings in order to justify themselves to their own Party for bringing in that Bill&mdash; they had, from an Irish point of view, no justification, good, bad or indifferent for the introduction of the Ireland Bill. I think we have had enough about the External Relations Act and that matter.</P>
    <P>In order to put on record again what Deputy Boland said on the Second Stage of the Republic of Ireland Bill, I will give a quotation from the Dáil Debates.  The whole thing is contained in column 562, Volume 113.  Deputy Boland said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am voting for this Bill with a certain amount of misgiving and anything but enthusiasm.  I certainly hope that the outcome will be good for the nation.  I am not the best judge.  I have my own views and have had them for a long time.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He concluded by saying:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have been in this movement for a long time and have held certain views and I hope I have an open mind on these matters.  I am not saying that my judgment is the soundest one but I have a certain feeling that the time we have chosen for this and the manner in which it is being done was certainly ill-chosen.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>However, whether the time was ill-chosen or not, it was done, and our job here is to make certain that what was done is accepted by the whole of our people and that they all support the Constitution loyally from this time forward. We had an unfortunate situation for a number of years that a number of people were disloyal to the Constitution. I hope we are now all loyal to it and will continue to be and that we will extend that Constitution over the whole 32 Counties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know.  The Republic <Col N="1542" /> of Ireland, as the present Attorney-General said, came in in 1937 and, according to the Minister for External Affairs, we left the Commonwealth in 1937.  There were a number of young people in this country who believed that we did not.  We will leave the matter at that.</P>
      <P>I want to say a few words about a matter which the public discovered only yesterday was on foot.  The management of the Great Northern Railway announced that the workers in Dundalk and on that railway would be on day-to-day employment after the 1st September.  Surely to goodness the Government got notice of that some time ago, and why is it that some statement was not made or some effort was not made to meet that situation before the management had to call in the workers and make that announcement? I heard from a person who, I think, knows about the matter that the Government were informed about this situation three months ago and the first thing that we see is this thing breaking in the Press as a bombshell on a number of people whose livelihood depends upon these railways being continued and operated in an efficient and profitable manner.  I hope that the Taoiseach or some other Minister will give us some indication as to what they have done, what steps they have taken since they were informed a few months ago that this situation was about to arise, and what steps they propose to take to keep the Great Northern Railway, and particularly that part over which we have control ourselves, going and in full operation. They might also see an opportunity of getting into contact with the people in control in the remaining portion of our country to see whether co-operation on this matter could not be secured between the two Governments. I do not want to go into the matter any further at this stage, but I hope the Government will have some reassuring statement to make on it before the debate concludes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy C. Lehane yesterday made a very eulogistic speech on Government policy and Government action.  He said that the picture painted by the Taoiseach &ldquo;was a good picture to look <Col N="1543" /> on&rdquo;.  Some people see mirages in the desert and they are good pictures to look on, but there is nothing to them. Such pictures are will-o'-the-wisps and the nearer you come to them, the further they seem to recede.  Surely there is no member of Clann na Poblachta, or indeed of any other Party in the Coalition Government, which made, and rightly made, a great fuss about the emigration which took place in this country, who can say that the picture of Irish economy is good to look upon when last year there was a big reversal of the trend which showed itself in the last years of Fianna Fáil in regard to emigration.  In the last year of Fianna Fáil Government, we had a big influx of people into the country who had formerly emigrated, but in the first year of this Coalition Government, instead of 9,000 or 10,000 more coming back than came back in 1947, an extra 12,000 or 13,000 went out. That picture is not good to look upon. I am not blaming the Government for the whole of it.  I think, however, that if they had clearly adopted the policy enunciated by Deputy Lehane here yesterday, we would have been somewhat further on the road to a solution of this national problem.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lehane said that he &ldquo;would have liked to have heard the Taoiseach say that what we could produce here should not be imported.&rdquo;  I am perfectly certain that if the Government had been more enthusiastic in seeing that what we could produce here would not be imported, we would have had very many fewer people exported last year, that some of our young people would have been able to stay at home and produce more goods on the land or in the factories.  We are going to import this year large quantities of wheat, sugar and other commodities that we could have produced here at home, and, in Deputy Lehane's phrase, we did not produce things in the country which we could have produced.</P>
    <P>Take, for instance, another bombshell which has affected certain towns in recent weeks, particularly the position of the boot factories in Dundalk. In one factory alone, 750 people have got notices of dismissal and the 1,400 <Col N="1544" /> or 1,500 workers employed in another large factory have been put on short time.  During the months of May, we imported £50,000 worth of boots and that figure multiplied by 12 is £600,000, which would keep a big number of people employed in making boots here. Surely, when Clann na Poblachta claim to have such influence with Fine Gael and the other groups, they should endeavour to put into effect the policy enunciated by Deputy Lehane here yesterday.</P>

      <P>The policy of reasonable self-sufficiency was not the monopoly of Fianna Fáil.  It was the policy of Sinn Féin and it was the policy enunciated by Arthur Griffith and preached by him for many years in the wilderness. It was the policy adopted by Fianna Fáil in 1926 when Fianna Fáil was formed.  It is a policy which, I think, brings with it the support of all reasonable people in the country.  On that matter of the national policy of producing what we reasonably can within our own shores and keeping our young people at home to produce these goods, there seems to be a difference of opinion developing within the Clann na Poblachta Party.  The Minister for External Affairs the other day read us a memorandum which he had sent to the Council for European Co-operation and I should like to ask him what exactly he meant by it.</P>

      <P>I have a summary here which I think is correct.  One of the matters the Minister referred to in that memorandum as causing trouble in Europe was the tendency to rebuild autarchic economic systems.  An autarchic economic system is a system of self-sufficiency.</P>

      <P>Hear, hear!  May I say this to the Deputy.  The actual point under discussion there was the question of limitation of trade by means of exchange controls&mdash;not the question of protective tariffs.  Every <Col N="1545" /> country agrees on protective tariffs as being necessary to maintain industries in different countries.  However, the burden of the discussion centered on the additional restriction on trade imposed by means of exchange controls or by means of limitation of trade.  In other words, the same kind of thing which happens to us which precludes our exporting books, periodicals and so forth to Great Britain&mdash;not the question of protective tariff.</P>

      <P>I have now the exact quotation from the memorandum which will be found in column 1057 of the Official Report of Thursday, 14th July, 1949.  It reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The features of the situation which created the problem with which we had to deal, can be summarised as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  Increased production in Europe without increased multilateral trading&mdash;or proper distribution.</P>
      <P>(b)  The tendency to rebuild autarchic economic systems, rather than the making of a determined effort to put into effective practice the concept of economic co-operation.</P>
      <P>(c)  Failure to examine our economic problems jointly with those of America.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel very strongly that the policy of the Government should be that which Deputy Lehane announced yesterday and I hope, like him, that even though the Taoiseach did not advert to it in his opening statement he will, in his closing statement, announce as his Government's policy that anything we can produce in this country should not be imported.  In other words, we should have here an agreed policy of reasonable self-sufficiency and not only should <Col N="1546" /> we have it here for our own guidance and for the guidance of all the people who want to know how to behave in the future with regard to the investment of money but we should make it clear to other countries with which we have associations that that is our fundamental national policy in this country and that it is agreed to by all Parties.</P>
    <P>I should like the Taoiseach, when he is concluding this debate, to withdraw a statement which he made down in Bantry on the 12th June last and which was reported in the Press of the 13th June, 1949.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;By reducing taxation by over £7,000,000 in 16 months we have eased a burden which has been oppressing every member of the community, for nowadays everyone is a taxpayer.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The fact of the matter is that in the 18 months of Coalition Government taxation, instead of being reduced by £7,000,000, was increased by £8,000,000.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Taoiseach to the financial statement issued in connection with the Budget in 1949.  The Taoiseach will see there in Table 4 that the expenditure in 1947-48&mdash;the last year of Fianna Fáil Government&mdash;was £65,165,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>That £65,000,000, Fianna Fáil expenditure, jumped to £71,943,000 in the first year of the Coalition Government, and in this year's Budget the Minister for Finance budgeted for an expenditure of £72,916,000&mdash;in other words, an increase of £8,000,000 instead of a reduction of £7,000,000.  The Taoiseach very rightly said that &ldquo;nowadays everyone is a taxpayer.&rdquo;  All sorts of taxpayers have contributed and are expected to contribute this year to this £72,916,000.  Take just one little item&mdash;people have to pay more <Col N="1547" /> on the stamps for postage.  You have the people who have to pay greater National Health Insurance without getting any increased benefit.  You have the people who have to pay for white flour if they want to make a bit of cake.  I am not going to go into them all, I am only giving a couple of instances.  This collection of taxation is going on, from everybody in the country, as the Taoiseach said, and the total amount of it this year is going to be £72,916,000.  That is altogether apart from any of the capital section part of the Budget that was alluded to yesterday.  For the ordinary household running expenses&mdash;as Deputy Lehane called them yesterday&mdash;this is costing the taxpayers this year £72,916,000&mdash;which is £8,000,000 more than that of the last year of Fianna Fáil Government, which was £65,165,000 by published accounts.  An increase of £8,000,000, instead of a decrease of £7,000,000, as the Taoiseach stated. Everybody has to pay it, as the Taoiseach said in Bantry.  In fact, if we take it this year, every person in the country&mdash;every man, woman and child&mdash;directly or indirectly will pay £24 6s. 0d. per head.  In 1947 they paid £21 14s. 0d. per head&mdash;nearly £3 a head less than now.  When the people were contributing and when we were spending at the rate of £21 14s. 0d. per head we were told that it was fantastic and that we were ruining the country by collecting that huge amount of taxation.  But this year, notwithstanding the fact that we no longer have to pay such famine prices for imports as we had to pay in the last year of Fianna Fáil Government, and notwithstanding the fact that £6,000,000 which was in the Fianna Fáil Budget for subsidies for food and fuel has been cut out, taxation has jumped to £24 6s. 0d. per head.  That is a tidy sum.  Indeed, that is only direct tax. There are other things that are affecting the cost of living which could be put into that account and which were formerly put into such accounts by the Minister for Agriculture and other members of the Government when they were in opposition.  However, we take it that this £24 6s. 0d. per <Col N="1548" /> head is all that the people are having to pay for this Government.  I want to know from the Taoiseach whether he sees any hope in the future that it is going to go back to the £21 14s. od. per head that the Fianna Fáil Party collected for housekeeping.  Remember that, out of that £21 14s. od., we spent a couple of pounds per head in subsidising food and fuel in a year in which there was a famine in both food and fuel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies in the Coalition Benches referred to the second part of the Budget.  It is a good thing that the Government continued certain parts of the capital development programme of Fianna Fáil.  I was glad to see that the Government had provided more for machine-won turf development and did not cut down on the electricity development but carried on what we intended to do and the work that had been started.  I was also glad to see that they were proceeding with the telephone development which was started in 1945 or 1946.  The strange thing is that, while the Government has provided in the Budget a large sum of money for capital development, the rate at which men are being employed on capital development is disappointingly low.  What is the use in providing more money for the Electricity Supply Board, for instance, for rural electrification, when, on July 1st, 1949, there are only 720 people employed, whereas in 1948 there were 711 &mdash;showing there is an increase of only nine persons in a year, on the development of rural electrification?  Everybody agrees, on all sides of the House and in all parts of the country, that this should be proceeded with as quickly as possible, but here we have a situation that, in a year when vast additional sums are being provided in the Budget for rural electrification, when it comes down to brass tacks, down to the men digging holes for the poles and putting up the wires and the transformers, there are only nine more employed this year on the 1st July as compared with last year.  There is something wrong with that and I ask the Taoiseach to inquire into it and to get a bit of a hurry put on the people who are responsible for holding down <Col N="1549" /> employment on this necessary development to the level of 720.</P>
    <P>The power stations are little better. There are, however, I am glad to see, another 300 men or more employed in building power stations.  There is another 1,000 or so in developing machine-won turf.  After all this fuss about forestry, what do we find? Between the two years, the employment on forestry has gone up only by about 10 per cent.  With 10 per cent. extra men, the members of the Coalition Parties are asking us to believe that they are going to plant 400 per cent. more trees.  That just does not hold water.  If we are going to plant 400 per cent. more trees, it would be normal to expect that we would be employing four times the number of workers, whereas, in fact, we are employing only 9 or 10 per cent. more. On the 1st July, 1948, 1,904 were employed on forestry, while this year it is 2,094, less than 10 per cent. increase.  We want to see forestry going ahead as quickly as we can.  We know that one of the main difficulties is the getting of suitable land.  There is no use in planting land that will grow only stunted trees, in which some types of pine trees will grow for a couple of years and then die when not very much higher than the heather.  We know the difficulty is to get land that is worth planting.  It would be a disastrous mistake from the point of view of public economy to adopt the policy announced by the Minister for Lands, after he was kicked by Clann na Poblachta in public, that he was going to plant on land that was hitherto supposed to be unplantable.  I have been visiting forests and plantations for the last 40 years and I know that trees will grow at a certain altitude and, when you go past that, they get smaller and smaller until at last they are no bigger than the heather.  We do not want to waste any money, whether Marshall Aid money or any other, in planting unplantable land and I hope the officers of the Department concerned will have a sense of honour and responsibility, and will not allow, without some public protest, unplantable land to be planted.</P>
    <P>What we want to do is to use the money well.  We are collecting this big sum of money from the people, <Col N="1550" /> £24 6s. 0d. per head, and we want to see the people getting a good return for it.  If the present generation does not get it, we want to see future generations improved by the collection of this sum of money.  We also want to see that they get a return for this Marshall Aid burden we are putting upon them.  We are borrowing money at the present time and no one sees very clearly how it is going to be paid back in dollars.  In that regard I think the Minister for External Affairs is a little bit off the mark when he blames European countries.  The real fact of the matter is that America cannot get paid back the dollars which she is lending at the present time unless she accepts repayment.  The only way that any country can accept repayment for past investments is by the importation of goods or by the importation of a promise to pay, which is a further loan. There are only the two ways, the country can accept repayment in goods or can accept deferred repayment, that is, by giving a loan.  Finally, in the last analysis, international debts can be paid only by the importation of goods and services, and if the Americans are not prepared to do that now and are not prepared to do it in the future, the world is going to be in a bad way.  They can do the same disastrous thing which they did in 1929, when they refused to import goods, demanded gold, and put the world into a tail-spin.</P>
    <P>I hope the present generation of American politicians and economists are somewhat more alive to the solution of the problem than their predecessors of a generation ago.  I can see that if Europe is to recover, if Americans are to give a reasonable assurance to the Europeans that there is not going to be a disastrous economic war, they should undertake now that after a certain period they will balance their books and will undertake to import, by way of buying goods or buying services, to the extent that they export, that is, to the extent that they receive interest on past loans or that they send out goods in the particular year.</P>
    <P>If they do not balance their books in that way, if they do not buy as much <Col N="1551" /> as they sell, somebody else must be in debit to them.  Creditors in the present situation have a responsibility of taking the action that will redress the economic balance of trade in the world. The debtors in some cases cannot do it, and it is up to the creditors, who want to see the world running on a smooth basis, to undertake that in a reasonable time they will balance their books in that way.  If they did, less energy and goods would be wasted on capital development in countries like France and England and others and more energy would be put into goods for current consumption.  That would in turn give those populations a higher standard of living at the present time and much ease of mind.  I do not want to go very far into that problem, but I hope that the Minister for External Affairs will study that aspect of it.  If he wants to study it he will find in the Department of Finance and, I think, in his own Department memoranda prepared by me going back to 1939 and some to 1933 on that idea of balanced national trade.</P>
    <P>I hope also that the Taoiseach in winding up this debate will say that the policy of this Government is that what we can produce in this country should not be imported.  That is an aim of policy and we are not demanding that it should be made completely 100 per cent. effective within one year, 18 months, five years or ten years, but it is an aim which we should have and try to implement with all possible speed.  I think it is disastrous that we should this year be facing a prospect of a cut down in the wheat crop when we have to borrow dollars to buy wheat in America.  It is the same with sugar. We have 33,000 acres less sugar beet and if the Lord is not good to us there will be a very much lower yield per acre than last year and consequently we have to borrow more dollars.  Those dollars will have to be repaid some time if we want to keep the good name we have in the United States and if we want to keep our own independence of judgment on various matters.  We do not want to have that creditor-debtor relation with the United States or any other country if we can avoid it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1552" /> One small point that I did not understand from the speech of the Minister for External Affairs and which the Taoiseach might clear up is what exactly is the name of this State going to be in international documents, international agreements and matters of that kind.  When Deputy de Valera asked about our being described as the &ldquo;Irish Republic&rdquo; in the statute for the Council of Europe the Minister for External Affairs said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Deputies will have noticed that this term is used in a general sense in the way the country is described; French Republic, Irish Republic, Italian Republic, Kingdom of the Netherlands and so on.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>However, I was looking over that document since and it is not used in that way.  In two cases it is as the Minister stated, but on page 10 we have Article 26 and it says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The following States, on becoming members, shall be entitled to number of representatives given below:&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Was there a bargain, United Kingdom and Irish Republic? The Minister gave as one reason that the Republic of Ireland Bill had not come into operation when the draft was being prepared.  The draft was signed on the 5th May and the Republic of Ireland Bill came into operation on the 18th April.  The Minister might ask the Taoiseach to explain, or, if he wants to do it, do it himself now if the Chair will permit. On the 5th May we had passed the Bill, and it had come into operation, in which it was laid down that the State shall be described as the Republic of Ireland.  If we go back before the 18th of April when this was <Col N="1553" /> being drafted the name of the State was &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; in the English language, but we neither get &ldquo;Republic of Ireland&rdquo; nor &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo;.  When the names of the countries are given as &ldquo;Belgium&rdquo;, &ldquo;Denmark&rdquo; and &ldquo;France&rdquo;, not &ldquo;Republic of France&rdquo; or &ldquo;French Republic&rdquo;, one would expect that the next thing one would find would be &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo;, but instead we have &ldquo;Belgium, Denmark, France, Irish Republic, Italy, Luxembourg&rdquo; and so on.  I just want to point that out because I do not know how it happened that &ldquo;Irish Republic&rdquo; was the name instead of &ldquo;Republic of Ireland&rdquo; or &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo;.  One or the other should be used.  Constitutionally the name of the State is &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; in the English language.  An Act was passed saying that the State shall be described as Republic of Ireland, so it should be one or the other and not this name, &ldquo;Irish Republic&rdquo;.

They wanted to popularise the name &ldquo;Irish Republic&rdquo; as the name of a State of merely 26 counties.  We want to keep up the name given in the Constitution, &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo;, in order to show that our claim is to the whole island of Ireland and in international documents, in my opinion, the State should be alluded to as &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Republic of Ireland&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Cosgrave) Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Cosgrave)</NameTxt>
      <P>I marvel at the blatant audacity of Fianna Fáil Deputies and particularly at some of the speeches here yesterday on the Estimate which alleged that this Government had not carried out the ten-point programme or had not implemented the undertakings it gave <Col N="1554" /> when it was elected.  I propose to elucidate, from the things which have been accomplished and the policy which has been implemented, a set of circumstances which will show clearly that with a few exceptions this Government can point to a record over the past 16 months which will defy and refute the allegations that the policy which was announced has not been implemented.</P>
      <P>I propose, in particular, to discuss the ten-point programme and to give the Dáil the facts under each heading, as well as the extent to which the programme has been implemented, in some cases completely and others partially.  In doing so, I think it is no harm to say that when that programme was announced it was never stated that it would be completed within the first 12 months.  But over the last 12 months there has been progress made under every single heading in that programme towards implementing the policy therein outlined.  The first point in that programme was &ldquo;increased agricultural and industrial production&rdquo;. Last year agricultural production increased over the previous year. The Taoiseach yesterday gave facts which show that not only had that production increased but that, as a result of it, our adverse trade balance last year was reduced, and that in the first five months of this year there has been a substantial improvement in our exports.  The improvement in exports, if continued, indicates that for the coming year the policy of increased agricultural production with a consequent increase in exports will undoubtedly go a considerable distance towards bringing about an improvement in our balance of trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly, with regard to industrial production.  The figures show that last year our exports increased by over £2,000,000.  Some Deputies seem to consider that the improvement there was not adequate, that it does not reflect a sufficient advance or mean that we have yet reached anything like the level of industrial production that we ought to aspire to.  Under both headings, however, there has been a substantial improvement, an improvement which is reflected even more significantly in the first five months of <Col N="1555" /> this year.  The trade statistics published in May last show that, for the months January to May our exports amounted to £22,062,230 as against exports for the same period in 1948 of £16,543,418.  If the increase that is shown there is maintained, as I think everyone believes it will be maintained since all the indications show that it is likely to continue, then the policy of the Government on increased agricultural and industrial production is being implemented, and in the earlier part of this year has been put into practice.</P>
    <P>The second point in the programme was &ldquo;immediate all-out drive to provide houses for the working and middle classes at reasonable rents.&rdquo;  In February, 1948, the number of houses in course of construction by local authorities was something over 3,000.  The number at present in course of construction by local authorities is over 9,000.  The number of persons employed on that work in February, 1948, was between 3,000 and 4,000.  At present, there are over 10,000 persons employed on local authority houses. The number of houses being built by private enterprise at the present time is approximately 5,000.</P>
    <P>The second part of No. 2 in the ten-point programme was that luxury building was to be controlled.  Since last year no licences have been given for houses over 28,000 cubic feet, and since the beginning of this year licences are no longer required for the construction of houses either by local authorities or by people availing of the subsidy.  It is quite true that housing output is not sufficient.  It is true that there was, and that even yet there is, some shortage of materials.  The restrictions on the use of materials for non-essential building work, the increase in the supply of skilled craftsmen and the impetus given by the Minister for Local Government and his predecessor to the housing drive, all operated, I believe, to increase the number of houses in course of construction and will mean, in the coming year, a further increase.</P>
    <P>I come now to the principal item in the charge levelled by the Opposition that the Government have not reduced <Col N="1556" /> the cost of living.  Reference has been made to the fact that there has been little change.  These references ignored a number of reductions which have taken place, but which are never taken into account, in the cost of a wide variety of commodities and they are not included in the regular cost-of-living index figure.  Up to date, since last October, there has been a reduction in the cost of a number of clothing items, in the cost of suits averaging 4 per cent., coats and sports wear 5 per cent., shirts and collars 2½ per cent., hosiery 12½ per cent., pyjamas and blouses 11 per cent., worsted suitings, 2 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite a number of those commodities are not taken into account in the cost-of-living index figure.  In the case of building materials, standard metal windows are down by 20 per cent.; nuts, bolts and sheet-glass from 9 to 6 per cent.; fire clay goods, 5 per cent.  I could go on and give a miscellaneous list which includes motor-cars, springs, sparking plugs, industrial gases, sugar confectionery, jams, margarine and timber, all of which show a reduction varying from as low as 4 per cent. up to 16 per cent.  These items, as Deputies are aware, are not included in the official cost-of-living index figure, which, as the Taoiseach has said, has itself shown a reduction.</P>

    <P>Deputy Aiken a few moments ago referred to the fact that he did not believe in the system under which certain commodities are sold at prices which are above the ration price.  He forgot to tell the House that there is now available to every person, just as there was under Fianna Fáil, a ration of bread and a ration of tea at subsidised prices.  I should say in connection with the ration of tea that the tea ration is now a half-ounce higher than it was, thereby increasing the State subsidy by £400,000.  There is also available a ration of sugar at the controlled price, but over and above that supplies of bread and sugar are available to those who wish to purchase <Col N="1557" /> them at the economic price.  At the same time, an increased butter ration has been made available.  It was not available in 1946 and 1947.  There are also available increased supplies of bacon and of eggs.  All these essential foodstuffs were scarce at a time when, if we are to take Deputy Aiken's words, we should have been producing from our own resources&mdash;our own farms and factories&mdash;the goods which our own people require.</P>
    <P>I think it will not be out of place if I refer for a moment to some of the achievements of Fianna Fáil under this heading.  In the last year that Fianna Fáil was in power, the total cattle population fell by 4.5 per cent.  Cattle under one year fell by 8.4 per cent., milch cows by 4.6 per cent., sows by 8.6 per cent., and then there is poultry. Under the headings Deputy Aiken announced to-day, we should have had increased production&mdash;under the headings which, he said, referring to European trade, were essential if they were to have a balanced economy.  The Fianna Fáil effort not only did not produce the increase but, under various headings, by either the effects of the wrong policy, or by not knowing the effects of the policy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in one year pigs under Fianna Fáil had become so scarce that, to use the eloquent phrase of Deputy O'Leary, if a man met a pig on the road he would lift his hat to him.  This year pig production has increased and bacon is available now to everyone at a reasonable price.  The indications are that if the increase in sows continues, there will be a substantial improvement in the supply of bacon, an improvement not only which will make it available to our people, but sufficient once again for us to engage in the profitable export trade which, in the earlier years of Fianna Fáil, was available to this country but which, due to some mismanagement or to deliberate mishandling, was lost to the extent that, in so far as they were concerned, they were prepared to allow it to go down, not only at a time when <Col N="1558" /> we wanted it ourselves, but at a time when we could have secured a profitable market for our agricultural produce abroad.</P>
      <P>I was particularly interested last night in Deputy Childers' statement that some of the Parties supporting this Government, or represented in it, had gone before the people on a policy of full employment and that now, after a period of office, Clann na Poblachta said that that was still their policy but that they had not yet been able to see it implemented.  He went on to say that Fianna Fáil knew the problem, that they realised the difficulty and appreciated that unemployment was a problem not confined to rural areas or to urban areas, but that it was common to the country as a whole, that it was not seasonal, that you always had a problem there to deal with, but that they knew that it required a solution and, as a result of their experience, appreciated that it could not be dealt with on a short-time basis.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to hear that in 1949 from Deputy Childers, because I have here a few quotations from what the <i>Sunday Independent</i> described on one occasion as the old family album.  And I find, at the opening of the Tuam beet factory, as reported in the <i>Connacht Tribune</i> of 2nd December, 1933, the former Taoiseach, Deputy de Valera, said they could support a population three or four time their present number with a higher standard of comfort than they had at present, if they set about it properly and co-operated with one another as they should. Speaking in Clare, and as reported in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 11th January, 1932, he said no other country could point to such a ready solution of the unemployment problem.  Then, speaking at Athy, and as reported in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 4th February, 1932, he went on to say that no other country could solve its unemployment problem as easily as Ireland because they had a home market capable of consuming all they produced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lemass was not to be outdone. As reported in the <i>Independent</i> of 30th January, 1932, he said that if they set out to do what they obviously could do, produce their own food, make <Col N="1559" /> their own clothes and build their own houses, instead of letting the foreigner do it for them, there would not be enough idle men in the country to do the work and they would have to call back some of the 250,000 who had emigrated during the previous nine or ten years.</P>
    <P>After experience in Government and after putting the Fianna Fáil policy into operation, Deputy Childers was forced to say last night that they knew the extent of the unemployment problem and they realised there was no ready solution which could be taken out of blue prints and put into practice. He upbraided Clann na Poblachta for maintaining that it was an easy problem; he upbraided them for their innocence or their ignorance and he forgot to refer to the advice of his own leaders, probably through which not only Clann na Poblachta but the more innocent Fianna Fáil supporters were deluded.</P>

      <P>It is significant that Deputy Childers went on to say that they believed more employment could be created by tillage and that tillage was one of the methods which they regarded as being an effective step to solve rural unemployment.  I wonder when will we get rid of the foolish notion in this country that some Parties stand for tillage and that others are against it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think, and I have repeated it before, that the best prospect of a prosperous agricultural and a prosperous rural community, the best hope of providing more employment and securing a bigger return from the land, and the best hope of making available to our people the goods which they require, essential foodstuffs, and offering a reasonable prospect of permanent agricultural conditions, was long ago described in the phrase, one more cow, one more sow and one more acre under the plough.  It is, I believe, a foolish, stupid approach to agricultural problems to suggest that live stock and tillage are in some way opposed to each other.  Anyone who <Col N="1560" /> has had the slightest experience of agriculture knows that if you keep another sow and another cow, if you carry that process to its logical conclusion, you will need another acre under the plough and perhaps more than another acre.  As long as our live-stock numbers increase, as long as we can keep them increasing, we will increase tillage.</P>
    <P>But people omit to add that if we were to till without having live stock, rural employment would be provided only in the spring and in the autumn of the year and there is a gap in between when tillage does not require the same attention as it does in the spring and the autumn.  It is true that you have to attend to crops at all periods of the year, but by and large, the maximum amount of employment in tillage is given in the spring and the autumn.  If you have, at the same time, a live-stock economy, there is permanent employment over the whole year in order to look after the live stock and attend to their requirements.</P>
    <P>Indeed, it is not out of place to give some facts about the policy which was carried on here during the war, apparently at a time when you had not only the maximum inducements for more tillage but at a time when we had compulsory tillage to assist whatever monetary inducements there were, caused by the world shortage and by a shortage of essential supplies at home.  During the years 1941 to 1946&mdash;that is, at the time when you had compulsory tillage, a shortage of foodstuffs, and a shortage of ordinary agricultural production&mdash;the number of males employed in agriculture dropped from 555,000 in 1941 to 519,000 in 1946, a drop of 36,000.  I do not know whether facts have any influence on Fianna Fáil mentality.</P>

I do not know whether that Party is in favour of telling the farmer what he must grow, how he must grow it and when he must grow it.  I do not believe that is a way of life our people would wish to follow.  I do not believe that our people have to be dragooned into doing things.  I believe that if the farmers get a better price for wheat under this Government than they did under the Fianna Fáil Government they will grow wheat.  I believe that if they get a better price for barley they will grow barley.  The result of lifting the ceiling on barley from 40/- to 50/- and removing the control which prohibited Messrs.  Guinness paying a higher price for malting barley is that there has been a substantial increase in the barley acreage and I believe that that will continue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I remember a time when it was Fianna Fáil policy to prohibit the import of maize.  There was a scheme at one time called the maize admixture scheme.  I think that was the title of it.  Unfortunately, the back-benchers in Fianna Fáil are always a little way behind their leaders. Deputy Lemass has talked throughout the country about our wanting increased quantities of maize, but that, of course, has not yet filtered into the heads of the back-benchers.  They are still a few years behind.  Not only do we need our own production of barley, oats and wheat but we must import additional foodstuffs in order to increase our live-stock population.  There was an increase in the price paid for wheat and a number of other crops during the emergency coupled with the Compulsory Tillage Order, but we were not even then able to produce sufficient for our own requirements.  Whether an increase can be brought about by compulsion or by inducement, or by a combination of both, is doubtful taking into consideration our experience during the emergency.  However necessary it may now appear to the Fianna Fáil Deputies that we should have an increased acreage under beet, I want to point out that that is a definite change in outlook on their part.  I remember a time when Deputy MacEntee described the beet factory when it was only in its infancy as a white elephant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That brings me to another matter to which I wish to refer and to which Deputy Aiken adverted at the conclusion of his remarks.  He deplored the fact that there was not a greater increase in the number of persons employed on rural electrification.  It may be news to the Deputy that at the present rate of expansion in the rural <Col N="1563" /> electrification scheme the programme outlined will be completed in less time than orginally anticipated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is in five years. It will be completed by 1953.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The scheme outlined will be completed in a shorter time. I do not know whether one should employ people in excess of the numbers required, but that was the conclusion to be drawn from Deputy Aiken's remark.  At the present rate of expansion in the rural electrification scheme the programme that was outlined in the White Paper will be completed in less time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Nonsense! Check up on that.  That cannot be right.  The board estimated that they would finish it in ten years, employing 4,000 men a year. They are employing 700 now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The present rate of expansion is four times what it was when Fianna Fáil went out of office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Nevertheless, it is four times what it was.  It is rather significant that that was another of the schemes described by Deputy MacEntee as a white elephant.  We are told that the members of this Government speak with different voices.  Was there ever anything more contradictory than the voices of the present Opposition when they were in Government?  Deputy MacEntee was a Minister at the time when he announced in the Seanad that this scheme was a white elephant.  Some of the present Opposition even went so far as to say then that we should have started on smaller schemes instead of on one really big schemes of a constructive nature.  It is one example of a scheme administered under a State company and giving a fair return for the initial expenditure.  Deputy Lemass referred to the fact yesterday that we had delayed the implementation of a number of schemes that were likely to be productive.  He referred in particular to the transatlantic air service.  I think some other member of his Party referred to the Tourist Board.  The <Col N="1564" /> prospects were that the transatlantic air service would be run at a substantial loss.  The local service run by Aer Lingus, which operates under more favourable conditions generally speaking, is still running at a loss.  It is significant that at a time when the tourist traffic was the largest in the history of the country and when every hotel was finding difficulty in accommodating tourists, the Tourist Board hotels operated by Fáilte Teo. demonstrated that it was possible to lose money on tourist traffic.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>They lost money every year.  The Deputy knows that the accounts originally published did not take into consideration depreciation or any of the other normal accountancy factors that must be adverted to in any balance sheet.  He knows well that the figures published did not give anything like a true representation of the facts.  It is significant that these hotels, which were regarded by the Fianna Fáil Government as such an important industry, should show that it was possible to lose money on this traffic.  I do not know whether this or any other Government can continue to squander money at the expense of the people when there is a prospect of productive work which will give a return, not only now but also in the future, by providing a more stable basis for our economy as a whole.  I do not know whether or not it is better and more beneficial to the community to spend public money on productive projects rather than permit extravagant claims to be made for wholly illusory benefits from some of the schemes carried on under the Fianna Fáil régime.</P>
      <P>I want to refer also to the improvements in the social services which have taken place and which were criticised by the Opposition because a White Paper was not published.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe that the people who want the old age pensions, the widows' and orphans' pensions and the blind pensions are interested in a White Paper.  What I do believe they are interested in is the increase that took place at the beginning of this year in old age pensions, widows' and orphans' pensions and blind pensions, not resulting in increased taxation, but amounting in increased benefits to the whole community to over £2,000,000.  The previous Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Dr. Ryan, said the country could not afford an increase, although the modest motion which was brought forward by Deputy Dr. O'Higgins and Deputy Costello, as they were then, was to increase the old age pensions by 2/6.  I believe that what the people require and what they are anxious to get from the Government is not a White Paper; they want results.  They have got an increase in old age pensions, widows' and orphans' pensions and blind pensions.  Then, as a corollary to that, there was to be a modification of the means test.  That was the last point in the ten-point programme. There has been in this year a modification in the means test as applied to old age pensions and other pensions.  That was one of the undertakings which was given and one of the undertakings which have been implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the Deputies opposite referred to the fact that the Ministers spoke with different voices.  They criticised the divergence of viewpoint which they alleged was sometimes expressed by individual Ministers.  I think it was Deputy Boland this morning who said that when they were the Government they arrived at agreement &mdash;maybe they argued it out&mdash;and they then announced their decision.  The difference between this Government and the last Government is this: that Ministers have a personal viewpoint. Deputy de Valera generally took his own line and the rest of them followed. Deputy Lemass spoke on economic matters and the other Ministers just said ditto.  In this Government a Minister is free to express his personal <Col N="1566" /> opinion.  It is a good thing that they have personal opinions.  However, when Government policy has been decided, that policy is then put into effect and the Government as a whole has responsibility for it.  The mere fact that a Minister gets up and makes a statement which differs slightly from that of other Ministers is not any indication that there is a divergence of opinion or that the Cabinet has split. In fact, I think the last 17 months have convinced even the most optimistic Deputies opposite, as well as the most optimistic of their own supporters, that the line of propaganda that the Government would not last, will no longer work.  The Government is going to last.  A significant development has taken place since this Government was elected.  When the Government was elected quite a number of Parties and a number of Deputies not supporting any Party, supported it.  Some who are not supporters of Fianna Fáil had some misgivings but the passage of time has convinced those Deputies of the wisdom of the policy of the Government, of the benefits that it has succeeded in securing and of the general improvement in national economic conditions.  It has secured their support almost without exception, and Fianna Fáil are now isolated and alone in their opposition.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter I want to refer to which was mentioned by Deputy Aiken.  That is the fact that there was not adequate protection here for the boot and shoe industry.  He went on to rant about producing all we want at home, giving the industry an opportunity without it having to meet competition from imports.  I want to give him some facts about the imports of boots and shoes.  In the year 1945 the quota period Order allowed in 925,000 pairs.  In 1946 it allowed in 925,000 pairs and in 1947 up to 1,250,000 pairs.  In 1948 it was cut down partly by an Order of this Government on the 1st July of that year to 775,000 pairs.  This year it was reduced to 225,000 pairs.  Anyone who has any experience of the boot and shoe industry, and Deputy Lemass will agree that that quota is so low as to have no effect on home production. The quota there fixed applies to certain <Col N="1567" /> lines of production not catered for by the home manufacturer.  Therefore, in so far as adequate protection is concerned, there is no step left to this Government with regard to prohibiting imports that it can take which will alter or improve the conditions under which home-manufactured boots and shoes are produced.  I think the quota is so low that even if the remaining 225,000 pairs were excluded it would not make any difference. Deputies who are familiar with the trade and with production realise that the quota there fixed applies to lines the need for which home production cannot meet.</P>
    <P>I want to say in conclusion that the fact that this Government has in such a short space of time implemented so much of the policies outlined in the ten-point programme is not only a tribute to the Government but is even a greater tribute to the Deputies and to the people outside who elected the Deputies in this House and who last year elected this Government.  It is a tribute to the capacity of our people to work together in harmony, to agree on a common policy, to agree on major issues and to put these policies into effect; and not only that, but when they are put into effect to examine the results.  On the results which have been accruing and which I believe in the future will accrue from this Government's policy, the condition of affairs when the term of office of this Government is concluded will be substantially improved for all sections.</P>
    <P>I should like to say just a word on a matter which the Taoiseach referred to yesterday, to say that I believe it was a wise step.  I was glad to hear Deputy Little comment favourably on the Government's desire to promote opportunities for cultural development here.  I think the fact that it has been possible to get an acknowledged expert of the standing of Dr. Bodkin is something of which not only this House but the country can well be proud.  It is fortunate that we have been able to secure an Irishman who has not only a national but an international reputation for work of that kind.  I hope that the terms of reference which he has will result in making available to this <Col N="1568" /> country increased opportunities for cultural development as well as an opportunity of once again securing international recognition for the high level of Irish culture.</P>

Some months ago these dairies were acquired by the Dairy Disposal Company and have been closed down.  The milk formerly delivered by producers to these dairies is now collected at a point roughly equidistant from them by a travelling creamery operating from Skibbereen Central Creamery. This arrangement is an experimental one, and it will take at least a year's experience before a definite conclusion can be reached as to how the needs of the district can best be served.</P>

      <P>Neither the police nor I have authority to grant permission for or to forbid the holding of a public meeting, except a meeting held by or on behalf of or by arrangement or in concert with an unlawful organisation, which can be prohibited by a chief superintendent of the Garda Síochána under Section 27 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939.  The police are entitled to prevent the holding of a meeting or procession if they have reason to fear that it would result in breaches of the peace, but whether they should interfere or not is a matter for them to decide, having regard to the circumstances of each case.

I know there are people who appear to have Communistic tendencies, and that could extend to a lot of people.  So long as they are within the law, I cannot interfere, and they appear to be within the law.

      <P>I think you might have completed poor Richard in the <Col N="1582" /> matter and added the &ldquo;wise&rdquo;.  I do not think it is possible for any human being to will ill to himself and I suppose we can acquit the Government of wishing ill to our people.  If there should be such a Government in a democratic State they would be driven back to consider themselves and their own position.  So that I think the Taoiseach could have taken it for granted that we would all agree with the aim even if he wishes to confine himself to making us wealthy.  It is not with the aims so much that we are concerned, because I think we would all have these same aims; it is with the method by which the Government intends to proceed to accomplish these aims.</P>
      <P>There are for this country, at the present time, three or four outstanding problems.  There is the problem of trying to bring about the unity of our country and to restore its real independence. There is the problem of bringing back again to be the normal spoken language of our people the Irish language, the national language, and there is the problem of endeavouring so to shape our economy that we will be able to keep here the natural increase of our population until that population has reached an optimum figure, and I do not think that anybody, even those who sneered at a remark that I made many years ago in the belief that that optimum might possibly be two or three times our present population, will say that our present population is the optimum.  Anybody who considers the matter would say that our optimum population would be considerably above our present population.  The test of retaining our population&mdash;the test of every Government&mdash;was applied ruthlessly to us when we were the Government and under conditions which were altogether abnormal, applied to us when we were endeavouring to maintain our freedom and independence and our right to be neutral in a catastrophic struggle.  We think that those who said there was a ready remedy ought now, after one and a half years in office, be able to point to some remedy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach quotes figures which indicate certain advances in industry. I would like to think that these were <Col N="1583" /> not merely the results of the ordinary law of inertia&mdash;the preserving of the momentum given to it before the present Government took office.  A start had been given.  A trend was established and that trend inevitably would continue for a period of years unless the Government, by wrong views and unwise action, interfered and changed the trend.  Before we left office the Minister for Industry and Commerce was able to say that our population was higher than it was in 1938, that our marriage-rate was higher, that our birth-rate was higher, that our industrial production had gone up by 10 per cent. and that there were at least 100,000 people in employment more than there had been when we came into office.  Surely, that being so and the world war at an end, with every nation producing the things which it was denied through the years of the war, it was obvious that conditions would make for industrial progress and material advancement.  I do not think the Government has much to boast of in allowing that trend to continue.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach says, and rightly, that the main basis of the wealth of this country is our land.  We want to see the land of this country used to the best possible purpose and to see that land made as productive as possible. It is true that drainage, for example, is important and that money can be spent selectively on improving land by draining it, but the test in all these cases, so far as the investment is concerned, is whether, when you deplete an asset to invest it, it will give you, when invested, a higher rate of return than it gave before.  If we are going to spend our wealth, such wealth as we have, on the land, we ought to have an examination and see whether the money spent is going to give an adequate return.  We examined that question back in 1932.  It is quite true that a number of things prevented the selective process which I indicated as being the right one from being adopted and applied, but we did later have a land reclamation scheme designed for precisely the same purpose as that for which the Taoiseach says their scheme is designed.  I would suggest, however, that if we are investing existing wealth <Col N="1584" /> or credits, obtained by borrowing, we should see that they give a proper return and, if borrowed, make provision for repayment.  We have not been shown what is the provision that is being made for repayment and we have not been shown how the money which is to be spent is to be reproductive in accordance with the test I have given.</P>
    <P>There is a way&mdash;and it has been urged upon the Government and certainly should be taken into account by the Government&mdash;the improvement of the good land.  It is one thing to try to bring land into productivity, land of a marginal character which, when it is brought into productivity, will not produce at its best a great deal, and quite another thing to try to restore good land which has been deprived of certain minerals and needs only the restoration of these minerals for its full productivity.  The drainage scheme would appeal very much more to me had it been accompanied by an all-out effort to improve the productivity of those lands which are already, in their very nature, good lands.</P>
    <P>As I have mentioned the word drainage, may I for a moment refer to arterial drainage?  I should like to suggest to the Government that they should have an examination&mdash;an examination which I had hoped we would have made before we had gone too far with our scheme&mdash;of the possibility of controlling the river flows by reservoirs on some of the tributaries, designed to regulate the flow on the main arteries, to be used for power purposes when possible and as a safeguard against the dangers which lie in indiscriminate draining.  I think Deputy Aiken said here some time ago that water should not be regarded as an enemy but as a friend, to be controlled and used properly. I suggest then to the Government that, side by side, with the arterial drainage scheme as operated at the moment there should be a further examination to see whether it could not be modified, so as to provide for the control of the waters by having reservoirs in connection with some of the tributary streams&mdash;the larger tributaries, in any case&mdash;to hold back these waters, to control them and have them at your disposal so that you can let them out at any rate you want <Col N="1585" /> and when you want.  I mention that merely in passing.</P>
    <P>The main point is: by what methods are we going to increase the productivity of the land?  When I spoke of land, I did so simply in connection with the idea of its being the real basis of the wealth of the country, and in that connection there is the problem of the migration from the countryside to the cities which is taking place in practically every country.  What is happening with us is not an unique phenomenon. It is a world wide phenomenon. I think I heard one of the Deputies on the opposite benches say that that was to be deplored and that it should be the aim of the Government to do its utmost to change that trend.  I, for one, would heartily support any such effort.  When we were the Government, we had two methods.  One was to increase rural amenities, so as to make rural life still more attractive, because it is attractive.  Unfortunately people who have been brought up in the cities and who have not appreciated country life at all are not able to see or appreciate the advantages in country life; but there are undoubtedly certain attractions in the city and these attractions have to be counteracted.  What are the methods by which these attractions can be counteracted?  One is the bringing of such advantages as supplies of water and electric light to the country homes to the utmost extent we can.</P>
    <P>Another is to improve county roads so that people will not, as they have to do very often at present, step from their houses, into mud and walk along a muddy boreen for, perhaps, some half mile or so, for example, on their way to Mass.  All these are things which ought to be done and done according to plan and done gradually because&mdash;and this is one of the things which we have constantly to keep in mind&mdash;we must not take the people away from the productive work of the farm.  We must not attract people, who can from a national point of view do better work on the farms, to work on the roads.  But if there is unemployment it ought to be possible to get the two things done.  We were then aiming towards improving rural amenities so as to diminish the attraction to the <Col N="1586" /> cities.  The fundamental urge however that drives people from the country to the town is the desire to get work or more congenial work.  They are foolish sometimes in only looking at one side of the account.  They hear of the wages that are given to tradesmen and others in the town and cities but they forget that side by side with these wages are increased expenses.  They rarely go to the trouble of studying the two sides of the account and of asking themselves how much they will be in pocket in the end when the balance is struck.  They rarely ask themselves whether they would not be more in pocket in the country where if there are lower wages there are less expenses.</P>
    <P>However, there is a need for increased rural work.  We tried to remedy that situation by decentralisation of industry.  I do not want to pretend for one moment that that went as far as we would have liked.  The difficulties are that where you have a big concentration of population you have a large market and diminished transport costs and, accordingly, inducements for every manufacturer to establish his factory near such a market.  Advantages must be given to those who establish industries in the country or in the small towns, to offset this.  We tried to do that.  We succeeded to a certain extent but we did not succeed to the extent that I had hoped.  The establishment of industries in the country, decentralisation, is however one of the methods by which you could hope to keep your population more closely in touch with the country.</P>
    <P>I think somebody mentioned in this debate, and I agree with him, that the growth of this city&mdash;until there is in it one-sixth or so of our whole population &mdash;is a menace.  Not everybody, perhaps, has the same social outlook as I have and will agree with me in that.  However, I believe that that statement is true and that the most important single thing that could be done at the present time for the country would be to keep the rural population in the country.  Somebody has suggested also that by the departure of our people from the country we will lose the widespread <Col N="1587" /> knowledge of how to work the land&mdash; and that is a precious tradition.  It can be lost.  We saw ourselves how even the knowledge of how properly to grow wheat was almost lost.  Certainly the equipment was not there and the tradition of growing that cereal was almost lost.  There are a number of agricultural activities which by tradition have become almost instinctive, and it is important that they should be fostered.</P>
    <P>One of the problems we have in the country at the present time is the problem of agricultural labour.  We have often been talking about the milk problem. One of the difficulties farmers have is the getting of the necessary help to perform the milking operations. These operations have to be performed Sunday and Monday.  There is no question of taking holidays.  Some effort must be made to get help which will do that.  Milking machines are all very well for the larger establishments but it would take some time, I take it, before we would be able to get them into the smaller farms and, even there, we are going to have a certain amount of difficulty because the machines will also need attention.  Although the owners of the farms may be able to operate these machines there will be a constant tendency to give up the particular occupations which require outside help.</P>
    <P>With the time at my disposal I am afraid to get into the many details associated with this problem and with the general problem of how to prevent emigration and get employment for our people as a whole.  I was twitted with having said about 20 years ago that we had at that time facing us a solution which other countries did not have.  We were altogether undeveloped as an industrial country.  I remember making certain calculations as to the number of people who could be employed in industries here and the number of people who were available.</P>
    <P>The figure remains in my mind as something about 80,000&mdash;there was something about that number of unemployed in the country at the time. It was not a very difficult calculation. Textiles, shoe making and a number <Col N="1588" /> of other industries could be established. I was working on the figures of the day and I was able not merely to talk about it in general but to find out what was the employment that could have been given in such industries if we had the will to establish them.  I did not say, of course, what the present Minister for Industry and Commerce said. I never said that every unemployed man in the country could be employed overnight.  He said that in this House not on one occasion but after the lapse of a year he repeated it and said that all that was required was the will.  I did not say that but pointed out that there were industries that could be established, and that when established would give the required employment. The figure I have quoted at the beginning, that there were 100,000 more employed in industry at the time we left office as compared with the time when we entered office, shows that what I predicted could be done and was, in fact, done.</P>
    <P>It is suggested that during our period of office we learned things.  Those who do not learn are very stupid.  Like most people, we encountered difficulties which we had not anticipated.  When we saw some time ago the programme which Clann na Poblachta put forward, we knew from our own experience&mdash;we were as anxious to do these things as they could have possibly been and we pushed as hard as we could in that direction&mdash;that the difficulties were of such a character that they could not be overcome all at once and that the way to proceed was to go on steadily, keeping the aim in view, and pursuing it steadily over the time necessary for the efforts to fructify.</P>
    <P>I do not think really this should have been turned into a debate in which Fianna Fáil was under examination and not the present Government.  We have passed out of office and the responsibility now rests on other shoulders. The aim of this Dáil should be to see that those on whose shoulders the responsibility now rests do their work in the best possible way from the national point of view.  I have indicated the main outstanding problems and I am reminded that we are pressed for time.</P>

      <P>I do not want to encroach on the Taoiseach's time.  However, with regard to Partition, there is nobody in this House&mdash;I challenge anybody in this House&mdash;who can give a solution for it.  All that can be done is to move in a certain direction.  We believe that we have right on our side; we believe that, by bringing to the notice of fairminded people what the facts are, we will get them on our side. I cannot say definitely that we will be able to do that in any period of time and I do not think that any member of the Government can say it either. Therefore, I am not going to say to the Government: &ldquo;Here, produce out of your hat a solution for Partition&rdquo;&mdash;because they have not got it and there is nobody here who can do it.</P>
      <P>If we were strong enough militarily to do it, then there would be a question as to whether we should do it in that way or whether we should not bide our time and by various methods try to bring about a situation in which they would come in voluntarily.  What we ought to do at the moment&mdash;and I think we are all agreed upon it&mdash;is to bring the facts to fairminded people everywhere and hope, at any rate, that no matter how it is going to end, that was going to be a good beginning.  I do not think I need say any more. There is nobody on this side who is attempting to make any political capital out of the problem of Partition. If anybody is trying to do that, either on this side or the other, he is, to say the least of it, acting unfairly and acting unwisely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the second problem, the restoration of the language, again there is no cut and dried solution.  If the people of Ireland at the present time had the will to do it&mdash;and this is a case where will would be all-powerful&mdash;they have the power to restore the language.  It is not going to be easy, of course. Most of us who are doing work which involves verbal expression will naturally tend to work in the way that is easiest and those of us brought up with English as our vernacular will naturally <Col N="1590" /> find it irksome to a certain extent to have to use a language with which we have not been as familiar as we are with English.  But the question is: &ldquo;Do we want to restore the language?&rdquo; There used to be a time when there was no doubt as to what the view of the Dáil was in that matter.  I wonder if it is the same to-day?  I would like to get&mdash;and I am not challenging the Government at all in asking this&mdash;from the Government an assurance that anything they can do they will do to try to restore the language.</P>
    <P>The obvious thing to do is, first of all, to get it taught in the schools. There is a difference of opinion as to the best method of teaching it, whether it is wise to teach it to children or not.  Most people who have examined this question and understand the psychology of children have come to the conclusion that the years in which a language can be learned easily and become a vernacular is between the ages of five and eight.  These are the important language years.  It was with a view to utilising these years, to give that vernacular knowledge of the language, that it is taught in the earlier stages to the children.  Of course, that is completely defeated if you teach it in any way except as a spoken language.  The insistence in the schools should be on the speaking of the language; that is what we want; the other things will follow.  In the earlier stages, much will depend on the enthusiasm of the teachers and the encouragement of parents.  Of course, it is absolutely stupid to suggest that, because a child has learned Irish and has not learned as much English in the same time as he otherwise would the child has not made progress.  I happened to read a report on bilingual schools in Britain and I saw a stupid test applied and an unfavourable report because the children with the second language did not know as much English as the children with English only.  There was no taking into account the extra mental development and that they had a second language.  I believe that, if our children are sympathetically taught and if their parents are sympathetic, they can rapidly get in the earlier years a knowledge of the <Col N="1591" /> language which will enable them to understand simple expressions and develop in the use of the language as a vernacular.  We have very many instances in this country of that.  The question, however, is: is it the policy of the Government to proceed in that way?  Is everybody here in this Parliament of the opinion that we ought to restore the language?</P>

      <P>It would do no harm to get a reiteration of it if that is so and I believe it to be so.  I would only be glad to get it, I assure you.  I am not putting this to get a negative answer.  I want to restore the position when it was felt by everybody that the Government desired the restoration of the language and helped towards it.  I want that to be known throughout the country.  But unfortunately the Government cannot by its own action restore the language.  No Government can do it by itself.  This thing, the restoration of the language, has to come from the will of the people themselves, from the parents, from the teachers and from the ordinary people. You have to have abroad a spirit like the original spirit of the Gaelic League if you want to do it.  If we do not do it in this generation it is never going to be done.  That is the second problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third problem is, as I have said, that of keeping our people.  There again there is no one way in which you can do it but you can by a multiplicity of ways.  Everything that gives productive employment should be availed of.  I have given the test of productive employment.  For employment to be productive, whatever assets are spent should give a return of increased assets. But there is more in this than the narrow economic view.  We on these benches never took the narrow economic view of the problems.  The problems are fundamentally social and the economics are to be judged good or bad according to the social results that follow from them.  We wanted to create in this country conditions in which as many Irish people, men and women, as <Col N="1592" /> possible could live in this island in reasonable comfort and happiness.  The things that would contribute to their comfort and happiness are the things that ultimately matter and material things are of value only inasmuch they lead ultimately to happiness.  In increasing the material wealth of the nation, in building up our industries, in increasing the productivity of the land, we are providing the material basis for a good existence, but, as everybody knows, you can have considerable material wealth and exist miserably. You can have people and a community with considerable wealth behind them and yet living in a miserable condition. If you try to find out what makes for content and happiness you are driven to consider mental states.  These are influenced by the condition of our surroundings. If people are living in squalor and have imagination or intellect they cannot help comparing their conditions with the conditions of other people about them and necessarily they become discontented and unhappy.  If people are in houses which are not fit really for human beings to live in it is too much to expect that these people could be happy.  We have got therefore &mdash;and in our time we saw to it as best we could&mdash;to provide as one fundamental necessity decent homes for the people.  When we came into office there was an appalling task to be faced.</P>
    <P>We had a condition, I remember, in this city where a quarter of the population were condemned to live in a single room to the families.  People could not be happy or contented under conditions like these.  Nobody could. We had, therefore, to see that proper houses were provided for those people. The war intervened and slowed things up, but I think that 140,000 houses were provided in our time.  Towards the end of our period when the war was ending we examined the situation to see how quickly we could get off our mark and continue with the programme which had been interrupted.  Before the change of Government we had planned for the new conditions.  We had plans laid for housing and forestry.  Forestry has been mentioned in the debate.  I remember that in 1943 or about that time I had a conference with the officers of the Department with regard to the <Col N="1593" /> development of our forests.  I was informed of the difficulties that obtained at that time.  We set as a fairly reasonable target to be aimed at in the first year or so after the war about 10,000 acres.  We were assured at that particular time that that was a target which was reasonable or which at least was not impossible.  Of course, if you take in, as was pointed out here to-day, land which is not suitable, you can increase this acreage but it is waste, the same sort of waste as I objected to recently in another connection.  I believe that there are too many useful things that can be done and that can be done with profit to contemplate even for a moment doing things which mean absolute loss.  There is nobody who will deny that it is absolute loss to go to the trouble of planting trees on land which is known to the experts to be unsuitable and which in the end will not yield a reasonable crop.</P>
    <P>This debate, of course, suffers, as it always has suffered, from the fact that it is so wide that to deal with it at all would require very many hours.  It would require some hours for each individual speaker if he were even to deal with only the things he himself deems of prime importance.  I could for a considerable period talk about a number of other things we had planned to do and that we think the Government can do, but there are other occasions on which that can be done and they have probably been pointed out by others.</P>
    <P>Before I sit down, however, I want to say something about the External Relations Act.  My attitude and the attitude of our Party towards the External Relations Act has been made clear both inside this House and outside this House.  I am not going to go over it again.  It is there on record and everybody can see it.  I stand, personally, by everything I have said.  It was suggested that in the recent election in Cork I said&mdash;I do not think I used the words attributed to me&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In elections I have constantly denounced the depriving of the people of this country of one of their fundamental democratic rights. The people have the right not merely to select their representatives from which a Government is to be formed, but they have the fundamental right to decide questions of major national policy.  That is a fundamental matter. I say that the Coalition, that all coalitions, deprive the people of that fundamental right.  The Deputies in Clann na Poblachta have been excusing themselves for not carrying out their programme on the basis that they did not get a majority.  Each Party can go and promise the people and tell them anything they choose and then form a coalition and carry out a policy quite independent of anything the people may have expected or desired.  I was attacking the fact that this step was taken not merely without consultation but in contradiction of the expressed pledges that were given and of the whole policy that had been indicated by certain Parties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Why?  I have lived through one split; I have lived to see the British Government and Britain taking advantage of our difference here and I was determined that, as long as I lived anyhow, I would not be a party to doing anything which was going to split this nation in face of a British attack.  That is why.  There were many criticisms that I could have made against the maladroitness of the methods that were used, and I refrained from doing it because during that time I believed that it would not have been in the national interest to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The other members of our Party who held fundamentally different views, who believed that it was a wrong thing to do, who believed that it was a nationally bad thing to do, were, I believe, induced to refrain from that during a critical time simply by these considerations.  It does not make for co-operation or for help.  There used to be a saying that those who sup with the devil need to have a long spoon.  It makes it particularly difficult to work with certain people when the things that are done in the national interest are used to try and hamper you and prevent you from speaking when you have the opportunity and the right to speak in the national interest.  We were silent when it was necessary to be silent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>We were silent.  The point is that if we wanted to do it this country would have been split and we know perfectly well what would have happened if we from the other side of the House had brought forward those proposals.  I was not dealing with the merits however, because it was not germane to the argument that I was using.  The same thing happened here when Deputy O'Leary interjected a remark a short time ago.  I put him aside and said what I had said at another time did not matter because I <Col N="1596" /> wanted to keep to the point that I was dealing with.  I might as well have been asked the old gag: &ldquo;What did Gladstone say in 1886?&rdquo;  It would be just as germane to the issue as that stupid remark, and I just waved it aside.  It was argued to-day and suggested that I did not want things that I said before to be examined.  Anything that I have said is open for consideration at any time.  However, that was only an interlude.</P>
      <P>The important thing in this debate is to consider major questions of national policy.  I would like to say that I agree with the Taoiseach that it is more appropriate to have the Statistics Branch associated with the Taoiseach's Department than with any other Department.  I would not say that there is anything very significant about it except that there is to be an increase of staff.  That is significant and I am glad of it.  The Statistics Branch has been associated with the Department of Industry and Commerce. It was more or less in an independent position however and its work was available to all Departments. In my opinion, what is proposed now is not particularly significant, but I do suggest to the Taoiseach that it would be regarded as having special significance if I had done it.  I can imagine the Taoiseach, for instance, speaking from these benches and twitting me on having appropriated the Statistics Branch.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only hope so now.  May I make another suggestion to the Taoiseach?  I have felt for some time that the transport section of the Department of Industry and Commerce&mdash;it is a section that serves all sections of the community, the Departments of Agriculture, Industry and Trade, the ordinary citizen&mdash;should be associated with the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  I think it would mean better governmental organisation. It is a thing that could be done without increasing the number of Ministries. It would not mean an extra Minister.  As I say, I think that the services which the transport section in <Col N="1597" /> the Department of Industry and Commerce renders to the Department of Agriculture to the Department of Industry and Commerce itself, to trade as well as the services that it gives to the ordinary citizen ought to be detached from the Department of Industry and Commerce.  I believe that the task of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in developing our industry is sufficiently large.  I do not agree at all with the idea that a committee can co-ordinate better than a single individual.  I have never held that view.  I believe the committees are very largely a waste of time.  As a rule, you find one directing mind and there are occasional meetings for talks but if there is not one directing head co-ordinating and seeing to the execution of the work then very little work will be done.  I want to say that I believe that the former Minister for Industry and Commerce or any Minister for Industry and Commerce that would be worth his salt, ought to be a better co-ordinating machinery for the development of industry than any group.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer very briefly to a matter which, I believe, will find agreement in all parts of the House.  I wish to direct the Taoiseach's <Col N="1598" /> attention to a special matter.  I ask for an assurance in reference to the crisis that has developed on the Great Northern Railway, and particularly in reference to the railway workers there, whose employment will be in jeopardy from 1st September.  The House will not be here to consider the matter until 26th October.  Perhaps the Taoiseach will give some consideration as to whether, without disturbing Government policy or making any prior announcement in the very delicate situation which has arisen, it would be possible to give us an assurance that the livelihood of these workers will have priority in any plans or emergency measures that the Government may find necessary in this particular crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset of the remarks I have to make in reply to this debate, I think I am entitled to say that we have reason to congratulate ourselves this year on the tone of the debate, to some extent on the level of the debate and, with some few exceptions, to the absence of personal attacks, personal bitterness and sallies of one kind or another that we have occasionally had here in the past.  We have had a debate which has ranged over a considerable number of topics. In view of the tone of the debate, to which I have referred, I propose to take the advice of my friend, Deputy Peadar Cowan, and, however alluring the prospect, to refrain from hitting back at Deputy Lemass for some of the things he said yesterday.  I would have, I must confess, enjoyed myself thoroughly in taking up some of the challenges put to me by Deputy Lemass.  I would have enjoyed myself very much less thoroughly in replying to some of the things that were said to-day about me by Deputy Boland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But, I take my friend Deputy Peadar Cowan's advice and, having taken that advice, I find very little, if anything, to answer in Deputy Lemass's speech.  He rather reminded me of a fly at a window-pane.  We have often seen a fly buzzing up against a window-pane, hitting it and going back again in spite of the fact that he has been hit, seeming to think all the while that there is no obstacle there in that window and that he can get <Col N="1599" /> through.  Deputy Lemass devoted practically the entire of his speech yesterday hitting himself up against the proposition that there was no rift in the inter-Party Government.  He said: &ldquo;I can see it; there is one; there is some split in that Government; there is a rift there in that Government; it cannot be true that they are united and that there are no rows going on between them; I can see it, because of the speeches they are making.&rdquo;  He hit himself up against the hard fact again and again that in this Government the Parties supporting it are solidly united in purpose and in policy.</P>
    <P>He referred to a variety of queer little characteristics that he found amongst certain of my colleagues and he did not even spare myself.  Fair enough.  He spoke about the personal laziness of some of my colleagues.  My trouble, I want to tell the Deputy and the House, for the last 12 months was to see that all my colleagues did not work as hard as they have been working and did not injure their health. That is what has been giving me trouble in the last 12 months, and not personal laziness on the part of anybody. He said the Minister for Industry and Commerce ought not to have been sent to an international conference, that the Minister for Finance ought to have been sent.  Of course, if the Minister for Finance was sent to a European Economic Conference or to this international conference held in Paris a few weeks ago, we would have heard Deputy Lemass thumping the table, working himself up into a range and asking: &ldquo;Why was not the Minister for External Affairs, whose job it is to deal with international conferences and Foreign Affairs, sent instead of the Minister for Finance?&rdquo;  Surely, Deputy Lemass will agree with me in his heart, if not actually.</P>
    <P>I know there is a concentrated attack now, on the part of the Deputy and those supporting him, on the Minister for External Affairs.  Having failed in their attack over some months on the Minister for Agriculture, who rated them bell, book and candle, by his <Col N="1600" /> words and actions and acts, they now concentrate their attack on the Minister for External Affairs.  I want to say one thing about that Minister.  In the last 15 months he has attended international conferences in various parts of the world.  He has brought prestige to this country.  He has brought respect for this country amongst the diplomats of the international comity of nations.  He has raised our status and brought recognition of the fact that, small nation though we may be, we have force and influence in international affairs, and possibly we may be able to give some assistance in the difficult problems that await solution in connection with international relations and international economic co-operation.</P>
    <P>Then Deputy Lemass turned his fire on his successor in the Department of Industry and Commerce.  I thought that he showed in that respect, if I might be pardoned for doing it in the presence of my colleague, Deputy Mrs. Redmond, some of the characteristics of a jealous woman.  It was perhaps too much for him to hear the figures I read out yesterday indicating, coldly and dispassionately, the success that has attended the administration of the Department of Industry and Commerce since Deputy Dan Morrissey became Minister.  Where was the basis for that irritation that Deputy Lemass referred to about the Minister for Industry and Commerce, because industrial progress was not sufficiently fast for him?  I gave the figures yesterday of the industrial progress, a record in industrial production, a record in industrial export, a record in industrial employment in 12 months under the leadership of the present Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>A record every year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Then he went even further than that, because he repeatedly drew attention to what he had already said some time ago&mdash;the occasion I do not know.  He said he had charged, or gone very nearly to the extent of charging, the Minister for Industry and Commerce with something which, if I were in a court, I would describe as being a charge of fraudulent delay in order to bring <Col N="1601" /> about a situation where he could say that Córas Iompair Éireann was a bankrupt concern.</P>
      <P>He continued his remarks by saying that I possibly might regard it as discourteous of him if he suggested I had acquired in the last 18 months an elementary knowledge of Irish national economics.  I might recall to the Deputy a statement that was made to me and some of my friends in University College, Dublin, a considerable number of years ago, a greater number of years even than have elapsed since Deputy de Valera made the famous speech recalled by Deputy Cosgrave to-day.  It was made by a professor of French during the last lecture we got in French in the University College before we sat for our examination.  He told us that we then knew enough French to learn French. I have never forgotten that.  He was a very wise man.  The longer I have lived and the more experience I have gained in law, politics or economics, the more I realise how little I know and how much there is still to be learned.  May I commend that little lesson to Deputy Lemass.  I do not suffer under the illusion that I know everything.  When I was charged with the responsibility of my present post last year I took the precaution of gathering around me the best men and the best advice available here on Irish economic affairs so that I might be the better able to discharge the task this House placed upon me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was the kind of speech made by Deputy Lemass.  He then went on to try to show that there was a rift in this inter-Party Government, that we were all speaking in different voices and that, although we were all saying that there was no fly, nevertheless there must have been some kind of fly on the window pane.  He said that my colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, was telling fairy stories.  That was the contribution made to this debate on general Government policy by the former Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I had given figures to the House, figures which speak for themselves, on the industrial progress of this country and recalled to the memory of the House <Col N="1602" /> figures that the Minister for Agriculture had given in reference to increased agricultural production.</P>
    <P>If there was any case to be made against that and if our balance of trade position, which I had explained, was not in the healthy condition in which it is, I do not think the former Minister for Industry and Commerce would have wasted his time talking about the personal laziness of Ministers, the alleged division in the Irish Cabinet, the fairy tales of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, or my elementary knowledge of Irish political economy.  He had not a single answer to the case that was made here that the policy pursued by this Government, the underlying principles of which I outlined in my speech yesterday afternoon, was beneficial to this country and that, if we get a chance to carry out our policy, we shall be facing a position where we can and will, I hope, bring a considerable degree of material benefit and prosperity to every section of our people.</P>
    <P>That was the type of speech that the former Minister for Industry and Commerce made.  It was the best tribute that could be paid to the general policy I outlined yesterday.  I gave the figures.  May I supplement them now by figures that were published last night?  The trade returns from our own statistical branch are not yet available.  They will be published very shortly.  They come out a few days after the British trade returns because they are compiled on a somewhat different basis and there is a time lag of two and a half to three days between the compilation of the British trade returns and our trade returns.  The figures from the British trade returns, which I propose to quote, do not present as rosy a picture as I believe will be presented when our own figures are available in a couple of days.  The figures relate to the first six months of 1949 and I shall compare them with the figures for 1948.  For the first six months of 1948 our exports to Great Britain of live animals amounted to £4.86 million; for the first six months of this year £7.41 million were exported. Deputy de Valera and, I assume the former Minister for Industry and Commerce will agree that one <Col N="1603" /> of the methods for rectifying our balance of payments position and of increasing our national wealth is by the export of our surplus agricultural products. There is an increase of almost £3,000,000 in six months.  For the first six months of 1948 our exports of tinned beef represented £225,000; for the first six months of this year the figure is £379,000, an increase of over £150,000.  Dead poultry represented £557,000 in the first six months of last year and £840,000 in the first six months of this year.  Eggs represented £2.9 million in the first six months of last year and £4.6 million in the first six months of this year.  Beverages last year totalled £2.57 million; this year the figure is £3.37 million.  In the first six months of 1948 exports of fish totalled £21,000; in the first six months of this year the figure is £310,000.  Are these striking figures?  Do they speak loudly of the effects of Government policy in the last 12 months?</P>
    <P>But that is not the whole story. According to the British trade returns the value of exports from this country of live animals to Britain was £1.19 million as compared with £445,000 in June, 1948, an increase of nearly £750,000.  According to the British trade returns, and we believe the figure will be increased and show a better picture as soon as our trade returns are available, fat cattle in June, 1949, were valued at £500,000 as compared with £20,000 the year before.</P>
    <P>That is the picture presented by the trade returns given last night by the British.  Compare those figures with the situation that existed during the decade from 1930 to 1939 when the Fianna Fáil Government was in office. During that period the national income was stationary.  It made no progress. During the same period the British national income was increasing at a normal rate, even though at that time there was considerable unemployment following the depression.  I understand that 1½ per cent. is supposed to be the normal rate of increase.  During that period of ten years prior to the war the national income here remained stationary and agricultural output was also practically <Col N="1604" /> stationary.  A difference of 5 per cent. one way or the other was the very most.  That is the figure compared with what we have done.  Is it any wonder that the former Minister for Industry and Commerce, opening this debate for the Opposition, could only refer to the personal laziness of Ministers, rifts in the Cabinet and the fairy tales of another Minister with a few little gibes about irritation and the suggestion of a fraudulent course of action on the part of one Minister.</P>
    <P>That was the greatest tribute that could have been paid to us.  He could say nothing except to make these particular statements to which I have referred.  He asked what our transport policy was.  He accused us of delaying our transport policy.  He spoke about this White Paper that he seems to have on his brain.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cowan made a constructive speech and one with which I find myself very nearly in complete agreement. He referred in the first place, I think to housing.  In obvious sincerity and with a very deep knowledge of the difficulties involved and the problems to be met, he suggested that a state of emergency should be declared.  I think I am entitled to say that profound as the knowledge of Deputy Cowan is of <Col N="1605" /> the housing conditions in the City of Dublin, wide as his experience is, I am nearly as familiar with those conditions and the problem as he is.  If I have any personal bee in my bonnet in connection with Government policy or anything else, I have it in connection with housing.  It is the one thing that, so far as I am concerned as a private Deputy of this House, I have had the most experience of.  As a city Deputy I have had people coming to me day after day and night after night with stories that would rend your heart. It does not require the production of a play in a theatre to bring home to us the heart-breaking problems that are involved in the housing conditions in this country.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera told us this afternoon of the target that his Government had set when they came into office.  A wise man stated to me the other day while we have a very serious problem to solve in connection with housing, while we have to concentrate on what we have to do, it is worth while thinking of what, in fact, has been done since this State was set up.  Go through the outskirts of the City of Dublin and you will find the contribution that has been made by successive Governments, the Cosgrave Government as well as Deputy de Valera's Government, to the solution of the housing problem.  I want to say to Deputy Cowan and to Deputies here that everything that can humanly be done to solve the housing problem in the county of Dublin and elsewhere in Ireland will be done by this Government. While I appreciate the idea at the back of Deputy Cowan's suggestion that a state of emergency might have been declared&mdash;I think Deputy Fitzpatrick made the same suggestion some time ago in a question&mdash;I do not believe in these tags and labels being put upon situations.  I do not think it will help the problem.</P>
    <P>I had many consultations and conferences with my friend and colleague, the late Minister for Local Government, about Dublin housing.  He had some conferences with the housing committee, Mr. O'Mahony and the Dublin City Manager.  We have had consultations since with the new Minister for Local Government.  I can assure the <Col N="1606" /> Deputy that everything that can humanly be done will be done to secure houses for the people who require them in the City and County of Dublin and elsewhere.  I do not say that the machinery is perfect.  I am inclined to think myself that it is rather too complex. There is the local authority, the county council, the Dublin Corporation, the city manager, the housing committee manager and the housing committee of the Dublin Corporation and all the complex machinery that has to be put into motion for the acquisition of land. It is possible that may be simplified. If that requires to be done in order to solve the problem then I think we will try and see that it is done.</P>
    <P>Let me, for the comfort of Deputy Cowan and the other members of this House and particularly Dublin City Deputies, give some indication of the progress that is being made at present. Last year, not very much progress was made for a number of reasons such as difficulties of supply and, above all, difficulties in connection with getting skilled labour.  That was one of the problems that the late Minister for Local Government had taken into his control to solve just before he died. A few days before he died we had a conference in my office about that.  At all events, whatever lack of progress in the provision of housing may have occurred during the last year this is the position at present.  On the 30th of June this year there were under construction here in the Dublin Corporation area 2,973 houses.  I think that is a little progress from the figure that Deputy Cowan gave in his remarks yesterday.</P>

      <P>Dublin Corporation. As regards the position that existed at <Col N="1607" /> the end of last year, there were 1,507 houses under construction.  Tenders had been invited for 578 and the number employed was 1,150.  So that, in the six months the number of men employed has risen from 1,150 to 2,898.  While that is some evidence of effort, we hope that the position will become even more satisfactory as time goes on.  In the case of all local authorities throughout the country the number of houses that were in process of construction on the 30th of June of this year was 9,534.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cowan also spoke about the position as regards the unemployed. For those people of whose existence we all know, the young people leaving school and looking for employment, the only cure is more industrial activity and more industrial employment.  That constitutes a very serious problem.  The only thing I can say to Deputy Cowan is that so far as the activities of the Government and of the Minister for Industry and Commerce are concerned, they have been all directed to the creation of new industries and to the promotion of new concerns that will give employment of a productive character. It was for that reason primarily that we set up this Industrial Development Authority to advise us as to what new Irish industries could be established. Deputy de Valera criticised that at the end of his speech and said that a Minister could direct that policy in preference to a committee, as he called it. The Minister is in full control of the situation.  He is still charged with full responsibility for Irish industrial development but he has at his disposal four of the best men we could get in Ireland to advise him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do say, with all respect to the experience of Deputy de Valera, that a body of four men of that kind working as they are at present working and as they will continue to work, with complete independence of Civil Service methods and Civil Service procedure, is far more likely to produce results quickly than if we were dependent on the kind of routine stuff that went on in the Department of Industry and Commerce, examining accounts, examining propositions, creating files, having interviews and wasting time to a very large <Col N="1608" /> extent.  We want to cut that out.  We set out to get four men of independence, integrity and, above all, of proved ability in industry and finance. We have got them and we have great hopes of them, but during all the time the Minister is responsible and the Government is responsible.  This is our effort to get expert examination of proposals and expert views in regard to what new industries can be established. We have had to provide productive employment for our people, not merely the patchwork, casual employment which had existed previously. We hope to do at least something for those people about whom Deputy Cowan, as well as ourselves, is so much concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowan spoke about the cost of living.  My Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Cosgrave, answered that this morning and I, in reply to an interruption from Deputy Lemass, who asked why the cost-of-living index figure has not gone down, stated that it has gone down ten points.  The cost-of-living index figure, calculated on the old basis, has gone down by ten points. This is the lowest point reached since May, 1947.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary was not talking about clothing, but what he said, and what he proved, was that we had made a serious contribution towards bringing down the cost of living.  The Minister for Finance, in the Seanad and here also, drew attention to what had been done here in the last 12 months to remove the legacies of injustice which we inherited from our predecessors and the contributions we had made towards amelioration of these injustices.  He pointed out that we had given increased salaries to civil servants, guards and public servants and had secured increased wages for workers in every branch of industry.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In spite of that, the cost-of-living index figure calculated on the new basis has remained stationary, which is a miracle performed by the Government, and the old cost-of-living index figure has gone down by ten points.  What Deputy Cosgrave proved was that even the old cost-of-living index figure, which was a manufactured one, and from the calculation of which we have taken beer, spirits and tobacco, has gone down by ten points and the new figure has remained stationary. Deputy Cosgrave pointed out that, while wages and the cost of raw materials had increased, we had kept the cost of living stationary and that, in fact, in certain respects, it has gone down.  Moreover, the price of a large range of commodities, as indicated by Deputy Cosgrave, has been decreased and the items to which he referred in that range of commodities are not taken into account in computing the cost-of-living index figure.  We have reduced the old official cost-of-living index figure by ten points and we have removed a number of commodities from the list, such as beer, spirits and tobacco, because they were subject to taxation.  We have secured a reduction in a large range of commodities which do not enter into the computation of the cost-of-living figure.  That is some contribution, at all events, but we are not satisfied with that.  We intend to do more if we can, because we think it is essential.  We have kept away a third round of applications for wage increases and we intend to bend our energies still further in that direction. When we hear the sort of nonsense that is talked about the ten-point programme, to the effect that we did not carry it out, then we answer back and answer back effectively in the way that Deputy Cosgrave has done and in the way I have done to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lehane, Deputy Cowan and, I think, to some extent, Deputy Childers referred to the question of employment. Deputy Childers jibed at Clann na Poblachta and Labour because, he said, it was part of their policy to secure full employment for our people.  That is part of our policy, <Col N="1610" /> too, but, as Deputy Cosgrave pointed out to-day, one would think from the propaganda circulated by Fianna Fáil, and by Deputy Lemass in particular, that we had promised to fulfil the ten points of that programme the very day after we came in here.  We were not here a week until it was said that we had not fulfilled that programme.  That, of course, is good political propaganda; it is perfectly legitimate and I have no objection to it but, as I said in Galway last week, we should see, in playing a political game, that it is not played at the expense of the general good of the community.  We put forward, as a Government, a ten-point programme but we never said we would carry it out in a given time.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept Deputy de Valera's statement that it is safe to say that, because we are going to stay here until we do it.  &ldquo;Increased agricultural and industrial production&rdquo;&mdash;Deputy Cosgrave dealt with that. &ldquo;Immediate all-out drive to provide houses for the working and middle classes at reasonable rents.&rdquo;&ldquo;Luxury building to be rigidly controlled&rdquo;&mdash; that has been carried out.  &ldquo;Reduction in the cost of living&rdquo;&mdash;that has been carried out.  &ldquo;Taxation of all unreasonable profit making.&rdquo;  We stopped <Col N="1611" /> unreasonable profit making.  We stopped that class of looting that was being carried on by a section of the community.  Deputy Lemass spoke about a speech I made at a meeting of the Irish Federation of Industries. That speech was made by me after very careful consideration, and it in no way conflicts with what Deputy Norton said.  There were a certain few people here who gave a bad name to the decent industrialists of this country. I have repeatedly stated while in opposition and I have said it since I came into Government, that any Irishman, Irishwoman or Irish firm that invests his, here or their money in Irish industry and takes the risk attendant upon a certain enterprise will get every encouragement from me and the Government.  They are entitled not merely to a fair return but a good return on the capital expended by them, provided they give reasonable service to the public and consider the people whom they employ.  They must consider the quality of the goods; they must consider the people they employ to produce those goods; and they must consider the community that buy the goods from them.  Provided these three matters are attended to, then any Irish industrialist, as I said, will have nothing to fear but everything to gain from the Government.</P>
      <P>There are, however, a number of people to whom I referred during the election campaign last year as the new rich.  Everybody knows who the new rich are.  Everybody knows that these new rich are not representative of the entire personnel of Irish industrialists. May I say also that it would seem from the remarks made by Deputy de Valera a few moments ago that Irish Industry and the Irish industrial revival started in 1932?  It started long before 1932.  Some of the best industries that we have at the present time were started under Deputy McGilligan when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>

      <P>Deputy Briscoe asked me for some figures.  I must say, and I am saying it with all sincerity, that, so far as the speeches of Deputy Briscoe and Deputy Aiken are concerned, I welcome them as constructive efforts.  I am pleased to see that topics of this kind can be approached in the way they were approached.  I do not know whether Deputy Aiken will regard me in the way of the old Greek aphorism about Greeks bearing gifts&mdash;will regard me as having some sort of design upon him in giving him a passing word of praise.  Neither Deputy Briscoe nor Deputy Aiken need have the slightest apprehension. I told Deputy Briscoe at a function some time ago that I hated him with intense political hate.  I will apply it to Deputy Aiken also, if it is any balm to his soul after giving him a meed of praise for his contribution.</P>
      <P>With regard to the figures asked for by Deputy Briscoe, some of these figures cannot be given.  It is obvious that it would be impossible to give tourist figures on a monthly basis.  The other figures that he asked for with regard to volume of imports could not be given either, because the value is the common criterion of all statistics. Volume varies from tons to gallons, dozens, etc., and it would be impossible to give the figures that Deputy Briscoe asked for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said what I said about Deputy Aiken, I could not let him go with the idea that I agree with everything he said.  He produced the old <Col N="1615" /> tag that we had increased taxation by £8,000,000 instead of reducing it by £7,000,000.  That was in strict conformity with the Fianna Fáil philosophy and propaganda since the first day they were conceived and were born for the misfortune and misery of this country.  If you say a thing often enough, it will be believed no matter how ridiculous it is.</P>
    <P>I would refer Deputies to the speech that was made by the Minister for Finance in the Seanad on the occasion of the Second Reading of the Finance Bill.  That statement was produced in the Seanad by the Fianna Fáil Leader in the Seanad in all its glory exactly as it was given by Deputy Aiken here. Deputy Aiken must have passed it on to him.  It was such a good thing, it had to be given in the Seanad and repeated here to-day.  The Minister for Finance described the allegation as not merely being untrue but as an assault upon truth.  Anybody who wants to see the actual answer to this will find it all set out in Volume 36, No. 10, of the 30th June, of the Seanad Debates, column 1278.  I would like and wish that I had time to read it out because it is a most effective answer but, as I have not time, I will content myself with doing what I did in West Cork when this thing was being spattered all round West Cork that we had increased taxation by £8,000,000.  I brought down the two Books of Estimates on the last day I was there and referred to this matter of an £8,000,000 increase instead of £5,000,000 decrease and I showed that in the 1948-49 Book of Estimates prepared by our predecessors and which we had to take the figure is £70,520,477.</P>

      <P>In this year's Estimate that is £65,406,570.  I asked any person down there in West Cork to say how on earth, with those two figures, we succeeded in not merely decreasing taxation but increasing it by £8,000,000.  We had put on the face of this book of ours a figure of <Col N="1616" /> £65,406,570, which was £5,100,000 odd less than the previous figure and in addition to that we had taken £6,000,000 that even Deputy Lemass, who will not admit anything, admits has been taken off beer, tobacco and cinema seats and £1,500,000 off the income-tax payers and some other reliefs to the extent of £250,000.  By taking £7,250,000 off taxation, by reducing this figure on the outside of our book, we had, by some extraordinary process of mathematics&mdash;again perhaps Deputy de Valera will advise upon it&mdash; increased taxation by £8,000,000 and at the same time given £2,250,000 to old age pensioners.</P>

      <P>It was a most remarkable achievement if we did it and all I can say is that those people who have to bear the burden and pay the taxes are the people who know whether we increased taxation or not. Deputy Aiken may juggle with figures and may be advised by the mathematician in the Opposition.  Deputy Aiken was a Minister for Finance and is entitled to certain respect for having carried that somewhat heavy burden upon his shoulders for some time.  But it does not in any way give me any greater respect for the figures that he produces when they capsize my intellect.</P>

I would like to deal with some of the points made by Deputy Con Lehane, who made a very constructive speech in the course of this debate. Deputy Lehane asked is it wise to maintain our present link with sterling &mdash;a horrible question to put in the present circumstances.

I do not approach the consideration of our maintenance of our link with sterling with something akin to religious fervour nor do I consider the question of breaking the link with sterling as something in the nature of a crusade.  I regard this in the way I would regard any other problem I have had to face in the course of my political career, as a strictly practical proposition.

If those are the achievements of a team such <Col N="1619" /> as Deputy Lemass stated we were yesterday, a team pulling different ways, playing different games, I do not know what achievement we would have if <Col N="1620" /> we all pulled together the way Deputy Lemass thought we should.</P>

      <P>That the Estimate be reduced by £10 in respect of sub-head A (Government Information Bureau).</P>
      <P>I should perhaps explain that the amendment to reduce the amount to be voted under sub-head A of the Estimate by £10 is solely for the purpose of directing the attention of the Dáil to the administration of the Government Information Bureau.  I hope to persuade the Dáil that the administration of the Government Information Bureau is unsatisfactory.  If I do, the Dáil will presumably pass the amendment.  Its passage, however, will not merely mean that the Government will have an obligation to reduce the petty cash expenditure of the bureau by £10&mdash;it will mean that the Dáil desires the Government to abolish or to reform the Government Information Bureau.  I have not much hope that I will secure a majority for the amendment here.  If my faith is not strong enough to move the Social Welfare mountain I can hardly expect that my arguments will move the Government majority on this amendment.</P>

      <P>My case is that the Government Information Bureau is subject to criticism under three main headings.  First, it has been administered in a partisan manner&mdash;and I mean in a Party manner.  Secondly, it has frequently been inaccurate and consequently tends to mislead instead of to inform the public and thirdly it is inefficient.  I do not propose to occupy a great deal of the time of the Dáil in this regard&mdash;not as long as I could&mdash;but I will give sufficient material to Deputies to enable them to determine that these allegations against the Government Information Bureau are well founded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the 11th May last Deputy M.J. O'Higgins addressed a question to the Taoiseach&mdash;a question which was very carefully framed, probably in consultation with the Taoiseach to state the number of occasions upon which statements had been made by the Government Information Bureau or otherwise concerning the accuracy of reports which appeared in Irish daily newspapers. I direct the attention of the House to the fact that the Deputy did not ask the number of occasions upon which the Government Information Bureau or a Minister thought it necessary to correct the accuracy of reports appearing in newspapers.  His question merely concerned the accuracy of reports.  The Taoiseach gave a <Col N="1623" /> reply in which he indicated that in the case of the <i>Irish Press</i> there were 26 such statements and in the case of the other daily newspapers a very much smaller number.  Following that reply of the Taoiseach an effort was made to extract from the Government Information Bureau particulars of the 26 cases in which it was alleged statements were issued concerning the accuracy of reports in the <i>Irish Press.</i></P>

      <P>On a point of order.  The line pursued by Deputy Lemass, I think, suggests a matter of some importance from the point of view of order in this House and the propriety of dealing with certain matters. Deputy Lemass will, I think, admit that he is financially interested in the <i>Irish Press</i> inasmuch as he is the general manager.  The point of order arises, in my submission for consideration by the Chair, as to whether a Deputy of this House who has a financial interest in a business concern is entitled to use this House for the purpose of raising matters relating to that business concern.</P>

Deputy Lemass is quite entitled to raise anything he considers desirable or necessary&mdash; within the rules of order&mdash;in respect of any expenditure that is to be incurred by any Minister of State.</P>

      <P>The information supplied was that of the 26 items 15 were statements issued by the Government Information Bureau.  I have had them examined.  This is my charge against the Government and the Government Information Bureau: that they have been for some time past directing a campaign against a particular newspaper in this country&mdash;a newspaper which is politically opposed to the Government&mdash;for the purpose of discrediting it in the eyes of the public. I will content myself by saying straight away that of the 15 statements issued by the Government Information Bureau 12 of them were produced not by the inaccuracy of the reports in the <i>Irish Press</i> but by their accuracy, and represented attempts by the bureau to confuse the public mind concerning these statements by the issue of partisan propaganda about them.  One of these statements, for example, concerning the accuracy of reports in the <i>Irish Press</i> relates to the contradiction of a completely false statement that was broadcast over Radio Éireann concerning the procedure previously followed in the presentation of credentials to the Spanish Government by the Irish Ministers to Spain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be within the knowledge of the House that Radio Eireann broadcast a completely false statement in that regard.  The falsity of that statement was demonstrated by the <i>Irish Press</i>, and the Government Information Bureau issued a statement in which they admitted that the Radio Eireann statement was false.  That is one of the 26 statements issued concerning the accuracy of reports in the <i>Irish Press.</i>  Three of the statements were concerned with correcting reports in the <i>Irish Press</i> which may not have been accurate.  One related to the inadvertent use of the term &ldquo;unemployment <Col N="1625" /> assistance&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;unemployment insurance&rdquo;; one concerned an inaccurate statement that the electricity supply under the rural electrification scheme to a village in Donegal came from the Erne, when everyone knew, or should have known, that the Erne station was not yet completed; one related to a report concerning the possible acquisition of the new Córas Iompair Éireann bus depot in Store Street, concerning which there is still some element of doubt.  Every other one of the 15 statements was produced not by the inaccuracy of reports in the <i>Irish Press</i> but by their accuracy, and was concerned to explain away the statements or confuse the public mind regarding them.</P>
    <P>It is quite apparent that in the Government Information Bureau the <i>Irish Press</i> is read from cover to cover and that every single paragraph in it is noted, with a view to issuing some statement concerning it if the slightest inaccuracy appears; and I allege that the bureau does not follow the same tactics in relation to other papers.</P>

No contradiction, however, came from the bureau.  In another issue of the <i>Irish Times</i>, in a three-column heading, there was &ldquo;No Coal to be Sold Without Firewood.&rdquo;  It was not true, but no contradiction was issued from the bureau.

But if the <i>Irish Press</i> attempts to use intelligent anticipation there is a spate of statements from the Government Information Bureau forthwith.  That is an important charge against the bureau, that it is being directed on a partisan basis, deliberately used as an instrument by the Government to destroy public confidence in the reliability of reports appearing in a newspaper hostile to the Government, and that it is not being used, even when the public interest requires it, to contradict false reports when they appear in papers which are favourable to the Government.</P>
      <P>I said they are inaccurate.  Last year, the Minister for Industry and Commerce received a deputation from the Federation of Irish Manufacturers and subsequently a report of the proceedings at that meeting was issued to the Press by the bureau.  In the report, there appeared a statement, attributed to the president of the Federation of Irish Manufacturers, to the effect that the statement made at the meeting by the Minister for Industry and Commerce was</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the most important statement made about Irish industrial development for the past 20 years.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, the publication of that report naturally caused a certain amount of dissension and discussion within the Federation of Irish Manufactureres, which is a non-political organisation. It was revealed there that there was no journalist present at the meeting, that there was no evidence of any report being prepared, and that the report issued by the bureau must have been prepared subsequently.  At the meeting of the council of the federation, where the matter was discussed, the president of the federation&mdash;who is, as the Minister for External Affairs knows, not now a supporter of this Party&mdash;denied that he made that statement. It is an extraordinary use of the Government Information Bureau if it can be made the instrument of attributing to people who occupy important positions in various organisations <Col N="1627" /> such as the Federation of Irish Manufacturers, statements which they did not make and the publication of which as having been made by those individuals is bound to cause, not merely embarrassment to them but dissension within the organisations for which they speak.</P>
    <P>I do not want to refer at any length to the issue by the bureau of the document concerning &ldquo;the Man of Destiny&rdquo;. That has been discussed here; but I think that most Deputies who heard the Taoiseach's explanation as to how that statement came to be published must have been appalled at the evidence of inefficiency within the bureau's administration. Is it true that the officers of the bureau have no responsibility for checking the accuracy or the suitability of any statement that they issue?  Can any Minister or any civil servant of any Department send a document, particularly a long document, to the Government Information Bureau requesting its publication and secure its publication without the director or any officer of the bureau taking the precaution of reading it and reporting to the Taoiseach his views as to its suitability for publication?  Is there any shifting process in the bureau?  The Taoiseach is responsible to the Dáil for it.  He should at least ensure that the officers of that branch of his organisation have got specific instructions as to the use that is to be made of that service.  It seems extraordinary that, in error, an official of the Department of External Affairs could arrange for the stencilling of a long document of a contentious character, relating to the Minister for External Affairs, transfer it to the Government Information Bureau for circulation to newspapers and have it circulated, without there being somebody at some stage of the process whose duty it was to check up on the suitability of that document for issue by the bureau.  I hope that, as a result of that incident or as a result of this discussion, there will be instituted in the bureau some more regular system of supervision which will prevent a repetition of that incident in the future.  Mind you, it has not, so far as I know, occurred yet because we had some other statements from the <Col N="1628" /> Government Information Bureau this morning in relation to matters affecting this House, no doubt prepared by the Minister for External Affairs, and issued by the bureau that the News Agency Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It was a question of our granting facilities.</P>

      <P>When the Government Whips indicated that the Committee Stage of the News Agency Bill was not going to be proceeded with we granted facilities for which the Government Whips should be grateful and which made it possible for the business of the Dáil to be concluded this week. <Col N="1629" /> If there is to be misrepresentation of our position; if it is said that we obstructed and prevented the Committee Stage of the News Agency Bill from being taken in this session, I repudiate that completely.  As far as we were concerned, there was no reluctance to remain in session here until all the business which it was desired to do was completed.  It was the Government Whips who wanted to conclude the business this week.  I do not say that we were averse to the conclusion of the business, and as soon as that became practicable by the contraction of the Government programme we did give facilities to the Government Whips.  I object to the Government Information Bureau being used as an instrument by which a completely misleading statement is issued, whether it is prepared in the bureau or by the Taoiseach.  I cannot think that the Taoiseach had any protracted consultation with his Parliamentary Secretary or with the Government Whips before it was issued.</P>
      <P>Anyway, that is the sum total of the case I am making against the Government Information Bureau.  I think it is desirable that the Government of this State should have some organisation for supplying the people and the newspapers of the country with impartial and accurate information, but that organisation becomes a menace when it is used for the other purpose of supplying partisan statements and inaccurate information.  I submit that the evidence I have adduced here provides proof without doubt that the Government Information Bureau was used as an instrument in partisan controversy and was inaccurate in some of its statements and that there were defects in the organisation which should be remedied and which obviously permitted of the issue through it of a statement which even the Taoiseach admits should not come from it.  Unless he gives us an assurance that the defects and weaknesses in the Government Information Bureau are going to be remedied and remedied at once, there is no alternative but to divide the Dáil upon this motion.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lemass used the phrase a moment ago that that <Col N="1630" /> was the sum and substance of the charge against the Government Information Bureau.  There was neither sum nor substance in the charge.  The charge was founded on an answer given by me to a question put down by Deputy O'Higgins on the 11th May. Deputy Lemass with his usual <i>suggestio falsi</i> suggested that that was done by Deputy O'Higgins in collusion with me.  It was not.  The answer was prepared by the officers of one section of my Department, which was not the Government Information Bureau.  What is this charge against the Government Information Bureau? That the officials read the <i>Irish Press</i> from cover to cover daily?  They earn their money very hard indeed if they do that every day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what he has complained of.  That was the sum of Deputy Lemass's charge against the Government Information Bureau, that it was apparent that the Government Information Bureau read the <i>Irish Press</i> from cover to cover every day. He said that with venom in his voice. I am very sorry for my officials who have that chore to do every day.  They have to do that, as they have to read every other daily newspaper and provincial newspaper as well.  That is their job, or at least it is the job of some official in the Government Information Bureau.  That is the charge.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why the Government Information Bureau is supposed to be partisan.  Deputy Lemass based his charge on that and on inquiries about the 26 cases of inaccuracy in the <i>Irish Press.</i>  What evidence is there of partisanship?  I cannot follow it.  If there were a criminal charge of this kind, if a judge were hearing the case and if it had to be referred to a jury, he would withdraw it as there was no evidence.  I do not know what the evidence is on that now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the &ldquo;Man of Destiny&rdquo; article, I explained that in an answer that I gave on the 17th May to a question put down by Deputy <Col N="1631" /> Boland.  The Minister for External Affairs wrote a letter to Deputy de Valera the minute he heard of the mistake that had taken place.</P>

      <P>It was issued by the bureau and I am going to deal with that.  When I gave the answer to the question which was put down, Deputy de Valera did not make any comment. He waits until this motion is on to bolster up an unsustainable case put up by Deputy Lemass.  I referred to a supplementary question by Deputy Boland as to whether the Director of the Government Information Bureau had responsibility.  Certainly he had responsibility to make inquiries, and he did so.  He was told that the reason he had to do it was that it was the Minister for External Affairs' direction and he did it because it was the Minister's positive direction.  He did his job as a civil servant, and he is a civil servant.  He saw that this was not the type of thing that should be issued by the Government Information Bureau and he issued it only because of the fact that when he drew the attention of the official involved to it he was told that there was a direction and he acted on the Minister's direction.</P>

      <P>He came on to another question, that of the communiqué issued last night. It was issued by me, in consultation with my colleagues, but I took the initiative and I take the responsibility.

But here we find Deputy Lemass using a quibble in connection with this matter&mdash;that they were prepared, when the Government Whip intimated that the Government were going on with this Bill, to facilitate the Government.

Therefore, I stand over every word in the communication that was issued last night.  Most of that communication was drafted by me, and it was issued on my instructions with the consent of every one of my colleagues.  I knew that my colleague, the Minister for External Affairs, wanted this Bill for Partition and nothing else.  If Partition had not been involved, we would not have considered an official agency Bill at all. Deputy Lemass spoke as a writer in the <i>Irish Press</i> and defended the <i>Irish Press,</i> stating at the same time that it is a hostile organ to this Government.

    <Title>Supplementary Estimate. - Vote 41&mdash;Local Government.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Keyes) Michael Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Keyes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a Supplementary sum not exceeding £1,500,000 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1950, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Local Government, including Grants to Local Authorities, Grants and other Expenses in connection with Housing and Miscellaneous Grants.</P>
      <P>The first item of the Supplementary Estimate is a sum of £250,000 on sub-head (3) of the Vote for the Department of Local Government for the current financial year.  That sub-head provides the grants for new houses built by private persons for their own occupation and by public utility societies for their members, grants for reconstruction in rural areas and recoupment of two-thirds of the letting grants made by local authorities.</P>
      <P>The Supplementary Estimate is necessitated by the extension of the statutory maximum of £580,000 contained in Section 26 of the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1948, and the authority given by the Oireachtas in the Housing (Amendment) Bill, 1949, for the extension of that maximum to £1,750,000.</P>
      <P>In the recent debates on the Second Stage of the Housing (Amendment) Bill, 1949, the House favoured me with a number of considered and helpful views on the general scope of existing housing legislation.  The amount now required will, at the present rate of expenditure, meet requirements up to about the end of October next.  I would like then to consider the rate of progress further and to give the Dáil an opportunity for considering the further provision to be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second item in this Supplementtary Estimate is £1,250,000 for the making of grants to local authorities <Col N="1638" /> for works carried out under the Local Authorities (Works) Bill, 1949.  The Act confers powers on local authorities to execute works affording relief or protection from flooding, landslide, subsidence and similar occurrences in relation to their own property and to other public property which they are required by law to maintain; they may also do similar work in relation to property not owned or maintained by them if they are of opinion that it is in the public interest to do so.</P>
    <P>My Department will give the terms of the Act a generous interpretation, but I have asked local authorities to confine their proposals for the present to works which will involve no elaborate surveys or heavy machinery and which can be carried out within the present financial year.  The local authorities have put forward a variety of works of lasting utility widely dispersed over the areas.  These works, in addition to being works of permanent improvement will add substantially to the volume of rural employment. I would, therefore, ask Deputies to agree to this Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point I would like the Minister to clarify.  Did I understand him to say that the additional amount provided under the Housing (Amendment) Act will carry on the work of the Department in that respect to the end of October next and that at that stage another Supplementary Estimate will be required?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise one matter in connection with the Works Bill. The total amount of the reduction in the road grants was over £2,000,000. That would mean roughly something like 13 or 14 weeks' employment for the road workers in this country.  The Minister is now providing only £1,250,000.  I suggest to him that that will not fill the gap and that there will be unemployment amongst road workers unless that gap is bridged by the other £1,000,000 taken away this year by the reduction in the road grant.  There is a gap of £1,000,000 and that gap will mean further unemployment in the rural areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one matter in reference to the Supplementary Estimate in connection with the Local Authorities (Works) Bill that I would like to mention.  In his statement today the Minister said, and this statement has been made before, that this Bill is primarily designed to ease rural flooding.  I pointed out in a recent debate that by easing rural flooding we are likely to make flooding in the urban areas more imminent, particularly in the low-lying urban areas.</P>
      <P>I know it is not for the Minister to take the initiative in any scheme, but not being a member of a local authority, I take this opportunity of urging that the claim of Cork City in this respect should not be ignored. During the flooding last December several areas in Cork City were under water.  In many cases that flooding could have been obviated if certain works had been carried out.  These works would have cost very little.  Two or three areas were under water and one of those areas was Blackpool.  I put down a question about this some time ago.  I realised then and I know now that legislation is not likely to compensate the people who suffer hardship as a result of such floods.  I appeal to the Minister not to deal only with the rural areas in the administration of this fund.  I urge upon him that he must appreciate that the easing of flooding in the rural areas may mean more flooding in the urban areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister and his Department requested each county surveyor to submit a list of simple schemes in connection with the Works Bill.  As a member of a local authority which submitted quite a number of these Schemes, I would like to know what has happened as a result of that request. I have been informed that only a section of these works, as requested by the Department, have been forwarded from our county and I would like to have a check-up on that matter if it is at all possible.  Can the Minister inform me as to the extent to which the county surveyor has complied with his request.  The question of simple schemes clearly indicates that the Minister will pursue a long-term policy in regard to these works.  I take <Col N="1640" /> it that the £1,000,000 referred to will only cover portion of the programme. As far as we are concerned in county Kerry the list of schemes we submitted will cost approximately £70,000 to £80,000.  I take it that if the surveyor acts on the request of the Department now to send up a list of simple schemes they will only represent a fraction of what we originally submitted.  This £1,000,000, therefore, will only cover the programme for a certain period. Next October, as indicated by Deputy Corry, we will be looking for another £1,000,000 if all the schemes submitted by Kerry and other counties are to be considered as early as possible.  We are anxious about these schemes and we do not want to leave anything undone, either by the engineers or anyone else, which would prevent the work being carried out according to plan. We would like to be informed as to whether the schemes we have submitted to the county councils will be submitted to the Department immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to know from the Minister who is to make the selection from the list of schemes submitted to him that are to be undertaken immediately, and who will allocate or determine the amount of money to be spent on each scheme?  When will those schemes commence?  It is important that county councils should know whether the selection is to be made by the county engineer, the county manager, or by the Minister, and who will determine the amount of money to be allocated on each individual scheme. We would like to have that information if the Minister can give it to us because it is important that local authorities should have it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>So far, there is no shortage of schemes and there is no shortage in the amount of money we have estimated to cover these schemes. They are mostly in the rural and county areas and we have not very much from the civic areas.  There is no reason why there should be.  The estimates of the schemes will be submitted by the local authority engineers for consideration by the engineers of the Department.  We have asked that the general run of schemes will be <Col N="1641" /> on the simplest possible lines and the councils have adopted that measure now.  Elaborate schemes are to be put in the background and the simple utility schemes are to come to the front, where there is simple engineering and the maximum of labour.  That will enable us to meet that deficiency that is spoken of in the Road Fund grant.</P>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Corry, the total as I understand it, deducted from the Road Fund was in the region of £2,000,000.  There is £1,250,000 provided here.  We want to utilise the months that are left, to make the most of the good weather to get this work going.  I cannot guarantee that it is going to close the gap completely, but as far as we have gone schemes have been submitted by the local authorities from the Twenty-Six Counties.  I feel that there will not be very much gap in the way of unemployment between this way, taken as a substitute, and the way taken by the road grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister able to to guarantee that he will come in here for a fund to fill that gap, if necessary?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows as well as I do that that particular £2,000,000 was taken from the peak contribution of the Road Fund.  The normal contribution up to two years before this was nothing at all like it. In the two years previous the amount granted by the Road Fund was practically on a par level with what had been contributed then.  When the Road Fund was completed during the emergency, emergency grants were given. That could not be maintained indefinitely. It is not quite right to say the £2,000,000 deducted from that was deducted from a normal Road Fund. It was deducted from an excessive or, at any rate, an emergency fund.  I estimate that this will be a very useful measure to relieve unemployment, to permit the local authorities to start work in order to give more work to labourers.</P>

It is this year, as usual, to authorise the issue from the Central Fund of the balance of the amount granted to meet the cost of the supply services for the financial year.  That is Section 2.  Section 4&mdash;appropriation of sums voted for supply services&mdash;is for the services granted by the Dáil. Section 3 is the usual borrowing section and Section 1 is an extra provision this year because of the excess Vote for Forestry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just two things I want to mention.  First of all, will the Minister for Finance tell the Taoiseach that the amount we are appropriating now for supply services is £69,703,288 1s. 6d.  He appears to be under the impression that the cost of supply services this year is going to be a great deal less than that. Secondly, I wonder would the Minister for Finance reply to a question that the Taoiseach avoided?  He knows as well as anyone else in this House that the position of sterling and our attitude to developments regarding sterling is a matter of particular delicacy and interest at the present time.  I want to know if the statement made yesterday by the Minister for Agriculture in which he suggested, or appeared to suggest, that he was advocating the devaluation or the revaluation of sterling, was made by him as a Minister stating Government policy or by Deputy Dillon as an individual whom we may disregard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is for me to tell the Taoiseach anything with regard to the amount of the supply services.  The Taoiseach is fully aware of the amount proposed and fully aware of the economies that have been made in the two years and the reductions in taxation made possible thereby.  The matter of sterling is so delicate and of such interest to us that I would not care to enter into any controversy on that at the moment.  I note the Deputy's phrase that Deputy Dillon appeared to suggest devaluation. I did not get that impression from what he is reported to have said.</P>

  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Committee on Finance. - Price of Farmers'" RHead="Butter&mdash;Motion. (Resumed)">
    <Title>Committee on Finance. - Price of Farmers' Butter&mdash;Motion. (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That the Dáil is of opinion that the price of farmers' butter should be guaranteed by the Government at a price which will give the producer the same return for his milk as that received by the creamery suppliers.  (Deputies Allen and Beegan.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make the point that it appears to be both fair and equitable that the producer of milk should get the same reward whether he is making farmers' butter or supplying milk to a creamery, and the object of this motion is to see that roughly the same return is given.  Up to two years ago, when this Government took office, the position was that the maker of farmers' butter was provided with a subsidy which gave him roughly the same return for his milk as the farmer supplying milk to a creamery.  The position has been changed within the last two years.  The subsidy has ceased on farmers' butter and, as has been mentioned by previous speakers, the price realised for fresh butter made by the farmer in his own home during the greater part of the year was about 1/6 or 1/7 per lb. That means, in fact, that the farmer who is making butter in his home is getting the equivalent to about 6d. or 7d. per gallon for his milk while the farmer who brings his milk to a <Col N="1645" /> creamery is getting 1/2&mdash;twice as much.  I do not want to give the House the impression that the creamery producer is getting too much. As a matter of fact, on a previous occasion here, I did argue that the producer of milk for the creamery, who had his price fixed in May, 1947, was entitled to an increase in the price he is getting because his costs have increased very substantially since May, 1947.  But even taking the price the producer of milk for the creamery is getting, the maker of farmers' butter is not treated by any means equally favourably.</P>
      <P>I presume that Deputies are aware that there is a subsidy paid to the creameries which enables them to pay this price for milk.  Otherwise, at the present price charged to the consumer of butter, they could not pay 1/2 a gallon.  The amount paid out in subsidy is fairly substantial&mdash;over £2,000,000 a year.  As we know, it takes a fair amount of collecting to raise £2,000,000 a year in this country and it is quite a substantial burden on the taxpayer, whatever particular tax may be earmarked.  Generally speaking, taxes in this country are fairly equally distributed.  Every consumer, particularly if he consumes tobacco or alcohol, is a substantial taxpayer and the farmer who is making farmers' butter has to pay taxation like everybody else.  It is certainly very unfair that such a farmer should be taxed to pay a subsidy to the creamery supplier when he gets no subsidy himself.  I do not know how anybody, the Minister for Agriculture or those who support him, can defend a policy under which this differentiation is made between the two types of butter.  For that reason, Deputy Allen and Deputy Beegan have put down this motion in order to give Deputies an opportunity of saying to the Minister by their votes that they believe this system is unfair. I would appeal to Deputies to vote for the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, to the beginning of 1948, when the change of Government took place, a subsidy was paid on farmers' butter as well as on creamery butter so that the two types of farmers, the farmer who made butter in his own home and the farmer who sent his milk <Col N="1646" /> to the creamery, were treated on an equal basis.  By means of that subsidy the merchants who bought farmers' butter in the fresh butter market were in a position to pay 2/10 per lb. for farmers' butter.  The price of 1/6 or 1/7 a lb. that was paid for the greater part of this year, shows a very big change from that.  In May, 1948, an announcement was made by the Government that the subsidy on farmers' butter was being dropped. Practically every Minister in the new Government at that time had to show some economy in his Department. Some of them scrapped short-wave stations, some of them scrapped mineral exploration and so on, and the Minister for Agriculture, evidently, agreed in this economy drive to drop the subsidy on farmers' butter.  I think it was very unfair that he should have done so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In dealing with this motion, the Minister gave bad butter as one of the reasons for his very unfair attitude in dropping the subsidy on farmers' butter.  I do not think that is a sufficient answer for any Minister to give because, if the butter was bad, it was the Minister's business to see that it was graded; that only butter of good quality should get the top price and that the price should be scaled down as the quality became inferior.  Another suggestion which he made was that we should build creameries.  We have quite a lot of creameries.</P>

      <P>I will give you Shelburne. Even if it were possible to have creameries maintained in every area, it would take quite a considerable time to have them constructed and put into operation.  But everybody must realise that it would not be possible to maintain creameries in certain areas, because there is a certain supply of milk necessary to make a creamery economic.  It is generally accepted that for a central creamery you must have at least a couple of thousand gallons of milk in the peak period, and for every auxillary creamery, 1,200 or 1,500 gallons.  The area may be taken then, and it could be quite easily worked out whether creameries can be maintained in the areas or not.  I think, however, that it will be found that creameries cannot be maintained in certain areas because there will not be sufficient milk for them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I say that it is not possible to have creameries erected everywhere. We must therefore assume, so far as the Minister is concerned, that he has no solution of the problem for farmers who make butter in districts where it will not be possible to erect creameries, and the only solution is to sacrifice them and to say to them in fact: &ldquo;If there is no creamery available, then go out of butter production.&rdquo; Of course, if they go out of butter production it means they must go out of cows.  In a recent census taken on this question it was found that about half the cows in the country were in non-creamery areas.  Therefore, we are really dealing with half the number of cows in the country, and under the Minister's policy, if he succeeds in going on with it, he is going to make it impossible for the farmers who are the owners of half the cows in the country to carry on.</P>

      <P>The Minister ought to be satisfied with the hour's speech that he made; at least he ought to be satisfied with the time he occupied, but I do not think he should be satisfied with the speech he made; he should be ashamed of it.  Another thing with which we should tax the Minister is that about last April he increased the butter ration.  At that time I questioned him in the Dáil as to the wisdom of increasing the ration.  I put it to the Minister that it would be better not to increase the ration at that particular time, because we were facing two or three months during which there would be a big surplus of farmers' butter, and if the ration was left at the level at which it had been, there would be a demand for more farmers' butter than if the ration was increased.  The Minister said on May 18th in this House, as reported in column 1503 of the Official Reports, that he was absolutely certain that the ration could be maintained.  Two days ago he was asked a question about the ration and he said that he hoped it could be maintained. I do not know whether the Minister deliberately chose his words two days ago, but he certainly used different words from those he used on May 15.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I can relieve the Deputy's mind by saying that he will get his butter as regularly as the clock until next April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all right.  If the Minister is certain that the ration will be maintained, as he appears to be, all I can say is that he was justified in increasing the ration in April.  If, however, there was any doubt about it, the Minister should not have increased the ration at that time; he should have left the ration a bit lower so that a certain amount of farmers' butter would be absorbed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I claim that the Minister did not put up any good argument why the motion should not be accepted.  Deputy Allen argued that, in all fairness, the maker <Col N="1649" /> of farmers' butter should get a return for his milk equivalent to that received by the person supplying the creamery, especially as the creamery supplier was being subsidised.  Deputy Cogan, who spoke after Deputy Allen, said that he could see nothing in this motion to which anybody could object, and I think that any fair-minded person would take up the same attitude.  But the Minister put up no cogent argument in reply.  The only two arguments that anyone could see in his long speech were (1) that the butter was bad; (2) that these people should have creameries.  Nobody will claim that all the butter is bad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody ever did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If all the butter is not bad, then it is unfair to victimise the maker of good butter because some people are making bad butter.  The Minister could very well have produced a scheme under which a top price could be paid for good butter and the maker of bad butter penalised to whatever extent might be necessary. Therefore, I do not think that that argument could convince anybody to vote against the motion.  I have already dealt with the question of the creameries by saying that it is absolutely impossible to provide creameries in many parts of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is incorrigible in his statements.  He knows very well that over the greater part of the country the creameries, the chocolate crumb factories and the dried milk factories are not going to be provided for many years.  Having talked about these two matters.  The Minister went on to throw a great deal of mud.  He tried to convince his followers in the Dáil that Deputy Allen and Deputy Beegan brought in this motion for political motives.  If the Opposition thinks that something can be done other than what the Government have done, or <Col N="1650" /> that something should be done to make the Government change a decision, and if they believe that what they say is right, surely they have a perfect right to come here and argue the question. It is the business of the Government, the Minister and everybody else, to answer arguments but not to throw mud and talk about lousers as he did in this debate.  That was one of the expressions used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the Minister's argument against the motion.  It must be obvious to any fair-minded person that two Fianna Fáil Deputies putting down this motion, only asking for what the Fianna Fáil Government had done when they were in office, are not going further than any Deputy should go. Surely if Deputies on the Fianna Fáil side, believing that the Fianna Fáil Government took the right course with regard to farmers' butter when they were in office, put down a motion asking the Dáil to approve of going back to the Fianna Fáil policy on farmers' butter, should not be treated as they were treated by the Minister, should be treated with good argument and not with this scurrility that was indulged in by the Minister the other night.</P>
      <P>The Minister concluded his speech the other night by saying he was going to fight.  The knock-out blow was to call this a lousy political manoeuvre. If that is the sort of fighting the Minister is going to indulge in and if it is the sort of fighting the Minister has ever indulged in, he is welcome to it. If he is going to fight on these lines, we are not going to pit our strength against him in that sort of fight; we will get some fishwife to take him on. That is the only sort of person who should take him on in that type of scurrility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we believe the Minister is not doing the right thing, we are in a democratic Parliament.  The Minister <Col N="1651" /> talks very volubly about the democratic system, about the freedom of the individual, the freedom of the Deputy and all that sort of thing, and then when we come along and exercise our right in putting down a motion, which is not a frivolous motion, and in which we are not asking for any more than the Fianna Fáil Government did when they were in office, we are answered with vilification and scurrility and not with argument.  If the Minister thinks that these tactics are good, it is time that some of the Deputies who are supporting him should show him that they want argument and not that type of answer to a motion like this.</P>
    <P>The Minister wound up by saying he wants us to co-operate with him. How can we co-operate with him in a matter like farmers' butter when we believe that he has acted altogether wrongly, not only wrongly in policy, but, as we believe, absolutely unjustly to a certain section of farmers, and he dismisses those who will not co-operate as being guilty of political manoeuvring. He wants those of us, as he puts it, who are out for the good of this country to co-operate.  We are not going to co-operate with the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>The Minister asked me about Shelburne.  On a former occasion here he accused Deputy Allen of having some sinister part in the <Col N="1652" /> closing of the creamery by Shelburne Co-operative and he came back with the same charge here two nights ago. How he got that into his head I do not know because he must have known that there was absolutely no foundation for it.  He says that if Shelburne had carried on there would be no farmers' butter problem in the County Wexford. Shelburne Co-operative with its auxiliaries covers at the outside five parishes, which is roughly about one-sixth or one-seventh part of the County Wexford so that even if the Shelburne Co-operative had carried on the problem would still exist.  Not only would the problem be in Wexford but it would be in many parts of Ireland.  As Deputy Allen pointed out the other night, there are very few creameries in Leinster and very few creameries in most of the Connaught counties and in all these counties of Leinster and some of the Connaught counties there is the problem of what the farmer is going to do when he has surplus butter.  Many farmers, of course, aim at having enough milk and butter for their own household and have a surplus only for a certain period and their problem is not very big but there are other farmers outside the creamery areas who keep a fair number of cows&mdash;20 to 24 cows perhaps&mdash;and who have kept them up to this for the purpose of selling butter. These particular farmers who have kept cows so that they may be able to market the produce in the form of butter cannot see any future before them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no creameries in many counties.  In fact, as I said, about one-half of the cows&mdash;this was the case some years ago; it may not be altogether half now&mdash;but say six or seven or eight years ago about half the cows in this county were non-creamery cows.  It is not a County Wexford problem alone.  I know, for instance, that there is surplus butter in County Wicklow, where I live at the moment.  There is surplus butter in many of these counties and the owners of these cows will have to see what arrangement they may make if they cannot sell the surplus butter at some reasonable price.</P>
      <P>Coming back to the Shelburne Co-operative, even, as I said, if it was not closed it would not solve the problem for four-fifths of the Co. Wexford. Other creameries were opened at the same time as the Shelbourne Cooperative&mdash;one in Tullamore, one in Carlow, one in Roscrea and, I think, on in Balla, County Mayo.  They were all opened at that time and I think they have practically all failed because the milk supply was not there.  After the Minister made this statement in the Dáil some few months ago Mr. Simon Murphy, general manager and secretary of Shelburne Co-operative Society, Limited, wrote a letter on June 3rd in which he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister for Agriculture during the recent debates in the Dáil on farmers' butter made a statement with regard to the Shelburne Co-operative. Mr Allen, Deputy for Wexford, is not in any way associated with our society, either as shareholder or as consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1654" />&ldquo;The facts in connection with the closing of the creamery department are: This department, with its entire equipment, was, through German action, completely destroyed by bombing in August, 1940.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What compensation did they get?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Listen to this.  It was destroyed in August and this letter goes on:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In September, 1940, re-building and re-equipping started&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&mdash;whatever compensation they got they did not get it at that time, anyway&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;and early in the following year we were in a position to accept milk supplies and manufacture butter.  In the interval between the bombing and re-building the suppliers in the area served&mdash;in compliance with the wishes of the Department of Agriculture&mdash;increased the area under tillage and reduced the number of milch cows, with the result that the supply of milk for the creamery ceased.  The committee of management circularised all suppliers that the creamery was now in a position to accept milk, but only four suppliers indicated their willingness to supply.  Notwithstanding this, the creamery and equipment were kept available for a further year in the hope that the supply would increase. This did not materialise, and the committee had no option but to close down.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That letter appeared in the <i>Irish Press</i> of June 3rd.</P>

He has no more <Col N="1656" /> regard for the truth&mdash;but perhaps I had better leave it at that.  I want to make this point: Farmers' butter has been made in this country for centuries &mdash;many centuries, I suppose&mdash;and the strange thing is that, when a person gets up to talk against farmers' butter, he usually says: &ldquo;I like it myself when I get it good, but a lot of it is not too good at all.  We all know that there is good farmers' butter, very nicely flavoured, with good body and so on, and we all like to get it when we can&rdquo;. It does take good technicians in the farmer's house to make good butter. The milking must be done in a clean manner, with great cleanliness.  If it is going to the creamery, the farmer does not think he should take such great care, but if he is going to make his own butter, he must, because he will not have good butter otherwise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister cannot listen <Col N="1658" /> to anybody.  He thinks he must be right and that he must interrupt.  He should have a little manners.  There must be cleanliness in the making of farmers' butter.  The vessels must be clean.  There must be cleanliness in the separating, which the farmer does himself. There must be cleanliness in the care of the cream and in the churning and in the making of butter, for which very much more knowledge, workman-Ship and experience is necessary than is required for the milking of cows and the sending of the milk to a creamery. It is a great pity that we should destroy this industry and that we should kill the tradition and the pride in good workmanship that farmers and their families in this country had in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, I ask the members of the Dáil on either side of the House to consider the arguments which have been put up on this motion.  The arguments on this side are that it is only justice to give the same price for good farmers' butter as you are giving for the creamery butter.  If you want to penalise the man who is making bad butter, all right.  The second point is that if you do not do something to give the man who makes farmers' butter a return for his butter he cannot, in many instances, possibly maintain the number of cows he has at the moment.  It will mean less cows in the country if this policy goes on. Against these arguments I have been trying to pick out arguments from the Minister's speech and the only two arguments I could find were firstly, that a lot of bad butter is made.  I submit that that is no argument because that state of affairs could be dealt with by penalising the maker of bad butter. The second argument against the motion was that they should get creameries only.  Until they get creameries let us preserve this industry and the cows that are there so that the cows will be there when the creameries come.  There is not much use in doing away with the cows now and coming along later and saying that the cows are not there to support the creamery. Any fair-minded person must see that the arguments for the motion are logical and good and that the arguments <Col N="1659" /> against it do not hold water at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all I should like to draw the attention of the House to the statement which was made and repeated by Deputy Dr. Ryan&mdash;who was a Minister for Agriculture for some years&mdash;to the effect that a great many of our farmers make good butter and that any farmers who makes bad butter should be penalised by giving him a lower price for it.  I thought it was the policy of the Department of Agriculture to make nothing but good butter.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it was the late Kevin O'Higgins who said that what we wanted was a consistently good standard.  Instead of penalising the farmer who makes bad butter I think he should be prosecuted.  He should not get off by merely saying to him: &ldquo;I will give you 2d. or 3d. less for your butter.&rdquo;  I am not a farmer at all, I am just a man of common sense. This Government spends tens of thousands of pounds every year in paying agricultural instructors, domestic economy instructresses, horticultural instructors, and so forth.  For what? Is it not to educate our people to produce the best article that can be produced? Yet we have Deputy Dr. Ryan getting up in this House and stating not once but twice that the only thing that he would do in the case of a farmer who brings bad butter to the market would be to reduced the price by 2d. or 3d.  In other words, he does not care three straws what type of butter is sold to the poor people in the back streets of our towns and cities. I hope that Deputy Dr. Ryan, when he forgets his political enmity and comes down to consider what he has said, will get up in this House and withdraw that statement.  I think it is an awful statement&mdash;particularly coming from one who occupied the very high position of Minister for Agriculture in this State for at least five years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, I do not profess to be an expert but I will say, in regard to farmers' butter, that I am one of those who never believe in control if it can possibly be avoided, and, above all, control of butter.  If my memory serves me correctly I think that at one period when farmers' butter was controlled and a subsidy was given by the Government there was an agitation in this country and the Government was asked to decontrol the sale of farmers' butter.  The argument that was put up at that time was that if farmers; butter were decontrolled the price would go up.  Is that a fact, or is it not?  Was it not advocated in this House that if farmers' butter were decontrolled the price would go up and, when it was decontrolled, and the price went down, the Minister was criticised?  But when it was decontrolled I maintain that the price did go up.</P>
      <P>It may be, at certain times of the year, that butter has come down to say, 2/-, 1/8, and, possibly, 1/6, but, as a Deputy representing Louth&mdash;which is just as good a farming county as any to be found in Ireland&mdash;I can say that there are very few people in Dundalk or in the surrounding districts who have got butter under 2/6 or 3/- a lb., and that farmers' butter when it was decontrolled&mdash;and when I say farmers' butter I mean butter in the strict sense of the term for which there is and always will be a ready market at a remunerative price&mdash;has been sold not alone at 2/6 but at 3/6, 4/6, 5/- and even 6/-.  Six shillings a lb. !</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us be honest and admit that there is always a question of an up and down in prices at certain times of the year.  What is the use of talking nonsense?  Had we not last year the question of potatoes?  Do Deputies not agree that it is better to have double the quantity of anythings than to have a scarcity and that there should be full and plenty of everything?  If, at a particular time of <Col N="1661" /> the year the price of butter, potatoes, or any other agricultural produce, even cattle, comes down, well, there are times when the price will go up again. Taking the year all round, with the exception of a few weeks, possibly, in the months of June and July&mdash;as far as I know, and I am only giving my experience&mdash;there has been no such thing as farmers' butter: at 1/6 or 2/- a lb.  Again, on the subject of farmers' butter, I understand and I have always understood from statistics given in this House that the major portion of the butter manufactured by farmers is used in their own households and that the quantity for sale in the markets in our town and cities is a very small percentage of the total quantity of the country butter that is produced in the country.  Am I to understand now that if any farmer has a little surplus of any commodity a Government is to be called upon&mdash;and when I say &ldquo;a Government&rdquo; I do not care whether it be a Coalition Government or a Fianna Fáil Government&mdash;to pass legislation day by day and week by week in order that farmers' prices will be regulated.  Is it not ridiculous to expect that that would be so? How can that be done?  Taking everything into consideration, I do not think there is any necessity for this motion. In the long run, the farmer is better with a free market.  I do not want to see a repetition of the scenes I witnessed for the last four or five years when farmers' butter was controlled. The Civic Guards, fine manly men that they are, had to follow unfortunate people to find out where they were selling the butter as they dare not sell it 1d. a lb. over the stipulated price. The mover and seconder should withdraw this motion and let butter be sold on the free market, without any control, just as the farmer was accustomed to sell it in the years preceding 1914.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am as interested as anyone else in seeing that the farmer gets a good price for his produce, but I do not subcribe to passing legislation every other day because a certain article is sold at some price at which some Deputies think it should not be sold, saying that that is bad for the country in general.  It is not.  The farmer is <Col N="1662" /> not fool.  He is keeping his cows, notwithstanding the speeches here to-night and previously.  You cannot get over facts.  Forget for a moment that Deputy Dillon is the Minister for Agriculture&mdash;the figures he has given prove that the terrible things Fianna Fáil said would happen if a guaranteed price were not given have not happened. The production of milk has gone up by leaps and bounds in the last three or four months.  In the face of that, what is the use in Deputy Dr. Ryan or others saying that, unless aid is given to this section of farmers who find themselves in temporary difficulty through having a little surplus butter, they are going to go out of the business of keeping dairy cows?  Everyone knows that farmers do not keep cows for the production of butter alone. There are many by-products which can be turned in to money.  You can not say the farmers keeps 20 or 30 cows for the sole purpose of making his living by producing butter from their milk.</P>
    <P>On the whole, the mover and seconder of this motion have not made a case for Government intervention. There are always ups and downs under any Government, and that cannot be cured by legislation.  The farmer is quite content.  If a free vote were taken to-morrow of the farmers of the Twenty-Six Counties, an overwhelming majority would vote in favour of decontrolling butter, leaving things as they are.  The farmer will take his chance in seeing that he gets a good price for butter in the future.</P>

      <P>I look at this problem from a constituency in portion of which there is no creamery working, that is, in Carlow.  I am interested in creameries, as I am a member of a creamery society.  The position in Carlow regarding farmers' butter is that in our creamery we have to travel 12 and 14 miles down almost to Kiltealy in County Wexford to collect milk.  We are charging the people supplying the creamery a penny a gallon for the delivery.  That is a small sum for putting a lorry on the road and bringing the milk back a distance of at least nine miles.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is costing us that. The members and suppliers are paying that, as otherwise the lorry would not be on the road.  If the Minister can find some way in which to do it cheaper he should let us know.  He is smiling, but it shows what he knows of the practical experience in the country.  We travel over that distance to collect 80 or 90 gallons of milk and I cannot see how you could run a lorry over countryside such as I have described at a lower rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>For 90 gallons of milk you travel 20 miles&mdash;nine or ten miles out and back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. T. Walsh Mr. T. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, collecting from small farmers along that countryside; yet there are pockets in that particular area where there are three or four cows and it would not be economic for the farmer to bring milk to the roadway where the lorry is passing, and the roads would not permit the lorry to go up to the farmer's house.  Those farmers have to produce farmers' butter and the price they obtain for their milk is 7d. a gallon, as against 1/3 paid in the creamery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. T. Walsh Mr. T. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether the Minister agrees or not, I say there is as good butter produced on the farms as there is in the best-regulated creamery in the country.  The same thing applies in many other parts of the country besides Carlow.  We have the statement from Deputy Ryan already that the milk from 50 per cent. of the cows in the country is going to creameries. Others I know are supplying liquid milk to the cities, but there is a big percentage still used for making home butter.  These people are not being compensated for the production of milk or the production of butter.  Why differentiate between the man making his own butter and the man who has facilities for sending the milk to a creamery?  No matter where you put creameries there will be some farmers who cannot avail of the facilities. Proximity must be taken into consideration. You have farmers on mountain sides with three or four cows and it would not pay them to take the milk <Col N="1664" /> a quarter of a mile to the road.  I heard of a case from West Cork last night, where you have Drinagh with 16 auxiliaries spread all over the countryside.  Where you have big creameries with travelling creameries the people can be facilitated, but there are farmers in West Cork who live in pockets on the hillsides and who still have to make farmers' butter, even in the best-equipped creamery county in Ireland.  Why has the subsidy of 5d. a lb. or 70/- a cwt. been taken away from farmers' butter?  There is a market there, were it not for the use of margarine, for confectionery and a hundred uses.  When winter comes farmers, butter which is not regarded as cart-grease&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The motion, as for as I can see, is reasonable both in draft and in object and in speaking to it Deputy Allen, I think, made a very reasonable case.  I do not think that the Minister or anybody else in this House can say that Deputy Allen even once in the course of his remarks offered the slightest insult to the Minister or anybody here.

      <P>The case was so unanswerable that it remained for a Minister of State to get out and pour out abuse and invective for one hour of the hour and ten minutes for which he addressed this House.  That is always the case, of course, when a person has a bad defence to make.  He knew that he had no defence and consequently he tried to side-track the issue in this way.  He drew up the question of the Shelburne Creamery in Wexford.  As seconder of the motion I think that it would have been as relevant for him to bring in the Shelbourne <Col N="1666" /> Hotel or the Shelbourne Greyhound Track as the Shelburne Creamery in South Wexford.  I am not concerned to a large extent at all with the people with 20 or 25 cows. I am concerned with the people who have three or four cows in the province from which the Minister came but the province in which he took very good care never to contest a seat in a general election.  He knows quite well that for four months of the year May, June, July, August, a large number of farmers in this country have a surplus of milk which they turn into butter.</P>

I cannot understand him either in taking up the line of abuse or the attitude he took up, but I came to the conclusion long ago that he must be a freak of nature, as otherwise he would not adopt the attitude he adopts in this House.</P>
      <P>This subsidy was given by the Fianna Fáil Government and taken off by the Minister.  The Minister may have his views as to whether this is economic business for the farmers or not.  Perhaps he has strong views in his mind to convince him that farmers following this line of business are daft. but nevertheless they have followed it and followed it for years.  When he talks about bringing in creameries to take over all this surplus milk and give the economic price he speaks about. does he not very well know that it will take a great number of years to do that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

There are large parts of the country where farmers do not avail of the creameries because they know very well that they would not be any use to them.  After all, a very great attempt was made some years ago to establish creameries.  They were established and how many of them went down?  The man who then occupied the position of the Minister had, I am sure, very great faith in them but he was disillusioned.

      <P>I must congratulate Deputy Coburn for having the courage to stand up and give his opinion, and he is not a farmer at all.  That is a striking contrast to people on the opposite benches who claim that they are the real representatives of the farmers of the county, but who have not the courage of their convictions to come out and either support the Minister or defend the motion.  In fact, I heard them being ordered out of the House by a member of Clann na Talmhan, who whispered around: &ldquo;It is not our business to keep a House for a Fianna Fáil motion.&rdquo; These are the facilities we get and how we are met for the facilities we gave to the Government during the past week.  To come back to the motion, the Minister tells us that he now has an export market for farmers' butter at 2/3 a lb. f.o.b.  The farmers know what they can get for it. They are getting 1/7 a lb., which is very far from 2/3.  When he was trying to make that bargain what way did he set about it?  He tried to misrepresent Deputy Dr. Ryan by alleging that he stated here that the farmers supplying the creameries were supplying them with dirty milk, a statement that he never made.</P>

    <P>When the Minister for Agriculture was contemplating making a bargain with the British Ministry of Food, how <Col N="1668" /> did he try to push the farmers' butter on the export market?  By standing up in this House and saying that there were 2,000 cwt. of it in a compound sanataire down at the docks, and that it would take the Dublin Fire Brigade with gas masks to approach it.  Even if that were so, it was a scandalous, unbusinesslike statement for any Minister, who is supposed to look after the interests of the farmers, to make when he was bargaining with an outsider. He now tries to release himself from that difficulty by misrepresenting Deputy Dr. Ryan and saying that the Deputy made a statement that he did not make.  That is the way the Minister tries to misrepresent.</P>
    <P>The sum of £75,000 has been docked off farmers producing home-made butter this year.  When I say that I am speaking for the people with three and four cows.  If they are able to make from £10 to £20 in four months of the year, does the Minister not realise that that sum is a great asset to small and very thrifty farmers in the West of Ireland?  Would it not be a great help to them to be able to put a £10-note aside in that way to enable them to meet their obligation to the local authority for their rates?</P>

      <P>The organised body will be listened to with courtesy when it puts up its case.  The people who supply milk to the towns are also well organised.  The Minister talked about rings.  In some instances he would find <Col N="1669" /> a few rings of people of that kind through the country.  I am speaking for the people who have no ring and are only trying to earn a few pounds. They are being penalised because of the fact that they are not an organised body.  Deputy Coburn made a certain statement.  It was at once a statement and a challenge.  He asked to have this left to a free vote of the House.  I am quite prepared to accept that challenge. If it is left to a free vote, and if the motion is carried, we are not going to regard that as a reverse for the Government.  On a few occasions the statement was paraded here by the Taoiseach that on matters of this kind every Deputy on that side of the House was free to use his own discretion and vote as his conscience dictated to him. I hope that principle will be put into operation on this motion.</P>
      <P>The Minister asked us for co-operation. Does he not know well that when he puts anything before us that is going to be of use to the agricultural community he will get our most kind co-operation?  I was one of the first to avail of his field drainage scheme last year.  It did not mean such a lot to me.</P>

The financing of it is another matter.  Just as I did on that occasion, I am prepared to co-operate with the Minister.  I know that every member of the Party is prepared, but when an unnecessary hardship is being inflicted on a section of the farming community we are not prepared to co-operate with him, but rather to call his action in question.  I appeal to the members of the House to take their courage in their hands and to do as Deputy Coburn mentioned&mdash;to vote according to the dictates of their conscience on this motion.

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the motion on the Order Paper:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Dáil disapproves of the policy of the Minister for Agriculture in relation to the home production of root seeds and of pedigree varieties of seed for cereal crops.</P>
      <P>There are two rather distinctive categories here, namely root seeds and cereal seeds.  I would like to deal with root seeds first.  The root crop is a very important item in our agricultural economy.  We are dependent to some considerable extent on a good root crop for winter milk production and winter beef and, to some extent indeed, for winter mutton.  As well as the other factors required to produce a good seed bed for the root crop, it is essential to have suitable seed if we want a good root crop.  Seed for roots, like all other seed, must conform to certain standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first thing a farmer, who is particular about the seed he sows, looks for is purity and good germination.  These two particular characteristics, purity of variety and good germination, are achieved primarily in the growing crop that produces the seed.  It is important, therefore, that there should be supervision of the growing crop if we are to have any certainty of purity in the seed so produced, together with good germination.  There must be supervision subsequently in the threshing of that seed and in the cleaning of it afterwards in order to get rid of any impurities that may exist.  When the seed is threshed and stored supervision must continue.  The seed for the root crop is threshed in August, or early September, and is then stored until it is required in the following spring. <Col N="1673" /> During storage there must be frequent inspection of that seed in order to ensure that germination is keeping up to standard.  I think it can be argued, therefore, that in order to achieve the important qualities of purity and good germination it will be easier if we grow the seed ourselves.  It is true that we can import seed carrying a guarantee of purity and germination, but it is not so easy to get seed with these very specific quarantees attaching to them.</P>
    <P>Another important item is variety. Farmers know that there are certain varieties in swedes and turnips and mangolds and they look for the variety that suits their land best.  So far the varieties we require have been produced either at home or in Great Britain.  During the emergency and subsequently we had the experience of bringing in root seeds from countries other than Great Britain. They were not suitable varieties for this country.  I think that is the general opinion.  We brought in swede seed, mangold seed and turnip seed from Denmark and the United States, but they were not varieties that we require. I think there was only one exception where we did get a fairly suitable variety and that was in the case of mangolds imported from Sweden.  I want to say, however, that that exception was not superior in anyway to what we produce ourselves.  It may have been as good as some of the seed produced here, but it was not superior to it.</P>
    <P>Again, in the variety there are different strains, and some strains are better than others.  Scientists and technicians dealing with the production of seed try to pick out a good strain of a particular variety and breed up from that.  They may even breed from one seed or from the seed of one particular plant.  Their object is, of course, to breed a strain that will give a good yield and a good tonnage and which will have, if at all possible, a better feeding value.</P>
    <P>In the case of beet, as we all know, great improvements have been made over the years in the sugar content of beet.  That was achieved by the breeding of good strains.  The same objective would be aimed at in the case of <Col N="1674" /> other root seeds.  The feeding value in roots lies in the amount of starch they contain.  If our scientists and technicians could succeed in getting even 1 per cent. more starch in roots they would achieve a great deal.  That, of course, demands plant breeding and selection.  In getting a particular strain, therefore, we are helped in that way by the scientists.</P>
    <P>We have in this country, as everybody will admit, good brains both on the technical staff of the Department of Agriculture and on the agricultural scientific faculty in University College, Dublin.  We have there men who are well fitted to pursue this particular objective.</P>
    <P>Another important point is to get, if possible, seed that will produce plants free from disease. In this country I think we are freer, at least in the case of swedes and turnips, from disease than are other countries.  We are, therefore, in a position to produce swede and turnip seed that will give us a disease-free crop.  We are more likely to get that crop from our own seed than from imported seed.  Again, we can call upon the scientists, who are at hand, to improve the position with regard to disease in these crops.  As a matter of fact, the agricultural faculty of University College, Dublin, has been working on this question of diseases of root crops for many years.  Over 20 years ago, they had achieved a considerable amount of success and their findings were of world-wide importance. Some of these men have gone, unfortunately, but where we have an organisation of that kind capable of producing men of that kind, we should again be in a position to do even better than we have done in the past.  These are, I think, generally, the qualities that are required when a farmer looks for good seed.</P>
    <P>The next question that the farmer has to consider is price.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to say that in all probability there will be no controversy with regard to the points I have already mentioned.  If there is a genuine desire to debate this question on its merits I would think that the principal question that would arise would be the question of price. Deputies, I am sure, from the rural areas will remember that back in 1941 we were left practically without seeds for our root crops in this country. From the time root crops were first introduced into this country we had got our seed practically altogether from Great Britain.  However, Great Britain was not in a position to give us any seed, or only a very small supply, in 1941, and we had to resort to emergency measures of dribbling small quantities from what we had and advising the farmers to take a few mangolds out of the pit, to grow their own seed for the coming year and to keep a few swedes and turnips in the field to grow seeds for them in the following years.  I am just mentioning that to give an idea to Deputies of the difficulties under which the whole question of growing seed here was organised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As soon as we had got over, to the best of our ability, the first year's trouble we got two organisations going.  Those two organisations were able to give out some seed to farmers to grow seeds in turn for sale, and so the whole project of root seed production grew up.  They had many difficulties. They had, for instance, in the beginning no mother seed.  If they were starting up now they would be in a position, probably, to get good mother seed from Great Britain and perhaps some of the mangold seed from Sweden.  At any rate, they would have some chance of starting off on a better basis than they started on in 1942.  They had only phosphatic <Col N="1676" /> manures, they had no other manures. They had no cleaning machinery.  They had to provide makeshifts for cleaning, and the farmers had no experience of growing these root crops for seed. However, in spite of that, the price at which the seed produced in the years 1943, 1944, 1945 and 1946 was sold the following spring to the farmer was, in the case of mangolds, 2/4 a lb. here and 2/3 a lb. in Great Britain&mdash;a penny differential.</P>
    <P>In the case of swedes the price was 3/1 a lb. here and 3/- in Great Britain, also a penny differential.  I should have mentioned that in one particular year, 1943, it was 2d. a lb. less for mangolds here than in Great Britain.  During those four years the farmer who bought Irish seed and was deprived, let us say, of getting seed from England was only at a disadvantage of 3d. or 4d. an acre in the case of swedes and 8d. or 9d. an acre in the case of mangolds.  That is not a very big item if other considerations are more important.</P>
    <P>In 1947 the harvest gave considerable trouble.  Deputies know that to produce the root seed, the mother seed is sown in the summer.  That which was sown in the summer of 1946 was in the ground during the very severe winter of 1946-47.  When the stecklings came to be dealt with in the spring of 1947 a lot of them had been destroyed by the frost and a very small crop was produced in this country.  Therefore, a great deal had to be imported from every part of the world, wherever they could be got, and the result was the prices were very high.  They were 4/10 a lb. for mangolds as against 2/4 in England and 3/11 for swedes as against 3/4 in Great Britain.  It was the imported seed that was dear.  The home seed, such as was produced, was produced at the same price as in the previous three years.  It was the imported seed that put up the price.  Any Deputy might reasonably say to me: &ldquo;Is that not a flaw in the whole thing?&rdquo;  It was a flaw, but if we were on a regular basis no doubt those who are providing the seed for this country would do the same as in other countries. In other words, they would have a good carry-over from year to year and in that way a disastrous year would not strike us as badly as we were <Col N="1677" /> struck in the year 1947.  Anyway, we can keep in mind that, as far as the home-grown seed is concerned, it is a penny a pound dearer to the farmer here than seed sold to the farmer in Great Britain.</P>
    <P>Lest any Deputy might wonder why I am mentioning so often the price here and in Great Britain, I want to repeat that the only suitable seed that we know of so far and that we can get is either grown here or in Great Britain.</P>
    <P>Are we sure that we can get this supply from Great Britain as time goes on?  We did get it pre-war, but we cannot get it now.  Whether we can get it in the future or not, I am not so sure.  The practice with Great Britain for the past few years is that she takes stock of the total amount and notifies us here, as she does other customers, in November, how much she can spare for the following spring. That is too late for us to know, because we cannot at that stage grow our own seed.  For instance, next November she may tell us what seed she can spare for the following spring, but we had to sow seed last summer in order to be threshed this coming harvest to give us the seed we require next spring.  So we are leaving ourselves in a certain amount of danger if we depend upon Great Britain unless there is some firm contract that Great Britain is going to supply us to cover any deficiency that we may have.</P>
    <P>I am proposing this motion because the Minister for Agriculture announced that it is his intention to allow root seed in after a certain date, giving a certain amount of notice.  I think that the Minister for Agriculture, in making that announcement, said that he is in favour of giving every farmer an opportunity of buying seed in any part of the world that he chose.</P>
    <P>In theory, I agree that that is a very laudable thing, but, in practice, I am not so sure that it is wise, because, in the first place, there are very few farmers who will avail of it. Very few farmers go past their own merchants for their seed.  They go to the merchant in the nearest town with <Col N="1678" /> whom they have always dealt and they order whatever quantity of turnip seeds, swede seeds or mangold seeds they want.  They do state the variety; some of them want Yellow Globe mangold seeds, some of them want Purple Top swede seeds, but very few of them like to go around to see if they can get their seeds elsewhere.  In fact, therefore, I think that the Minister's announcement has given freedom to the merchant to go where he likes for his seed.  Is that wise?  We all know that many of the merchants who sell root seeds in this country are not men who know much about seeds; in fact, they know nothing about seeds.  Many of them are hardware merchants, grocers or general merchants in small towns.  They sell seeds to oblige their customers, but they know very little about the business.  If they get a very attractive advertisement from some foreign source offering seeds, which promise to give enormous crops, they may order seeds because of that advertisement, but the seeds may not be at all suitable to this country.  I would, therefore, say that to give merchants power or an option to buy seeds where they like is a dangerous thing to do.</P>
    <P>Then, there have been failures of crops in this country and so far as I have been able to find out, every failure has resulted from imported seed and none from the home-grown seed. I may be told by Deputies that the farmer will be compensated.  He will, when there is a failure, but he is not compensated when he gets a bad strain or a bad variety of seeds.  He is not compensated when the seed is diseased. In any case, if he has a lower yield from his crop than he might otherwise have, it is a loss to the country.  If the crop is a total failure, even if he gets compensation, that is a loss to the country.  So far as it is reasonably possible, we should make sure that only good seeds are supplied to farmers when they go to put in their crops.</P>
    <P>I should perhaps say that the present system of growing root seed is that there are two groups here&mdash; seedsmen who have formed a company for the purpose and who make contracts with farmers to grow root seeds. <Col N="1679" /> They take these root seeds from the farmers and distribute them to merchants all over the country.  Now the merchants who are in this company in my opinion cannot make a contract with a farmer to grow these seeds unless import is controlled because they have no guarantee that after they have paid the farmer for his crop they will be able to sell the seed.  It is absolutely essential under the system we have&mdash;there may be a better system &mdash;that the import of seed should be controlled.  If not the merchants cannot give a contract to the farmer and if the farmer gets no contract he cannot grow seed for sale.</P>
    <P>In my opinion the policy announced by the Minister will inevitably kill this industry of growing root seeds in this country.  If it does, I believe, apart from injuring those men who are growing seeds&mdash;they are only a small number&mdash;by depriving them of part of their livelihood, it is going to destroy the possibility that was there to improve the strains of root seeds so as to give better roots&mdash;roots that would give us a better yield in tonnage and starch content.  That will go by the board because, if we go back to the imported seed again, we shall have no control over the breeding of strains or any of the matters I have already mentioned.  I do earnestly appeal to the Minister, in the first place, to reconsider his decision because I believe he is doing a very unwise thing in killing this scheme, if you like to call it such, that was in existence for the production of seeds within the country.</P>
    <P>This motion also deals with the production of pedigree cereal seeds.  Again I need not go through all the requisites of good seed.  You want purity of strain, and good germination.  You want a suitable variety and the best strain that can be got in that suitable variety.  You also want seed that is free from disease.  All these qualities are requisites of good seed and, as in the case of root seed, they apply equally in the case of cereals.  In the case of cereals, however, we have had a better and longer tradition than in the case of root seeds.  Ballinacurra and University College, Dublin, have <Col N="1680" /> been producing pedigree strains of seeds for some years.  I think everybody will pay the tribute to them that they have done great work in producing good varieties and good strains.  I have heard it said that they have almost reached perfection in malting barley, that it would be difficult to imagine how a better strain could be produced in any particular characteristic. They have produced some good varieties of oats that have certainly improved the total yield of oats in this country considerably.  While the same cannot be claimed in regard to wheat we have this at least, that there is a fund of experience and knowledge there that has been accumulated over the years which it would be a pity to cast aside.  We should do everything to see that the brains that are there are encouraged to go ahead in the direction in which they are going.  Now, unlike root seeds, it is true that good cereal seeds can be got outside these islands that would be suitable to this country.  We have as a matter of fact, as Deputies know, got good varieties of wheat from some of the continental countries and also good varieties of oats.  But, even so, it is sometimes difficult to get the seed when needed and sometimes, it must also be admitted, we get seed that is not so good.</P>
    <P>There was an organisation something like that for root seeds&mdash;a number of merchants came together; only two in this case&mdash;and it was called Pedigree Seed Growers, Limited.  They took the pedigree seed bred by University College, Dublin, and Ballinacurra.  It was bred from one grain.  One grain gave one head and that head was taken and from that new strains were got. When in places like University College and Ballinacurra they had reached the stage of producing a few hundred barrels, that was given to Pedigree Seed Growers, Limited, and they made a contract with farmers to sow this seed and to give them back the produce of the crop.  In that way we were able to keep continually renewing the seed going out to farmers all over the country.  This seed was given to any merchant who might require it.  In this case there was much criticism of the price.  During the war years <Col N="1681" /> especially, there were many criticisms in this House of the price charged by Pedigree Seed Growers, Limited, particularly for the wheat seed they gave out.  It did look very high, I must admit.</P>

      <P>I extend this challenge to the Minister&mdash;let him ask Pedigree Seed Growers, Limited, to put their balance sheet on the table and let every Deputy see it.  I do not believe they will refuse.  They were what was called a non-profit making company. They took in the seed from University College and Ballinacurra and they sold the produce to merchants all over the country.  Whatever was made is there in the fund still and I would be very interested to see the balance sheet. Last year the Minister allowed in seed and here are the prices charged.  The wheat seed came from Sweden.  It was sold to the farmer at from 115/- to 120/- per barrel.  Pedigree Seed Growers, Limited, sold theirs at 105/- a barrel. Seed also came in from Great Britain. It was not pedigree seed and it was sold at 95/-.  Commercial seed in this country was sold at 90/-, which was the lowest.  Commercial seed would be the third or fourth crop, let us say, from what Pedigree Seed Growers, Limited, had sent out three or four years ago. The British seed which came in was sold for 95/- and it was not good seed; it was very inferior seed.  The only seed we can compare with that of Pedigree Seed Growers, Limited, is the Swedish seed, and that was from 115/- to 120/- as compared with 105/- charged by Pedigree Seed Growers, Limited.  I am only giving these figures because I want to see that they will get a fair show.  If the Minister would ask them to produce their balance sheet to see how their affairs were managed during the last six or seven <Col N="1682" /> years, I would be very glad to see it. If they have made any undue profits, then the purchasers can get the benefit of them by getting cheaper wheat seed for a few years to come.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, imported seed in this country has a certain amount of magic attached to it.  Farmers think it is good.  They have, I am afraid, a very exaggerated opinion about imported seed and they will buy it.  Those who bought imported root seeds during the last year and those who bought imported wheat seeds from Great Britain now know what imported seed is like.  It certainly is not very good. However, the prejudice is there in favour of imported seed and it would not be possible for any native company to try to push home-grown seed against imported seed in an open market. Pedigree Seed Growers, Limited, cannot continue if the ports are left open for seed to come in, because they cannot give the contracts.  If they are to be up against imported seed from England, which is not nearly so good but which has the name of imported seed, they cannot carry on.  In the same way as in the case of root seed, we are going to lose the chance that we had of improving our varieties and strains and getting our cereals free from disease.  We were going to get the benefit of the experience and knowledge that our scientists have accumulated in University College, Dublin, in the Department, and in Ballinacurra. We are going to lose the benefit of that if the ports are opened for imported seed.</P>
      <P>It is reported that the Minister was thinking of growing grass seeds.  I do not know what scheme he may have in mind.  He may possibly have a scheme which will work better than the scheme for the production of root and cereal seeds.  If he has a better scheme, that is all to the good.  But to scrap the scheme altogether before something better is put in its place is a great mistake.  I am appealing to the Minister not to proceed on the lines of the announcement made by him that there would be free import of seeds, both root and cereal, from now on so far as cereal seeds are concerned, and from a date mentioned so far as root seeds are concerned.</P>

I gather that from what he says.  I think it would be very much more helpful procedure, if he wished to inform the House, to make inquiry on the Agricultural Estimate.  If the matter was overlooked, I would have hoped to repair the oversight, as I think I sought to do when dealing with the Fishery Estimate.  It seemed to me the Deputy and some of his colleagues had raised points that I had not had time to cover adequately in my reply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Or even widespread prejudice against home-produced articles. I stood behind a counter for 25 years and sold seeds and pretty well everything else that is sold in a country shop.  I never in all that time met anybody who rejected that which was produced at home in favour of that which was produced abroad if the article produced at home was equal in quality and value to that which was manufactured abroad.  But I have found repeatedly that tariff racketeers in this country, having got high protection, manufactured and offered for sale rubbish and the average Irish farmer, perfectly legitimately, came in and said: &ldquo;Do not give me that, give me the British thing&rdquo; because it was the only way he could readily express his grave disapprobation of the commodity that had failed to satisfy him.  I remember the late Deputy O'Hara of Swinford getting up in the benches over there and taking out of his pocket the head of a fork every tooth in which was like a corkscrew, and asking the present Deputy Dr. Ryan who was then Minister for Agriculture how he expected farmers to face the harvest with forks of that quality.  It was experiences of that kind that have caused our people on occasions and in certain circumstances to seek to defend themselves from exploitation by looking for something that was not the product of a highly protected industry for they had come to associate such products with inferior quality.  I never heard a farmer in this country prefer Huntley and Palmer biscuits to Jacob's biscuits. I never heard them prefer foreign produce to domestic produce where both articles had been produced in the free field of competition and both articles had secured their market by merit alone</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1685" /> Deputy Dr. Ryan has adopted a conciliatory tone in his opening observations. I am bound, however, to deprecate strongly aspects of the policy which he rebukes me for jettisoning. The policy of root seed production in this country fell into two parts.  There was the duty of the farmer to grow seed, stecklings, and then in the following year to allow these to mature and bear a seed crop.  Side by side with these producers, however, there were the monopolists, these two groups of seed merchants.  The basis on which these two monopolists were prepared to handle the produce of Irish seed growers was that if they did handle the seeds of the Irish grower they must have an absolute monopoly of the right to import root seeds from any other source and I allege that what in fact was happening was that the monopolists were using the Irish seed growers as an alibi to cover up their activities as importers.  Once they became associated in the public mind with the domestic grower they were in a position to say to anyone who challenged their monopoly: &ldquo;Are you going to hit me with the baby in my arms?&rdquo;  What happened?  Armed with the baby, in 1948, the retail price of mangold seed in Ireland was 4/10 per lb.  I would like to make this clear to the House&mdash; the members of these two monopolies are wholesale seed distributors&mdash;Associated Seed Growers and Pedigree Seed Growers.  These were the names of the two monopolies.  They sold the seeds which they had had propagated for them on contract in Ireland and the seeds they imported to wholesale distributors and they themselves were wholesale distributors.  The price per lb charged to wholesale distributors by the producing companies worked out on an average in 1948 at 3/2 per lb. for mangolds.  The retail price by the time the farmer bought it was 4/10.</P>
    <P>Does Deputy Ryan know the price at which mangold seed was on offer delivered at the port of Dublin from Great Britain?  The price was 1/4, which, by the time it reached the farmers' hands, was 4/10.  Do Deputies think I am remiss in saying that that kind of exploitation is going to stop as soon as I can stop it?  The price of swede turnip seed in 1948, the retail <Col N="1686" /> price, was 3/11 per lb., and the price at which that seed was on offer at the port of Dublin was 1/8 per lb.  The price of common turnip seed was 1/2 delivered at the port of Dublin, but by the time it reached the farmer the retail price was 3/3.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan was Minister for Agriculture and he was succeeded by Deputy Smith, who was succeeded by myself.  Is it our duty as Ministers for Agriculture to protect the farmers or to protect the seed merchants?  Maybe I am wrong, but my interpretation of the duty of my office is to defend the interests of the farmers who live on the land and get their living from the land, and if someone imports seed which could have been imported at 1/4 per lb. and I find the farmers being asked to pay 4/10 per lb. am I expected to get into a wrangle and a tangle with auditors, costing accountants, lawyers and solicitors to disprove the proposition that you can justify 4/10 per lb. for mangold seeds that could be bought at 1/4?</P>
    <P>Every monopolist in Ireland loves the prospect of sitting down with a Minister and his officials and introducing them to his costing accountants, his auditor, his solicitor and his expert adviser, and chopping logic till the cows come home to prove that his expenses were so heavy, his losses in previous years so oppressive and the necessity for an ample allowance for management expenses and interest on capital, not to speak of lighting and rates and cleaning and advertising, so great.  By the time you have argued the toss with them about each item, everybody has forgotten what the argument is about.  I do not think I want to argue with anybody about that.  A price of 1/4 to 4/10&mdash;not all the auditors, costing accountants, solicitors, business advisers or anybody else can persuade me that that jump does not constitute robbery somewhere along the road.  I should like to find out from Deputy Allen, Deputy Corry, Deputy Gorry and Deputy Walsh if they consider it wrong to put an end to a system of seed propagation in this country which conferred monopoly rights on two groups of importers, with the result that in 1948 mangold <Col N="1687" /> seed which was available at ¼ at the port of Dublin cost the farmer in Kilkenny 4/10.  Gloomy silence!</P>
    <P>I announced that if I could open the market to competitors who would put the &ldquo;come-hither&rdquo; on that kind of activity the following morning, I was going to do it.  What did I discover? I discovered that I was irrevocably bound by an undertaking given by Deputy Ryan some years ago that neither I nor any of his successors could break that monopoly without giving them two years more to rook the farmers right before they let go. That is the position at the present moment.  I did my level best to get round that agreement, to get under it, to get over it or to break my way through it, and, short of repudiating an undertaking which my predecessor was legally entitled to give and which was most undoubtedly binding on any successor he might have, whether in the same Administration or another, I could not break loose from that agreement. It is still in operation.  From the first tick of the clock, when I can put an end to that, down it will go, as dead as a duck, never to rise again, and, if there is a Deputy who disagrees with that, let him oil his joints for a trip to the Lobby, because he will go one way and I will go another.</P>
    <P>I am happy to inform the House, however, that, although I discovered that that agreement could not be broken, I thought a little exhortation might achieve some purpose and I had a discussion with the gentleman engaged in this public-spirited activity, and, with all the respect due by a public servant to his employers, I told them what I thought of them.  I am glad to say that in this case the master hearkened in some measure to his servant, and I received an assurance, to which I believe effect has been given, that the retail price chargeable for seeds during the past spring would be substantially regulated by the retail prices ruling in Great Britain.  I am glad to have been able to achieve that measure of reform, but I do not propose to take any chances hereafter. The power of exhortation in reforming the wayward is often striking in the early stages.  The hardened sinner <Col N="1688" /> does not always so readily yield to exhortation.  I have decided to remove temptation from their way and the surest way to remove temptation is to provide honest competition.  I want to reaffirm that as soon as it is humanly possible to restore the full Arctic blast of competition it will blow through this land like a tornado and the farmer, seed dealer and shopkeeper can buy his seeds where he pleases, how he pleases and he shall be the judge of what he pleases.  My Department retains the overriding duty to examine the quality of all seeds offered for sale in this country, with a view to preventing the sale of seeds of low germination or incorrect description.  That has always been the duty of the Department of Agriculture and it will continue to be such in the future as in the past.  That duty is designed to prevent fraud and will, of course, continue.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Ryan says: &ldquo;You cannot grow seeds here if you allow imports of seeds.&rdquo;  Does Deputy Dr. Ryan believe that?  Why is it possible for every other country in the world to grow seeds and allow imports of seeds, except Ireland?  Why have we so wretchedly low a conceit of ourselves as to imagine that we can do nothing in this country that somebody else cannot do better?  I confidently anticipate that within four years from to-day we will have grass seed, root seeds and barley seeds superior to anything else produced in the world and I would consider that we had failed in our purpose if we had not produced here what, in the judgment of a competent farmer, was the best in the world and I have not the slightest doubt of our capacity to do so, it being understood that nothing less is an objective that we would entertain for a moment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coburn said in this House earlier to-day: &ldquo;Try to forget that the Minister for Agriculture is Deputy Dillon.&rdquo;  It is an interesting commentary on that, that a motion is moved in the House calling on the House to reject the Minister's policy in relation to the home production of seeds when the only thing they know about the policy is that it is the policy of Deputy Dillon.  I ask Deputies on the other side of the House if they do not feel in some measure that it degrades <Col N="1689" /> themselves to be manipulated into the position of getting up in this House and moving that Dáil Éireann do reject the Minister for Agriculture's policy on the propagation of seeds&mdash;on the sole ground that the Minister for Agriculture is Deputy Dillon.  Surely, if the iron has entered so deeply into their souls they ought to learn, for respectability's sake, the art of dissembling. Hatred is never a very pretty spectacle, clothed even in the raiment of hypocrisy, but Fianna Fáil hatred, naked and unashamed&mdash;oh, it is a revolting spectacle.</P>
    <P>What then are our plans?  In regard to grass seeds, I do not think I need recall the memory of Deputies of this House to the catastrophe which the folly of my predecessors brought upon those who had to buy grass seeds in this country.  The situation which was created by their utter incompetence resulted in the man who grew the finest, cleanest seed it was possible to grow being paid precisely the same price as the man who brought in the sweepings of the loft.  It is a very natural result that the number of persons who went on taking the traditional care to produce a good clean sample of perennial dwindled steadily until hardly anybody brought anything into the market except the sweepings of the loft and they gave up growing Italian altogether so that for the last three years you could not get a stone of Italian.  The nearest you could go to it was mixed seed, because the glorious principle of a guaranteed price for grass seed had been established and, of course, grass seed was grass seed whatever sort it was.  But the man who produced it, the man who cleaned it, the man who sold it never lost, because his rate of profit was carefully fixed by Order at every stage. The only man who got it in the neck was the unfortunate farmer who had to buy it and when he sowed that stuff God only knew what was going to come up in the spring.  Sometimes nothing came up at all and sometimes there came up a crop that would frighten the rabbits.  Then we took the control off.  I took the control off. Monaghan is the largest grass-seed producing county in Ireland and I was told that I would be run out of the <Col N="1690" /> constituency.  I was told that it was a lovely racket, that my constituents in Monaghan had got in on the ground floor and that if I spoiled it on them I would know the reason why.  I told my political advisers not to worry their heads, that I knew the people of Monaghan had no admiration for racketeers or love for rackets.  I told them that I was going to take the control off grass seeds immediately and that I ventured to say that no county in Ireland would more consistently support me in that than the growers of County Monaghan, and I was perfectly right.  Two years from to-day we will be growing in Monaghan, Cavan and Louth better grass seed than is grown in any country in the world&mdash;and we want no protection for it.  Our only trouble is that we will not have enough to meet the demand that exists for it abroad.  Yes, the Deputy may raise his eyebrows and wag his head and dismiss from the range of possibility that anything could be produced in Ireland that people from abroad would come to buy.  Deputy Walsh regards such a proposal as grotesque, ludicrous&mdash;but he is wrong.  According to his standards, I am not surprised that he laughs with scorn at the suggestion that what is here produced should be eagerly sought from abroad.  But it is, and it will be, because it is the best and because the men who are growing it are of that invaluable quality&mdash;too proud to do less than their best, given the assurance that they will be allowed to sell their produce at its worth, so that their care and labour may be adequately rewarded.  Their neighbours all over Ireland would far sooner pay 6d. or 1/- a stone more for the best&mdash;what is produced in County Monaghan&mdash;than buy the sweepings of the loft, which they were compelled to buy for the last six or seven years.</P>
    <P>We propose to go a step further. Certain preliminary work has been done in the research institutes of the country on indigenous strains of grass. In the propagation of grass one unique difficulty confronts the propagator, if he is concerned, as we will be, to propagate Perennial, Timothy and Cocksfoot. Broadly speaking, for pasture land we aim to get a leafy tillering <Col N="1691" /> strain; for short leas, a leafy but more upright variety; but, in each case, a leafy strain&mdash;and a leafy strain connotes a strain which produces relatively little seed.  The more seed it will produce the less leaf it tends to retain in maturing.  Now the man who grows seed for commercial sale has a perfectly legitimate interest in the bulk of the seed that he saves off his acre; but the variety of grass we hope to propagate is going to be of a variety which, instead of yielding ten to 12 cwts. of seed per acre may yield to the commercial grower no more than five or six cwts.</P>
    <P>My aim is to eliminate from our domestic market all foreign grass seed of the Timothy, Cocksfoot and Perennial varieties, but without prohibiting, hindering or taxing by one farthing a lb. the supply of seed from any other part of the world.  The aim will be to do that by propagating varieties of seed here derived from indigenous grasses selected by our own agronomists and by making it possible for the grower who is prepared to grow them and accept the yield of five or six cwts. instead of ten or 12 cwts. to get an acreage bounty no more than will put him on an equal footing with where he would have stood had he sown commercial seed.  Then put both on the market side by side and let the best seed win, and I confidently prophesy that, so soon as adequate supplies of the seed we wish to propagate and distribute for growing for seed have been made available to growers, not one ounce of foreign grass seed will be brought into this country&mdash;because nobody will be able to sell it.  Anyone who wants to bring it in, however, will be as free as the air, and if there is any country in the world that can make available a better seed at a lower price to our farmers than the seeds that are propagated here, my advice to our farmers is to buy them and leave the seeds we are propagating on our hands. My advice to every farmer in Ireland is this: Sow your land with the best seed you can find which yields the best value; do not care who propagated it; whence it came, or who is selling it; if it is the best seed for your land and will give you and your family the best <Col N="1692" /> living for the work you do on your land that is the seed you should buy; do not ask if it is Cathleen Ní Houlihaun seed or Seán Buidhe seed or Yankee Doodle seed, so long as it is seed that will produce a profitable crop for you and your family, put it down and you are under no compliment to anybody.</P>
    <P>Regarding barley and oats, as Deputy Dr. Ryan said, the business of propagating this has gone on for many years.  For well-nigh 50 years the attempt has been made to spread the use of pedigree seed by selling it to merchants and asking the merchants to get their customers to sell their production back to them, so that in the second year they could sell it out again.  That plan has never worked.  One never could get a sufficient number of merchants sufficiently interested to keep the crop under surveillance and get the crop sent back to sell it again.  The Pedigree Seed Growers' Scheme was operated here with the astonishing result that pedigree seed was costing 105/- to the farmers who wanted to buy it when commercial seed was costing 85/- or 95/-.  Yet Deputy Ryan says: &ldquo;Get their balance sheets.&rdquo;  I saw a good many balance sheets published in the last 15 years in this country and I never saw a trace of an excess profit on them, but some of the tulips who drew the balance sheets, when I first met them, had not a shoe to their foot &mdash;and they are going around now in Bentley cars.  Of course, you can study their balance sheets for the last 15 years, and more moderate men never transacted business in this country.  I often think they must imagine their neighbours' memories are very short.  When I pass the residence, standing in its own grounds, of a gentleman I knew 25 years ago in the two-pair back, I am told that he is a prop of Irish industry, an employer of Irish labour, a benefactor of the Irish people and a man who has done yeoman service for his native land.  He has done yeoman service for himself, anyway.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and publish advertisements calling on all and sundry to put back the Fianna Fáil Party, as their interests would suffer gravely if that Party ceased to be.  But I conceive it to be best to take temptation out of their way, too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That brings me to the general framework within which I hope to put the propagation of root seeds in this country on a solid and enduring basis, not apologetically, not on the assumption that they will always be second best and that unless the farmers of the country are flogged into buying them no reasonable man could ever anticipate them to buy a lb.  We propose to propagate swede turnip seed and we will sell it, I hope, proudly labelled as clear as daylight to show that it was produced under the supervision and with the approval of the Department of Agriculture of Ireland.  Any competent farmer who sows it and meets with an average season will gather a better crop than he can gather from any other variety of swede turnip that he can buy anywhere else in the world.  If our own neighbours do not buy it&mdash;and nobody is going to make them&mdash;we will sell it in Great Britain, France, Germany or anywhere else and we will be ashamed to offer as the produce of our propagation industry any seed of a quality lower than that which would command a ready market in any agricultural country in the world.  I guarantee that not an ounce will be sold under protection or fortuitous advantage of any sort, kind or description.  I acknowledge freely that that may mean the elimination of a few individuals who are in the seed propagation business at present, because there will be room in it hereafter for nobody who is not too proud to do less than his best.  Now, mind you, a great majority of the men who stuck it out for the last two or three years must be good men, because they had the devil of a time.  What Deputy Dr. Ryan says is perfectly <Col N="1694" /> true, that in 1947 the fellows who were trying to grow mangold seed, and turnip seed, too, met with a series of disasters following the unprecedentedly severe weather that would have knocked the heart out of most men.  It did out of some and they have gone out of business altogether, but others stuck on.</P>
    <P>I must confess that it irritates me a little&mdash;perhaps I should not reveal this to my opponents, as it provides them with a weapon&mdash;when the less scrupulous or, should I say, the more unscrupulous, stoop so low as to use their neighbour's distress for the purpose of trying to toot their own political horn.  A consistent yowl has been going on for the last three months from the more depressed elements of the Fianna Fáil Party and their kept newspaper that there was a firm resolve to trample into the dirt every farmer who is concerned with the propagation of seeds.  Everything that could be said or done to cause distress, anxiety and confusion among a small group of hard-working men who are trying to make their living has been done by the rag tag and bobtail of Fianna Fáil for no other reason than their faithful belief in the doctrine that the public memory is short, that you can get up and tell any falsehood that comes into your head and will serve a term in perfect confidence that the public will have forgotten all about it in a month's time.  I have to take off my hat to Fianna Fáil with regard to that. They are the greatest past masters in the doctrine of saying anything that comes into their head, confident that in a month's time nobody will remember. And, of course, they are perfectly right.  The kept newspaper and the &ldquo;Dáil Reporter&rdquo; will publish anything that comes into their heads and you would imagine that it could disappear overnight, as three weeks later they publish the diametric opposite and the vast majority do not notice it.  Have Deputies noticed&mdash;I presume that those of the Deputies yonder who can read have been reading the kept newspaper &mdash;the steady bombardment of falsehood with which they have tried to disrupt the seed growing of Wexford, Meath, Louth and Carlow?  They never took <Col N="1695" /> the slightest trouble to inquire, because they did not want to know.  They were very solicitous that nobody would put them in the awkward position: &ldquo;Did it ever occur to you to find out what the truth is&rdquo;?  Oh, no, that is the last thing they would do.  As long as they could dissemble they were free to speculate and display their ignorance. A halfpenny postcard would have got them all the information they wanted. The kept newspaper was quite entitled to go any morning to the Press Bureau and administer a questionnaire, but that would have wrecked the whole ship.  They have a perfect right as taxpayers to request of the Press Bureau the answer to any question relevant to Government policy and get it.  Any Deputy in this House can put down a question and get an answer, but then they would not have the opportunity of putting down this motion.  They hope, according to the classical pattern, to make a bit of mischief, but cheerfully confident that when they were discredited it would be forgotten in a month's time.  In the meantime, they would have all the advantage of a bit of mischief.</P>
    <P>I have no objection if, in addition to the seed propagation that the Department undertakes itself, the seed merchants in this country want to do it themselves on the Dutch pattern as a co-operative or associated effort under the supervision of the Department of Agriculture, but they have got to do it in the knowledge that they are aiming at a standard of excellence which will sell their product on its merits and that any approach on the basis that the poor ignorant Irish could not be expected to produce it as well as anybody else in the world and that they must have a tariff of 100 per cent. will not be listened to for a moment. I want to make it perfectly clear that any seed grower or seed merchant in this country who is prepared to collaborate with us on those terms will be welcome, and I am prepared to let bygones be bygones.</P>

      <P>It is the 4/10 mangold <Col N="1696" /> seed I am talking about now.  I am quite prepared to draw a line under these peculiar happenings and to welcome the collaboration of anyone interested in the seed business in a new departure; but the produce of that co-operative effort will be put on offer before our farmers in competition with seed from anywhere else in the world.  The produce of that co-operative effort will be offered to seed merchants, shopkeepers and farmers with nothing to commend it except its own performance, though it will carry, I hope, the declaration that the Department of Agriculture in this country stakes its reputation upon the quality of what they offer.  No sane salesman will prognosticate the crop-yield of seed because that is contingent on the capacity of the farmer, the quality of the soil and the event of the weather; but the seed that will be offered will be offered on its merits and on the understanding that if our own people do not want to buy it, it will be sold on its merits abroad or thrown away.  No one will ever be compelled, and it is only when we are able to do that, as I am certain we shall be able to do it, that I shall regard the seed propagation business in this country as being on a satisfactory basis.</P>
      <P>Deputies will probably note that in referring to root seeds I spoke with emphatic confidence of swede turnip seed.  I do not think that we have had enough experience of the propagation of mangold seed here.  We will have to pursue an experimental degree of propagation of that crop for some time before I am satisfied that we have got the technique right.  I do not see why it cannot be got right, but performance to date has not been satisfactory.  That may have been due to a combination of weather and unforeseen circumstances and contingencies that could not have been provided for, but I cannot give the same certain promise in respect to that crop that I can of the other one.  That we shall try is certain, and that we shall succeed I hope.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to rape, kale and common turnip, I would be interested to hear the views of Deputies as to whether, in their judgment, the market for these crops here is now or is in the <Col N="1697" /> early future likely to be of sufficient volume to justify an attempt to propagate them in Ireland.  I would be interested to hear the views of Deputies as to whether they believe that in these crops there is a prospect of superiority as between one variety and another which would justify our efforts to propagate them.  If the views were strongly held that one of these, or all, had considerable scope for improvement by propagation here at home, I would certainly most favourably consider making the attempt.  Of swede turnips I am confident of our competence; of mangolds I am going to try, and I hope to succeed with the other three.  I have an open mind on barley.  In the case of cereals, we have new varieties, and there can be no doubt that Ymer, a new Scandinavian variety of the short straw type, has potentialities for a feeding barley in this country that it is really hard accurately to estimate.  But this is true, that on the shortest straw that I have ever seen Ymer barley has yielded over 50 cwts. per statute acre under a heavy dressing of manure. That, so far as I know, is a new record for barley culture in this country. Now, it is to be noted, of course, that Ymer is a nitrogenous variety of barley and feeds heavily on nitrogen, but with the malting system traditionally obtaining in this country it is not acceptable to the majority of brewers.  As a feeding barley there is no doubt that, properly cultivated, it is going to become a real economic rival to my well-beloved yellow meal. That is a most interesting thing, that there should be a cereal crop which will give a yield from our land which puts it in the same economic category as maize meal is, in my judgment, quite an exciting revolutionary development. But there is more to it than that.</P>
    <P>Now, a scientist would not even breathe this, because he would regard it as still unproven and would communicate it to a learned paper in about five years' time, I suppose.  I am not a scientist, and let us enjoy the good news while it is still good.  If it goes bad later on, we will have had a couple of years' enjoyment out of it, anyway. There has been produced at Ballinacurra <Col N="1698" /> a hybrid between one of the varieties of Spratt Archer and one of the Scandinavian varieties.  If its performance in full-scale field plots approximates to its performance in strips, it will take the talk of this country and of a great many other countries, too.  That is the kind of cereal seed that I would like to see propagated in Ireland, which foreigners would be glad to buy by the stone and, like the Aga Khan in his jubilee year, pay for it by weighing it against its weight in gold.  And, mind you, if this seed turns out to be what it looks like now&mdash;though the conservative will wait &mdash;nobody will get any of it, unless the balance of gold against the seed is forthcoming, for a good while, until our own people are fully supplied.</P>
    <P>I am an optimist.  Doubtless, some of my argosies will not come home, but I have a good many afloat, and if some of them land we will get along very nicely.  I do not believe in losing sleep over the danger of some of them sinking. I prefer to glory in the fact that for the moment they are sailing with their sails full spread before the wind. If they hit a rock they will sink, but we will start another one.  If some of them come home, you will get a great kick out of unloading the cargo.  I think there are a few cargoes in this seed progagation business with which we will be able to astonish, not only ourselves, but our neighbour.  I am not one bit afraid to proclaim that hope and I am not one bit afraid to say that if we do not produce seed in this country better than any other seed in that category procurable in the world, I would esteem such a performance a failure.  Time will tell whether we are going to fail or not.  If we do, it will not be for the want of trying, and anyone who does not like that policy, let him take to the Lobby.</P>

      <P>As a farmer, I welcome most heartily the speech the Minister for Agriculture has made.  One of his predecessors is hiding behind the barrier, and another former Minister for Agriculture ran out of the House. I boil over when I think of the time that we prepared our land for seed and went to the rounds of cropping it year after year and thought we were getting it in real good heart.  Then all we did <Col N="1699" /> get was nothing but a lot of furry grass. I gave £5 or £6 for it.  I boil over with indignation when I think of that, and when I think also that in 1948 a local merchant showed me a letter from London indicating what I could get seed at.  I had travelled from shop to shop in Dublin looking for mangold seed for two acres.  I had to get ten varieties after going to ten shops in order to have enough for the two acres.  I paid 4/11 here for it.  The local merchant had a letter from a London firm.  The London letter offered seed at the price the Minister told us.</P>

I go through the country now and I see the new grass growing and I remember the time when you could see nothing but foggy dew growing on it&mdash;you all know what the foggy dew was like and you all know what we paid an acre for it.  Think of the monopoly and think of Deputy Dr. Ryan, with his sweet talk, asking us to try to develop home industry, while they were robbing the farmers.  Why did he not go to the Department's farms and grow that seed there?  Why did he allow two firms to rob the farmers?  Look what we got for a turnip crop.  You would have one turnip here and beside it would be a big green thing with nothing on it.  I stand up in indignation as a farmer.  I thank God something has been done to do away with that racketeering department and the people who ran it.  We have put in their place a man who is honest and who will make his name for ever among the farmers of Ireland.  I defy any of you on the Fianna Fáil Benches to deny that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture has propounded a policy in relation to seed growing which, he says, could have been got by sending a postcard to the Department of Agriculture within the last three months.  During the last three months the Government Information Bureau has issued many denials in regard to reports of Government activity and in regard to Government policy.  Why on earth did not the Minister for Agriculture, if he had this policy that he has propounded to-night, say something about it?  The Minister is not shy.  He does not lack words.  When he has something to say he can make a noise at length.  However, he says to-night that the Department of Agriculture is going to do great things in regard to the propagation and distribution, not only of root but of cereal and grass seeds.  I am glad that the Minister is going to do something, but why throw out the dirty water until he gets in the clean?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Why do you not?  Why does not the Minister for Agriculture, if he wants to get rid of these two organisations of seed merchants, get rid of them, but still carry on and buy the crops from the farmers to whom these merchants issued seed in order to propagate more seed?  What we in Fianna Fáil are concerned with is that our farmers should have a decent supply of the best seed we can get under a guarantee of purity, strain and freedom from disease.  We cannot get that if the Minister for Agriculture puts the seed produced by Irish farmers on sale side by side with seed imported from <Col N="1701" /> other parts of the world.  One can get turnip seed or mangold seed which is true to name, which will germinate well but still be quite useless in relation to producing a good crop with a proper starch content.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many countries in the world which have difficulty with regard to disease control.  Not only do such countries prohibit the import of seed from outside the national borders, but they actually prohibit the transport of seed inside the national territory from one area to another.  Having here a situation in which it is proclaimed from the Government Benches that agriculture is the basis of all our national wealth, we should procure for the farmers the best possible seed.  The Minister instanced one case to-night where a greatly increased yield has been obtained from a new strain of barley.  That greatly increased yield can be obtained without any fundamental change in soil conditions, in the working of the soil or in the weather. Side by side with another variety of barley sown under the same conditions, this new variety will give many times the yield obtained up to this.  The same principle obtains with regard to sugar beet.  Farmers who grow sugar beet know that owing to the activities of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann in regard to the propagation of seed at home, the shortage of beet seed during the emergency was a blessing in disguise.  We now have a stronger growing beet with a higher sugar content and complete freedom from disease.  We got that simply because there was an organisation interested in procuring for our farmers the best possible seed. Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann went to the western seaboard and gave the farmers there the stecklings.  Those farmers produced disease-free seed because, owing to the constant blowing of the wind from the Atlantic Ocean the seed grown there does not carry any of the germs of disease which affect beet crops in many parts of the world. Because of those activities on the part of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann it should be possible for us to export sugar beet seed to many parts of the world and my belief is that the industry will in time expand sufficiently to enable us to do that.  What Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann <Col N="1702" /> have done with regard to beet seed we want done with regard to turnip seed, mangold seed, kale seed and grass seed of all kinds.  How will the Minister do that?</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the organisations set up to cultivate pedigree seed are the racketeers that the Minister says they are.  The Minister for Agriculture is very, very free in casting the name of racketeer at every person here who tries to produce at home something that can be imported.  If anybody attempts or dares to produce here a substitute for something that can be imported, according to the Minister for Agriculture he is a racketeer.  I do not believe that these two organisations are the racketeers the Minister says they are.  During the war years not only did they sell turnip seed here at about the same price that the farmers in England were charged for turnip seed, but they paid our farmers who grew the seed for them 3d. per lb. more than the seed merchants in England paid the farmers in England for growing the seed for them.  I think they did a good job of work in organising at such short notice the production of root seeds and in having a supply of root seed available for our farmers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Ryan stated the cause for the very big increase in the price of root seeds in the year 1948 and the difference here as compared with England. He compared the performance here with the performance of the pedigree seed people there during the war. The Minister for Agriculture now wants to seize on his opportunity&mdash;the opportunity created by the fact that seed production here is small in relation to the effort that was put into it. We on this side of the House cannot prevent him doing that.  But there are people on the Government Benches who can prevent him if they wish to exercise their influence.  We cannot prevent the Minister for Agriculture defeating this motion here to-night, but those who have an interest in the development of the country can behind the scenes if they will not do it in the open, ensure that if he destroys the organisation that is there for the production of root seeds, wheat seed, barley seed and other pedigree seeds <Col N="1703" /> he will substitute something for it.  Let the merchants who have been handling this be put aside.  Let the farmer who has got seed from them to produce more good seed go on producing.  Let the seed be purchased by some State organisation, or any organisation the Minister for Agriculture may set up, but let it be bought and distributed to the farming community so that their crop yields may be improved.  I hold no brief for the merchants.  I know nothing about them.  I do not even know their names.  But I do know that in County Louth, in County Wexford and in other counties hard-working farmers were under contract to grow seed for them.  A number of towns-people think that agricultural production can be increased overnight.  In regard to mangold, turnip and sugar beet, one is faced with 18 months' work before one can get a crop.  The seed has to be sown one summer.  It will be 15 or 18 months before the farmer can thresh that seed.  If we are to secure that improvement in variety and type that the Minister for Agriculture talked about and for which Deputy Dr. Ryan showed the need, we have got to continue the organisation of farmers that has been built up. Put some other head at the top if we are not satisfied that these companies or merchants are running the thing right; let us put them out and put some other organisation on top.  There is no use in the Minister saying that at some time or another he will induce the farmers to grow better seed varieties all over the country and that he is going to induce other farmers to buy under the stamp of the Department for Agriculture.  We have a stamp at the present time.  If anybody wants to buy seed wheat, seed oats or seed barley from the pedigree seed merchants, he will know what he is getting from the stamp.  If the Minister wants to substitute a stamp from the Department of Agriculture, well and good, let it be done, but at least let the seed be bought from the farmers who have put it in and let that organisation of farmers be continued. I have no objection at all, if the Minister can organise it, to have it <Col N="1704" /> organised on a co-operative basis.  It would be the best way of doing it, but it is not always very easy to get these things organised.  A lot of people have been advocating co-operation in various ways and we all know the difficulties of getting farmers to co-operate even in their own interests.</P>
    <P>I want to say to the Minister, again, if he is not satisfied with the monopolists, as he calls them, who are handling the root seeds and the pedigree cereal seeds at the moment, let him appoint his own monopolist, whoever it is, whether it is an official in his Department or some such people as those they have appointed in charge of the industrial development project.  I think it would probably be very much dearer to pay a gentleman, such as the industrial development man, £2,000 a year than it would be to appoint an ordinary merchant in charge of the job.  However, we want the Minister to do something.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is going to put, as he said, no barrier at all to the importation of foreign seed it will have to be sold side by side.  We all know that the farmers are inclined to buy cheap seed and particularly if it is, as all seed coming into the country for a long time has been, guaranteed by the Department of Agriculture as to the germination and type.  There is all the difference in the world, however, between the various strains of the same type of seed.  I need not go into that point because Deputy Dr. Ryan covered it.  There is also the fact that no Department of Agriculture inspector can tell you what strain the turnip seed in the bag belongs to, whether it is a strain that will yield five or six tons an acre or 26 tons an acre.  Neither can they tell you whether the seed in the bag is free from disease.  Freedom from disease and a good strong growing strain are of very much more importance than the variety or the germination. However, it is the two minor things that the Minister for Agriculture is going to look after in regard to the importing of seed.  Nobody, of course, wants to shut off our farmers from the best seed in the world.  However, the best seed we can get is the seed that is grown under our own supervision. We know not only its variety but its <Col N="1705" /> parentage.  We know what its parents have done and we know what to expect the seed to produce.  We can know also whether it is growing in an area that is subject to various diseases or whether it has been grown in a clean area.</P>
    <P>Another thing about this production is that the farmers who are engaged in the production of seed and, in particular, root seed, are the best type of farmers in the country.  They have to take great care in the production of the stecklings.  They have to keep their land clean all the time that the crop is in the ground.  Then they have to harvest the seed with the utmost care, particularly with reference to mangolds. Surely to goodness, after we have got through the war practically on our own resources we should not give the farmers a blow on the head and trample them into the mud.  They are the best type of farmer in the country and they should get every possible support from the Government. As I say, all that I knew up to the moment the Minister for Agriculture spoke was that he tried to break their contract last year.  No one in Fianna Fáil was concerned with a few merchants. What we were concerned about was that the couple of thousand farmers who were producting the root seed were going to get a very bad blow.</P>
    <P>We were all delighted that the Minister for Agriculture could not let the Arctic gale of his hatred of home production blow upon these farmers.  He did not succeed in suppressing homegrown wheat last year.  This motion here to-night has got him to come part of the road, at least, to protect the seed growers.  We cannot hope to get the members on the Coalition Benches to vote for us on this motion but at least we can hope that behind the scenes they will bring pressure to bear upon the Minister, to make certain that the farmers who are producing these seeds will continue in production and that every year they will be supplied with the mother seed of the best variety and type that we can get from our own plant breeders or from plant breeders in any part of the world.  Do not, as I say, throw out the dirty water until you get in the clean.  Do not <Col N="1706" /> suppress and destroy these farmers who have been producing these seeds until we see whether we can create an organisation to take over from them the seeds which they grow.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that we should approach this matter on the lines of the policy which I heard Deputy Con Lehane enunciate last night, namely, that we should not import anything that can be produced in this country. We knew nothing in this country of the growing of small seeds when the emergency came.  We found ourselves suddenly cut off from the supply of any seeds from abroad.  The first deficiency which we had to face was a lack of beet seed.  We were in the happy position, as regards beet, that we had in stock two years' supply but we had immediately to prepare for a seven or eight years' period of war in which we could not get seed from anywhere or get sugar from anywhere either.  We started with that position.  In the second year of the war I grew five acres of beet seed and to my amazement and happiness, I was able to get a yield of 32 cwt. of beet seed per acre. I found that I was able from the cultivation of that crop, to get over £100 per acre and to give a lot of employment in my own district.  We are in the position to-day that we are able to export beet seed and the foreigners are very glad to get it because it is superior to their own.  It took almost two years after the emergency started before we were able to go in for the production of the smaller seeds such as mangold and turnip seeds.  At that time the farmers were largely dependent on black market seeds imported over the Border and from Britain at £1 per lb.  That is what they paid for it I paid for it myself and I know it. That is the position in which we found ourselves soon after the war started. If we are to revert to that position let us blame ourselves.  I have no particular brief for any firm who took up this matter.  I did my damndest to get the Beet Growers' Association to take up the growing of the smaller seeds and my only regret is that they did not do so.  It is a pity they did not rather than let any merchant get in on the job.  I say that as one who <Col N="1707" /> realises that once you bring in a matter of this kind the town or city mind you are immediately going to have the cost of the article blown up.</P>
      <P>I deprecate the attitude of the Minister for Agriculture on this matter and I do not know where it is going to lead us.  One body of men who cannot be blamed are the farmers who set out on this work with very little knowledge of the work of growing the smaller seeds&mdash;mangold seeds, turnip seeds and kale seeds.  They had very little knowledge, but they took their chance and they did it at very small profit so far as they were concerned.  As I said, once this thing gets into the hands of commercial firms, naturally the price is blown up.  The seed that is grown by the farmers at 1/4 per lb. is more than doubled or trebled in price when it reaches the farmers again.  I have no sympathy for that kind of conduct. It may be that those people made no great profit.  That could certainly happen because the Department themselves knew damn all about it.  I saw one lunatic&mdash;I cannot describe him as anything else&mdash;from the Department who said that the proper place to keep turnip seed after it was threshed was in a bag.  He said it was quite safe in the bag although it was freshly-threshed turnip seed, whereas it was explained by those in charge of the Agricultural Seed Station at Ballinacurra, to whom the Minister paid a compliment this evening, that that seed should be spread out in a loft, not more than a few inches in depth, and properly dried, if not artificially dried, or otherwise it would go mouldy. These are the things that have to be considered.  For the past eight or nine years I have been pressing my own people to take this matter up.  It was a specialised job for the small, uneconomic farmers in West Cork, in Kerry and Connacht.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>To my mind it should be grown on small holdings instead of having the small uneconomic holder growing an acre of oats or potatoes.  He will certainly have to put a large amount of intensive labour into it, but, even at <Col N="1708" /> that, he will have something that will yield him from £80 to £100.  That would be far better than sending this money over to England to be paid to the seed producer there.  I have heard the Minister speak about mangold seed at 1/4 a lb. which came here from England. We have heard this kind of thing before.  It is not the first time that young Irish industries were crushed in their infancy by a flood of shoddy products from abroad.  These foreign producers are now in the happy position of having a Minister here who will certainly give them his blessing in everything in which they want to engage.  You cannot expect the farmer who had over a long number of years to pay a high price for the fork that the Minister described here to-night if he is deprived of the home market for these products.  I do not use these forks, but I was one of those who succeeded in having started in Temple-michael one of the finest industries in Cork County, the products of which are able to hold their own against any imports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not mind Deputy Fagan.  I spent five or six weeks in Deputy Fagan's constituency.  They get up at 11 o'clock and go out and look at the bullocks, come back to dinner and go out and have another look at them in the evening and then take the car into the village for the rest of the time.  I am not surprised when he says that the mangolds were green and small because that is what you can expect from land that has not been ploughed for 150 to 200 years, and where you have men who never saw a plough following a plough. I remember on one occasion when we were travelling from Cork by train, bringing the ex-Leas-Cheann Comhairle, Mr. Eamonn O'Neill, and many other Deputies to the window when we reached Kilmallock to see how they sowed wheat in the County Limerick.  There were two men sitting on top of a seed sower and a pair of lively horses galloping up and down the field and nobody to see whether there was any seed in the machine or not.  Then Deputy Fagan comes here and tells us about his unfortunate two acres of mangolds.  Deputies of that description know nothing about tillage and were not reared in a tillage atmosphere, <Col N="1709" /> and regarded Deputy de Valera in a bad light because he was the first man who ever made them plough.  I had about seven acres of mangolds last year and had no danger of not getting seed.  I could get all the seed I wanted and there was competition in Cork amongst the merchants for custom.</P>

      <P>I did not experience any shortage of seed last year.  If the Deputy will call at Lacey and O'Connell's any day they will tell you what mangold seed they had to spare when the demand was over.  That is the attitude adopted here.  I was glad the Minister paid tribute to the fine agricultural station in Ballinacurra and to the value of the men in that station, and the fine property that is being handed over and the skilled men that are being handed over.  What I want to know is what he is going to do with them and what use he is going to make of the brains that we have trained and the experience these men have gained in growing seeds of all descriptions? What use is going to be made of them now?  Is all that experience and all that skill to be thrown on the scrapheap now so that we can bring over from Mother England cheap seed until such time as the last of our growers has gone out of production and then you will pay John Bull just what he likes to charge you for it?  Nobody knows that better than the Deputies who are listening to me here to-night and who perhaps in their own particular business and their own time have had the same bitter experience as we had.  How much turnip or mangold seed would you get from Britain in 1941? Where were the farmers of this country to get mangold seed or turnip seed from 1941 to 1948?  Where will they find it in two years' time when the next war starts?  Where are they to find the seed now if the growers are crushed out of existence by this Minister who complains of the mangy, inadequate salary of £2,100 a year that he is getting?  I suppose that is why he does not look after all these things.</P>

On all sides of the House there are Deputies who have an interest in everything that can be produced in the country and in the welfare of its citizens.  I put it to these Deputies: Is it in the interest of the country and its people that we should have sitting over there a gentleman, now the Minister for Agriculture, who has deliberately set out since he became Minister to damn in every possible way he can the efforts of his predecessor over a dozen years to grow crops, to grow seeds, to grow tomatoes, to grow all the necessaries of the people within the country?  That is what the policy of this Minister has been.  It is a damnable policy for any Minister for Agriculture in this country which has made sacrifices.

      <P>These seed growers prepared a memorandum and made a case why root seed growing should continue. I ask Deputies on all sides of the House to ponder well on what the policy of the Minister has been on several matters, not alone on root seeds.  That is only one of the items, but it is an important one and a very serious one for the country.  In my constituency there are a large number of hard-working, struggling farmers who have been growing these seeds for a number of years.  They have now been told that they must abandon this seed growing from which they have been earning a livelihood.  They are to be prevented from growing these seeds. I want to register an emphatic protest against a Minister of an Irish Government, by his policy, killing an Irish industry in its infancy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we had better come back to the terms of the motion. One can readily admire the sentiments expressed in the motion, and undoubtedly Deputies on all sides will subscrible to the view that if it is possible to grow seeds of the type and variety referred to in the motion it should certainly be done.  We have heard Deputy Ryan speaking of the wisdom of preserving this industry.  We have also heard the Minister and, unless I am stupid or unable to understand plain English, the Minister's speech was to the effect that, so far as lay in his power, within a period of three or four years, the farmers engaged in the production and growing of these seeds would be in a position to grow as fine seeds as could be grown in any part of the world.  I further suggest that the charges made by Deputy Allen that he is out to kill an Irish industry are not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recognise my limitations, so far as my knowledge of the growing of these seeds is concerned, but I represent a constituency in which the farmers have been engaged in the growing and <Col N="1714" /> saving of grass seeds from time immemorial.  The saving of these seeds did not start with the advent of a native Government.  When I was a boy of seven I can remember seeing at certain times of the year, and especially in June, July and August, the main streets of Dundalk chock-a-block with farmers' carts full of grass seeds.  That was almost 60 years ago, so that Deputy Corry need not think that the growing and saving of grass seeds started with the advent of either the Cumann na nGaedheal or Fianna Fáil Governments.  The farmers of that period saved that seed without any protection, without any tariffs, and, the farmer being a keen businessman and human nature being what it is, I could not visualise the farmers of that generation engaging in a type of agricultural economy that did not pay all down through the ages.</P>
    <P>Deputies opposite seem to base their whole argument on the principle of bidding the devil good morning before they meet him.  They are always looking at what will happen to this country in the event of war.  Let us forget about war and about when it will come or will not come.  Life would not be worth living if we were to live in fear and dread of what would be this country's position in the event of another world war, but the argument of Deputies opposite is that we must continue this activity because a war may come and prevent the farmers from getting supplies of seeds necessary for their economy.  In all wars, supplies of various commodities are not as plentiful as they would be if there were no war, and, during the last war, it was imperative that certain seeds should be grown in this country, just as we had to grow wheat in greater abundance than before.  The farmers took up the growing of these seeds under contract to the merchants and seedsmen in Dublin.  They sold these seeds, and I do not agree with Deputy Corry that they got very little profit.  The farmers in my county generally tell the truth and they are not always crying about bad prices. Any of these farmers whom I met told me that they were well paid for their labour, and Deputies opposite ought to <Col N="1715" /> admit that occasionally and not say that the farmer gets no return at all.</P>
    <P>Having heard the Minister speaking of what he proposes to do in relation to the growing of these seeds, how can it be argued by Fianna Fáil Deputies, and especially Deputy Allen, that the Minister is out to crush in its infancy every little Irish industry which starts? Deputy Allen tries to create an impression by quoting Arthur Griffith and Sinn Féin policy.  I am quoting what the farmers did years before Arthur Griffith spoke about this policy of Sinn Féin.  I am not decrying the policy. We are all Irish and each man does the best he can, but why Deputy Allen should go out of his way to give the impression to the House and the country that the Minister is an enemy of the agricultural community is something I cannot understand.</P>

      <P>The Minister's statement regarding the production of seeds is the first intimation I have had that he intends to develop the production of root seeds.  Never before have I come across a statement of his that he intended to have root seeds produced. His intimation last January that the contracts which were in existence the year before for the production of root seeds were to be cancelled was the first thing that worried the root seed growers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was only when he was confronted with the bill of £88,000 for compensation for the breaking of a contract which had been made that he reconsidered his decision and it was in February, when the mangold stecklings should be sown, that he consented to <Col N="1716" /> give protection to root seeds for the coming year.  This is the first time that we have heard that the Minister is in favour of producing small roots here.  We heard the Minister to-night talking about the two companies&mdash; Associated Seed Growers and Seed Industries.  He talked about the profits they made.  He has employed those tactics in connection with everything regarding agriculture.  He has talked about the fertiliser cartels.  He has talked about the huge profits they have made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. T. Walsh Mr. T. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>He told us about our Irish manufacturers.  I think he mentioned a man named O'Hara who produced a fork here which was twisted like a corkscrew and which was made in this country.  What he said was no tribute to the Irish manufacturers. Deputy Hickey, I am sure, will not stand over what the Minister said to-night. He spoke about the inferior type of stuffs we in this country are producing.  That has been the theme of his arguments since I came into this House.  I think I have never heard the Minister for Agriculture praise one thing, with the exception of beef, that was produced in this country&mdash;not one thing.  The position that obtained in this country in 1941 was that England prohibited the export of mangold and turnip seeds.  It was, therefore, necessary for our farmers, if they were to produce mangolds and turnips in this country, to set about producing the seeds themselves.  They had no equipment and they had no knowledge.  They did not know how to proceed about the production of these seeds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The farmers, particularly in the county I come from, where a big acreage of root seeds was grown during the past six or seven years, took the stecklings out of the pits at that time.  We did not know the proper size they should be.  We did not know the proper treatment they required. We did not know what type of artificials was best for them, and we did not know how they should be cultivated. We knew very little, even in <Col N="1717" /> regard to the harvesting, but nevertheless we produced a profitable crop. Our principal difficulty in that particular year was the threshing of these mangold seeds.  We had not the machinery the English people had, but, notwithstanding all that, we produced, we harvested and we placed on the market a crop that ensured that in the following year we had a sufficiency of mangolds and turnips to feed our live stock in the country.  That has continued. We have been producing our own supplies during the past few years.  There have been very few complaints regarding the purity and the germination of these seeds and we have ensured that we have had mangolds and turnips.  We do not know, even though Deputy Coburn said we should never live in dread of war, when the same conditions may obtain again, but whether these conditions should ever obtain again or not, I say that this industry was built up during the past five or six years by the tillage farmers of this country and that it was worth in the neighbourhood of from £60,000 to £100,000 per year.  We export that amount of money every year to the English farmers for producing our beet and turnip seeds.  Why should we do that when we have farmers in this country capable of doing that work and workers capable of harvesting it?  Why not keep that money here and thus give employment to about 250 agricultural workers in the production of the necessary root seeds we require for the country?  That is a point I would ask Deputies on the Labour benches to think of.</P>

      <P>This motion is of the utmost importance to the farmers.  We have Deputies in this House in the Clann na Talmhan Party who claim to represent the farmers.  However, while the opening statement regarding this motion was being made by Deputy Dr. Ryan, and even while the Minister was speaking, there was not one member of that Party in the House until very late in the evening when one of them came in.  Does that show that the farmers who returned those Deputies to the House did the right thing when they sent them here?  A matter of the utmost importance, as far as the farming community is concerned, is being discussed in this House and these people do not think it worth their while to come in and find out if there is any reason to take part in this debate.

Maybe it was one of the Associated Seed Growers, we do not know, but it was somebody whom the Minister had thought had come on money that he should not.  The Minister thought&mdash;even without inquiring and without knowing what business that person had.</P>
      <P>The production of beet seed in this country was started in 1941.  Many of the Deputies here who are not beet growers must have heard of the condition that obtained here in 1942, when there was only one year's supply of beet seed available in the country.  We were depending then on Germany, Czechoslovakia and Belgium for our beet seed. The sugar company set out and asked the beet growers to produce seed for them.  We did not know whether it was going to be a success or a failure. However, the fact is that our farmers went out and produced that seed, under the supervision of agricultural advisers to the factories all over the country.  We produced a seed that was equal to any and that, in later years, proved superior to the seeds that had been imported.  If it had not been for the initiative of the sugar company at that time we would have found ourselves in the position in 1943 and 1944 that we would have no beet grown in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All we ask in this motion is protection for the people who are prepared to continue growing seeds&mdash;that is, that they should not be subject to the dumping of foreign seeds on the Irish market.  We may be told about the purity and the germination of these seeds.  They may be all right, but we have nothing to indicate the purity of the variety and it is only in the following harvest or the following winter, when the mangolds and turnips are <Col N="1720" /> being pulled&mdash;we will see it, of course, before that&mdash;that we will reap the disaster, if the mangold or turnip seed is of an impure kind.</P>
    <P>We have developed the industry in the country.  It has been and will be a success.  It will give that amount of money to our farmers, £100,000 and it will give employment to 250 farm labourers.  Why send that money out and throw these men out of employment? I do not say they are going out of employment, but it will help to put them out of employment; as they will not be finding the same amount of work and eventually it may be responsible for these men not being able to obtain full employment.</P>
    <P>It has been mentioned that, during the past couple of years, our production of seeds was not up to the required standard.  All the turnip seed of 1946 that remained in the ground, something in the neighbourhood of 500 acres, was destroyed in the winter of 1946 and the spring of 1947 and there was a scarcity.  In that year also, 1,500 acres of mangolds were destroyed, due to frost, floods and snow in the late spring.  Notwithstanding that we had that amount destroyed, we were still producing last year and the year before and in other years, two-thirds of our requirements and we had to import only one-third.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister for Agriculture would be very unwise if, at this stage, he would not continue the production of seeds.  I listened to him here to-night and came to one conclusion, that he is prepared to go ahead with the production of these seeds, but he does not want to give the credit to those who have been in the business for the past five, six or seven years. If the credit could be given to him, he would be perfectly satisfied to give that protection; but until he gets the credit for everything that is done, so that people will say he is a great &ldquo;I am&rdquo;, he will not be satisfied to give way to anything that Fianna Fáil has done. It is his hatred and detestation of Fianna Fáil that is preventing him from protecting seed production in this country.</P>
