      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will indicate the present position concerning the proposed unemployment insurance reciprocal arrangements with Great Britain and if, in the view of its importance to Irish Workers, he will endeavour to have this matter brought to finality with the least possible delay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to be able to inform the Deputy (and the House) that on the 24th instant an agreement was made between the British Minister of National Insurance and myself for reciprocal arrangements in respect of unemployment benefit.  On the 25th instant I made an Order bringing the <Col N="1741" /> agreement into operation as from the 6th April, 1949.  This Order is now on the Table of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielORourke" hpid="Mr. O'Rourke Mr. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare whether he is aware that various employees of Roscommon County Council who are resident in the Elphin area and temporarily unemployed were refused unemployment benefit at Carrick-on-Shannon Labour Exchange because they could not leave their homes to take up employment at Ballyshannon, County Donegal; if this refusal to pay unemployment benefit is in accordance with Government policy; and, if not, whether he will take steps to have the men referred to paid the benefit to which they are entitled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that three men resident in Elphin area whose last employment was stated to have been with the Roscommon County Council refused employment offered to them at Ballyshannon and were refused unemployment benefit on the ground that they were not unable to obtain suitable employment.  One of the men had been unemployed since September last and the others since the 19th and 22nd January, respectively.</P>
      <P>The Unemployment Insurance Acts do not permit unemployment benefit to be paid to any person while suitable employment is available for him.  If these claimants are dissatisfied with the decisions given on their claims, it is open to them to exercise their statutory rights of appeal to the court of referees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that a similar situation obtains in North Sligo?  Men there cannot take up work in Ballyshannon owing to domestic difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of the domestic difficulties which prevent workers from taking up employment, but if they are refused benefit because they decline to accept what is considered to be a suitable offer of employment it is open to them to appeal to <Col N="1742" /> the court of referees, which has power to reaffirm the disallowance of benefit or to authorise the payment of benefit, according to the circumstances of the case.  I may add that the employment available at Ballyshannon is remunerated at the rate of 1/10 per hour for a 48-hour week, and that hut accommodation, with full board, is available at 33/- per week, and that the employment is stated to be likely to continue for a period of some years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the difficulty of getting board and lodging there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that hut accommodation, with full board, is made available at Ballyshannon at a charge of 33/- per week, which can be paid from a wage of 1/10 an hour for a 48-hour week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare whether Mr. Edward Fitzpatrick, of Claregate Street, Kildare, who was discharged at his own request from the Army in January, 1949, was entitled to unemployment benefit or assistance after his discharge; and, if so, whether he applied for or received any such benefit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. Edward Fitzpatrick, of Claregate Street, Kildare, had 495 contributions credited to him in the unemployment fund in respect of his service with the Defence Forces.  He did not make any application for unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The facts of the case, as known to my Department are that Mr. Fitzpatrick left the Army at his own request and sailed for America the day after he was released from the Army as he stated he was promised employment there.  His wife is an American citizen and she was most anxious to make a home in America. I understand that she had and her seven children hope to sail for the United <Col N="1743" /> States in the course of a few days if, in fact, they have not already sailed.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs whether he has considered, and, if so, with what result, the provisions of Article 4 of the proposed North Atlantic Treaty from the point of view that the acceptance of the provisions of this article by Ireland would imply the acceptance of the unnatural and enforced division of our country.</P>

      <P>Article 2 of our Constitution provides that:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The national territory consists of the whole island of Ireland, its islands and its territorial seas.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Article 4 of the draft Atlantic Treaty, which is the consultative article, refers to.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the territorial integrity, political independance or security&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>of the parties to the treaty.  The provisions <Col N="1744" /> of this article might well, under existing circumstances in regard to the six north-eastern counties, imply an acceptance that &ldquo;the territorial integrity&rdquo; and &ldquo;political independence&rdquo; referred to in the article, are the concern of Great Britain, unless it is clearly recognised that the national territory of this State consists of the whole island of Ireland, as provided by Article 2 of our Constitution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>The exchange of views referred to took place by way of aide-mémoire.  The Irish Government's aidemémoire was delivered to the United States on the 8th February last.  No intimation has so far been received to indicate that the United States Government, and the Governments of the other convening Powers, have yet had an opportunity of considering the Irish Government's aide-mémoire.</P>
      <P>As already stated, the Irish Government's view is that a constructive approach to the concept of Atlantic co-operation would suggest the necessity of examining, in the first instance, problems tending to prevent or weaken the co-operation in the Atlantic area. The Irish Government has indicated that it would welcome such an approach to what we consider to be the unnatural and unjust division of our country.</P>
      <P>In these circumstances, I do not envisage the publication, at the moment, of the documents in question.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>(a) The average allin expenditure at existing labour and material costs, but excluding interest, is roughly £40,000.  Average time for maturity is 50 years. The rate of interest is liable to variation, and is not determined by my Department, which is in consultation, with the Department of Finance about the preparation of forestry accounts on a commercial basis.  When these are completed they will be presented to the Dáil.</P>
      <P>(b)  The capital value of 1,000 acres of plantations, at 1948 timber prices, is £170,000 for the timber alone.  The land remains with its productivity for timber cultivation an appreciating and valuable asset.</P>
      <P>(c)  The Deputy must seek this information elsewhere; my Department has no definite information on the matter and would not normally be concerned in the ascertainment of the information.</P>
      <P>(d)  The capital value of the timber growing on the existing State forests is conservatively estimated at £4,000,000.  The value of afforestation to the nation, in view of the present and future world shortage of timber, is inestimable.</P>

      <P>As stated in my reply to the Parliamentary question by the Deputy on 17th February last, the proportionate amount available for employment schemes in South Kerry for the financial year 1948-49 was duly allocated and expended.  On the understanding that the primary purpose of these schemes is the relief of unemployment, and within the limits of the money at my disposal, due consideration will be given in the coming financial year to the making of grants for any proposals which may be found suitable for the purpose for which the money is provided.</P>

      <P>When the Deputy's application for the work in question was received by the Special Employment Schemes Office in February, 1948, it was considered on its merits as an employment scheme.  Employment schemes in rural areas are confined to the winter months when the Employment Period Orders are not in operation, and, as a rule, the winter is not a suitable time for drainage work.  I will have the case looked into again in connection with next winter's employment programme.</P>
      <P>If, however, the work is necessary apart from the question of relieving unemployment, it could, if the landholders were prepared to pay onequarter of the cost, be considered as a rural improvements scheme, and, if approved, could be carried out during the summer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>The work referred to by the Deputy was carried out as an employment scheme in 1938, and was satisfactorily completed at the time. Since then, however, it has fallen into disrepair, largely owing to the gradual process of erosion by sea action.  A contributory cause has been the failure of the landholders concerned to maintain the watercourse which the bridge spans.</P>
      <P>I will have the case again considered to see whether it could be made the subject of a further employment scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Parliamentary Secretary's reply, is he aware that the construction of the bridge was not completed at that time? The construction of the bridge and the roadway leading on to it was not done as part of the same project.  The farmers agreed to maintain that section.  The bridge is still awaiting completion and untill it is completed there is no way of getting to the seashore for the removal of sand which is so essential to the farmers in the district as a fertiliser.</P>

      <P>The answer is in the negative. I do not think it would be possible to provide shelters which would afford effective protection and at the same time allow sufficient freedom of movement for the pointsmen.  Apart from this most of the junctions where pointsmen operate are too narrow or otherwise unsuitable for the erection of shelters.</P>

      <P>My attention has been drawn to the photograph and statement mentioned.  Sergeant Edward Fitzpatrick was discharged on pension from the forces, with effect from the 23rd February last, at his own request. The letter containing his request for discharge was dated 20th January last and stated that he proposed to emigrate to the United States of America.  It was open to Sergeant Fitzpatrick to serve until the 6th October next, when his engagement would have expired in the ordinary course.  As from that date, if he had desired, his engagement could have been extended for further periods.</P>

I am informed, however, that the distance from the load and the consequent voltage drop would present a problem at this stage. If it is finally decided by Bord na Móna to proceed with the development of these bogs the land will be left in a fit condition for reclamation and the construction of houses would be undertaken as part of the project.</P>

      <P>During the course of this debate a number of Ministers have participated and have made statements bearing upon matters of <Col N="1767" /> public concern.  I should like to open my remarks by expressing the opinion that unless Ministers are frank with the Dáil, unless they put before the Dáil all facts bearing upon problems which the Dáil has to consider, unless information which they give or which is extracted from them by Dáil questions is reliable, then the Dáil cannot do effective work and, inevitably, national interests will suffer.  The complaint I have to make, having heard some of these speeches and read others, a complaint which arises not merely out of these Ministerial declarations but out of previous ones, is that Ministers are habitually less than frank with the Dáil and that very frequently the facts given here are distorted by them in order to support the particular argument which they are pursuing.  I go further and I will say that there is evidence to suggest that even statistical information which is prepared by the Statistics Branch reaches the Dáil through some propagandist bureau by which it is not infrequently distorted in order to support some political point in which the Government are interested.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is not yet the most important member of the Government.  It is, of course, a central point of Coalition propaganda to establish that the Government are genuinely seeking economies.  They are trying to convince the people that they are reducing the cost of administering the Government Departments. The Minister for Finance, in support of that general propaganda line which he and his colleagues are following, pointed out that 31 of the different Estimates in this Book of Estimates show a reduction as compared with last year.  They do not.  It was a misleading statement and intended to be misleading, because, in so far as many of these Estimates are shown in this Book to be lower than the corresponding Estimates last year, it is because the Estimates for last year have been written up in an unprecedented way by <Col N="1770" /> the addition to them of higher administrative costs sanctioned by the Minister for Finance after these Estimates were passed by the Dáil.</P>
      <P>I ask Deputies to turn to the Book of Estimates where these reductions are shown.  The first is the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  This Estimate purports to show a decrease compared with last year of £360, but the amount of last year's Estimate was written up by £1,640 in respect of increased remuneration to the officers of the Department sanctioned during the year.  There have been other years during which the Civil Service has got increased remuneration, but always the Minister for Finance set out on the face of the Estimate in a footnote the amount of the last year's Estimate and the amount of the addition to it sanctioned by Supplementary Estimate during the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Never before was the present device adopted and I suggest that that device was designed to trick the Dáil and the public into the belief that this campaign of economy has been successful. In fact, we know it has not.  We can point to almost every Department of State and show that the costs of administration have gone up since Deputy McGilligan became Minister. Taking the Estimates as a whole we find that all the Government Departments and services are estimated this year to cost approximately £65,500,000. That is £6,500,000 more than the net audited cost of these services in the year 1947-48.  It is £1,000,000 more than the services cost last year, if the estimate of their cost upon which the Minister prepared his Budget was realised. We do not, yet, know what they cost. We know, however, that when the Minister for Finance was preparing his Budget he estimated that all the Departments and services of the Government would cost £1,000,000 less than he estimates they will cost this year. This campaign of fooling the people into believing that economies are being secured has been pursued by many devices but the most flagrant trick ever attempted was that to which I have referred and which is evident upon the face of a number of the Estimates set out in this Book.  There has <Col N="1771" /> been a reduction between the total cost of the public services as set out on the face of this Book and the total cost of public services set out on the face of last year's Book.  The main contributory cause of that reduction has been the change in the Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce. I am referring now to the Estimate of the Department of Industry and Commerce as introduced.  Certain changes in Government practice have been announced in the meantime. Many of the charges which formerly appeared against the Minister for Industry and Commerce's Vote will appear in future against the Vote for the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <P>The amount required for the service of the Department of Industry and Commerce is reduced by £6,500,000. £2,500,000 of that £6,000,000 is attributable to the termination of the emergency turf scheme and the dropping of fuel subsidies.  Over £3,000,000 of the balance is attributable to the lower cost this year of food subsidies. In fact, the whole of that reduction was automatic and would have come about if the Minister for Finance had sat in his office for the whole year playing tiddly-winks.  In so far as economy means the reduction of unnecessary expenditure in Government Departments and the elimination of waste in the financing of public services there is no evidence of it.  On the contrary, all over the field costs are rising, and so far as one can judge from Ministerial declarations bearing upon the question they are likely to continue to rise.  If, however, the main change in the Estimates this year, as compared with last year, is the reduction in the cost of food subsidies, then I think it is high time we got some authoritative declaration from the Minister for Finance as to Government policy in regard to food subsidies. Even this year, with the lower cost, the amount required to finance food subsidies comes to no less than 14 per cent. of the total bill for all Government Departments and services.  It is, therefore, a matter of some importance that the Dáil and the public should be informed as to what the <Col N="1772" /> Government intends to do in regard to the maintenance of these subsidies or the policy of rationing which appears to be associated with them. At the present time, the whole of the Government's policy in regard to rationing and food price subsidisation is clouded in mystery.  Here, again, I want to accuse the Government of being less than frank in the Dáil, of playing tricks upon the Dáil, of deliberately misleading the Dáil concerning the facts of this matter. Whenever some Deputy asks a Dáil question as to why bread, flour, tea or sugar are still rationed, or as to the prospects of having these commodities unrationed, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce is put up to give the misleading reply that the supply position does not at present permit of the ending of rationing in respect of these goods.  I say that is not true.</P>

      <P>I know that you purchased last year less than we did in 1947 and the only reason I suggest is that you decided to do that.  There is no scarcity of sugar.  There is enough sugar in the country at this time to abolish rationing.  More sugar can be purchased if home production is insufficient. Why, then, are we still subjected to tea and sugar rationing?  Not merely are we subjected to this unnecessary rationing of these foodstuffs, <Col N="1773" /> but the Minister for Finance has imposed upon sugar used for manufacturing purposes an illegal tax.  I said here in the course of an earlier debate that the policy of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in relation to industry, the policy which he has proclaimed at various banquets and occasionally in this House, is being sabotaged and negatived by the policy of the Minister for Finance and I was asked for an illustration.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce is, on every occasion when he speaks about industrial matters, urging the importance of expanding our industrial exports.  There is one class of industrial products for which an export possibility exists now and that is sugar confectionery, particularly jam, marmalade and so forth.  Those who are engaged in the manufacture of these commodities could, at this moment, be building up an important export trade which might prove to be permanent.  I will not put it stronger than that.  They are prevented from doing so by reason of the fact that the Minister for Finance is taxing their raw materials to the extent of £20 per ton.  I say further that that tax is illegal.  The Constitution of this State requires that no citizen can be taxed without the consent of the Dáil and the imposition of that levy for the benefit of the Exchequer upon sugar sold to manufacturing consumers has never been sanctioned by the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not true that we could not obtain sufficient wheat to abolish the flour and bread rationing.  The recent wheat conference, at which an agreement was signed last week, was apparently embarrassed by the surplus of wheat which the exporting countries had to offer. In fact, instead of the importing countries, as in previous years, being concerned to write up the amount that they were prepared to contract to buy, they were, this year, trying to write down the amount which they would be under contract to buy for the period of the agreement.  The price of wheat has fallen, and the Government was able to authorise its representative to sign that agreement upon the basis that for its duration the maximum price which they would have to pay for wheat <Col N="1774" /> purchased under it would be $1.80 a bushel&mdash;roughly about £18 per ton. Why have we got these unnecessary rationing schemes?  If the real explanation is that the Government is economising in foreign exchange, then why do they not tell us that?  I do not believe that is the explanation.  On the contrary, I know that it is not.  I suggest that the reason why rationing is still maintained is because the policy of price subsidisation is still in operation as regards these goods.  I suggest that when the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce gets up to tell the Dáil that the rationing of tea, sugar, bread and flour has to be maintained because the supply position does not permit of anything else, he knows that is a misleading explanation.  He knows that the true reason why the people of this country are being subjected to the unnecessary rationing is because the Government cannot make up its mind between two courses, each of which they think might be politically unpopular&mdash;either to allow the prevailing prices of these commodities to rise, or else to vote more money out of revenue for their subsidisation.  Let it be clear, however, that when the Minister for Finance boasts about having reduced the cost of Government services, even though the amount which the people pay in taxes is increasing, the price which the country is paying for that notional reduction is the perpetuation of the rationing of essential food for long after the supply position had so improved as to make it unnecessary.</P>
    <P>Can we get some statement of policy from any Minister on this matter?  How long is this going to last?  Have we to face the prospect that so long as the maintenance of the present price of these commodities involves the payment of some subsidies, then we will continue to be rationed?  Is that the position?  Is there any reason why the people of this country should not get the benefit, in flour and bread prices, of the fall in wheat prices recently recorded?  Is it the policy of the Government to maintain these prices at their present level so long as <Col N="1775" /> any subsidy is payable?  Can we get some information, other than the false and misleading information which is occasionally given to the Dáil by the Parliamentary Secretary?  How long are we going to suffer this unnecessary rationing of essential food stuffs, and why?</P>
    <P>The Government, of course, can provide the necessary dollars to supplement our tobacco purchases and to increase the delivery of tobacco from bond by 12½ per cent. because, of course, that is going to bring in more revenue.  We can get an announcement as to the doubling of the basic petrol ration and, again, we have to bear in mind that an increase in the petrol ration means increased dollar expenditure, but that also brings in increased revenue.  Why is petrol rationed?  Will someone give me a sensible reason as to why the petrol ration was not abolished altogether?  We imported into this country last year 58,000,000 gallons of petrol.  Our normal pre-war imports of petrol, averaged for the three years 1936, 1937 and 1938, 38,500,000 gallons. We have a 50 per cent. increase already over the pre-war total petrol supply, and petrol rationing is still being maintained. There is not a Deputy in the House who does not think, as I think, that the Government could, in the present supply position abolish petrol rationing entirely.  Why is it being maintained?  What secret motive is there in the minds of the Government to justify the retention of petrol rationing when the supply position does not require it?</P>
    <P>The reduction in the price of wheat, and the conclusion of an agreement to buy annually 270,000 metric tons of wheat at 1 dollar 80 a bushel is practically responsible for the whole of the drop in the food subsidies.  It is possible that there will be a further drop. Under the agreement which will shortly be submitted to the Dáil for ratification, there is provision for the possibility of a further drop.  At what stage will the Government give the people the benefit of these reductions in price?  At what stage can the consumers of flour and bread hope to get their supplies cheaper because <Col N="1776" /> of the drop in the price of wheat? Will the Minister for Finance even say that it is the policy of the Government to maintain present prices so long as the subsidy is payable?  I do not know what the view of the Government is upon the whole question of food price subsidisation.  I do know that some members of the British Government have on occasion spoken as if they regarded it as a permanent addition to their social services, something to be maintained even when abnormal trading conditions or war-time scarcities had ended.  Is that the view of the Government here or are they aiming to get rid of these subsidies by the various devices to which they resorted during the year?  The white flour scheme has been a flop; the allocation of additional tea at 5/- for harvesting or the release of additional sugar at the uneconomic price of 7½d. per lb. in order to help the Exchequer to meet the cost of the sugar subsidy.</P>
    <P>Talking about wheat brings me to this question of the Argentine wheat. The Minister for Agriculture has been dealing with this matter again and dealing with it just as dishonestly as ever he did before.  I have no hope that anything that I may say here will prevent him or any of his colleagues from misrepresenting the facts of that deal to the people of the country.  I have no hope beyond putting the facts on record that I can prevent the possibility of confusion in the public mind but I am going to put the facts on record.  I know that every official in the Department of Industry and Commerce and in the Department of Agriculture and every officer of Grain Importers, Limited, as well as every British or American official who was dealing with this matter at the time will know who is telling the truth&mdash; the Minister for Agriculture or myself. They will also be able to form their personal judgment between us upon the basis of that knowledge.</P>
    <P>Let us get the facts right first.  I apologise for using the word facts.  Let me give the Dáil the information that was given to me by the Minister for Agriculture in reply to a Parliamentary Question.  I apologise again for describing them as &ldquo;facts&rdquo;.  I asked the Minister for Agriculture what was <Col N="1777" /> the total consumption of wheat in this country between the 1st of March, 1948, and the 1st September, 1948, that is to say the wheat equivalent of the flour and bread consumed and I was told it was 220,000 tons.  Now there was available, to meet that alleged consumption of 220,000 tons, the following quantities of wheat: from stocks 24,217 tons.  The stocks on the 1st March were 64,984 tons and on the 1st September 40,281 tons.  There was, therefore, brought into consumption from the available stocks 24,217 tons. The stocks left on the 1st September were much lower than would normally be regarded as the requirement of safety.  The international wheat organisations used to assume that in order to maintain an uninterrupted supply of flour and bread a minimum of nine weeks' stock was required.  In practice we found we could work upon a five or six weeks' supply.  On the 1st September, 1948, there was just roughly a five weeks' supply so that we had reached the stage of minimum stocks.  There was imported during the period, according to the Minister for Agriculture, from Australia, 83,000 tons; the Argentine, 73,658 tons, and the United States, 2,116 tons.  If some Deputy takes the trouble of adding these imports to the 24,217 tons that we drew from stock I think he will find that he will get a total of 183,019 tons.  With that total available by some miracle according to the Minister for Agriculture we consumed 220,000 tons.  The propaganda department slipped up there.  The Statistics Branch produced those figures and if the officers in the propaganda department had not slipped in adding up we would not have had this ridiculous reply given to a Parliamentary Question.</P>
    <P>That reply shows that in six months of last year the people of this country consumed 37,000 tons of wheat which was not here at all.  The Minister for Agriculture, when speaking in this debate last week, referred to the Argentine wheat as involving 50,000 tons.  Whatever the present Minister for Agriculture may be, he is not such a fool as he sometimes tries to appear, and he knew that when he said that <Col N="1778" /> 50,000 tons of wheat were involved.  I suggest that the reply that he gave me on the 16th February was distorted for the purpose of making the quantity of Argentine wheat purchased less significant than it really was in relation to our total requirements.  When the Minister last week spoke about imports of Argentine wheat of 50,000 tons he was again taking the same line, also hoping to give some significance to a document which he quoted in the form of a memorandum from Grain Importers, Ltd., which suggested that it might have been possible in May or June of last year to purchase 50,000 tons in the United States of America.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture did not make a mistake when he spoke about 50,000 tons of Argentine wheat instead of 75,000 tons.  He had to get a figure which related to the figure which appeared in Grain Importers' memorandum, because if he admitted that even the quantity of wheat which Grain Importers thought they could be able to import from the United States would, nevertheless, leave our requirements unfilled, then he would have to admit some purchase of Argentine wheat was necessary in any case.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture stated that the Fianna Fáil Government, in December, 1947, decided to leave this question of purchasing Argentine wheat to myself.  He also stated that we got advice not to purchase it from the British Government, and he read a memo sent to the Department of Industry and Commerce from Grain Importers.  Not one of these statements conveys the whole truth.  Every one of them has been twisted or doctored or clipped in order to convey a false picture.  The question which went to the Government was whether we should reduce the bread ration or buy Argentine wheat.  The decision of the Government was that the bread ration should not be reduced.  When that decision was taken, it was irrevocable.</P>
    <P>Ministers opposite may play with the suggestion that this decision to purchase Argentine wheat was made a day or two before the change of Government. It became inevitable when the Government decided not to reduce the bread ration because, if we were to <Col N="1779" /> leave a reasonable ration available to the following September, a reduced bread ration would have to be brought into operation immediately.  Every month's delay in making the reduction in the ration meant a severer cut. What the Government decided in December, 1947, was that the bread ration would not be reduced and they left to me the question of the manner in, and the time at which the purchase of Argentine wheat would be effected in order to supply the necessary quantities of wheat to maintain the ration.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture stated that the British Minister of Food advised us not to buy Argentine wheat. Is he or any other Deputy opposite under the illusion that Britain gave us that advice in our interests?  The British Minister of Food were thinking of the interests of the British Government. They were anxious that other countries would stay off from buying Argentine wheat and perhaps force a reduction in price so that they could buy cheaper.  They did not care if our bread ration was reduced.  At that time it was higher than theirs.</P>
    <P>As regards this memo from Grain Importers I am not willing to discuss the motives that inspired it&mdash;its author is dead&mdash;but I will go on the fact that when they expressed the view that it might be possible in May or June to purchase some 50,000 tons of wheat in the United States of America, they were giving us information of no value. There is no responsible Government that would have taken the risk in January or February of 1947 that, if the hope expressed by Grain Importers was not realised and if by May or June wheat could not be purchased, there would then be no bread in the country. Can you imagine any sensible group of men deciding to gamble on the possibility that in some future month wheat might possibly be procured when, in fact, it could not be, and knowing that if the hope did not come off there would be a period of two months in which no bread would be available to the Irish people?  In fact, the quantity of wheat imported from America during the six months' period was 2,200 tons&mdash;two weeks' supply.  If the Government had <Col N="1780" /> taken the advice which Grain Importers gave them, do you think we would have been exempted from blame by our successors if they found themselves in May or June in the position that there was no wheat available in the country and no possibility of buying it anywhere?</P>
    <P>This thing has been brought up here again in the hope that some political advantage will go to the Coalition Parties.  I am prepared to face the Irish people on this issue, that the Government now in office, the Coalition Government, thought it would have been better policy to have reduced the bread ration last year than to have purchased this Argentine wheat, and I am prepared to defend my action, that by purchasing that Argentine wheat before the change of Government I put them in the position that they could not reduce the bread ration.  If there is any question about the price of Argentine wheat I will tell them that at the time they were eating it the price of bread was lower in Dublin than it is now.</P>

      <P>The characteristic dishonesty of the Government's propaganda in this matter is to be found in almost every Department.  We are used to that type of propaganda at home.  What I want to inform the Minister for External Affairs is that I object strongly, and will always object, to the introduction of the same type of tendentious propaganda into documents intended for international circulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had some discussion here already concerning remarks made by me relative to this memorandum dealing with the European Recovery Programme and presented to both Houses of the Oireachtas by the Minister for External Affairs.  I think I am as well fitted as any other Deputy to assess national interests.  I think that anything I may have said in this regard was more likely to help national interests and national prestige abroad than the contrary.  We have had the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Minister for Agriculture and other Coalition Deputies repeatedly boasting that during the year 1948 there was a recovery in agricultural production as compared with 1947 and, in particular, that the yield of wheat per acre was substantially higher in 1948 than in 1947, and they have endeavoured to suggest that that was due to some benign influence which they spread over the country.  By their speeches they have tried to ensure that the maximum political advantage would redound to them by reason of that fact. They know that that is a false picture. That will not prevent them, nevertheless, continuing to present it here at home.  They know that the year 1947 was a completely abnormal one because of weather conditions.  That will not prevent them, I am sure, continuing to endeavour to take some undeserved credit from the fact that there was a recovery in agricultural output in the following year.  When they do that at home I am prepared to meet them and answer them.  I am prepared to show the Irish people the falsity of their propaganda and the baselessness of <Col N="1782" /> their claims to credit because of the 1948 figures.  I am not going to be blackmailed into remaining silent in the face of such dishonest propaganda because the Minister for External Affairs chose to write the same propaganda into a document for international circulation.  Every Deputy knows that the year 1947 was an abnormal year. Yet, the week before last the Minister for Agriculture was expanding his chest here when announcing that the quantity of wheat delivered to Irish mills from the Irish harvest last year was nearly double the quantity delivered in the previous year.  The acreage had declined by 60,000 acres, but the wheat yield, because it was a good season, had enormously increased.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is exactly what the Minister for Agriculture said&mdash;a slightly blasphemous observation, I think.  The Minister admitted, however, that the yield per acre in 1947 was 10.8 cwts. as compared with 14.4 cwts. in 1946.  If there is to be any suggestion that the improvement in 1948 was due to the availability of fertilisers or other materials which were not procurable during the war years, I prefer to make a comparison between 1947 and 1946.  1946 was not a good year either.  It was the year in which we mobilised the shop hands and factory workers and the people in the towns and villages to go out to help the farmers save the harvest.  It was not a good year.  It was not a year for which one would normally quote the statistics as indicative of the productive potentialities of Irish agriculture. But 1947 was worse.  When we find, however, the Minister for External Affairs explaining or purporting to explain to O.E.E.C., or to their American advisers, that that decline in yield in 1947 was not due to any abnormal circumstances prevailing here in that year but to the effect of the war upon Irish agriculture, then we know that he is putting himself in a position in which he can be proved wrong.  It is to that I object.  I expect members of the Coalition Government at home to use that type of false <Col N="1783" /> propaganda, but when they are using it abroad they are using it in relation to people who know the facts.  The Americans will not be deceived. O.E.E.C. and its advisers will not be deceived.  They know.  Every one of the Governments concerned has a legation here which supplies them with that type of information.  They know that 1947 was an abnormal year.  They know that in that year not merely did the wheat yield decline to the extent I have indicated, but they know also that the yield per acre of oats declined and the yield of barley per acre declined. In the case of oats, it declined from one metric ton per acre to .8 of a ton.  In the case of barley, it declined from .95 of a metric ton to .61.  The yield of turnips, mangolds and potatoes also declined.  The yield of sheep and lambs was down by 36 per cent. as compared with pre-war.  Egg production was down by 27 per cent.  Milk production was down by 11 per cent. The number of cattle under one year was 17 per cent. less.  There is no point in the Minister for External Affairs trying to suggest to the European Economic Co-operation Organisation, or the American authorities administering E.R.P., that the decline in yield in 1947 was attributable, as he said, to the effect of the fertiliser shortage.  I am not going to deny that we cannot make a very strong case for an increased supply of fertilisers under the E.R.P. scheme. But let us make an honest case.</P>

      <P>I do not know to what extent the Minister for Finance is prepared to tell the Dáil his scheme for financing these or any similar projects upon which they may decide in the future.  There is a suggestion that the money put into the loan account &mdash; if that is the right name for it&mdash;under the Marshall Plan will be invested in Government stock and used for development purposes.  If that is so, it is clear that some further information is required by the Dáil.  We were certainly given to understand that the payment of sterling funds into that account corresponding to the dollar value of purchases made under the European Recovery Programme, was a device by which sterling would be accumulated to wipe out the dollar debt when sterling became convertible into dollars. If it is now going to be used as a capital fund for Government purposes here, at what stage and in what manner will it be replaced when the repayment of the debt becomes due?  Will any of the funds be used to finance Electricity Supply Board development or Turf Board development?  That presupposes investment on a long-term basis and, if so, can these organisations, or similar organisations, be required to repay at any time when the liquidation of liability under the Marshall Plan is being <Col N="1786" /> effected?  There is no reason that I know of why the Minister for Finance cannot give, and should not give, the fullest possible information to the House on these matters.</P>
      <P>Amongst the projects upon which the Government is going to embark is industrial development, and, for the purpose of promoting this industrial development, we are going to have an industrial advisory authority.  I hope that before the debate ends, we shall get some information concerning this industrial advisory authority.  Up to the present we know nothing about it except the names of the members and the fact that they are going to get £2,000 a year each.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know when it was made but it was an announcement from the Government Information Bureau.  Whether that organ is still fulfilling the purpose for which it was first created or is merely a propaganda agent for the Coalition Parties I do not know.  The first pronouncement made by this man since his appointment was an attack of a political kind. He said that the Fianna Fáil Party, the Deputies on this side of the House, were</P>
      <P>&ldquo;bracketing themselves with the various Communist Parties in Europe who were trying to promote disaffection in the hope of bringing down existing Governments.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The existing Government about which he was worried is the Government over there.  The man is an ass to start with. Is there any Deputy opposite who did not read that without a blush?  That is one of the people you have chosen to be the architects of Irish industry.  He <Col N="1788" /> then expressed his views as to how Irish industry should be planned.  First of all we get a formal pronouncement from this member of the Irish Industrial Authority that flour milling is to be nationalised.  Is it?  Can we get some authoritative statement from some member of the Government that a policy of that kind is to be operated. There might be a case to be made for that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Next we were told that if the Government gives protection to any industry then there is to be a new job created.  Sitting on the board of management of that industry there will be a Government representative.  Is that part of Government policy?  Let me quite seriously advise them on this matter.  If the Government participates in the management of industry it must do so in a controlling capacity or not at all.  It is an impossible situation for the Government to be represented by a minority of directors on the board of some industrial concern. The only consequences is that the Minister who appoints the representatives on the board can be questioned here in the Dáil concerning its administration while his representatives will have no effective power to direct its administration.  If the Government is going into industry it will have to go completely into it.  Any combination of Government and private interests in industrial management would be completely unworkable unless the Government is in the saddle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that Deputies opposite will discourage any intention on the part of the Government to adopt that particular suggestion by the brains of the national advisory authority.  He also stated that there should be a representative of the workers on the board. That is a suggestion that has been made on other occasions, and maybe there is something in it.  We can judge of that after we know what is meant by the term &ldquo;representative of the workers.&rdquo; If it is intended that there should be upon these boards, whether State appointed or otherwise selected, men <Col N="1789" /> of experience of the trade union movement who have withdrawn from active participation in it for the purpose of doing work of this kind, then I have no objection whatever.  But if the idea is that workers in a trade or industry should have on the board of management of that industry their representative acting as such, I think it is a completely wrong idea and that not merely will it put an end to trade unionism as we have known it, and to collective bargaining as heretofore practised, but it will mean that the board of the concern will be ineffective to do its main job, which is to direct and develop the industry.  I do not know whether Senator Duffy knew what he was saying in using those words, but if there is any intention of moving along these lines there should be some elaboration of this policy, because I am quite convinced, if the idea is to put on the boards of management of State, semiState or privately-owned concerns, persons who are representatives of the workers employed by these concerns, not only will the interests of the workers themselves suffer, but the interests of the concerns will most certainly also suffer.</P>
    <P>In any event there is going to be no new industry started because the policy of this new authority as announced by Senator Duffy is that those investing money in it are to have their margin of profit limited to the interest earned by an investment in gilt-edge securities.</P>

      <P>Is there any serious intention on the part of this authority or of the Government of imposing on those who may engage in industry the limitation that they will not be allowed to draw more in dividends on their investments than they would get as interest on a gilt-edge security? Anybody can imagine himself winning a sweepstake and seeking a suitable means of investing that money.  He could, according to Senator Duffy, invest in Irish industry, but, having risked his money in a speculative enterprise of that kind and taken all precautions to ensure that his investment will not depreciate, he can hope for no greater return, according to Senator Duffy, than if he had invested the money in Government bonds and sat back to enjoy the interest.  If that is the idea that is to be operated by this authority it will mean the end of development of Irish industry by private enterprise.</P>
      <P>I have no confidence in the intention of this Government to promote industry by State enterprise.  I believe that if we are going to get industrial expansion it will come more quickly and more effectively and over a wider field if it is promoted by private enterprise and individual initiative.  I have no objection, and Deputies who were in this House before know that I have never raised an objection, to State intervention where it was quite clear that private enterprise was ineffective, but I believe if the policy enunciated by this member reflects the policy of that board or the intention of the Government then we can give up any idea of industrial development by private enterprise so long as the board exists or the Government is in office.</P>

      <P>Let Deputies have no misunderstanding about it that, in the absence of any more authoritative pronouncement, business people are assuming that Senator Duffy is speaking the mind of the Government and that it is because he knows the mind of the Government that he was chosen for this position.

      <P>Particularly to Córas Iompair Éireann.  Was there one member of the Government with the moral courage to stand up and tell the public why Córas Iompair Éireann is losing money?  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;and all credit to him &mdash;did make some attempt to explain the position.  The fact of the matter is that Córas Iompair Éireann, in 1948, was paying out £2,500,000 more in wages than in 1946.  Every attempt has been made to suggest that the losses incurred by Córas Iompair Éireann were due to faulty management or direction and that the losses will disappear when the board of directors is changed.  Do not Minister know that that is not true?  Is it wise to tell the people that the employees of that concern can get wage increases amounting to £2,500,000 per year and that increases in charges for transport could, nevertheless, have been avoided? Is it not much wiser to be frank with the people and tell them that the increase of wages, the justifiable increases, that were sanctioned by the Labour Court or settled by negotiation have to be paid for by somebody and that there is no source from which the company can draw revenue to pay them except transport charges?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to take the clear meaning of the words contained in the letter which was sent by the company to the Minister for Industry and Commerce and which was published in the newspapers.  Let us have no illusions with regard to this matter.  Irish transport is in difficulties. Let us have no illusions that meeting these difficulties is not going to be easy.  You will not solve them by dismissing the present board of directors and putting in a bunch of Government nominees.  That is not going to solve them; that is only pretending to solve them.  It is leaving the essential cause of the trouble untouched.  This is not a matter which we can discuss now.  My views will be given when it comes before the Dáil officially.  I say that the Government were dishonest in every public declaration they made in the matter; that they are less than frank, and because they are less than frank, they are unwise, and particularly in concealing from the people the real cause of the increase in the operating charges of Córas Iompair Éireann which led to the losses of last year and at the present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same thing applies to a reply given by the Minister for Industry and Commerce last week concerning the <Col N="1793" /> generation programme of the Electricity Supply Board.  There is to be a new steam station at Ringsend.  In order to divert criticism, he endeavoured to convey that this was really a steam station of which I approved, with this difference: that I had approved of its establishment in Cork and it was merely being transferred to Dublin.  I approved of the inclusion in the generation programme of the Electricity Supply Board of a small station at Cork which was intended, as I understood it, to be used to boost the supply into that part of the network and which would not have been required except for that purpose. To misrepresent the decision to establish that small station as being equivalent to setting up at Ringsend a steam station which I understood him to imply would be as large as the Pigeon House is thoroughly dishonest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="A Deputy A Deputy">
      <NameTxt>A Deputy</NameTxt>
      <P>To replace the Pigeon House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Would someone explain this business of replacing the Pigeon House which has been there for some years and which, I think, contains six generating units?  From time to time as units wear out they are replaced. Some were replaced in the last ten years.  There is no question of replacing the Pigeon House in the sense in which I understood the Minister to use that term.  Each generating unit is replaced as required.  This problem of planning the development of electricity generation can be considered under three headings.  It can be considered solely in relation to the economic cost, and that is what the Electricity Supply Board is inclined to do.  It can be considered in relation to the development of national resources, whether of water power or of peat.  It can be considered in relation to national security in times of emergency.  On any ground, the decision to establish a new steam station of the dimensions which the Minister suggested at Ringsend is wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me admit that, earlier in the planning of the Electricity Supply Board development, I had tentatively agreed to the erection in Dublin&mdash;not at Ringsend, but at another site in <Col N="1794" /> Dublin&mdash;of a new large steam station using foreign fuel, because at that time it seemed to me there were practical difficulties of a real kind in developing turf-fired stations for standby purposes. It seemed to me, and I stated it in the Dáil when I brought the Bill here in 1944, that every turf-fired station would have to be a base-load station, because it was a station with a bog attached.  You could not lay off men or take back men according as the station was brought into or put out of commission.</P>
    <P>It is recognised that there must be in relation to a system which is based largely upon water power a great deal of standby plant.  It is obviously much more convenient that a standby plant should use a fuel which can be imported or not imported, as suits ourselves. However, in the course of 1947 repeated conferences between the engineers of the Electricity Supply Board and Bord na Móna secured, as I understood, an agreement that the standby plant requirements of the Electricity Supply Board could be met by steam stations using turf and that that was made practicable by the decision to expand the programme of Bord na Móna.  It is quite obvious that the absorption into the ordinary commercial market of the quantity of turf that might have been used in a steam station if the steam station was not brought into commission was less difficult when that market was enlarged than it was as originally planned. Again, I am merely bringing this matter in to illustrate the disreputable methods by which the Government are endeavouring to defend their decisions and to score points over their opponents.  It is not honest to represent the establishment of a new steam station at Ringsend as the implementation of a decision taken by me.  I did not decide on the inclusion in the programme of any steam station using imported fuel except, as I understood it, a small station in Cork intended merely to boost the supply.  That station was of no significance in relation to the generation programme as required.  A large station at Ringsend does inevitably mean the putting back to a further date the development of our peat resources.  Furthermore, I <Col N="1795" /> should like to know if the military authorities were consulted before that decision was taken.  It seems to me the height of folly in a world which might in three, five or more years be at war to concentrate in one area&mdash;an undefendable area of Dublin&mdash;such a significant proportion of our total generating capacity.  It would be far wiser to space our generating stations in smaller units throughout the country than to concentrate them into one unit located at Ringsend merely because it is cheaper to import English coal into Ringsend than into any other part of the country.</P>
    <P>I have, perhaps, spoken unduly long on this matter, but I do ask any Minister who proposes to participate in the debate to realise that the value of the work done in the Dáil&mdash;our debates are often acrimonious, but even acrimonious debates can be useful&mdash; depends upon the reliability of the information which the ordinary Deputy gets.</P>

The tools we use are reliable information.  Whether the statistics which are given in reply to questions are accurate or not, sufficient doubt has been created by the misuse of statistics in the past to make us accept them with doubt, and Ministers have got to break down that bad tradition by being frank and honest with the Dáil in future.  If they are, they will get from these benches criticisms when they deserve them, but constructive proposals when they are in order.</P>

Probably the most damaging form of dishonesty or slander is that which is carried out by way of innuendo.  I do not think that it is easy to deceive anybody, and I think it is a pity that Deputy Lemass, in particular, should indulge in it, because he has more ability than most of his colleagues and he would contribute more to the discussion if he did not resort to palpably dishonest statements.</P>
      <P>In a great many respects I might share Deputy Lemass's views.  A great many other people in the country might also share them in a great many respects.  However, he antagonises people from even taking him seriously by reason of that bitterness and of the false innuendoes that he interjects in the course of his statements.  I think it is a pity that we have so many acrimonious debates in the House.  It reduces the standard of the discussions, and it precludes the House from making the contribution that it could to the various economic and political problems of the Continent.  It would be a good thing if we could agree to avoid these acrimonious discussions, if we could agree to prevent over-statements and if we could agree not to slander each other, either directly or by way of innuendo.  I do not think that the country wants behaviour of that kind; I think it prefers us to conduct constructive discussion in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last portion of Deputy Lemass's speech was concerned with trying to justify a completely irresponsible speech which he made in Fermoy and which was reported in his paper on the 7th of March.  The speech was irresponsible because it was both untrue in its main facts and also calculated to be damaging to this country abroad, as the House knows.  This country joined with a number of other European nations in the O.E.E.C. to formulate economic programmes and plans.  It has to submit these to the O.E.E.C. and to the economic authorities now in Washington.  They have to be approved and passed by them before this country can get any allocation of dollars.  They are carefully screened both by the O.E.E.C. and by the American authorities in Washington. They are doubly screened.  The <Col N="1797" /> statistics are checked and counterchecked not merely here, in Paris and in Washington but most of the other countries have also an interest in verifying the statistics and in ensuring that there is no over-statement. Finally, when the allocations are made the provision of the money which is required for this operation is discussed by the Congress of the United States. Speeches made, even by irresponsible members of Parliaments in their own countries, are often quoted in the discussions on the appropriations of different countries.  Therefore, it is clearly damaging to the interests of the country that a Deputy of this House, and particularly one who is an ex-Minister, should make untrue allegations concerning his country's economic requirements or position.  Deputy Lemass, in his Fermoy speech, which he sought to justify this afternoon and which is headed in his paper &ldquo;Coalition Propaganda &lsquo;Dishonest&rsquo;,&rdquo; begins, first of all, by accusing the Government of falsifying national conditions and then proceeds to deal with the long-term programme put forward by this country:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Report gave a definitely misleading picture, both of the effect of wartime shortages on Irish productive capacity, and on possible future increases in production.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I notice that to-day Deputy Lemass did not seek in any way to accuse the Government of having given a false estimate of wartime shortages on Irish production.  I take it he could not do it, nor did he challenge the long-term report on the ground that future increases were also wrong.  It is quite easy for the Deputy to make a speech and have it reported in his paper, but he did not try to justify these assertions to-day.  He then went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The section dealing with agriculture set out to show the effect of the war on our agricultural production by comparing pre-war output with output in 1947.  It also gave estimates of increased future production... based on 1947 figures. The selection of 1947 could not have been accidental.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1798" /> I issued a statement immediately I saw that speech to try and minimise the damage that a speech of that kind might have on our programme which is at present going through the E.C.A. machine and the O.E.C. machine.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy in his speech said that the selection of the year 1947 could not have been accidental. It was not accidental.  The year 1947 was selected, not by us, but by E.C.A. and by O.E.C. as the year for comparison.  The long-term programme was compiled at the end of 1948 and the comparisons were between pre-war figures, in most cases laid down by O.E.C. and E.C.A. as the year that had been directed.</P>
      <P>The Deputy said to-day in the House that weather conditions in 1947 were bad.  They were, but it was not only here they were bad; they were bad in the rest of Europe as the Deputy knows, and nobody could have been misled by the figures.  The details and figures given were prepared by an inter-Departmental committee representing officials from the Departments of Industry and Commerce, Agriculture, Finance and External Affairs. Therefore, most of the burden of Deputy Lemass's speech was, in effect, an attack on the officials who prepared the report.  I do not think it is proper to attack these officials because that is, in effect, what the Deputy did.</P>
      <P>The Deputy destroyed his own criticism by saying that the Americans knew the facts; that they had their experts here to advise them.  Other west European countries had the same experience as this country in 1947 and their production had been cut by nearly half.  It is perfectly futile to suggest that the year 1947 was taken arbitrarily by this Government in order to mislead the United States authorities or the authorities of any other country.  It was the year determined for comparison purposes.</P>
      <P>May I, before I pass from that speech of Deputy Lemass&mdash;I dealt with some aspects of it before&mdash;refer to one typical sentence in it?  He said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1800" />&ldquo;Housing and health plans had been reduced in scope or delayed by incompetence.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Can Deputy Lemass seriously suggest that housing and health plans had been either reduced in scope or delayed by inefficiency?  Before the change of Government Deputy Lemass and his colleagues, when on these benches, did, in fact, allow people to die year by year for want of treatment in sanatoria.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Lord Mayor of Cork is listening to me because I want to speak about unemployment as it exists in Cork.  In my opinion, the number of unemployed there was never greater than at the present time.  Workers have been laid off in several factories within the past six months.  Every Cork Deputy must admit that he has been repeatedly asked to try to get employment for young people and old people in the City of Cork.  I am sure that Deputy Sheehan has been requested to do that as often as anybody else, and I am sure that he has to tell the people as often as any of us have to tell them that he does not know of any employment offering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been told here about drainage schemes, river clearance schemes, for the country.  That is no good to the unemployed in the City of Cork.  What are the Government prepared to do for the unemployed in Cork City?  The Minister for Defence is a Deputy for the city and I would like to know if he can offer any suggestion as to where we could put those people to work. <Col N="1804" /> Will he ask the Government to do anything so that those people can be employed and not have us forcing them out of the country?  That is what they are doing every week.</P>
    <P>I was in the American Consulate in Dublin last December, and I saw there a woman with six children who wanted to join her husband, who had gone to America 12 months before.  She had been told she could not get away until February.  There was an air of great activity over there, and when I saw the Consul he told me: &ldquo;You can tell that lady that she may be able to get away by the middle of January, because we are stepping up production here.&rdquo;  That is not a lie&mdash;that is the fact.</P>
    <P>I put down a question a couple of weeks ago to the Minister for Defence about the repair of furniture in the Southern Command.  I asked if it was a fact that it was being sent to Dublin for repair from all the stations in the Southern Command.

Surely, it should be possible to get the work done in a properly equipped workshop in Cork, instead of sending the stuff from Cork and Castletownbere all the way to Dublin.

      <P>The unfortunate thing is that when you ship the work up here you must ship the men up likewise in order to do it for you.  That is the trouble.  I would like to draw attention to the increased cost of living because of the increased bus fares. These increases will cost an adult family of six members an extra £1 1s. per week.  On to that must be added the 3/- per week that this family of six will have to pay in increased insurance contributions.  The Government should do something in the matter.  There has been a lot of criticism about one Minister saying one thing and another Minister saying something else.  On the 9th of December I put down a question to the Minister for Defence with regard to a couple of clerks employed in Collins Barracks in Cork, and I pointed out that one of the men had neither Army nor Old I.R.A. service.</P>

I put down a question a couple of weeks ago with regard to a man employed in the Board of Works.  He had offered himself for Army service but was rejected because of varicose veins. He spent seven years in the L.D.F.  In his case the Minister very coolly told me that he had no Army service.  Is it the case that a man need not have Army service if he is a supporter of Fine Gael?</P>

In the first six months of this Government we had nothing but plans and schemes with big headlines in the papers telling <Col N="1807" /> us what was going to be done by the Department of Health.  I believe the Minister had the best intentions in the world when he started out.  He visited Cork and we gave him a hospital in Mallow capable of accommodating 100 patients.  But since that time nothing further has been done.  Plans have been drawn up&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely want to recall now the great promises that were made about the reduction in the cost of living, full employment and the building of hospitals.  Deputy Lehane said on one occasion that the work would be done in two months.  I think the people have had their eyes opened at last and I hope they will be given an opportunity, though not at our expense, of following the example set in Donegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSheehan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in sympathy with the statement made by Deputy McGrath in relation to the unemployment problem in Cork.  It is not to-day or yesterday, however, that this problem confronted this Government or any previous Government.  If we all joined together for the working out of a better and happier economy we might go a long way towards solving this <Col N="1808" /> problem.  I suggest to the Minister that the best help he could give in that direction would be to lower taxation. Taxation is a terrible drain on the industrialist as well as on the rank and file.  If taxation is lowered more money will be available for capital expenditure and for industrial expansion. Those who pay income-tax will have more to spend on purchasing and will thereby bring about a better standard of living.</P>
      <P>A good deal has been said about emigration.  The people have always emigrated from this country to England, America, South Africa and all over the world.  We are all proud of our emigrants.  Even though they may be divided from us their heart is always in this country.  Ours is a small island country.  In rural Ireland, the children of farmers on small holdings who have families of six or eight must have an outlet somewhere.  This country is too small to provide for all these people. They have been emigrating down the ages and they have made good in other countries.  What can a farmer who owns 30 or 40 acres do for a family of nine or ten when they grow up? Some of them may come to Dublin, to enter the Civil Service, perhaps, but the majority of them have to go abroad, as there is room for only one on the farm.  The same applies to families of labourers.  I have listened to Deputies here advocating the division of large farms into smaller holdings of 20 or 30 acres.  I think that is a policy that is altogether wrong, because a man can only get a bare existence on a farm of that size.  The extension of agricultural production is, of course, a thing which appeals to many people.  We were discussing it to-day coming up in the train and it was pointed out that if the Minister makes another 1,000,000 acres available, we shall have over-production. What then are we going to do with our surplus products?  So far as the housing problem is concerned, I think the Minister for Local Government has done his share in trying to find a solution for that problem during the past 12 months.  He has appealed to local authorities to do their utmost also and they are doing their best, but you cannot build houses overnight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1809" /> We have heard a lot of discussion about turf production, but I should like to point out that in Cork we have 50,000 tons of turf which have been lying there for the last two years and which are rapidly deteriorating. I suggest that it is madness for Deputies to say that we should have produced turf last year at the same rate as during the emergency.  I am sure the Government has no objection to the people of rural districts producing as much turf as they want but, so far as I can see, the tendency in this, as in many other matters, is to look to the Government for everything.  I think that the production of turf is largely a matter for private enterprise.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, may I suggest that it would be much better for the country if, instead of bickering here across the floor, we pooled all our efforts to try to solve unemployment and to do some good for the country?  I think it would be much better, too, if the membership of this House were reduced to 50 or 60 members.  At present there are almost 150 members, each drawing a salary of over £600 with expenses.  I think this House could do much more useful work if we had, say, two representatives for each county. That would mean a substantial reduction in the cost of Government and I think the country would be run much more efficiently.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>The claim is made for the present Government that it has reduced the amount of the Estimates by £5,000,000 or £6,000,000.  That represents, in comparison with last year's figures, a reduction of 1 in 14.  The comment I have to make is that the services which were designed principally for the benefit of the poorest areas and the most depressed areas in the country, including my own constituency, had the figures reduced by 1 in 4.  I think that is hardly fair. The Minister for Finance should have left the Estimates for services which benefited the people in those districts untouched and should have looked around in other directions for the economies which he thought it necessary to effect.  The unexpected cessation of the production of turf hit those <Col N="1810" /> areas very seriously.  I am not going to comment on that now further than to say that it was a very sudden blow and a very big blow and that it increased emigration almost immediately from these areas.  I asked the Minister for Social Welfare for the figures in regard to the recipients of unemployment assistance in my own constituency last November and I was given the rather startling information&mdash; startling to me, in any event&mdash;that there were fewer people drawing unemployment assistance in my constituency last November than in November, 1947, and that a larger amount of unemployment assistance was being paid. To me, of course, the explanation was obvious because I knew that all the people who had no domestic ties, all the younger men, had left the area immediately employment on the turf scheme ceased, and that a larger number of small landholders came on the register.  These people, having dependents, qualified for a larger amount of unemployment assistance.  The amount paid was increased while the actual number receiving it had been reduced because there had been a big increase in emigration.</P>
      <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the contraction of the amount for the glass-house scheme, which, on the figures given recently by the Minister for Agriculture, was a very good scheme.  If the public purse has to undertake certain expenses in connection with that scheme, I would put it to the Minister that it is much better to expend the money in that way than that we should pay it in unemployment assistance.  It is a scheme which promises to become a paying one in a short time, even from the point of view of the national Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently we had an announcement that another enterprise started by Fianna Fáil is to be terminated.  I know the Minister will not agree when I say that it is going to be terminated.  I refer to the sale of the Ballynahinch Hotel, which gives employment to about 50 people in that county.  The people have benefited very considerably by the existence of that hotel. There is, I believe, nobody in the West who believes that a buyer who will run Ballynahinch Castle as a hotel will be <Col N="1811" /> found.  I hope it will be possible to continue it as a hotel, but the prospects of people getting into the hotel business in the tourist areas, now that we are getting further away from the war, I am reliably informed, are very thin, indeed.  I know of one tourist hotel in the West which is privately owned and which is already advertised for sale. There are rumours that another large hotel is also for sale.  With that information in mind, it seems to me unlikely that the Government will be able to find a purchaser who will keep that hotel going and thereby guarantee employment to the people now employed. It is going to be a very serious loss to the district in which it is located.  The majority of those employed are local people.  They are married men and their condition is going to be so worsened that I cannot conceive of any public scheme which the Government can introduce which will put them in as good a position as they are in now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>When money was lost on the operation by a transport concern nobody said anything about it, but because the Tourist Board operated hotels, objection is taken immediately to it.  Deputy Sheehan made a great many statements to which I believe a great many people on that side of the House would take exception.  It seems to me that if we had not the organisation of Parties in the country which we have had we would have a much different alignment of representation in this House from what we had even in the Fianna Fáil time.  Anyone who read Deputy Commons' speech last week will find that, making due allowance for his artificial opposition to Fianna Fáil, the sentiments he expressed are the same as are expressed by other Western Deputies in this House.  I want to congratulate Deputy Commons on his honesty in saying that he is not satisfied that his own side of the House has shown any earnest that they are going to make any more progress in solving the problems of the West than has been the case in the past.  We want to find out, for instance, what the Government are going to do in the matter of providing money for land settlement.  I know that complaint has been made that too much land is being divided, that it is a pity to divide any more, and that, in any event, if you give people 20 or 25 acres you are not going to give them an economic living.  What Deputy Commons and myself and a lot of other people from the West put forward against that point of view is that, in any event, you give them the means of keeping body and soul together, of getting a sustenance from the land which they cannot get from the bogs <Col N="1814" /> and the rocks where they are huddled together at present.  The people who have been migrated from the West and given small farms have, on the figures given by the Land Commission, increased enormously the production of the food that human beings require. Even if their families have to emigrate, they have had the advantage of having been well fed, well housed, and well clothed during their early years.  If that consideration does not appeal to the average Deputy, I want to tell him that the Deputies from the West place a great deal of store by it.</P>
      <P>I should like to find out from some Minister what the policy of the Government is going to be in relation to that matter.  I am not asking this Government, any more than I asked the last Government, to take all the congests in the West and bring them up to the good lands.  I do say, however, that the problem ought to be tackled and that relief ought to be given.  I do ask that the worst places in the West should get more assistance. A whole lot of other schemes in relation to the congested areas&mdash;housing schemes, land reclamation, and various things of that sort&mdash;are of no use to people whose lands are to be rearranged.  If there is a townland where the Land Commission has yet to carry out rearrangement work, the people living there cannot get a grant for a new house.  These people are condemned to live on in hovels simply because the public authority, the Land Commission, will not do its work or will not say that it is not going to do this job at all.  We asked the last Government and we want this Government to declare the extent to which this problem is going to be tackled, the number of people that the Land Commission intends to migrate and the places from which it is going to be done.  I do not think it is beyond the powers of the Land Commission to give that information.</P>

      <P>I do not like to refer on this Vote to anything that seems to be purely politics, but I cannot pass by a speech that I heard last week from a Deputy on that side.  I think it was Deputy Cowan.  He said that for the first time we now had peace and order in the country and that he, for one, although he had broken away from his own Party would not give his vote to put this Government out and the last Government in.  He went on to say that if Fianna Fáil were returned to power there would again be in the country disorder and disturbance.  That seems to me a very strange statement to make and, in view of the statement of the Taoiseach with regard to the difference between the position under Fianna Fáil before the External Relations Act came into operation and the position since the Republic of Ireland Act, it seems a very strange thing that any Deputy should prophesy that any Party would be justified in creating conditions of disorder and disturbance if Fianna Fáil were returned to power.  Is it not being made the case that whatever disorder did exist in the past, whatever lack of peace there was, was due to the fact that the people kept Fianna Fáil there by their votes and that there would not be any peace or any order in the country until the people changed their minds and put them out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the people again in the next election decide that they are going to put back Fianna Fáil will these people feel justified again in creating these conditions of disorder and disruption for the purpose of bringing duress on the people to change the Government? Does the argument not boil down to the fact that the peace was established simply because the people put out Fianna Fáil?  The Deputy who made that speech also seemed to take great exception to any criticisms being offered to the present Government.  He particularly attacked the one organ of expression in the country&mdash;the <i>Irish Press</i>&mdash;which does criticise the Government. It seems to me that any man who objects to one newspaper out of <Col N="1816" /> the great number we have in the country, both daily and weekly, criticising the Government has a totalitarian attitude in that he wants a single Party in the country.  I hope that we have departed from that outlook for a very long time.  That type of attitude has brought enough destruction to the world and I hope that the satisfactory position in that regard which exists between the Opposition and the Government will be continued and that whatever criticism is offered by the Opposition and by Opposition organs will be lumped if it is not liked. I think it is best for the peace and order of the country that it should be so and that no Deputy of this House will succeed in introducing any type of totalitarianism here.</P>

      <P>I should like to say at the outset that I welcome very much the fact that the Minister, notwithstanding all the difficulties with which he has had to contend during the past year, has been in a position to reduce taxation so far as the coming year is concerned.  That is a fact that should be welcomed by all Deputies of this House because I think it is fairly well agreed that high taxation is not good for industry or for increased production, especially as this is a very small country with limited resources.  It cannot be compared with any of the other countries in the world.  It is good to see that the Minister has thought fit to cut the cloth according to the measurement.  On an occasion like this it would be well to take stock of the present position in the country, especially so far as the future is concerned. I think we should realise at once that Acts of Parliament or the making of speeches or criticising one another are not going to increase production in this country.  That can only be done by hard work and efficiency and the sooner we recognise that fact the better.  I can speak with a certain amount of contentment on this Vote <Col N="1817" /> for the simple reason that I think I cannot be charged with criticising the previous Government or accused of making rash promises during the previous election.  I think we should forget all about that.  Everybody makes certain promises during an election and hopes to fulfil them.  He will do his best to fulfil them but if he cannot, that is that.  It is about time that the present Government got a little consideration from the Deputies opposite. They have only been in office for 12 months and surely things cannot be that bad after 16 years of as successful a Government as Fianna Fáil was, according to themselves.  They are unconsciously blowing sky high their own case by stating that the country is bankrupt.  Deputy O'Reilly stated in the Dáil last week that in County Meath 40 per cent. of the farmers were leaving the land and on the verge of starvation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MatthewOReilly" hpid="Mr. M. O'Reilly Mr. M. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that 40 per cent. of the grassland is not now set. That is a fact.  I further said that there were people on the verge of starvation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>That, I said to myself, is nonsense.  Deputy O'Reilly is hardly fair to his own Government after 16 years to say that the people of Meath after one short 12 months should be on the verge of starvation.  Let us be a bit realistic on an occasion like this and not try to score one over the other.  We are all pledged to do the best we can for the country.  The outlook for this and other countries at the moment is not just as promising as it was ten or 11 years ago and the sooner we recognise that fact the better. During the last eight or ten years we have been, like a fly in the summer time, basking in the sunshine of prosperity, but an economic blizzard has come now, and that would be there, no matter what Government was in power.  There is no use in the Deputies opposite trying to create consternation in the country by the mere fact that half a dozen men were dismissed from their employment.  That will always happen.  We have always had unemployment here, and I have said so many a time during the last 20 years <Col N="1818" /> in this House.  No matter what Government is in power, you will always have a certain amount of unemployment.</P>
      <P>As regards the various Ministers and their efforts during the past year, I do not intend to say much.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce will, I am certain, do his best, just as his predecessor did, to foster existing industries and help in the creation of new ones.  That is his job.  He is the Minister not only of the Parties represented in this Government, but of the Irish people as a whole, including the Deputies on the far side.  We have then that much abused Minister, the Minister for Agriculture.  He, too, I think, is doing his best in the interests of the farmers, but his work, too, will take time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Deputies seem to think that the Minister for Agriculture is going out of his way to do things that militate against the best interests of the farmers.  Now, I come from a county in which mixed farming is carried on very extensively.  Like other members of the House, I meet many farmers from time to time, and I must say that in the County Louth I have heard no undue criticism either of the work of the Department of Agriculture or of the Government as a whole.  I cannot understand where some Deputies get their information.  They seem to meet people who are always complaining.  It may be that those people are different from the people of the County Louth.  I know that, as far as the farmers in Louth are concerned, and indeed farmers all over the country, the position is this, that while there may be certain things about which they are a bit annoyed at the moment, their income does not seem to have decreased to any appreciable extent last year as compared with previous years.  I want to substantiate that statement by referring to the statements made by the various chairmen at the annual meetings of the joint stock banks.  I am sure nobody will suggest that they are telling lies or making false reports.  It will be seen from these annual reports that the deposits in the banks were greater last year than during any previous year.  In <Col N="1819" /> view of the fact that agriculture is our chief industry, one must assume that a great part of those moneys put on deposit came from the farmers.  We should be all proud of that fact and should not try to minimise it.  Neither should we criticise the Minister because of the fact that a particular person happens to be in that position at the moment.</P>
    <P>So far as I can see production seems to have increased considerably in many spheres of agriculture.  Poultry is a case in point.  That is an industry that has always yielded a considerable income the whole year round.  The production of poultry has increased to such a large extent that I understand the L.M.S. have had to put on extra cargo boats to meet the demands of the export trade.  That is so far as poultry is concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>And eggs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>The same is true of eggs.  I am sure that a great many people who supported Fianna Fáil at the last election, and were entitled to do so, have benefited from this increased production of eggs and poultry because they knew it was good business. The Minister for Agriculture, realising his responsibilities, is, I think, doing his best.  Deputies must agree that so far as he, personally, is concerned he is a hard worker.  I do not think his labours are confined to eight hours a day, judging by the close attention he gives to the work of his Department.  I think that if he and the other Ministers receive the co-operation which they are entitled to, especially in the case of many schemes which are contemplated and are calculated to increase the productivity of the country, much good can be done for the country.  I hope that those schemes will, at least, get the tentative co-operation of the Party opposite and of their supporters in the country.  If that is done, much more employment will be provided for the people.  I think the Ministers are entitled to that co-operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies should remember that we have millions of acres of land going to waste.  If they help schemes for the <Col N="1820" /> reclamation of that land, so that it may be brought into production, then they will be doing the work they were sent here by the people to do.  I think it is bad policy to be magnifying any little shortcomings that there may be in this or in any other Government.</P>
    <P>Take housing.  I think there has been undue criticism of the policy pursued by the present Minister.  In my opinion he is doing his best.  I ask Deputies to remember that, even if the country were full of money, we could not build one extra house.  We have first to wait for the skilled labour required to do so.  That is true, no matter what Minister or what Government is in power.  I think Deputy T. Brennan would bear me out on that. It is not a question of money but of getting men to erect the houses.  There is only one factor that will solve the housing problem, and that factor is time.  It is important to remember that Fianna Fáil, during the greater part of its régime, was engaged in building houses for people who had houses that were not fit to live in.  In other words, for every house they built they knocked down one.  That is the explanation of the fact that despite all the houses that have been built there still is a scarcity.</P>
    <P>The housing problem, as I say, will be solved in time no matter what Government is in power&mdash;in one, two, or three years.  I do not think it is good policy, because you have a boom in a particular industry for one or two years, that you should take thousands and thousands of people into it, and then at the end have a slump.  We had an example of that in the case of the turf industry.  As regards housing, we all know that we are not complete masters of the situation here.  There are many things required for houses that we have to import.  We had shortages during late years.</P>
    <P>As regards the position we occupy internationally, I think that our Minister for External Affairs did excellent work during the past year, as did his predecessor.  I think we can congratulate ourselves on the position in which the country finds itself at the moment. I do not intend to say much about unemployment. I have expressed my <Col N="1821" /> views on it on many occasions in this House.  I think that problem will be solved to a certain extent when all, including the workers, recognise that this is a small, poor country, and that it can give a certain standard of living to the majority of its people.  We may then be on the road to the solution of the unemployment problem.  It will be very difficult, almost impossible, without general co-operation.</P>
    <P>The Leader of Fianna Fáil said in this House that he saw no reason why this country would not support 9,000,000 people.  I shook my head, because I knew that after a bit he would more or less have to amend that statement. He did so, and all credit to him. It will require the co-operation of everyone in this country to solve unemployment. There is no use in magnifying small aspects, such as a few men being dismissed here and a few being dismissed there.  In the building trade we did not wait to be sacked and we did not go to a Minister or a Deputy to complain.  We set our chins and took the road to look for another job.</P>
    <P>I deplore the tendency in this country lately of people sending word to the Minister to know what he will do because so many men have been dismissed in a particular job.  The less a Government interferes with the ordinary affairs of our people the better.  Let the people use their own initiative and enterprise and you will find this country will be much better off in the course of a few years.  We have to sink or swim together, and make no mistake about that.  It does not matter what Government is in power; we have to help one another. This Government in the main will make progress in accordance with the assistance it gets, not alone from those who support it but from Deputies on the opposite benches and above all from the people generally throughout the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened carefully to Deputy Coburn.  He suggested that Deputies on this side of the House should not talk about unemployment and emigration, should not magnify the evils that exist in the country to-day. It is a great pity that Government Deputies did not take up that <Col N="1822" /> attitude during the last general election when they attacked Fianna Fáil and tried to persuade the people that the Fianna Fáil Government was responsible for unemployment and emigration and other attendant evils.  It now appears, since there has been a change of Government, that we cannot talk about these things at all.  The fact of the matter is that there never was such unemployment and never such emigration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">

    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should permit me to speak; he is very good at interruptions.  There was talk about the twin evils of unemployment and emigration.  I think it is right to bring to the notice of the Government that these twin evils are greater to-day than they were at any time and the Government apparently has no solution for them.</P>
      <P>I have risen particularly to point out to the House that there is a reduction of £20,000 in the Gaeltacht Estimate for Seirbhísí na Gaeltachta.  I cannot understand why that is the case, why there is such a reduction in the Gaeltacht Estimate and an increase of £20,000 in the Estimate for the External Affairs Department.  I know that it is necessary for this country to follow the trend of external affairs and to play its part in any deliberations and activities that take place between the nations, but I believe that it is much more important for us to look after the interests of the weakest section of our community before we expand our provision for the Estimate for External Affairs.</P>
      <P>The people living in the Gaeltacht are the weakest section of the community and any Government in power here should see to it that there is provision made to assist those people. There was a time when there was a Parliamentary Secretary in charge of Seirbhísí na Gaeltachta.  I still believe that there should be a Parliamentary Secretary, if not a Minister, in charge of that service.</P>

      <P>That is another matter. Whether there is a Minister or a Parliamentary Secretary in charge of Seirbhísí na Gaeltachta I do not see any justification for a reduction of £20,000.  But that is not the whole story.  There are other reductions in the Book of Estimates which I hold are completely unjustifiable.  They affect the people of the Gaeltacht and the welfare of the Irish language.  We have, for instance, a reduction of no less than £64,000 for the glass-house scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not know all about it, because the Minister for Agriculture has given us no information, and neither has the Minister for Finance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>When a question was put to the Minister for Agriculture as to whether the glass-house scheme, as it is called, was a success, he said the time had not yet arrived to make a comment.  &ldquo;It is too soon,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to make any comment on the glass-house scheme in the Gaeltacht.&rdquo;  It is a pity the Minister did not take up that attitude earlier; at the time when he said that the scheme was a flop and when he called it an exotic scheme.  We are still without information as to whether the Government propose to continue the scheme.  I am afraid we are inclined to be sceptical when we see that the Estimate has been reduced by no less than £64,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also in that Book of Estimates a reduction of £3,000 in the scheme which provides grants for Irish-speaking families in the Gaeltacht. There is a reduction of £4,000 in the amount to be made available for Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge.  If we add these reductions together&mdash;the reduction of £20,000 in the Estimate itself, the reduction of £64,000 for the erection of glass-houses in the Gaeltacht, the reduction of £3,000 for Irishspeaking families and £1,000 for Comhdháil <Col N="1824" /> Náisiúnta na Gaeilge&mdash;we get a grand total of £91,000.  It seems to me that the policy of the present Government is to forget about the Gaeltacht and to reduce the Estimates relating both to the Gaeltacht and the Irish language.  The moneys so saved may be used for other purposes, but if so, I think that is a bad policy.  We all acknowledge that the problem of the Gaeltacht is one that should be tackled. We all believe, or profess to believe, that the people of the Gaeltacht have first claim on our consideration.  But we are now reducing the Estimate for that particular service which deals with the Gaeltacht.  I think that is an indefensible step.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why the Estimate for the Department of External Affairs should be increased by £20,000. When the Minister is replying, I would like him to give some justification for that increase.  I think it would be better for us to keep our eyes on the problems affecting us here at home before we concern ourselves too much with problems abroad.</P>
    <P>There are a few other matters to which I would like to advert in connection with this Vote on Account. Reference has been made to unemployment in rural Ireland.  The problem of emigration has been mentioned. Lest anybody might think that we refer to these things for political motives, I would like to quote from an independent paper to show the magnitude of the problem and give the House some idea of what the position is in certain parts of rural Ireland. So great has been the increase in unemployment along the western seaboard and especially in the county that I have the honour to represent that <i>The Kerryman</i> thought it advisable to send one of their staff reporters to find out for himself what conditions are.  I have here a report published on the 11th December, only a couple of months ago.  As far as my knowledge goes, the position is even worse to-day. Yet, the present Government seems to ignore the position.  Here is an extract from the report.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;An Chiarraíoch.&rdquo;  It can hardly be said that <i>The Kerryman</i> is prejudiced against the present Government. Yet this is what the staff reporter found: &ldquo;In a district adjacent to Killorglin town and extending roughly to five square miles a <i>Kerryman</i> staff reporter this week investigated the conditions under which approximately 10,000 people live and was appalled by the conditions he found existing.  He found that practically every family in the area is dependent for existence on remittances sent by relatives from England; that the people were fatalistically accepting the fact that when the youngsters at present at school grow up they too will emigrate and that meanwhile many mouths have to be filled and are being filled with limited rations of bread, tea and potatoes.  Meat is a luxury here among these people who during the war years worked on turf schemes estimated to be worth £120,000.  We went into cottages at random.  The cottages in every case are clean and neatly kept.  The children, and they are many, bright and intelligent. There was no complaining here&mdash;just a longing that something might be done to provide them with employment at home.  A 20-year-old boy who, like every other boy and girl I spoke to, said he was going to England, told me &lsquo;If I could get a job at home I would stay.&lsquo;&rdquo;  That is the condition of affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1826" /> What is true of County Kerry, which I represent, is equally true of many other counties along the western seaboard. There is no work for the people there and they have to emigrate. Emigration is more rife in these counties now than it has ever been.  When is the present Government going to bring its plan for stopping emigration into operation?  That is the plan we were told about in the last general election.  It is about time we heard something more about it.  This is not my own statement; therefore, it cannot be said that I am doing this for political purposes.  I am giving the House what an independent reporter found for himself. I am giving the House a description of the conditions as he found them. The sooner the Government turns its attention to the people living in these areas the better.  I do not know whether any reference has been made so far&mdash;if there has I did not hear it&mdash; to the question of the price of milk delivered to creameries.

I wonder what his Party did for the Gaeltacht during their period of office.  The principal industry in the Gaeltacht would be fishing, and it is the one industry that should have been developed in order to give the people full employment. Yet during all that time, it cannot be contradicted that the fishing industry was entirely neglected.  In fact, when this Government took over, it found that the fishermen had no proper gear, scarcely any boats of value and everything was in a deplorable state.  Had it not been for the war years, when whatever fish they were able to catch carried a good price, the fishermen in that area would have been drawing unemployment benefit.  As a matter of fact, owing to some regulation of the Fianna Fáil Government, they could not even do that.  However, that matter has been rectified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the present Minister for Agriculture has taken over control of fisheries, he has made wonderful improvements and has enabled fishermen <Col N="1829" /> to get boats and gear on a 20 per cent. deposit whereas under the Fianna Fáil Government, they had to make a 50 per cent. deposit.  In fact, the Minister has been so good to the fishermen in the various areas that any fisherman who had proved himself industrious and paid up all his loans in previous years, will not be left without a boat or gear even though at present he may not be able to make any deposit.  I think that is a wonderful advantage.</P>
    <P>It can be shown by statistics supplied by the Sea Fisheries Asociation that during the past year fishermen have made more money out of their catches and have been more successful than they have been for many years past.</P>
    <P>As regards unemployment in the Gaeltacht, there is always a certain amount of unemployment everywhere, and it is no new thing to hear of unemployment in these congested areas. The problem goes back, I suppose, to the time of Cromwell when he pushed the people from the rich lands back amoung the mountains of Kerry and Connaught.  The only way they can ever be made prosperous is by removing as many as possible and giving them land where land is available. Emigration has been going on in these areas since the famine years.  That is supposed to be the first cause of emigration and we find that down through the years it continued.  But, statistics will show that in the year in which the Fianna Fáil Government took office 11,000 more people came into this country than left it.  It was only when the so-called economic war started and people could not get a living at home, especially on the land, that emigration started again.  Once anything like that starts, when people go away they entice other people at home to follow them.  I suppose they paint bright pictures of entertainments and so on in foreign countries.  They have a certain amount of money and, for the time being, until perhaps they settle down in life, everything looks bright and prosperous and so others follow them. I know some people in my area, even in Gaeltacht sections of it, who had a good living wage at home and decent <Col N="1830" /> employment and yet they gave it up and actually used every means to get released by the labour exchange so that they could go to England or to the United States.  Emigration is a rather difficult problem and it will be very difficult to solve and to entice people to turn their minds from foreign countries and settle down at home.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kissane read an extract from <i>The Kerryman</i> of 11th December.  A staff reporter was reported to have visited that area.  As a matter of fact, he was not a staff reporter attached to <i>The Kerryman.</i>  He was taken there deliberately by a Fianna Fáil county councillor to write that article.  If Deputy Kissane had referred to an article in <i>The Kerryman</i> of the 19th March by a real staff reporter, he would find a very different account of the conditions in that particular area and the whole of South Kerry.  I shall not delay the House by giving quotations from it.  It is remarkable that Deputy Kissane should pick on that article and not refer to the other.</P>
    <P>When the previous Government increased the ordinary housing grants, they forgot to increase the grants for the building of houses in the Gaeltacht. The Minister for Lands recently introduced a Bill which increases these grants for housing in the Gaeltacht not only up to the maximum for ordinary housing, but £25 beyond it.  Therefore, I think that, on the whole, ample provision is being made for the people of the Gaeltacht.  I understand, of course, that they cannot be made as prosperous as those living on the rich land throughout the country, but, as time goes on and the fishing industry is further developed, I am confident that the people in the Gaeltacht will have cause to be grateful to the present Government.</P>
    <P>Anybody listening to the doleful tales of Deputies opposite would think that because they are not in office this country is heading for doom.  Deputy Lemass spoke of the distortion by Ministers of information issued by officials of their Departments.  In a speech recently in Fermoy he deliberately charged the Minister for External Affairs with submitting wrong <Col N="1831" /> information to the United States Government which may be the means of getting for this country greater help under the European Recovery Programme than that to which it would otherwise be entitled.  An ex-Minister making a statement like that is really guilty of blackmailing the Government and, to a certain extent, the people of the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Aiken's mind appears to be centred on oats, flax and potatoes.  If he had ordinary intelligence it would help him to understand matters of a political and economic nature.  The estimate given to him by Ministers regarding agricultural products should satisfy him, as it has satisfied the people of the country.  The Deputy manages to forget those agricultural products and the manner of their disposal. He is filled with the fantastic idea that we have illegal organisations in this country.  He forgets the time when he himself was connected with these and perhaps he should be the very last man in this House to refer to them.</P>
    <P>No matter what Deputies on the opposite side say, the people are perfectly satisfied with practically everything that has been done by the present Government since they came into office.  It is a matter of comfort to the taxpayers to find that, for the first time since the establishment of the State, there has been a reduction of taxation.  Ever since 1922 it has been mounting up gradually year after year and especially during the period of office of Fianna Fáil.  Last year the Minister for Finance managed to reduce it by something between £6,000,000 and £7,000,000.  This year, in spite of the increased social services and various other commitments which were handed down to him by the previous Government, it must be a massive satisfaction to the Government's supporters and the people of the country that he was able to bring about that reduction in taxation.  I would suggest that if the Fianna Fáil Party had been in power this year the carrying-out of these schemes&mdash;land settlement, shortwave stations, turf schemes, the producing of turf for which there was no market&mdash;would have increased the <Col N="1832" /> taxation of the unfortunate people of this country to about £100,000,000. Notwithstanding all that the opposite Deputies say, the people of this country have an entirely new outlook since the change of Government.  I think it is, perhaps, because of that and because of the improvement in the people's condition that the Fianna Fáil Party knows it is losing power in the country, that they have become so soured and are making statements which are anything but the truth. They have a habit recently of starting whispering campaigns, knowing that the people in their innocence may believe them.  You can understand the people of this country do not always read the daily papers and the weekly papers and, therefore, it is very easy to make them believe things that are not true.  However, they know that they need no longer have any fear of expressing their views, no matter what they are, and that there will be no victimisation of any kind.  That was not the case formerly, I am sorry to say.  I have had good experience of it.  If a man in employment&mdash;a postman, ganger or road worker&mdash;at any time said anything in opposition to the Government he was a marked man and very soon his position was filled by somebody more sympathetic to the views of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>If I may refer to some statements made about Government policy I should like to mention the policy of members of the Opposition and in particular Opposition leaders, in making statements either in this country or in foreign countries during their visits which may be in conflict with Government policy.  For instance, Deputy de Valera, as was reported in an American paper, stated in Los Angeles, when he was asked if Partition were abolished would he be willing that the Government in Belfast be allowed to function, that he would, provided that the powers of the English Government were transferred to the Irish Government.</P>

      <P>I should like to say that, on the whole, people are quite pleased with the present Government and I <Col N="1833" /> think their hope is that it will be many years to come before Fianna Fáil will come back into office.  After all, they can now look out into a free clear atmosphere where they can feel sure of having perfect freedom of speech, freedom from want and freedom from fear.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister for Agriculture in making his one conversion in this House in the person of the Lord Mayor of Cork.  I think he is about the only Deputy in this House who subscribes to the rancher outlook of the present Minister for Agriculture. The Lord Mayor of Cork stated there were too many people on the land. A typical city outlook.  I hope that the day will not come when we have a Dáil in this country, as outlined by the Lord Mayor of Cork here to-night, of 65 Deputies with the same views and outlook as the present Minister for Agriculture and himself.  In any event, I think it would be an impossibility.  I do not believe that if you searched all the zoos in the world you would get 65 of the species.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present Minister for Agriculture has set out deliberately to turn this country into a cattle ranch for Britain. He has set out deliberately to discourage tillage, to grow more grass, to produce cheaper and more meat for the British market.  It was not sufficient to warn the Minister at the time that he negotiated the trade agreement that the British always buy in the cheapest market and that if there is an alternative market cheaper than ours the British will avail of it.  That has always been their policy and that is their present-day policy.  If the cattle population in other countries which used to compete with us in the British market were up to standard to-day and they could buy there more cheaply, they certainly would not buy from us. The present Minister missed the greatest opportunity of any Minister of any Government in this country of providing employment here and of providing a permanent market for the export of beef from this country.  For the first time in the history of this State he had the opportunity of having our live stock slaughtered here, thereby giving the employment that is now given in <Col N="1834" /> Birkenhead and elsewhere.  He was in the position that he represented a State that had an exportable surplus of meat when the whole of Europe was looking for meat.  This matter could not be tackled before because we were dependent more or less on the British market due to our long economic history with Britain, and if they closed down on us as they did during the economic war they could penalise us to a certain degree.  However, the present Minister for Agriculture was in the position that he had ample markets for his product.  If the British did not want our cattle dead there were various other countries that would take our meat and he let that opportunity slip.</P>
    <P>He then came into the House a couple of nights ago and attempted to perpetrate one of the greatest political frauds that were ever attempted in this House.  He tried to put over on the Irish housewife that 2/6 a dozen for eggs is better than 3/-.  We have been listening to the Minister for Agriculture throughout the last 12 months asking the people to produce more eggs and saying that the more eggs produced the greater the price that would be available.  We listened to him when he invited himself to a meeting of the Mayo County Committee of Agriculture recently when he assured the people there, publicly, that the more eggs produced the more money they could get.  Can anybody explain why the Minister for Agriculture has accepted this reduction of 6d. a dozen in the price of eggs?</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>What about next year's price?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any logical reason why the Minister should accept that price?  A price of 3/- a dozen was guaranteed under the previous régime. The Minister attempted in the House the other night, in order to cover up his own failure, to put over the idea that a firm bargain was made whereby, at the expiration of a two years' period or on exhaustion of the money supplied for this egg and poultry scheme, we were committed to sell our eggs to Britain at 20/- per great 100.  That is an absolute untruth and the Minister <Col N="1835" /> knows that quite well.  He said here last week:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;However in 1950 a new price would have to be negotiated and the only assurance we have for that year is that it will not be less than 20/-per long 100 which is about the equivalent of 1/6 a dozen.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>What it means to the producer is not material.  The fact is that the Minister tried to twist the position under the previous trade agreement in this way that we were committed to sell our eggs after a period of two years at 20/- per long 100.  The fact is that we have other markets than Britain. There is Spain for example.  When the Minister went over recently he should have known that he was not tied to the British market.  Under the agreement negotiated by his predecessor this country was not committed to sell to the British at all after the two year period, or as soon as the amount of money provided by way of subsidisation for this scheme was exhausted. I think I know the real reason why the price of eggs has been reduced by the Minister under the recent trade agreement. The British put up £1,350,000 for this scheme and our Government had to put up a similar amount.  Is it because the Minister for Finance has refused to give the Minister for Agriculture the proportionate amount of money to subsidise the scheme on this side that the price has been reduced? I believe that is the true reason why the Minister for Agriculture was forced to go over and accept 2/6 per dozen for Irish eggs after guaranteeing publicly in written articles and notably in the article published in <i>P.E.P.</i> last May, that the more eggs the Irish housewife produced the more money would be available for her.  Our egg producers have got a rude awakening in this matter as well as in many others from the present Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A few nights ago, when complaints were made here about the price of milk and the condition of the dairying industry, the Minister for Agriculture tried to flood us with statistics to prove something that everybody knows to be <Col N="1836" /> untrue.  I am not concerned with the dairying industry because we have no creameries in our part of the country, but there is a problem there that is prevalent in every town in the West of Ireland.  The position there is that it is impossible to get milk.  Milk is rationed in virtually every town in the County Mayo that I am familiar with.  I can tell the Minister that, during the last month, there were several prosecutions for black marketing milk in Westport.  Does he think that we live in the moon, or that the consumers of milk in those towns are going to pay more than the fixed price for it if there is milk available for them to buy, or if there is competition between milk producers?  The fact is that the Minister's policy is driving dairy farmers out of production in the West of Ireland.  These farmers have to meet increased costings and increased wages.  All costs in connection with the milk industry have been increased, and yet the Minister has refused to do anything about the matter.</P>
    <P>The position is that the unfortunate people in the towns there have to take a pint of milk where they expected to get a quart because the dairy farmers have been driven out of production and are not in a position to meet the demand. I do not know what the Minister proposes to do about that.  If he thinks that by coming into the House and by waving his arms, as he did the other night, he can put over the statement that there is no such thing as a scarcity of milk in the country he is just fooling.</P>
    <P>He also told us that there was an increase in pig production.  In 1947, before ever he became Minister for Agriculture, every curing company in the country knew that, once feeding stuffs became available, the pig population was going to increase and was, in fact, on the increase.  Everybody connected with the bacon industry and with the production of pigs knows that the production of pigs in any one year is based on the sow service of the previous year.  The margin of error in regard to that is never more than 10 per cent.  The Pigs and Bacon Commission could have told the Minister that, and I am sure they did.  The sow service of the previous year indicated that <Col N="1837" /> we were going to have more pigs, and, goodness knows that was needed, since under the Minister's policy the bottom had fallen out of the market for oats and potatoes.  The pigs are there and there will be more of them.  The Minister was informed over 12 months ago by the people in the industry that the bacon requirements of the country would be met and that the chances were that we would have an exportable surplus even by the end of this year. He quoted figures the other night to show that once Deputy James Dillon walked into the seat of the Minister for Agriculture pigs would suddenly multiply at the wave of his wand, and that suddenly we would have the pigs producing bonhams and bacon porkers. One, of course, knows that is all codology.  All that one has to do is to point out the falsity of those figures, especially to city Deputies who may not understand the position as well as those of us who come from the country.</P>
    <P>I would like to point out that the first great fraud perpetrated by the present Government on the people of this country was the promise that was made on the abolition of the turf scheme.  In the area that I represent, when that scheme was in operation, the people were getting as much as £200,000 a year for hand-won turf, and we had over 5,000 people employed.  When those people were thrown out of employment we were told that work would be provided for them on the roads.  The Minister for Local Government said that he would employ all the people who were employed at turf work on work that would be met by special grants.  In the County Mayo we were gravely affected by the discontinuance of the turf scheme.  It meant as I have said the earning of £200,000 a year on the turf that was produced by the Mayo County Council, irrespective of what was earned by private producers.  There were over 5,000 employed.  They were thrown on the dole.  In substitution of that work on turf production, we were offered the magnificent grant of £17,000 by the Minister for Local Government, provided the ratepayers in the county put up another £6,000 or £8,000.  Even if the ratepayers in the county blistered themselves to put up that amount of money, in addition to the sum promised <Col N="1838" /> by the Minister for Local Government, the result would be that it would not mean three days' work in the week for the 5,000 people displaced.  The Mayo County Council, irrespective of Party or politics, told the Minister in no uncertain terms that he might as well try to empty the ocean as to try and replace the £200,000 that was being earned by the people heretofore on the turf schemes by his grant of over £17,000. At all events, the promise then was&mdash; it was the first great fraudulent promise to those unfortunate people&mdash;that they would be all absorbed, through these grants, by the work on the roads. No work came their way and the result was that they emigrated in thousands.</P>
    <P>We reached the unfortunate position that during the past 12 months, under the present Government's rule, the emigration figure in County Mayo hit the new high level of 4,430, an increase of virtually 1,000 on the figure for the previous year.  That does not represent the true figure, because any Deputy familiar with the people going out knows&mdash;and the figure that I have given does not cover it&mdash;that quite a lot of them go on what are termed holiday passports.  They get a travel permit purporting to go out on a holiday in order to get out quicker and not be stultified, when they go over, by being tied to any particular job.  The 4,430 emigrants who left Mayo do not represent the total number who emigrated from that county.</P>

      <P>This year in County Mayo we lost approximately £47,000, due to the cut in the road grant by the Minister for Local Government.  I wonder is that a reflection of Government policy?  Will the Government continue to take away from the congested areas one of the few sources of employment that the people there have?  In Mayo and in the West generally our roads were not restored to the condition they were in before the war.  We were not in a position to avail fully of the grants available from the present Ministers' predecessors. The result is that many of our roads are in a bad way.  Our unemployment and congestion problem being what it is, one would imagine that the Western representatives in the Government parties would press particularly for the grants to be left as they were.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>No, sir.  The money was provided for us in County Mayo the same as for every other county, but during that period there was a shortage of certain types of road material and that was one of the reasons why we could not complete our programme <Col N="1840" /> under the previous grants.  Again, during part of that time we were engaged in major turf production.  At that time a certain amount of labour was not available.  There were various reasons why we were not able to spend the full amount available to us under the previous grants and we were not in a position to bring our roads up to the condition that we could have brought them to had we been able to avail of the same grants this year as we had in other years.  There was no indication by the previous Government that there would be a reduction in these grants.</P>
      <P>The suggestion that this is only a temporary measure will not wash.  It was never indicated by the previous Minister that councils would be sent back to 40 per cent; it was never indicated to any county council that we could not look forward this year to the very same grants as we got in other years.  So much was opinion to the contrary that in our county we prepared the estimates on the same basis as they were prepared last year.  No one had any idea of a change and then we got this extraordinary circular from the Minister for Local Government, presumably dictated by the Minister for Finance, telling us that he was not allowed to spend the same money on roads as was spent by Fianna Fáil. The result is that we will have greater emigration from the west and more unemployment, the twin hall-marks that the Coalition are leaving on the congested areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the Government's supporters, particularly Deputies from my own county, decided, when a motion was put down here a couple of weeks ago, that they would have to support the Government on this issue.  They went against the express instructions of their own council.  They went into the Division Lobby and voted to deprive County Mayo of this £47,000. The excuse they gave when they went back to Mayo County Council was, in the case of Deputy Commons, that he could not catch the Speaker's eye, but he could enter the Division Lobby on the side of the Government.  Deputy Browne told the council that he had fallen for the Minister for Agriculture's new scheme, that everybody will be <Col N="1841" /> employed under the £40,000,000 drainage scheme.</P>
    <P>First we had the promise bluffing the turf workers that there would be work for them on the roads, and, secondly, we had the position that the road work is being wiped out.  The people are now being asked to swallow a new pill, that everybody will be employed on this £40,000,000 drainage scheme.  It is difficult to know much about this drainage scheme beyond the fact that the Minister says the money will be expended over ten years.  I want to put it on record for the benefit of the Deputies on the Government Benches who voted for the cutting of the grant for Mayo County Council that Mayo is not one of the counties in which this scheme is going to be put into operation. According to the Minister's statement, not even the Minister himself appears to know when this scheme will commence in the west of Ireland. I wonder what our unemployed are going to do?  I wonder what the people will do who used to work on the roads and on the bogs while the Minister for Agriculture is making up his mind as whether it is in 1952, 1953 or 1958 that this scheme will come into operation in the west of Ireland.</P>

      <P>I want now to refer to that colossal monument of Irish efficiency&mdash;the Irish Land Commission&mdash; with its present Minister for Lands. Prior to the election Deputy Blowick, as he then was, gave an interview to the <i>Sunday Independent</i> in which he set out his policy.  That policy can be summarised under four main points.  He wanted new legislation to deal with congestion; he was going to give cheap fertilisers and plenty of them; he was going to derate the first £20 on agricultural land; and he was going to make the town tenants the owners of their own homes.  I want to know what has the Minister for Lands done in connection with this new legislation, if new legislation is necessary to deal with the problem of congestion.  Prior to the election the Minister for Lands said that the problem of congestion in the West of Ireland could be solved in 12 months, and that what was wrong then was that the Fianna Fáil Ministers were lazy and sufficient money was not provided for the Land Commission. The Minister has been in office now for 12 months and, to use Deputy Commons' own words the other night, he has done nothing and the Land Commission has done nothing.  If new legislation was necessary why has the Minister not introduced it in the past 15 months?  This Government will certainly not go down in history as one that flooded Dáil Eireann with legislation.</P>

      <P>I am merely saying that the Minister for Lands held that some legislation was necessary and I am pointing out that no legislation has been introduced even though there was ample time in which to do so.  He told the electors that he was going to provide cheap fertilisers.  Instead of that the subsidy has been reduced by £329,000.  That is the way in which the Minister for Lands has implemented his promise to make cheap fertilisers available to the farmers in order to <Col N="1843" /> restore fertility to the soil.  He was going to derate agricultural land up to the first £20.  He has been, to use the Minister for Agriculture's expression, as mute as mice on that question since he took office.  I have heard nothing about any legislation where town tenants are concerned.</P>
      <P>On the 6th May, 1947, at column 2182 of the Official Report, Deputy Blowick, as he then was, said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Are we to leave 23,400 people in Mayo, not to speak of people in other parts of the country, to eke out an existence on holdings with such low valuations?  They are to exist there, get married and rear their children for export.  Is that the Government policy?&rdquo;</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Is the export of human beings to go on because no attempt will be made to solve the land problem?&rdquo;</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Is the export of human beings to go on because no attempt will be made to solve the land problem? Instead of asking for £1,140,000 it would be far better business if the Minister asked for £7,000,000 and kept doing so for the next eight or ten years.  Then an end of the problem might be in sight.&rdquo;  Further on he said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;It strikes me very forcibly that the Minister for Lands is not as forceful in making his demands as the Minister for Lands each year at the appropriate time, as the Minister for Defence or the Minister for Industry <Col N="1844" /> and Commerce in putting forward demands for their Departments.  I wonder is the failure to deal with this question with sufficient speed due to that inactivity of the Minister for Lands?  I wonder is he taking his office in a too lackadaisical fashion, in not demanding sufficient money for his Department?  At the present rate of progress, the Land Commission would not have the land question settled for the next 120 years. That is a very glaring state of affairs for a responsible Government Department. They seem to be in the position of a person with his hands tied behind his back.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Not alone has the present Minister got his hands tied behind his back but the Minister has been tied hand and foot since he took office.  What has he done to relieve congestion?  According to the Minister himself during his 15 months in office he has removed only two families out of the congested areas. Those families went to farms which were prepared by the Minister's predecessor. The Minister has moved two families out of approximately 23,500 in County Mayo.  If that is the Minister's rate of progress it will take him 2,400 years to do the job which he accused his predecessor of taking 120 years to do.  Possibly that may solve the Minister's problem because there will be no people to take out then.  The Minister is quite aware of that.  We have listened in the past to the Minister ranting from public platforms and in this House about the operations of the Land Commission in bygone years.  The Minister may suggest now that there is no land.  Let me quote for him from the new republican issue of the <i>Irish Independent</i> of January 15th, 1949.  This is not that terrible paper, the <i>Irish Press.</i>  In that issue of January 15th there are farms advertised in Leinster over the name of one auctioneer alone comprising 1,487 acres. In the same issue, there are farms advertised by other auctioneers in Leinster to the extent of 1,893 acres while there are lands advertised to be let for grazing to the extent of 664 acres.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have allowed the Deputy a good deal of latitude but he has travelled far from the subjects that may be discussed on the Vote of Account.  He knows perfectly well that a detailed discussion of that kind properly arises on the Estimate for the Land Commission.  He will pass from that now to matters of major policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to point out, on the question of major policy, and I hope that I am not infringing the ruling of the Chair on this occasion, that I quoted what the Minister stated when he said that there should be at least £7,000,000 paid by the Exchequer for expenditure on this particular Department. Yet the figures this year are exactly the same as last year, with the exception of £100,000 and the major portion of that is not money expended on Land Commission schemes.  It is represented by the increase in the cost of labour or the increase in Civil Service salaries.  Therefore the Minister who now occupies the position of Minister for Lands, the very man who demanded £7,000,000 for the Irish Land Commission some years ago, is quite content now to sit back when the very same figure, a reduced figure, is provided for the Land Commission.  There was reason for a reduced figure as the Minister well knows for the Land Commission during the emergency, because the Land Commission staff was sent off to the Department of Supplies and other Departments and the normal <Col N="1849" /> functions of the Land Commission could not be proceeded with.  The Minister has not that excuse.  The Minister has got back his staff and still we are dealing with this comparatively small amount being expended on the most vital of our Departments, namely, the Land Commission, when, on the Minister's own statement, it requires at least £7,000,000 to make any headway with the problems confronting him.  I think it is obvious that, either before he became Minister he was speaking with his tongue in his cheek, or now, as he said about his predecessor, he is not sufficiently energetic in pressing the claims of the Land Commission and the other sections catered for by the Land Commission, particularly in the congested districts.</P>
      <P>I know that the Minister is quite well able to get round this matter.  Prior to the last election, he told us that not alone should a certain amount of money be spent by the Land Commission, but that the annuities collected for the land should be devoted to the work of the Land Commission.  He has travelled a very long way since then.  I am also convinced, and I think every Deputy irrespective of Party who comes from the west is convinced, that if you wanted to have a picture painted of Irish inefficiency and you imported one of the French Surrealists and he painted 26 Upper Merrion Street, there is not a backward farmer in Ireland who would not recognise it for what it is&mdash;a monument to Irish inefficiency. Unless the Minister bestirs himself, and I press on his colleagues to put some pressure on him, we shall still be talking our heads off about this problem for the next 20 years or, at the Minister's rate of progress of two people a year from the West of Ireland, it will take another 2,400 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not intend to say anything about the Government's policy in the matter of health and hospitalisation until I listened to the Minister for External Affairs to-day.  Here again we come back to the spider-like figure of the present Minister for Finance floating over the national treasury and refusing money for these vital services. Deputies on the opposite side of the House are also aware that the Minister for Health, presumably speaking on <Col N="1850" /> behalf of the Government&mdash;if any Minister does&mdash;declared war on the county homes in this country.  He came down to the west of Ireland and attacked the county homes and some hospitals we had there.  My council decided to try and do something about our county homes in Mayo and went to the trouble of getting an architect to prepare plans.  We came along to the Minister for Health, with all his high-sounding remarks which appear to signify nothing, looking for money, and he told us that if we wanted to do anything the ratepayers should provide the money.  He pressed us to turn the county hospital into a training school for nurses.  He knows just as well as any of us in Mayo that the hospital is overcrowded and that an extension of the nurses' home is required, which would cost approximately £30,000. When we came as an all-Party deputation to the Minister for Health, he blandly informed us that if we want to do this vital work we have got to find the money.</P>

      <P>Listening to some of the Deputies on the opposite side, it seems to me perfectly clear that they <Col N="1852" /> are more interested in Party politics than the welfare of the people in rural Ireland.  The previous speaker drew attention to various points in connection with agriculture.  So much has been said on that matter that I do not intend to go into it very deeply.  I should like, however, to refer to two points.  He spoke about the prices of eggs in his own area.  He maintained that there should be a bigger price given.  Yet his fellow Deputies representing various towns and cities are complaining about the cost of living. With regard to local government, I notice that the Deputy did not say very much about housing.  Deputy Burke spoke about it the other night.  Naturally each one of us is interested in his own constituency and in his own county.  I want to say that we in South Cork, at any rate, are very pleased at the way housing is going on at the present time.</P>
      <P>The previous speaker again laid emphasis on the question of the turf scheme.  Must it be for ever in this House a question of Party politics? Twelve months ago this question was dragged out again and at that time we clearly pointed out the fact that it was the previous Government who brought the hand-won turf scheme to an end through the circulars issued from the Department to the various local county councils in this country.  If Deputy Moran is unable to recall such a thing &mdash;I presume he is on the local council &mdash;it is just too bad for him.  I can say, at any rate, that the people in County Cork are fully aware of it.  In connection with the hand-won turf scheme naturally we are interested to see work going on as far as possible.  One thing which strikes me very clearly is that during the emergency the price was enormous and the people found it very difficult to get turf at the price, yet at the present time under the present regime in Cork City turf can be brought in at 32/- per ton delivered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy mentioned, also, the question of road grants and so forth. Again I should like to draw attention to the fact that no matter what Government is in power in this country in all local matters including roads, a great responsibility must, of necessity, <Col N="1853" /> rest with the local council.  No matter what Government is in power, if Parties through the local county councils are trying to obstruct and to offer criticism which is of a destructive nature no one in this country will fail to realise what is behind it.  Perhaps it may be indifferent to members of this house, but if the people in the country could but realise the waste of time by Deputies talking about things time by Deputies talking about things outside the country which they must know in their hearts is false from the start, they would have a vastly different opinion from the one they have.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of the road grants, at the present time it is not very clear what is going to be lost. In fact, we do not yet know whether there will be a loss or not.  However, I should like to remind the Opposition again when they speak of the grants that we do know that they were not going to continue giving the grants on the same scale themselves.  I should like to draw attention to the fact that two years ago, or a little over, we were told in the council by a circular from the Department of Local Government and, furthermore, were threatened afterwards, that if we did not spend £18,000 to £20,000 in mapping the main roads for the improved carriageways for tourists that even the grants we were getting then would be stopped. That has not been the case with the present regime at any rate.  Even on this side of the House we realise it is our duty to offer criticism when it is necessary, provided it is of a constructive nature.  If, however, any Party or any member believes that the constituencies they represent are going to gain anything by Party quibbling in this House in years to come a poor view will be taken of their attitude at the present time.</P>
    <P>Considering that this debate has dragged on for so many days already and at enormous expense any other remarks I wish to make I shall make on the Estimates dealing with the Departments when I shall criticise if I feel I am entitled to.  However, I assure the House that such criticism will definitely be of a constructive nature.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate on the Vote on Account this year has been carried on in a bad spirit, a spirit for which there was no need at all.  I am satisfied that if Fianna Fáil put in as much energy during the last sixteen years in solving the problems of this country as they have during this debate they would have had the same success as the inter-Party Government has. Fianna Fáil should get away from the idea of attacking the inter-Party Government. They should realise that the people rejected them and not the inter-Party Government.  I must congratulate the Government for the very peaceful state of the country.  For about 25 or 30 years we have generally had some class of political turmoil every other year but all this year we have had perfect peace in all parts of the country, thanks to the spirit and the good-will that the Government has shown to all the different political parties.  The inter-Party Government is, as we all know only on a try-out. Fianna Fáil strongly object to it but I suggest that as the first inter-Party Government it should get a fair trial. As far as I have seen during the last twelve months it has worked very well and smoothly and produced good results.  I think it is entitled to the respect of the people and of Fianna Fáil.  The inter-Party Government is new to Irish politics.  It may be of immense benefit to this country and it is only right that it should get its trial. Fianna Fáil are attacking the present Government all over the country for not having solved all the problems in front of them.  They are attacking them over emigration, employment, afforestation and all those vast schemes which they themselves spent sixteen years trying to tackle and never solved. It is unfair of the Opposition to do that.  They know that no Government, can solve in 12 months the problems that have confronted the country for the past 200 years.  Emigration is the major problem.  It is the canker that has taken the life out of this country. It will take superhuman efforts on the part of any Government and it will also test the resources of this nation to stop it.  I am satisfied that the schemes initiated by the present Government are laying the foundations of <Col N="1855" /> the stamping out of emigration.  I would ask the Deputies to realise that when a change of Government takes place it also means a change of policy. The policy of Fianna Fáil was very grandiose and high-falutin.  They were up in the air, up in the clouds.  Big things were all they wanted but they did not realise that the plain man out of the bogs and hills and out of the country towns counted more than the big men at the top.  That is how they lost control of Irish affairs.  Thanks to their foresight the present Government is starting at the bottom and is trying to give a fair chance to the underdog and that is what should happen. It has brought immense benefits to the aged, sick and blind and resources are being spent to alleviate the sufferings of those people.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil must realise that they left some bad legacies to the present Government, such as the legacy of the bankrupt Córas Iompair Éireann.  In that case the present Government has to find millions of pounds in order to put our transport system in a proper working order and no thanks to the past Government.  They should also realise that £8,000 or £10,000 of the people's money has to be spent on the fuel dumps in the park.  That is more waste of public money and bad foresight by the past Government.  Fianna Fáil should realise that these are the headaches which they left behind them. It will take big money and resources to solve those problems.  During the last 12 months there have been greater achievements in this country.  We have brought perfect peace to our people; we have brought freedom and there is no quibbling about votes and so forth. We have brought about what I think is of more benefit to the country than anything else and that is the freedom of the farmers from the shackles which Fianna Fáil put on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The farmer to-day is a free man and he can now work with a free will.  In addition to that the Minister for Agriculture has brought about a four years' stable market so that the farmer can see four years ahead with a reasonable chance of good prices in that four years.  He can lay down his policy and know that at the end of four years he <Col N="1856" /> will know where he stands.  We had not that in the past.  In addition, we have a housing programme in progress of which any Government can be proud. In the towns and villages vast schemes of house building are going ahead and are being intensified every day.  The more contractors we can get the more houses we can build.  The Minister for Finance is prepared to spend money on housing.  It is a thing which will bring great benefit to the people.</P>
    <P>The Estimates this year are being reduced by over £6,000,000.  The Minister for Finance reduced them by a similar sum last year when he was only a month in office.  That is what we want instead of the squandermania that went on before.  The people are very thankful that there was a change of Government.  They do not want the high-falutin nonsense that had been going on, the &ldquo;Constellation&rdquo; aeroplanes, the high and mighty spending, the big dinners and great speeches about things all over the world.  What the people down the country want to talk about is their way of life.  That was all forgotten by Fianna Fáil.  In regard to the major problems before the country, there is not so much dividing Fianna Fáil from this side of the House except that they want to pretend that there is.  Afforestation, drainage and the stemming of emigration are three major problems.  If we are all Irishmen and brothers we should try to tackle these problems.  There may be a difference as to the best way of doing so, but surely we can agree to differ.</P>
    <P>There is no use in Fianna Fáil bawling and ranting that the country is doomed, and that emigration is on the increase.  I am not going to say that this Government has stemmed emigration. We could not do it in one year, but I believe the back will be broken in it within, say, five years.  I do not believe you can have any such thing as the complete stemming of emigration. There should not be that either. People in the past emigrated to Australia, Canada, America and Britain. They were quite entitled to do so. Many of my own people, and many of <Col N="1857" /> my neighbours in the County Meath did so, and all of them did well in America, Canada and other countries. If freedom is freedom, then people are free to go away if they like.  One thing is certain and it is that the vast schemes initiated by the present Government are well calculated to stem emigration.  It is proposed to spend over £40,000,000 on vast schemes of land reclamation, field drainage, afforestation, bog developments, etc.  These will afford employment for our people, so much that I think many of those who went across to Britain will be required to come back and give a hand.  I believe they will be glad to engage on work in their native land.</P>
    <P>The problems that are to be undertaken are certainly of vast magnitude. They are being pressed forward by men of vigour and experience.  Some of the members of the present Government held office in a previous Government and have learned from their successes and their failures.  Some of the chief men in Government to-day were in Government more than 17 or 18 years ago.  They have learned from their own mistakes in the past and from the mistakes of Fianna Fáil and are in the position to build on a good foundation. I believe they are doing that.  The policy that is being initiated by the Minister for Agriculture is one that holds out great hopes for the farmers and farm labourers.  He has stepped up production in the case of pigs, poultry, butter and milk.  The farmers are quite content.  They are happy under the Government and they are not worried or trembling as Fianna Fáil has suggested. They know what the policy of the Government is for the next four years.  They have their coats off and they are working hard laying down their economy in their own way without interference from the Government or from anybody else.</P>
    <P>One of the Deputies for whom I have great respect is Deputy M. O'Reilly, who comes from my own county.  He is a man that I seldom differ from because I believe he is a decent gentleman. But I certainly found it hard to believe that it was Deputy O'Reilly who was talking when he made the <Col N="1858" /> speech that he made on this Vote.  He made a nonsensical speech, coming as he did from the County Meath.  He said that 40 per cent. of the land there that used to be set on the 11 months' system could not be set this year, and that there was starvation in many homes in that county.  I say that is a falsehood.  As regards the land that is let there on the 11 months' system, I know that quite a number of people who used to take it held back this year because they thought that the price asked for it, compared with last year, was a bit too high.  The Deputy forgot to tell us why the land was not being set.  It was because of the good prices for store cattle that people were afraid to pay the high prices asked for letting.  For that reason they were hesitant in taking the land.  I want to tell him that 99 per cent. of that land is let to-day at reasonably good prices, and that it is well stocked.  I do not think the Minister for Lands was in the House when that statement was made.  But what would he think if he were?  He would think that we were driving the Meath men out of Meath, and that it would be necessary to have another drive of migrants from the west.  He might think that Deputy O'Reilly was not a Meath man.  I would ask the Deputy to restrain himself a bit in future and not make such an opening for the Minister for Lands. We certainly had enough migration in the last 16 years, but if the Minister were to accept Deputy O'Reilly's statement it might be that the drive would be doubled in the future.</P>
    <P>We have been told that under the present Government a certain amount of money has been set aside to build a memorial to the memory of Griffith and Collins.  Who could object to that? Why should we not do that&mdash;put up a memorial to two of the greatest patriots that this country ever produced? They gave their lives that we might live in freedom.  I am not worried about stone memorials.  I am more concerned to see Ireland built up on a basis that will give us peace, contentment and prosperity, that will help to increase the population, that will give our people a better living than they had in the past and that will enable large families to be well reared, educated and <Col N="1859" /> properly disciplined.  That is the kind of memorial we want here.  The present Government are laying the foundations of peace and prosperity.  If they follow the policy they have pursued during the last 12 months, then at the end of five years we will have a memorial that will be worthy of our patriots.</P>
    <P>A Government's duty is to hold the balance evenly between all classes of the people.  I am satisfied this Government is doing that.  It is helping the farmer; it is cutting down waste; it is cutting down unnecessary Estimates and, on the other hand, increasing the Estimates where that is required.  In the past this country was run for politics and for politics solely.  Politics has been the curse of this country.  It has left us with a dead-weight debt of £120,000,000.  Emigration was not being stemmed and, as Deputy O'Reilly has said, there were men hungry in the country.  We are now getting away from all that and are facing realities.  The more we work the more we will have. This country is initiating schemes of national progress, schemes which will develop our national resources, that will build up our industrial life and strengthen our agricultural arm.</P>
    <P>Let us get all the industries we can started on the basis that agriculture is the key, the pivot, of our whole life. The present Government are working on that basis.  If we can attain that, I am satisfied that Fianna Fáil, instead of attacking us as they did during the past year, will have to change their tactics.  If the present Government keep building in the same way as they are building now, and if Fianna Fáil continue their present tactics, then Fianna Fáil will be a small Party in this country five years from now.</P>
    <P>I will say to the former Taoiseach, Deputy de Valera, that he speaks in a reasonable way in debate.  He may be able to use words with four or five meanings&mdash;he is a terrible man at that &mdash;but he is very reasoned in debate.  I hope he will ask some of his front and back benchers to modify their conduct, to behave themselves and to realise that they are living in a country that needs the help of every man so that we may raise it to a standard it never <Col N="1860" /> reached before.  The chance has come our way now and if we do not take it we may not, perhaps, ever get such a chance again.</P>

      <P>It was announced by the Tánaiste that it is desired to finish the financial business to-night.  I understand that the Opposition desire to speak on Section 4 of the Central Fund Bill.  I propose to move that the House will sit later than 10.30 p.m. but not later than 12 midnight.  Perhaps we could get some understanding now as to what time will be allowed the Minister for Finance to reply to the debate on the Vote on Account.  That would enable us to see what time will be left for whatever debate the Opposition may wish to have on the Central Fund Bill.  I think it will be appreciated that it is essential that the financial business will be finished to-night.</P>
      <P>I want to try, so far as I can, to make the best use of the time available. If there is no desire to debate anything on the Central Fund Bill and to let it go through in the usual way, the House might agree to the Minister getting in at a certain time.  If there is a desire to have a particular section of the Central Fund Bill debated on the Second Reading, that will obviously mean that the Minister for Finance will have to get in earlier to conclude the debate on the Vote on Account.  If the feeling is that the House should sit until 12 midnight I suggest the Minister for Finance should be allowed to speak at 10 p.m. and should be given an hour to reply to this four-day debate and the remaining hour should be devoted to the Second Reading and concluding Stages of the Central Fund Bill.</P>

      <P>In my long association with my native City of Limerick I have never known unemployment to <Col N="1862" /> increase to such an enormous extent as it has increased during the past year. It is a menace to the members of the Government who stated, when soliciting the votes of the people, that if elected they would cure unemployment in 24 hours.  A number of citizens in Limerick have told me that their trade has decreased very considerably during the past 12 months.  Increases in valuations, up to 300 per cent., and increased rates have placed a burden on the people that is unbearable.</P>
      <P>The housing problem in Limerick City is as large in proportion to the population there as it is in Dublin City.  The ambitious housing programme of the Limerick Corporation cannot, I fear, be carried out if the Minister will not increase the housing subsidy by 100 per cent.  The Minister recently met the Mayor, the City Manager and Deputies representing Limerick City, and the City Manager put up an undisputed case for an increase of 100 per cent. in the subsidy.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister for Industry and Commerce will consider a pension scheme for Electricity Supply Board employees equal to the local authorities' scheme.  He must be aware that they are paying 5/10d. towards a miserable 30/- pension.</P>
      <P>I also appeal to the Minister for Social Welfare to consider invalids and cripples from the point of view of a pension in his comprehensive scheme. There are not so many of them to be considered and they should not always be regarded as a burden on the rates.</P>

      <P>This lengthy debate has been very revealing in so far as those of us who are new to the House have had an opportunity of learning the minds of Deputies who, heretofore, were noted for their remarkable secrecy in the matter of their convictions, political and economic.  I was a very interested listener the other evening during the discussion on this Vote when my colleague, Deputy Burke of the Fianna Fáil Party, was pontificating at considerable length upon the misdeeds of the present Government. There was one point which he might very well have left alone because of the range of this Vote. thought that a Deputy of his sensitivity <Col N="1863" /> would have had more sense than to raise the question of housing in County Dublin.  He spoke of the lack of housing progress, as he put it, under the present Government.  Deputy Burke is not, of course, a member of the local authority.  He is, therefore, merely on the fringe of activities so far as housing is concerned.  He could not be expected to be as conversant with the problem as are those of us who carry the responsibilities of the local authority upon our shoulders.  During ten long, dreary years only 14 labourers' cottages were built in County Dublin.  It is estimated at the present moment that by the middle of next April there will be 1,000 labourers' cottages under construction in County Dublin.  It would appear to me that Deputy Burke had very little information in his possession when he spoke about housing.  He was certainly not conversant with the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am one who is not given either temperamentally or otherwise to the denial of the rights of criticism.  I reserve to myself very strongly the right to criticise any measure with which I disagree whether it be carried through by this Government or by anybody else.  With regard to the problem of housing I say emphatically that the policy of the present Government is as good a policy as could be implemented by any Government holding office at the present time.  The housing programme is being pushed with the utmost rigour by the Minister for Local Government.  Since his advent to office housing has taken on an urgency and an importance that it never previously had.  It has been tackled with an energy noticeably absent in bygone years. Now, there is undoubtedly a tremendous problem still outstanding but those of us who are concerned with the removal of this dreadful social evil of bad housing can at last see some semblance of hope for the many thousands of our people who are now living in condemned dwelling-houses and in single rooms; we can see some future for the newly-weds and for the large and small families throughout my constituency at any rate.  Because of the policy pursued by the present Minister for Local Government there is hope for them in the very near future.  It is <Col N="1864" /> quite true that even to-day there are cases of families whose living conditions are a scandal to all right-thinking men. But that is nothing new and it cannot be attributed to the advent of this particular Government.  It is something which has been part and parcel of the social system of this country for very many years.  It is something which time alone will eradicate.  I believe that the policy of the present Government will undoubtedly break the back of the problem within two or three years.  I believe that at the end of that period we shall be within sight of the finish of the housing problem.  That in itself will be a tremendous step forward.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke made some remarkably contradictory statements on this question of housing.  In one breath he referred to the alleged slow progress in relation to the provision of houses for the workers; in the next breath he deplored the fact that people are no longer permitted to build six and sevenroomed houses&mdash;in other words, they are no longer permitted to build luxury dwellings.  Deputy Burke cannot have it both ways.  Any Government which has to determine the situation must determine it by doing the greatest good for the greatest number.  The corollary to that is that they will permit a small group to benefit while the majority suffer.  It has been the policy of this Government to restrict as far as it could luxury building.  I regard that as very creditable on the part of the Government. It was a matter of comment by the people that, while there was no building activity on the part of local authorities during the years immediately following the war and while it was impossible to get a house built for the workers, luxury houses were being erected and that there were ample supplies available for them.  In the same way ample supplies of building materials were available for cinemas. All that has been stopped.  All the forces of the Department concerned are now thrown into the production of houses for the working classes, houses for the people who really matter.  Apparently, Deputy Burke deplores the fact that luxury building has stopped.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about the policy of the present Government in connection <Col N="1865" /> with turf.  Last year when the hand-won turf scheme finished there was a tremendous barrage of propaganda by the Fianna Fáil Party through the medium of their Party organ, the <i>Irish Press,</i> against the Government and everybody associated with it because of the cessation of the hand-won turf scheme.</P>
    <P>I think everybody realises now, irrespective of whether he admits it or not, that the hand-won turf scheme was an uneconomic proposition.  I believe, however, that there is a future for turf in this country.  I strongly adhere to the conviction that we can have much more employment than we have at the present time on the winning of turf by machinery.  I believe that the policy recently announced by the Government in relation to turf production will be of benefit.  I would make the point, however, that if we are going to build industries of permanent value to the nation we must build them on the basis of fair and decent treatment for the operatives in those industries.  Men living in the turf camps and working on the bogs under the aegis of Bord na Móna at present have much to be dissatisfied with.  They never at any time got a fair deal in the matter of wages.  It has been their unhappy experience to have gone through considerable hardships, during the reign of the Fianna Fáil Government, in order to establish the elementary right to which every worker in this country should be admitted and which now at the moment is admitted&mdash;the right to claim a fair wage for a fair day's work. I would strongly emphasise the point that no industry is going to be of value to us unless we lay down the cardinal and primary principle that we must pay an adequate wage to the men who carry that industry on their shoulder&mdash; the workers on the bogs, in the turf industry to be specific.</P>
    <P>Much the same can be said in regard to forestry workers.  The whole history of Government policy in relation to forestry workers, both under the administration of the Fianna Fáil Government and of its predecessor indicates that it has not been a commendable policy.  These are matters to which I intend to refer at greater detail whenever an opportunity <Col N="1866" /> presents itself during the debate on the Estimates.</P>
    <P>I have very strong views on the question of the Government's policy in relation to compulsory tillage.  I believe firmly that it is not a policy which is beneficial to the nation.  I believe we do require compulsory tillage and, lest I might be misunderstood, I believe also that the bulk of Opposition Deputies are against compulsory tillage, however much they may be trying to exploit the present situation to their own benefit.</P>

      <P>It is just as well one does not always judge the Opposition by their actions.  They were responsible for some actions in the past when they were on this side of the House which were not very creditable.  In this matter I want to repeat&mdash;as I say I shall deal more fully with it at a later stage&mdash; that I do not believe we can achieve that bigger cultivation of land in this country that we want, that we require for safety and in order to create employment on the land, on a purely voluntary basis.  I wish it were so, but I cannot subscribe to the idea that it is so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had also occasion during the year to criticise Government policy in relation to the tomato situation, with <Col N="1867" /> which my colleague Deputy Burke dealt so ably the other evening. Deputy Burke in this matter was a little bit astray in some of the points which he made.  I have made representations in this House and otherwise, to the Minister for Agriculture in relation to the importation of tomatoes and in relation to his policy in that matter.  I consider that there is a case to be made for protection for the Irish grower but I do not think that case is helped at all by exaggerations of the situation which are obviously untrue and quite easily contradicted, as for instance, the statement that was made that the policy of the Minister for Agriculture in allowing in Dutch tomatoes resulted in 50 or 60 tons of tomatoes going to rot in the Rush area of County Dublin last year.</P>
    <P>I happened to be in the Rush area over the week-end and people there thought it was the best joke they ever heard for several years.  I can assure the Deputy that if that statement were true&mdash;I am equally in touch with these men as the Opposition Deputies are&mdash; I would be aware of it.  I took the trouble to inquire and I found that that was not so.  That kind of statement can only do damage to what I regard as a very good case.  Deputy Burke also said that the importation of these tomatoes affected the employment of 800 to 1,000 men in the County Dublin. I should like to know where they are. I represent the trade union organising these workers and we reckon we have 99 per cent. of them organised, but we have not got 300 altogether.</P>

      <P>I have sufficient sins on my soul without its being said that I am supporting Deputy Burke.  These are matters which, as I say, can be raised possibly with greater effect at a later stage during the consideration of the Estimates.  The question of unemployment is one in which I have a very deep interest and which I have studied for a considerable number of years. Statements have been made that, as a result of the policy of the present Government, as the result of cutting the road grants, there is unemployment in the country.  Any Deputy who makes such a statement must obviously know that it is not correct.  When he makes that statement, he is talking with his tongue in his cheek.  Any unemployment which exists at present is unemployment belonging to the financial year 1948-49.  The cutting of the road grants affects the financial year 1949-50, which we have not started upon yet. Therefore, the statements which are <Col N="1869" /> being made by Fianna Fáil Deputies to distort the present situation to suit their own political purpose are not alone discreditable, but in many cases are downright dishonest.</P>
      <P>Many Opposition Deputies are members of local authorities.  If they are fearful of unemployment so far as road work is concerned, I suggest that they should do what other local authorities have done, what the Dublin County Council has done&mdash;ensure that sufficient money is provided from the rates to supplement the grants and thus ensure that there will not be any reduction in employment.</P>

      <P>It behoves every local authority to do everything possible to see that unemployment is reduced to a minimum.  I have held the view for a long time that road work in itself is not the most productive type of employment. In this country, which is predominantly agricultural and in which the bulk of our people get their living from the land, any Government should devote itself primarily to the improvement of the land.  Whatever the Opposition may say about the Minister for Agriculture, and however much I may disagree with him on many points, I do think that the plan to improve the land is fundamentally a sound idea, is a good plan, and is one which should be given every encouragement by all Parties in this House.  Once it is put into motion and got going properly, it cannot but have a beneficial effect on <Col N="1870" /> the livelihood of the entire nation. Workers in towns and cities and in industries belong to the superstructure of our civilisation which is built upon the land and upon the rural areas.  We must, therefore, improve the land at all costs, and in that particular matter the Minister for Agriculture's scheme will, I believe, be of tremendous benefit and value.  These are the few points to which I wish to refer on this Vote and, as I say, I shall elaborate them at a later stage during the debate on the Estimates.</P>

      <P>The Deputy who has just sat down opened his speech by making a reference to the housing position in County Dublin.  It was, like many of Deputy Dunne's statements, a statement which was calculated to deceive people who are ignorant of the true state of affairs which prevailed in that county in the early part of the ten years to which he has referred.  He told the House that in ten years only 14 houses had been built in County Dublin.  Of those ten years, there were four, three at any rate, when the chairmanship of the Dublin County Council was held by a member of the Fine Gael Party. then in Opposition, the late Deputy Belton.  Of those ten years there were four in which there was a Fine Gael majority on the council.</P>

      <P>Who was Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The neophyte asks who was Minister.  The Minister was a member of the Fianna Fáil Government of the day.  The Fianna Fáil Government of the day was a Government the Ministers of which had some regard for the rights of the local authorities, for the powers of the local authorities.  They were not like the present Minister&mdash;I shall deal with this more fully when his Estimate is before the House&mdash;who sends down his ukase to the members and to the officers of the local authorities telling them what they are to do, despite their position under the law.  That was not the attitude which the Fianna Fáil Ministers took up.  Perhaps they were foolish in giving some of these Fine Gael <Col N="1871" /> county councils so much rope.  I, at any rate, when I became Minister for Local Government thought that we had been a little bit too tolerant with the Fine Gael obstructionist element on the Dublin County Council, under whom, as Deputy Dunne, told the House, only 14 houses were built in the county in the four years during which they were in office.  They were abolished by me in 1942 for shameful neglect of their duty. Not only did they refuse to build houses but they even refused to collect the rates, and the ratepayers of County Dublin well know how the consequences of this ill-judged reluctance or refusal on the part of the members of the local authority to do their plain duty to the ratepayers reacted upon them and upon the employees of the Dublin County Council.</P>
      <P>When the council was abolished in 1942, the war was at its height and no building could be undertaken.  When the commissioner took office, however, the first instruction that I gave him was to make a general survey of the housing needs of the county, something which had not been done under the Fine Gael majority, and to prepare co-ordinated plans for dealing with the problem.  If, as Deputy Dunne has told the House, truthfully, there will be over 1,000 houses in the course of construction in County Dublin next year, this is not due to anything that has been done by the present Minister for Local Government, but is due to the steps which were taken by the successive commissioners at my instructions, first of all to acquire the land and that is a long and tedious process as you know; secondly, to prepare the plans; thirdly, to put these plans out to contract and to secure the tenders for them.  There is not a single house that has been built in County Dublin to-day, or will be built in County Dublin during the next five years, that has not been planned under the Fianna Fáil Government and for which, in most cases, tenders had already been received under the Fianna Fáil Government. Yet the Deputy has the hardihood to boast that in one year his Minister has secured 20 sites whereas his predecessors secured a 1,000.</P>

      <P>It was not about Deputy Dunne and the housing position in County Dublin, however, that I rose to speak.  I wish to address myself to the Vote on Account and to the policy which is enshrined in the Book of Estimates which was submitted to the Dáil a few days ago.  Last year when the Estimates reached our hands they contained a prefatory note disclaiming responsibility for them and assuring the public that it was the wicked Fianna Fáil Government that had done it. There is no need to proclaim who is responsible for the present year's issue. Everyline betrays the dominant characteristic in its somewhat mixed and equivocal paternity.  It is quite clear from the study of these Estimates that old hide-bound reactionary Fine Gael is again in the ascendency in this country. That is manifested in the volume as a whole in every Estimate in it and in every item of every Estimate.</P>
      <P>Considerable reductions have been made in the financial provision for certain services.  They have been made in conformity with a policy of political expediency which is shocking in its disregard of any national interest.  Certain other reductions which we might have expected bearing in mind the platform upon which certain Parties fought the general election campaign of last year do not appear in the book. That fact is no less shocking because these reductions were definitely promised by members of the Coalition.  I propose by way of illustration to retell just one of them.  To refresh my memory I will look at this leaflet:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Fianna Fáil have made you pay through the nose for your pint.  Do you realise that the rise in price is the Government's method of compelling you to finance increased salaries, judges, Ministers and T.D.s?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Here is another leaflet which appeals equally to the intelligent electorate:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In 1947 when everyone was suffering hardship Ministers' salaries were increased by £10 a week.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That quotation is from the election address which was issued by the present <Col N="1873" /> Minister for Health.  Here is one which was issued by the present Minister for External Affairs.  I turn to the back and I see precisely the same statement made in exactly the same words:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This year when everyone was suffering hardship Ministers' salaries were increased by £10 a week.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the issue which was raised throughout the country by the Clann na Poblachta Party.  It was the issue which was raised also by the candidates of the Labour Party and by the candidates of Clann na Talmhan.  Those three Parties between them now constitute the majority of the Coalition, and are in a position to give effect to these pledges which by implication at any rate they gave to the electorate when they were appearing on the hustings last year.</P>

As I was saying this was the campaign which was conducted up and down the country without any restraint of tongue or without any scruple of decency against the members of the Fianna Fáil Administration. What have these hot gospellers of frugal living&mdash;the Minister for External Affairs, the Minister for Health, the Tánaiste, the Minister for Social Welfare&mdash;he is faring very well <Col N="1874" /> socially, I am told&mdash;and the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to say about the campaign now?  I have gone through the whole of this volume and I see that each and all of these gentlemen are recommending to the Dáil that they should be paid the salary of £2,125 per annum, precisely the same as I was paid and other members of Fianna Fáil were paid when in office.

Any country which has adopted that policy has had good cause and has been taught by experience to regret it and the people of the country have been taught to regret it also.  I am not criticising these Ministers because of the fact that they have become converted to the view that the salaries now attaching to Ministerial office are not more than is sufficient to enable the occupant of that office to discharge his public and Departmental duties with dignity and without undue worry to himself.  If he is doing his job when he is in office all his attention should be devoted to public affairs and he should have no time to devote to his <Col N="1875" /> private interests.  That was the policy and the attitude which the members of Fianna Fáil adopted.  I only hope that all our successors are conforming to the precedent and the doctrine which we laid down.</P>

If I twit these gentlemen opposite because their performance has not been equal to their promises, it is not because I should like to see them giving effect to their promises, because I think that those promises were ill-judged and ill-advised. I hope that now that they have accepted the salaries prescribed by law, this question of Ministerial remuneration will no longer be bandied about from public platform to public platform in the mean way in which this was done during the three or four years that preceded the last general election.</P>

      <P>We raised them after two general elections.  During the General Election, 1937, we indicated to the people that, if we were returned to power, we would accept and ask the Dáil to provide us with the statutory salary.  In 1932 we voluntarily accepted a reduction from £1,700 to £1,000.  Now let us have no more of what we promised in 1932 from Deputy O'Higgins.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, let me get back to the general policy enshrined in this Book of Estimates.  A great to-do has been made in certain papers about the reduction represented by this volume of Estimates as compared with the amount which was asked for in the Estimates for 1948-49.  Last year the total Estimates, as printed and circulated, amounted to £70,520,000.  This year, as the House will see from the cover of the book, the amount asked for is £65,406,000, or a decrease of £5,114,000.  Government spokesmen have been boasting of this reduction and have been telling the public that it is something which is very creditable to the new Government.  That is the line which has been taken up in the Press, and that is the line which has been taken up in this House and elsewhere by those who apologise for the Coalition.  But let us see how this reduction has been secured.  It has been secured, first of all, by weakening the defences of the State; secondly, by crabbing national development; thirdly, by reducing the provision for certain social services; fourthly, by cutting the provision which Fianna Fáil made for establising the cost of living; fifthly, by suppressing the supplementary and uncovenanted benefits which Fianna Fáil provided for beneficiaries under the national health insurance, unemployment insurance and unemployment assistance schemes; sixthly, by drastically curtailing the provision which Fianna Fáil had made for civil aviation and development; seventhly, by depleting the Garda Síochána to a point at which the State will not have an adequate police force to enforce law and order and protect life and property; eightly, it has been secured by abolishing, or restricting, many services which Fianna Fáil had instituted several years ago for the benefit of the farming community, and <Col N="1877" /> for which provision was made in last year's Book of Estimates; ninthly, it has been secured by penalising the Gaeltacht and the congested districts; and tenthly, by omitting, perhaps because it was not necessary, to make provision for the relief of world distress.</P>
    <P>These are the ways in which this reduction in the Estimates has been secured.  Let any Deputy in this House ask himself, is there a single one of these things which has been done in the Book of Estimates which he would do of his own volition if he had any regard for the public interest or the welfare or safety of the public or the State?</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that it was worth while to defend the ports and to make proper provision for the defence of this country.  The Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party are following the policy which they have long formulated&mdash;for over the ten years to which Deputy Dunne referred.  If it was in order for Deputy Dunne to discuss the performance of the Dublin County Council in relation to housing for ten years, surely I am justified in reminding the House that Fine Gael and the Labour Party, in regard to national defence in the year 1949, are pursuing precisely the same policy as they advocated in this House and in the country in the year 1938: that is to say, they told us then, as they are telling us to-day, that &ldquo;it is not worth spending Irish money in order to defend Irish liberty&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, since the Chair is doubtful as to the propriety of referring to what Deputy Norton said when he was not Tánaiste but Deputy Norton, or what Deputy Dr. O'Higgins said when he was not Minister for Defence but a <Col N="1878" /> leading member of the Opposition in regard to the problem of national defence, I do not propose to dilate on it. I propose, instead, to take some items in the Estimates and to remind members of the House, or perhaps to inform members of the House who have not had the opportunity of studying this comprehensive volume in detail, what exactly they are being asked to do if they vote for this Vote on Account and thereby approve of the general policy of the Government.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it is too late to hope that my action in drawing attention to this fact will be effective, because, while the book undoubtedly represents the mentality of Fine Gael, we must not forget that I am told the estimates as a whole were submitted to a meeting of the Coalition at which all Parties were present, and that it was in general approved by them, so that every member of the Coalition, whether he is a member of the Labour Party or a member of Clann na Poblachta or Clann na Talmhan or Fine Gael or even an Independent like the Lord Mayor of Cork, has responsibility for what it is proposed to do here in relation to national services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I read it in the <i>Irish Independent.</i>  Perhaps, therefore, it is not true.  Let me see what it is proposed to do.  Clann na Poblachta is one of the Parties that went before the electorate with a very comprehensive programme.  Here is the Clann na Poblachta policy as set out in a speech by Mr. Seán MacBride at Carlow, and one of the things Clann na Poblachta proposed to do was to utilise our natural resources to the fullest extent possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us see how they now propose to deal with mineral development.  In the year 1947-48 Fianna Fáil provided for mineral development under four subheads&mdash;sub-heads N (1) to N (4).  They proposed to provide for mineral exploration and development the sum of £160,155.  This year the Coalition, supported by Clann na Poblachta, is reducing that provision by no less than £70,000.  So, for mineral exploration there is provided this year £70,000 less <Col N="1879" /> than was provided in 1947-48 by Fianna Fáil.  That is all in line with the policy laid down by the Minister for Finance when introducing his Budget last year, but there was such a hullabaloo kicked up in Wicklow and other parts of the country that there was an apparent conversion on the part of the Minister for Finance and it was broadcast all through the country that, thanks to the pressure which Clann na Poblachta and the National Labour Party had brought to bear on the Coalition, the policy of Fianna Fáil with regard to mineral development was being reverted to and that things were going to go ahead.  I will put down a question to the Minister for Industry and Commerce which will elicit the fact that practically nothing has been spent on mineral exploration and development during the past 12 months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Gaeltacht is supposed to be the principal concern of Clann na Poblachta.  If we turn to Vote 54 we will see there a considerable number of provisions under various sub-heads of D which have been drastically cut.  We will find, for instance, that the provision for machines and plant has been cut, that the provision for materials has been cut, that the provision for the toy industry has been cut, that provision for spinning has been cut, that the provision for homespuns has been cut, that the provision for the leaden models industry has been cut and that, in fact, the total provision which was made for rural industries has been cut from the sum of £304,365 which Fianna Fáil would have asked the Dáil to provide last year, to £209,275.  In fact, it has been cut by virtually one-third.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The importance of these rural industries lies in the fact that most of them are cottage industries and all of them are carried on mainly by hand labour in these congested areas where there is no living to be won from the soil and where, if industries of this sort are not provided, the unfortunate people have no remedy except to emigrate, no way of escape from <Col N="1880" /> starvation except through the emigrant ship.  The members of Clann na Poblachta and of the Labour Party are always crying out against the evils of the present social system, and yet they are going to vote to endorse the policy which is written into this Book of Estimates in Vote 54.</P>
    <P>Take some of the other services&mdash; National Health Insurance, for instance. There, under that heading in Vote 54, the amount to be provided for benefits, expenses of administration and supplementary Grants-in-Aid is reduced by £358,000 from the £740,000 which Fianna Fáil would have provided last year.  We will be told we have a new Social Insurance Act in operation. That is true, but under Fianna Fáil these supplementary benefits were being provided at the general expense of the Exchequer and the beneficiaries under the various schemes to which they apply had not to pay for them. They are getting approximately the same as they got last year at this moment, but they are paying for them to the tune of 6d. a week or 26/- a year, which is being collected from every worker, plus a corresponding contribution from his employer.</P>
    <P>Clann na Poblachta were going to develop our turf industries.  If they turn to Vote 55 they will see that not only is the provision for mineral development to be cut down severely, but under O (1) they will see that the provision of £60,000, which we wanted to make for experiments and research in truf utilisation has been cut to £20,000. That means that £40,000 less will be provided for experiments and research in turf utilisation and turf working.</P>
    <P>Then, again, we have declared a bold and striking policy in relation to external affairs.  We have decided that, come what may, we are going to join no pact and we are going to maintain a position of splendid isolation.  That is the declaration which we have made to the world in the present state of international strain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does not your leader agree with that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>If my leader agreed to it there is one thing he would do.  He would ask the people to provide themselves with the means to maintain that <Col N="1881" /> policy.  He would not become a braggart before the world and a miserable pauper when it comes to providing himself with the arms, the equipment and the ment to maintain whatever position he would take up.  If he took up a position in international affairs there is no sacrifice that he would not ask this country to make in order to maintain that position.  He would at least make certain that if ever he was called upon to maintain that position and defend it in arms, Ireland's honour would be safe.  What are we doing now?  We are making brave statements, but we have reduced the provision which we make for the defence of this country by no less than £800,000 under this Vote.  We have denuded the Army of men, stripped it of men, reduced it to such a position that when we had a St. Patrick's Day celebration a week or two ago we had cooks and supernumeraries of one sort or another parading as if they were expendable troops.  And we are in this position because of cuts in the provision for defence which the Minister is making with the support of the Labour Party and Clann na Poblachta.  I do not bother about Clann na Talmhan, because they were never national in any event.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Turn now to the miscellaneous social welfare schemes and we find the same story told.  Last year we were providing grants for the supply of fuel to necessitous families to the extent of £90,000.  This year the appropriation has been cut to £84,000. It is a minor reduction, amounting to £6,000, but do not forget that in the City of Dublin the figures for unemployment have increased considerably compared with last year, and throughout the country the number of persons on the unemployment register has gone up by thousands and would go up still further if it were not for the fact that once again the emigrant ship has come into operation, and while the list of emigrant passengers is swelling, the number of persons on the unemployment register has been correspondingly reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1882" /> Then, again, one of the things which the Minister for External Affairs told us he would do in 1947 was to provide subsidies so as to reduce the cost of living.  He said that subsidies should be provided sufficient to bring about a reduction of at least 30 per cent.  On the existing cost of all food produced and consumed here and should be accompanied by rigid control of prices. Now, we are being told by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the other members of the Coalition Government that it is quite impossible for them to give effect to the admonishments they addressed to us to keep prices down despite all that was happening in the world outside.  We know, therefore, that so far as this Coalition Government is concerned there is going to be no drastic reduction in prices.  Nor, as this Book of Estimates shows, is there going to be any attempt made to give effect to the pledge which the Leader of the Clann na Poblachta Party gave to his followers in 1947 that if he were in power&mdash;and he is in power now&mdash;there would be an increase in the subsidies sufficient to bring about a reduction of at least 30 per cent. on the existing cost of all food.  How is that being given effect to?  So far from subsidies being provided to secure a reduction of 30 per cent. in the cost of living, if the Deputies will turn once more to Vote 55 and look at sub-head J they will see there that, whereas we provided £12,676,000 for food subsidies in the year 1948-49, that provision has now been cut by £3,617,000 in the present year and only £9,150,000 is being provided.</P>
    <P>What justification is there for cutting the provision which was made for food subsidies?  Having regard to the policy upon which the Parties on the Government benches appealed to the electorate&mdash;and Clann na Poblachta was not the only Party that wanted to subsidise food; the Labour Party wanted to do it, too, and some members of even the Fine Gael Party also advocated it &mdash;what justification is there for the reduction now?  It may be that there is a general fall in the price of certain imported foodstuffs.  But, if there is, do you not think that, having regard to the stress which was laid on the increased cost of living during the general <Col N="1883" /> election last year, that you ought to use that £3,160,000 to reduce the cost of essential foodstuffs still further? Then at least you would be doing something to fulfil your pledges to the electorate. But you are certainly not fulfilling them when, so far from maintaining the subsidies at the figure at which they stood last year, you are taking steps to drastically reduce them.  Do not forget, you members of the Clann na Poblachta Party and the Labour Party, that your statements on this matter are on record and when you vote to-night&mdash;as I have no doubt you will vote&mdash;you are voting in order to nullify your own pledges, to forswear your own words and swallow them and to give effect to the policy of the reactionary wing of Fine Gael.</P>
    <P>I think it would be no harm now if I were to summarise what I have been saying by giving you a few figures.  In regard to agriculture and in relation to the provision which was made for the assistance of farmers, these Estimates represent a net reduction of £367,000 odd; for social insurance and assistance there is in this Book of Estimates a reduction of £666,000 on the figure provided last year; on ameliorative services&mdash;and these include food subsidies and Gaeltacht services&mdash; there is a reduction of £4,712,000; on national development, including hand-won turf schemes but excluding airports and civil aviation, there is a reduction of £1,649,000; on national defence there is a reduction of £859,000; on police and general protective services there is a reduction of £53,000, making all-told on these services a reduction of £8,309,000, in addition to which we must add the fact that £575,000, which was provided last year for the relief of European distress, is not included.</P>
    <P>On civil aviation and development there is a reduction in the provision made for them of £611,000.  I do not want to impinge upon the debate which will properly take place on the Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Meteorological and Aviation Services, but I do want to say that I am perfectly certain that there is still room to improve the accommodation and facilities provided <Col N="1884" /> for the safe handling of passengers and planes at both Shannon and Collinstown Airports to the extent of £300,000 That £300,000 could be advantageously spent there.  We have been hearing a good deal about the £40,000,000 scheme to provide alternative employment, but there is one form of employment which could be readily given and could be availed of by the people in Limerick and Dublin who have been thrown out of work by Coalition policy and which, if it were given, would considerably increase the economic potentialities of this country.  But the provision for that is being cut because Clann na Poblachta, which promised to develop all our resources, and the Labour Party, which had a somewhat similar programme, are now backing the Coalition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>All-told, the reductions in the Services which I have retailed to the House account for £9,495,000; let us say £9,500,000.  That is a reduction of £9,500,000 manifested in this volume of Estimates.  But here is the interesting point.  While the items which I have enumerated amount to £9,500,000, the reduction in the figures printed on the back of the volume of Estimates is not £9,500,000 but only £5,114,000.  Now, where has this other £4,500,000 gone?  We are told, of course, that there is going to be an increased provision for old age pensions.  That is true.  But if there is going to be increased provision for old age pensions let us not forget the fact that under the various contributory insurance schemes £1,000,000 will be collected in additional contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly, £192,000 more is being provided in respect of the supplementary grant for the relief of rates on <Col N="1885" /> agricultural land, but, if it is being provided, it is being provided by the Minister willy-nilly because it was the Fianna Fáil Government that passed the Act under which it is being provided&mdash;at least, they passed the original Act.  Again, widows' and orphans' pensions purport to show an increase in the volume of Estimates, but that is one of the most dishonest tricks that has ever been attempted to be perpetrated on the House.  If last year's Estimates volume is compared with this year's volume, we find that in Vote 27, under the Fianna Fáil Estimates, there was to be provided last year, under sub-head A, by way of payment to Pensions Investment Account a sum of £450,000.  That is the sum which the then Minister provided because it was necessary, under the statute, to replenish the Pensions Investment Account to that extent to meet the obligation for widows' and orphans' pensions during the current year.  There was as well a payment of £510,000 to the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Fund, making in all a total of £960,000.  That was the provision which Fianna Fáil was making last year.  This year, in the Book of Estimates, the total amount which is to be provided under Vote 27 is £1,058,000, or, roughly, £98,000 more than was provided last year.  Yet the Estimate itself is presented in such a way as to lead the ignorant to believe that the increased amount to be provided is no less than £547,990.  Of course, one is not surprised that Fine Gael should fake the books.  I had some experience when I succeeded them as Minister for Finance.  I know how they faked the books during the previous Administration.  I am not surprised that they should be doing the same thing again.</P>
    <P>Then the health grants to local authorities have gone up.  Once again it has been done, because in the year 1947 the Fianna Fáil Government asked the Oireachtas to pass the Health Services (Financial Provisions Act), 1947.</P>

It is going in <Col N="1887" /> wasteful and extravagant administration and it is going in buying support wherever support is purchasable.</P>
      <P>Let me, however, remind the House that this Book of Estimates, totalling £65,460,000, does not tell the whole story.

      <P>Where is the increased provision for the increases in teachers salaries that Clann na Poblachta promised them they were going to get in 1948?  Where is the provision for the comprehensive social security scheme about which the Tánaiste is so voluble and about which the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance are so deprecatory?  Where is one penny provided for the £40,000,000 reclamation scheme with which the Labour Deputies and the Deputies of both Clanns are lulling their uneasy infuriated followers into quietude.  There is nothing in this Book of Estimates for any one of these schemes&mdash;for the scheme of social insurance which is to cost £27,000,000, or for the Minister of Agriculture's grandiose schemes of £40,000,000 one week and £50,000,000 the next.  There is nothing in this Book of Estimates for the Garda or for the teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These things are all going to be provided we are told, and the question I am putting to the House and the country now is: when these items mature, what will be the size of the bill and how will the Government meet it?  One thing is quite certain&mdash;it cannot borrow.  Its recent experience with the Exchequer Bond Issue has put that matter beyond doubt.  We ought, therefore to ask ourselves whether we are not heading for a deliberate devaluation of the currency.  After all, Clann na Poblachta had two main political objectives at the last election.  One was the repeal of the External Relations Act.  That has gone.  The other was to break the link with sterling. Even more recently the Minister for External Affairs has been harping back <Col N="1888" /> to that again.  The Minister for External Affairs admittedly is not very sound about the &ldquo;link&rdquo;, but we can say the same thing for the present Minister for Finance.  I do think we can, in view of what he said, as reported in column 2392, Volume 94, of the Seanad Debates: The Banking Commission, he said, considered the question of breaking the link with sterling, and he went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;They stated that in the then circumstances it was considered desirable to maintain the particular situation.  The circumstances have changed very much since. There have been very different courses pursued by the two economies, the economy in England and the economy here.  If the commission could only report that in the circumstances as they were about 1936 it was right to maintain a partiticular situation, then certainly we are thrown back on an inquiry.  Now that the circumstances have changed, would the Banking Commission likely report&rdquo;&mdash;suggesting a great deal of doubt in the mind of the Minister&mdash;&ldquo;for the maintenance of the old conditions?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then, later in the course of his speech he said this, which I think is very significant:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I do not see why the matter should not be talked about, why it should not be inquired into.  I do not see why there should be any shake given to public confidence because the Minister for External Affairs or even a person like myself thinks there is something to be talked of and to be inquired into in regard to that matter.  I would go a great deal further if I was not afraid of shaking public confidence.  This matter has to be approached gradually, and I hope it will be approached gradually.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Let me in conclusion remind the House of what this Government has done during the past year. This State is declared by the Constitution to be a &ldquo;sovereign, independent, democratic State&rdquo;.  It is fast becoming a plutocratic State, a State in which the wealthy enjoy all the privileges that money can buy.  It is a State in which we have now one class of bread for the very rich and another for the middle classes and the worker and the poor.</P>

      <P>It is a State in which there are unlimited quantities of butter for the rich, of sugar for the rich, of tea for the rich, and meagre rations of all these foodstuffs for the rest of us.  It is a State in which one can buy fuel dirt cheap if you are rich enough to buy it in five or ten ton lots and in which you can scarcely procure it at famine prices if you happen to be a worker.  It is a State whose Government by deliberate action reduces the price of the rich man's champagne, while it increases the social services tax collected from the worker and the employer.  It is a State in which the Government provide cream for the rich.  It is a State with a Government which, in order to cheapen labour, has deliberately created unemployment. That is the sort of State we are living in to-day under the Coalition Government. <Col N="1890" /> That is the record of the Coalition Government and that is the record upon which the people of this country will find them guilty and condemn them the moment they get the chance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>He talks about the pound sterling.  It happened that I brought in here a series of old quotations. There is an article in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> called &ldquo;Looking at the Old Family Albums,&rdquo; dated 23rd February, 1947, and my eye caught the headline, &ldquo;MacEntee, Explorer.&rdquo;  Here is part of the quotation the <i>Sunday Independent</i> gives from a speech of Deputy MacEntee:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1891" />&ldquo;I think it was the President (Mr. Cosgrave) said that we were anchored to the pound sterling, and now the pound is a millstone round the necks of the people and is dragging them down to the bottom of the sea.  The financial and economic position of the country would be much better if we had an independent currency instead of being tied to the sinking pound.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it was because the Deputy was younger, or that he had more sense in 1932.  It may be that he is now resuming the sort of prudence that people sometimes get in their old age, but of which the Deputy has given no great sign so far.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that Deputies belonging to a Party that boasts of being always of the same mind and thought on everything could not have made up their minds what angle to attack the Vote from before they came into the House.  The first effort of the <i>Irish Press</i> in this matter was that the Estimates had been slashed.  The second view was that the economies which were supposed to be in the Estimates were all a fake.  Deputy MacEntee went through the same course to-night.  First of all, he alleged great slashing, and then went on to make a case that the slashing had in some way or another achieved £4,000,000 which he could not find.  He apparently does not see that it is possible to increase expenditure on certain desirable objects and cut out expenditure on things that are fantastically extravagant.  It was the extravagant fantasies which we sent out to kill. We did some last year; we are dealing with a few more this year.  It is not easy to hunt all these things down in a short period, but we have stopped their gallop on certain things; at least the country was well advised to stop their gallop by putting in people who had, on the one hand a mind towards retrenchment where retrenchment was required and, on the other hand, a mind towards spending where spending was going to develop.</P>
    <P>It has been a hard and difficult task to cut in on some of the Fianna Fáil things.  They had not yet made up <Col N="1892" /> their minds what their expenditure would be if they had been allowed by the people to continue for another year. The sum is simple enough.  On the face of the Estimates, there was an amount of £70,500,000.  The Central Fund services were another £7,000,000.  They would have been budgeting for £77,500,000 without anything extra for old age pensioners or for civil servants or for employees of the local authorities on the health side and yet they complain that I am getting from the people some £70,000,000 this way.  They would have looked for an additional £7,500,000.  If they had given the old age pensions, the extra tea and the emoluments to the civil servants which they were pledged to give they would have looked for an extra £9,500,000 or £10,000,000.  I do not look for that sum, and yet I think that the sum I am looking for is very heavy indeed.</P>
    <P>Referring to the opening remarks made by Deputy Aiken as to whether I had or had not been able to economise this year, I have.  I should like to submit an account much more cut down than the present one.  So far as it has not gone lower I confess to a partial failure.  We have dropped some things. Amongst them is the matter that has been so fiercely debated by Deputy Lemass to-night.  I do not think that it is conceivable that ever again there will be a purchase of wheat made so improvidently as the 75,000 tons of Argentine wheat which Deputy Lemass purchased two days before he left office in February, 1948.  That purchase alone put a blister on this community, as I said when speaking on the Budget last year, of £2,435,000.  In fact, it cost us a bit more in my calculation of that purchase&mdash;about £2,585,000.  That was the dearest, the most improvident, reckless and inefficient piece of buying that was ever done by anyone given Governmental responsibility in this country.  It was done in spite of all the advice that he had.  Up to that purchase no other had been made except through the medium of a regular body known as Grain Importers.  Grain Importers, through the late Mr. Hallinan, told him that this purchase should not be made. The letter came on the Monday morning of the week in which he made the <Col N="1893" /> purchase.  He made the purchase on the Tuesday.  Grain Importers, and in particular Mr. Hallinan, were the only people that the then Minister had to advise him on this matter.  They advised dead against.  They told him that Mr. Rank, who was the buyer for the British, had advised against.  They told him that the communication of the British Imported Cereals Board had advised against it.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;The winter wheat crop in the United States of America is in excellent shape, and there has been very little, if any, winter kill and, therefore, it seems that we would be quite safe to rely upon getting most of our supplies from the United States of America for July, August and September at prices that compare very favourably with the Argentine.&rdquo;</P>

Before we are through with that decayed stuff in the Park this country will have lost £3,500,000.  It is a bit in line with the Argentine purchase which cost us about £2,600,000 by way of subsidy. £3,500,000 is going down the drain because of that fuel piled up in the Park.</P>

      <P>Oats were fixed at such a price and, in relation to those oats, oatmeal was fixed at such a price that nobody could make oatmeal and sell it.  The Department of Industry and Commerce, therefore, having driven oatmeal as a manufacturing product, proceeded to buy and import 9,000 tons of oatmeal from the United States of America and Australia and a certain smaller tonnage of wheat offals. The oatmeal, if fresh at any time, was distasteful to Irish palates.  It was not all fresh.  The wheat offals were found to be full of weevils, I suppose in an effort to help Deputy Smith with the live stock of the country.  We had to sell them eventually to the manufacturers of compound food for animals at a loss of about £125,000&mdash;a small matter, of course, to people who have £3,500,000 in the Park of decaying fuel and almost £2,600,000 extra subsidy because of the bad purchase of Argentine wheat.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>We got over a Tourist Board which had gone into the hotel business and <Col N="1896" /> we are trying to get rid of the hotels now.  One famous purchase was made which Deputy Lemass not merely recommended but forced on his colleague, Deputy Aiken, the purchase of a particular hotel.  The Minister was so satisfied that his purchase was of a profit-earning character that he convinced his colleague, Deputy Aiken, that that was so.  £11,000 was paid for the hotel. Later an investigation was made cautiously enough&mdash;though that might have occurred to themselves&mdash;as to when the premises was last used as a hotel, who owned it at the moment of purchase, when those owners acquired the premises and what they had paid for it and it was discovered that the most recent purchase made before the Government stepped in was for the sum of £500.  The Government was asked £11,000 and paid £11,000, while the purchase price was £500.  That was not the full amount, however, because there was a debt of something less than £3,500 when it was taken.  The hotel passed hands previously at something under £400.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1942, and it had lain there until 1947 when the Tourist Board, backed by two Ministers, decided to buy it for £12,000.  In the meantime an investigation was made into the hotel, and the Tourist Board, putting a proposition into the mouths of two Ministers, said that as much money had to be spent on the hotel was was asked for it, £12,000.  The fact of the matter is that the hotel was stripped, its fittings were all taken out and the plumbing gone, there was nothing there but a shell of a building. £12,000 was put up and eventually £32,000 was asked, not for furnishing, but for the reconstruction of this place. Right through this, the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Lemass, puts up to Deputy Aiken that it was going to be a profitable concern. It never had been very much of a profitable concern in its history and it certainly had not been from about 1938. About this time the board were having their activities in another direction inquired into and they got a fair <Col N="1897" /> amount of money for what they called the development of seaside resorts and they did develop a few pitching and putting greens in seaside resorts. £300,000 of the people's money went for that purpose and when they were queried about these matters in May, 1947, they decided to call an end to their optimism.  They wrote to the Department of Industry and Commerce a letter in which they suggested that it might be possible to regard all their capital expenditure as coming temporarily within the category of &ldquo;advances otherwise authorised&rdquo;.  That phrase hides the fact that they did not want their expenditure to be regarded as being of a profit-earning character. Note the times.  In mid-May they asked the Department of Industry and Commerce to forget all they had said about the profit-earning character of the various works they were developing in seaside resorts, but in the same month they were writing through Deputy Lemass to Deputy Aiken telling him that the hotel was of a profit-earning character, so although they had withdrawn their optimism with regard to developing localities, as far as hotels were concerned they were cock-a-hoop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We propose getting rid of that hotel and of as many others as we can and end that particular development which never should have been entered upon by any Government through any board of that type.  We will certainly lose money but we were losing money.  I have said this before and there is no need for me to repeat it at any great length.  At that time for two years every boarding-house in the country was able to make money.  The tourists were coming in such swarms and with such an amount of money that it was scarcely possible to find a poor type of inefficiently-run boarding-house that did not make money.  Yet the Tourist Board, presented with five or six properties, failed to make money.  They showed a profit on two things, the sale of cigarettes and the takings of the various bars, but there was a loss of that profit when it came to room accommodation and all over that period in which it was almost impossible to be in the hotel or boarding-house business <Col N="1898" /> without touching gold they succeeded in showing a loss.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Another lame duck which was handed over to us was the famous Córas Iompair Éireann which is referred to so often.  An attempt was made here to represent to the House that Córas Iompair Éireann did not really make the demands my colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce has spoken of.  I was at these meetings when the directors appeared before us.  They did demand three things.  They wanted leave to close all the branch lines in the country and they estimated the resultant unemployment to be 1,000 people but that was only an estimate.  They wanted leave to cut back on maintenance to such an extent as to discharge 2,000 men.  They wanted leave to raise fares all over both the rail and bus system and they wanted further to be allowed to raise freights over all the system but only if the Government would decide narrowly to restrict private hauliers.  They really had four demands: the closing of the branch lines; putting back maintenance; a rise in fares and a rise in freights accompanied by a narrow restriction of private haulage.  Deputy Lemass said that they were not being put up in the same scheme but were being put up as alternatives.  The answer to him is this: The company forecast a loss of £1,500,000 and they claimed that roughly each of these proposals would save £1,500,000.  How can we believe that they only wanted one proposal bringing in £500,000 when they were faced with a loss of £1,500,000? They wanted them all.  They wanted to be allowed to dismiss 3,500 men.  They wanted to be allowed to close the branch lines, to raise fares and, if we could restrict private haulage for them, they wanted to raise freights as well. At the same time they were going on with these amazing schemes which they described as capital development. That amazing contraption near Store <Col N="1899" /> Street was to cost £500,000 but was more recently priced at £750,000.  They were going to remake one of the stations here at a cost of £1,000,000. Sir James Milne reported that if the company were in a good healthy position and making money they might do the job for £100,000.  They wanted to spend £900,000 more.</P>
    <P>Comment has been made to the effect that wages have been raised all over the railway and on the costs side. Deputy Lemass skated around that point, trying to save himself by saying that the wages must be proper when they were given by the Labour Court and by the Labour Wages Board.  Why should the men not ask for an increased wage?  They knew of these fantastic schemes that were going on.  It was the talk of Kingsbridge and of the shops.  They knew the money that was being spent fantastically and fruitlessly around the whole place.  They themselves had sarcastic comments to pass about the new bus station or stations and about the remaking of the railway station that was to cost so much, and quite an amount of other capital developments.  They knew that the staff was incomplete as far as the top level was concerned&mdash;a matter which Sir James Milne reported on. They were quite well aware of the fantastic emoluments that were given at the top level.  It was more than human nature could expect that they would withstand making an appeal for increased wages when they saw the extravagance around them.  Deputy Lemass thought fit to sneer that people put on an industrial development authority were to get a fee of £2,000. He had given the chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann £2,500 and he knew that the board of Córas Iompair Éireann had given him another £4,000. The Deputy knew that the Chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann had worked himself £33,000 compensation&mdash;£17,000 of it he took in cash and £10,000 of it we have had to pay him to get rid of him, nearly £26,000 either pension or arrears of pension.</P>

We now see what it has come to, but add that to the Argentine wheat, to the fuel dumps in the Park, to the weevilled oatmeal, to the Tourist Board, and you get some impression of what one man was responsible for&mdash; although he got his share of that under the guise of collective responsibility with all the other imaginative people he had around him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I admitted recently that I thought the public would be thoroughly frightened and shocked when they heard the full story&mdash;and they have not heard it yet.  But they have heard this amazing part of it, namely, that the chief men in that organisation could not face anybody to whom they owed money since November of 1948.  Imagine the main transport concern of this country, with a virtual monopoly, having a safe which contained £500,000 worth of cheques written but not issued because there <Col N="1901" /> was no money with which to meet the cheques if they were issued.  That is represented as part of the efficiency of the Government that we have replaced.</P>
      <P>There is one thing, however, that I certainly only heard of at a very late stage in the last Government's career. That was a gigantic scheme for the better housing, if you please, of this Parliament and of the civil servants attached to the Government.  The mania started early but it did not fade with the years.  In 1933 the last Government set up a committee consisting of the then Minister for Local Government and Public Health, now the President, the then Minister for Finance, Deputy MacEntee; the then Minister for Defence, Deputy Aiken, and the late Mr. Flinn, to consider a plan for the housing of this Parliament&mdash;as if we were not comfortable enough&mdash;and of the civil servants attached to the Government. A report was produced by that body in January, 1934.  It was decided to have a comprehensive plan for these new Government Buildings. The suggestion was made that an area in the City of Dublin should be scheduled and that legislative action should be taken to prevent undue inflation of site values inside the scheduled area.  Those who know Dublin might be attentive to this.  The scheduled area, as recommended, was the whole portion of the district bounded by Merrion Street, Lower Baggot Street, the Canal and Fenian Street.  In other words, you turn right from Government Buildings and go up towards the turn left towards Baggot Street, go along Baggot Street to the Canal, turn left along the Canal passing Mount Street Bridge until you turn left where Sir Patrick Dun's Hospital is and go along Fenian Street until the corner of Westland Row and left again to Government Buildings.  That area was to be scheduled&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That did not end the suggestion.  It went through four separate memoranda and eventually they reached an A, B, C, D scheme. When you had the whole picture it meant the whole of the scheme I have talked of.  They priced the A scheme&mdash; which was less than a quarter of the whole £3,000,000 as long as you left out furnishing, equipping of the buildings and certain costs that would arise in connection with the clearance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Eventually the whole matter was referred to a further committee which was told to consider the whole proposal as covered by A, B, C and D. They considered it, and it ran into the year 1945, in which year the then Minister for Finance approached Deputy Mulcahy, as Leader of Fine Gael, to ask him whether we, as the Opposition Party, would approve of the scheme. We threw it back at them, whereupon the Government thought better of it or &mdash;perhaps that is the wrong phrase&mdash; they thought a second time about it. In the second plan, they left Merrion Square, Merrion Street and all that area and betook themselves to the Park.  The new proposal, so far as I can gather, was that a road was to be driven up behind where the present road is along Conyngham Road and a big acreage of the Park was to be taken over and that was to be made an island on which to plant the new Parliament House and the Government buildings and offices.  It was a good, ambitious plan and it had its accompaniments. They were that people would naturally object to certain of the amenities of the people's park being taken from them, so they would have to be provided for elsewhere&mdash;and the &ldquo;elsewhere&rdquo; was a costly thought. Let Deputies think of themselves standing at Kingsbridge, with their backs to the mouth of the Liffey, and think of the buildings right and left of them as they look down towards Chapelizod.  Those properties to the <Col N="1903" /> right and left from Kingsbridge to Chapelizod were to be cleared.  It meant the disappearance of Cahill's, the Lucan Dairies and a host of places along that bank, but the people would have had a pleasant riverside walk.  I think Deputy Aiken made his contribution to the plan by saying that, if that did not protect the people's amenities far enough, they should have, not a compulsory scheme but a compulsory control scheme of the amenities of the Liffey valley to Lucan and finally to Leixlip.</P>

      <P>We have not.  There is one small bit of it, and that is a bit which I was late to stop, unfortunately. There was a proposal to have a new National Library which would have meant the disappearance, so far as I remember, of the Fitzwilliam Tennis Club and a builder's yard beside it and all that stretch of territory that goes out to the canal bank.  That was all to have been expropriated for a new storehouse for books attached to the National Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say how many unopened boxes of books are in the National Library for want of space?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know, but I certainly would not think of taking <Col N="1904" /> over the grounds of the Fitzwilliam Tennis Club and a builder's yard for the purpose.  Talking of books reminds me that I have been told that I am showing my hand in cutting down certain subventions to the Irish language. Various calculations have been made about how much has been cut, but nobody has mentioned that there is an increase in one Vote with regard to folklore which, I understand, is regarded by those interested as quite a valuable addition to the study of Irish. There is a certain cutting, not very much, with regard to grants made to papers published in Irish.  There are three papers in the main and the calculation has been made that the subsidy to one of them is 1/- per copy.  It is sold at 2d. but the State is paying 1/-per copy.  On the second, the subsidy is 1/9 per copy and, on the third, ? per copy.  If you take it from the angle of readers&mdash;we have to make an estimate of readers&mdash;apparently it is not possible&mdash;I am not to blame for this&mdash; to find as many as 3,500 readers of these three Irish publications who will pay the 2d., or who will pay another 1d. or so to keep them going.</P>
      <P>In addition to that, there is a series of publications got out by An Gúm. Deputy Lynch is interested in books. He might get some to take away with him even this evening.  An effort was made to place some of these Irish publications published through An Gúm. There are at the moment in the cellars or storage presses of the Stationery Office nearly 250,000 volumes and efforts have been made from time to time to get rid of them.  The first effort took the form of offering parcels of them to the Fior-Ghaeltacht.  These were free sets of books valued at about £2 6/- or something short of it.  They were put up in parcels and sent to the Fior-Ghaeltacht to be presented free to the schools in the Gaeltacht area.  The plan was tried, and, after many months' trial the Department of Education reported that the arrangement had proved a complete flop.  None of the schools wanted the books.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I need not go through the lengthy tale of misery connected with them, but at least five efforts were made to get rid of these books, and, in the end, <Col N="1905" /> when it came to a matter of value, the criterion the Stationery Office or the Department of Education applied to these books in connection with any tender they might receive was whether the tender exceeded the value of the books as waste paper or not.  If it did, they would accept anything over and above the value as waste paper, and, if they could not get as much as that, the waste-paper merchant was always there.  But some sort of sentiment still hung around them and there are still 239,000 of these volumes cluttering up whatever storage accommodation there is in the Stationery Office.  Deputy Lynch is annoyed about the books in the National Library, or around those premises, unopened.  If he will take these books and distribute them through the Gaeltacht, we will give him storage space for some of the other books about which he is anxious.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that they are in boxes which can be given to the people.  We have also five industrial alcohol factories on our hands. There is a novel called <i>Eight Republics in Search of a Future.</i> These are five factories in search of an industry.  If I can get a good industry for them, they will be used for it. There is good machinery in the factories and they are good buildings, but what are they doing?  They are producing a particular essence, and, if we spill that essence into the ground and do not make the petrol distributors take it, we could reduce the price of petrol immediately by between 1½d. and 2d. per gallon by just wasting the stuff. If we could get the place destroyed, on the money we would not have to spend on them, we could give his present wages to every employee in the place for the rest of his life.  Yet these factories are being kept working and the Government that started them was not content to start one as an experiment but had to launch into five at more or less the same time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was looking back over the debates to revive my memory of this project when it was first mooted.  In 1934, Deputy MacEntee and Deputy Lemass were both in charge and they banked <Col N="1906" /> their credit in those days on this, that they could produce industrial alcohol at about 1/9 to 1/10 per gallon, and they certainly said that they did not anticipate it could go beyond 2/-.  It never, of course, came near 2/-.  And at the moment it is costing 6/- to produce, and at 6/-, it is completely and wholly uneconomic.  The five factories cost, I think, about £300,000&mdash;between factories and machinery, £312,000&mdash;and they are going there, producing a particular type of spirit which is no good to anybody and without which we could make life cheaper for motorists.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moylan criticised me for stating that he had started the system of spoils.  I read here on the 25th May last a letter which my colleague, Deputy Murphy, read out in the Dáil many years before in which Deputy Moylan put himself on record.  Various people had to go before a particular board for appointments, the appointee having in the first instance to be certified as competent and suitable for the position by the interview board. He said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I believe Miss Gilligan will fulfill that condition.  From the list certified as competent, I shall appoint the person best suited to the position from a political point of view.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I put that as a clear-cut example of the spoils system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is the spoils system.  The <i>Irish Press</i> had an article recently commenting on that and saying they did not like this and did not approve the spoils system.  It should not be worked by Ministers and they said, more or less, in Fianna Fáil's time there would be no such thing.  I was reminded that Deputy Moylan not merely told Miss Gilligan he would appoint the person best suited to the position from a political viewpoint but, on one occasion, when a certain number of people were up before him for putting into certain order, he had the bad luck to appoint to an office a person who had not applied for the job and that had to be pointed out to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If anybody cares to see the documentation, <Col N="1907" /> I will provide it for them.  That was, of course, going a bit too far because the word had not passed out as to what was on.  In particular, the <i>Irish Press</i> political commentary, by &ldquo;Dáil Reporter&rdquo;, is very strong that those who support the present Government and who are lawyers should not, no matter what their professional qualifications, apparently, be given briefs on State cases.  That is made a point of principle.  That should not be done.  There is an interesting file which shows that the first Attorney-General under Fianna Fáil put up a proposal that a colleague of his, who was also a T.D., later to become a judge, should be appointed to the office that in England they know as Solicitor-General. We do not know any such office here but we can always manufacture a salary for it and the salary was apportioned at the rate of £500, in addition to which that member of the Bar, who was a Deputy supporting Fianna Fáil, was to be allowed to take fees in private cases.  Of course, he was entitled to that.  But he was also to be entitled to take fees in State cases and, being as near to the Attorney-General as he was in those days, it was only to be expected that some fees would go his way.  In the first year he succeeded in having the sum of £1,574 paid to him out of State cases. One adds to that the £500 and then adds on the Deputy's salary.  He was also doing private practice.  In part of the second year he drew £1,262 in State fees.  That is hardly the idealism that is in this article.</P>
    <P>I remember the time when there was a discussion in this House over the dismissal of the late General O'Duffy and Deputy de Valera was asked whether his successor had any virtue that General O'Duffy had not and he said, yes, he had one and that was that he was not chief of police for ten years under the previous Administration.  If that was not the application of a spoils system or, rather, the application of a revengeful system, I do not know what it was.  Later, when it came to the disappearance of the Secretary of the Department of Local Government there were lectures given by many people who are now in the Opposition <Col N="1908" /> Benches about political affiliations and how a Minister must have political reliance and political confidence in the man whom he had beside him as secretary. Would the Opposition like that particular plan put into operation now? I do not think they would.  I do not think we intend to have anything to do with that sort of plan, but that was what was preached as correct policy in those days.</P>

I have not yet found that there was an order in the book by the Attorney-General, but the change is such that the order might as well be there: Do not appoint anybody to hold a prosecuting brief if he held one under the previous Administration.  I invite Deputies to ask me who were the people who were getting briefs in 1946 and 1947, and who are getting briefs now, and see whether the change has been so drastic and so complete as it was in 1931-32 as opposed to 1933.  We know what the spoils system was, worked against us.  It is a bad system and should not be applied.</P>

      <P>The most serious matters that have been raised in this debate have been the general questions of emigration and unemployment.  In that connection I see an editorial in the <i>Irish Press</i> of the 28th of this month calling attention to a phrase used by Deputy Keane in the House in this debate.  He had talked about people who emigrated, not through force of circumstances but because they were by tradition wild geese and were trying to better themselves.  The editorial pours scorn on that idea and says that it is a waste of time having an Emigration Commission because there is the tradition of emigration.  We have the habit of emigrating and the <i>Irish Press</i> say, scornfully:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The tradition has been established and everybody knows how tenacious tradition can be.  People will leave their homes, their friends and relations even if they have no need to.  They are wild geese and they must spread their grey wings on every tide.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the attitude they had here before they became a Government.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lemass told us in 1928 that he believed:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Ireland can be made a self-contained unit, providing all the necessities of living in adequate quantities for the people residing in the Island at the moment and probably for a much larger number.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He told us in 1930 that &ldquo;the outstanding fact concerning unemployment in this country is that it need not exist at all&rdquo;.  Later, in the same debate when I challenged him, and when he seemed to be getting into a mood of gradualness with regard to it, he retorted:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;You could find an immediate solution for unemployment tomorrow.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy de Valera told the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The more I consider the position the more convinced I become that the problem of unemployment in Ireland is quite capable of solution, and the more certain I feel that it is a crime against the unemployed and against the nation to leave it unsolved.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Of course, he did learn a bit after that, because he told us in a more recent debate that</P>
      <P>&ldquo;this emigration was not a thing that could be stopped easily and that the Fianna Fáil Party had done its best&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;they were in about 12 years at that time&mdash;and &ldquo;he had to confess that they had failed.&rdquo;  He pleaded in this House that if Deputies had any remedy that <Col N="1911" /> they could suggest to him in connection with the development of agriculture he thought that was the keynote of the whole thing.  He said he would readily accept their advice, and if it seemed good to him he would work it. At the end of their days in December, 1947, the late Government, faced with the thought that the gates of America would soon be opening and that the system of permits with regard to passage to England could not be maintained, decided that they might consider the appointment of a commission with wide terms of reference to examine population influences and a number of other factors of which emigration was one.</P>
    <P>We are jeered at because we established a commission on emigration.  In December, 1947, the former Government could think of establishing a commission to deal with emigration, amongst other things.  Might I point out to Deputies what this Government has done in connection with emigration?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It has given the people a better incentive to work in this country than ever before.  Wages have been increased.  In the State services there have been increases and we have reduced taxation that was pressing hard on people in connection with tobacco and beer to the extent of over £5,000,000.  These, surely, are incentives to keep people in occupation here by increasing whatever pleasure they get in their lives through having a bit more money to spend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was said that we stopped the turf schemes, aviation development and a variety of things are alleged against us.  I sometimes, I suppose, see things possibly from a different angle from other people because of technical matters pressing in upon my Department. I am very often gravely concerned with the amount of money that is being spent and rushed through the country, sometimes through Government agencies.  If I take what is called <Col N="1912" /> below the line expenditure, and look at what was spent in 1947-48, I find that on such matters as Telephone Capital Acts, Electricity Supply Acts, Local Loans Fund Acts, Turf Development and other matters there was a sum of £5,500,000 spent that way, £1,000,000 of which was on air navigation and transport.  As the greater part of that was for the purchase of machines it did not count much from the employment that was given, but at any rate £4,500,000 was spent on what should have been productive employment in 1947-49.  In the financial year 1948-49 these items accounted for £9,000,000 and in the year that we are facing they are likely to amount to £13,750,000.  That must be reflected in occupation.  Certainly, if there is unemployment or emigration in the country it cannot be put down to any skimping of money because the sum of money which the previous Government spent has been almost doubled in the financial year we are just finishing, and will be increased by £9,250,000 in next year.</P>
    <P>That cannot go on.  These sums of money may not be spent at that rate. It will not be possible to get money to spend, and in any event that type of development may have to take second place to other development.  That is the reason why this Government as a group have decided to go in for a land development programme.  We would prefer to see money spent on the land, to be put into a position where it may become more productive, rather than put money into roads where it can never become productive.  The roads may make a greater amenity, but money so spent will not lead, except indirectly to greater production.  We are going to have a plan with regard to land development.  We are bound to have such a plan.  We have accepted a loan of money from the American Government which is to aid production here.  We have promised to get more production, but production will not come of itself.  We have decided to aid the people in certain areas and hope to show them that, if they do get a certain amount of money to spend on the land, they will reap the advantage in the way of better production.  We hope, too, to reap <Col N="1913" /> advantage by an increase in the national wealth.  We want to inaugurate that plan one of these days, and about the time it is being inaugurated I want to make this suggestion to the Deputies over there.  In the past, when the Shannon was developed, everybody in Dáil Éireann accepted it.  It was approved unanimously. The Deputies opposite were not then in Dáil Éireann.  They disagreed with it.  It was thought to be too big a scheme, and that it was <Col N="1914" /> involving the national credit too much. It may well be that, in four or five years' time, people looking back on the land reclamation scheme planned with the same type of imagination and with every encouragement and preparation, will see that there was a good chance of the same good results coming from it for the country.  Beware that you do not make the mistake a second time that you made over the Shannon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we can take it now.  The proposal in Section 4 is to set up a counterpart fund which will be at the disposal of the Minister for Finance.  This is a somewhat new idea introduced into the handling of the Marshall loans, as they are called. When I was speaking in the House last December I told the Minister for Agriculture that if he had encouraged the production of wheat instead of oats he <Col N="1917" /> would have saved $5,000,000 which were spent on the purchase of American wheat because of the Minister's success in getting wheat production here reduced by about 60,000 acres.  I said that the reduction of the acreage under wheat and the increase in the production of oats created two problems for the people.  One problem was the marketing of the surplus oats held by the farmers, and the other was that we would have to repay the American loan over the next 50 years.  The Minister for Agriculture was quite indignant at my assertion.  He said that it was, in fact, a &ldquo;monstrous libel,&rdquo; and in column 1767 of Volume 113 of Dáil Debates, the Minister for Agriculture said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I am going to give a further demonstration to the House of the truth of certain statements made by Deputies opposite.  Deputy Aiken said that we had to import wheat and that we shall be paying for it for 50 years.  The Deputy knows that that is not true.  He knows that for every dollar of Marshall aid money we bespeak, a corresponding amount of sterling is put into the Central Bank and can be withdrawn at a moment's notice to discharge the debt.</P>
      <P>Mr. Aiken: It is a debt.</P>
      <P>Mr. Dillon: The money is there in the bank and it is a monstrous libel on this country to say that this debt will be a-paying for 50 years when our currency is deposited in the Central Bank to pay the debt whenever the person to whom it is due is ready to take it.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, the Minister for Finance may very well pass that off as the Minister for Agriculture passed off statements made by responsible people as &ldquo;silly-billy&rdquo; talk on the part of the Minister for Agriculture; he might even call it cracked-Jamesy talk.  But the fact is that the spokesmen for the Government last December said that the money was going into the Central Bank, that it was going to remain there in sterling and that it could be paid out overnight to anybody who asked for it. The Minister's present proposition is that it should be taken out of the Central Bank; that we should empower <Col N="1918" /> him to take it out of the Central Bank to spend it or invest it in any of the ways in which Post Office Savings Bank funds can be invested.  That seems to be a new idea.  Last December the Government were prepared to leave this fund in the Central Bank and let that body invest it in the normal way. When the Central Bank invests its assets in the currency fund it gets interest on them in the normal way.  As a matter of fact, the State benefits to a considerable extent because of the profits made by the Central Bank upon its investments.  But, instead of leaving it to the Central Bank to invest, the Minister now proposes to take powers to invest this money in whatever type of securities he selects upon the list on which he is empowered to invest Post Office savings funds.  Is it a fact that the Minister suddenly conceived this idea when he failed to get the full amount of the recent loan from the public?  Up till then we had no hint that the Minister would not allow the funds to be invested by the Central Bank.  The Minister, talking just now on the Vote on Account, was concerned because of the great amount of the bill of loan expenditure in the country on various capital debts of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>In his recent appeal for money to the public, he stated that this was an inflationary situation and he wanted to get money from the saving public.  The Minister knows himself that if he is spending money, whether borrowed or otherwise, on non-productive expenditure of various kinds in an inflationary situation, he is going to add to the inflationary pressure.  I wish the Minister would make up his mind as to whether there is an inflationary situation or not.  Certainly when he spoke in appealing for investment in the recent national loan, he talked about the danger of inflation and about the inflationary pressures that existed, but in framing his Budget last year he did not seem to be very anxious to avoid adding to the inflationary pressure if, by doing so, he could avoid political difficulties for himself.  Undoubtedly in an inflationary situation, either the borrowing or creation of money for expenditure on current consumption is adding to inflation and that is what <Col N="1919" /> the Minister did in his Budget last year.  Not only did he borrow money to pay for the bread we ate, but during the year he also borrowed money for a number of other things that should have been met out of current revenue.  Not only did he borrow money to spend on current consumption, but he actually realised the capital assets of the State.  One such realisation was the sum of £466,000 which he took out of the Post Office Savings. The law allowed him to do that, but that law, which was passed in 1930 or 1931, was never operated except once by a previous Cumann na nGaedheal Minister.  I think the last time it was operated was in 1931.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister, in concluding the debate, to give us some idea as to his outlook on a proper financial approach to the present situation.  I asked him the other day a question as to what the Government meant by saying to the European Economic Committee in Paris that this country had followed orthodox financial principles in the past in regard to the Budget and intended to stick by them in future.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister what were the orthodox principles referred to and he gave me the dictionary definition of &ldquo;orthodox&rdquo;, that they were generally accepted principles.  When I tried to get some further information by way of supplementary questions I did not succeed in extracting it.  I asked him by whom were they to be accepted as orthodox, who are the experts who will accept as correct financial procedure the spending of borrowed money or the spending of created money in an inflationary situation for current consumption. There is no one except a crackpot with the same crazy ideas as the Minister for Finance who would think that the cure for all our ills is to print money, or who would put forward the suggestion that the Minister for Finance should do what he actually did in this financial year in what he called an inflationary situation&mdash;borrow money and spend it for the bread subsidy. He borrowed money to spend on a lot of other things which I think he should have met out of current revenue in an inflationary situation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1920" /> The Minister is going to sell us this idea of taking this £24,000,000 or thereabouts&mdash;I think that is about the present accumulation in the Central Bank&mdash;and using it at his sweet will for investment.  He will have $89,000,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am not trying to convince you at all.  I have asked the <Col N="1921" /> Minister to give us some more information. I can only make my calculations from published facts.  One published fact is that the American authorities or the Export-Import Bank have put $89,000,000 at the Minister's disposal.  It may be more than that, but that was the last figure I saw.  I know the Minister told us he was going, for every dollar he got in America, to put into the Central Bank an equivalent amount of sterling.  As a matter of fact, the quotation I gave from the Minister for Agriculture showed quite clearly that that is what he understood was being done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the $89,000,000 that the Minister borrowed from the United States will appear in the Central Bank. He will take that $89,000,000 and it is going to be put into a counterpart fund over which he will have control and can invest without coming back to the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt about it.  The Minister has set out the securities in which he is asking the Dáil to authorise its investment.  If we pass this Bill, the Minister at his own <Col N="1922" /> sweet will can invest the moneys. Section 4 (5) of the Bill states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister for Finance may from time to time, as he thinks fit, invest money for the time being to the credit of the fund in any manner in which moneys of the Post Office Savings Bank are, for the time being, authorised by law to be invested and may realise any such investment.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister without coming back to the Dáil for any further authority can invest these moneys in new loans issued by the Government, or old Government stock, or in the stock of local authorities and may realise these at any time he likes.</P>
      <P>Then there is this scheme that is floating round and which is not very clear yet, the scheme that the Minister for Agriculture propounded in order to save the Government on a recent Vote when he said that he was going to spend £50,000,000 on land drainage and reclamation.  I believe, and have always been a believer in land drainage and reclamation and the improvement of the soil.  Many Fianna Fáil Ministers for Finance gave more than lip-service to that particular principle. They recognised, however, that land reclamation could in many cases be regarded more as a social service than as an actual investment, that there are certain places in the country where farms are very small, where life is hard, and that from a strict accountancy point of view you could not say that the capital sunk in drainage and reclamation would be profitable from the point of view of showing a monetary profit on the sum invested, but that from the social point of view the land so improved might add to the comfort of the small families in the congested districts and might actually bring the small uneconomic holder some way towards the economic level.  We were quite prepared to say that, even though it could not be justified 100 per cent. from the point of view of financial investment, it was a good social investment and that from the point of view of a social service it should be met out of current revenue.  We did tax and proposed to tax last year to the tune of £500,000 in order that the Farm Improvements Scheme might go ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1923" /> The Minister for Agriculture is proposing to make a start on what we would like to refer to as his £50,000,000 scheme next year.  It may do a lot of good work.  I hope that it will not be as expensive per acre as some of the experimental drainage schemes last year.  Some of them, I understand, cost over £100 per acre.  According to the reply he gave us, the average was £46 18s. 0d. per acre.  You can buy very good land in this country for £20 an acre.  If the £50,000,000 is going to be spent on draining callow and bog lands and other lands like that at a cost of £46, or even up to £120 an acre, I do not think an investment of that kind would be a very profitable Exchequer investment.  I do not know whether the Minister for Finance intends that the Minister for Agriculture should pay him interest on the loan.</P>
    <P>Take, for instance, the £22,000,000 that he has bororwed to date from the Export Bank.  He deprives the Central Bank of that money.  That is not invested by the Central Bank.  The Minister takes it and invests it in Government funds, or in a Government loan, to reclaim land that will not be worth £5 per acre at a cost of £120.  I do not think it would be a very good security for the repayment of the Marshall aid.  It is certainly going away from what the Minister for Agriculture said last December, that for every dollar we get we had an equivalent in sterling in the Central Bank which should be repaid.  It is quite a different proposition to try to get it out of the callow land which has been drained at a cost of £120, and which might not be worth £5.  There is no doubt that it would be a very good social service to improve a lot of the poor lands in the congested districts.  But, if we are going to do that in an inflationary situation such as the Minister for Finance says exists, I think it should be met out of current revenue and not out of borrowed money.</P>
    <P>I think it would be a good thing if before every Budget we had a system of discussing at some length the financial situation of the country to find out how much money should be raised by <Col N="1924" /> borrowing and how much by taxation. That is a calculation which could be made if the Minister for Finance would give us the facts of the economic and financial situation which are at his disposal normally.  If there still exists, as the Minister says there exists, an inflationary situation, it is a wrong policy from the point of view of any financial expert whom I would regard as an expert to spend borrowed money for current consumption.  When the Minister for Finance brings forward his Budget this year, if the inflationary situation still exists, I hope he is not going to budget for borrowing more money for current consumption during the next financial year.  The Minister realised a lot of capital assets during the past year that he cannot realise again.  It is not every year that he can sell Constellations, nor is it every year that he can draw £466,000 of a surplus from the Post Office Savings Bank.  If he is going to have expenditure for current consumption I trust that he will face up to his responsibilities and collect the money from the people to do it. It is a very poor investment for the people of this country if he is going to save them one year from taxation at the expense of adding to the inflationary pressures.  It may be politically easy for him to do it, but he is going to create more difficulty for the country.</P>
    <P>I do not want to reply in any detail to-night to the number of things that the Minister for Finance referred to in his Vote on Account.  He complained very bitterly that under the Fianna Fáil Government we had been examining a number of schemes for the capital improvement of this State.  He did not, as I say, tell the whole truth of what was in the files.  He will find from those files that the Government was anxious to have a series of public works to meet a depression so that if there were unemployment and the men could not be put to work in the normal way on ordinary production, there should be a scheme of capital works of a public nature that would take up the slack.  I make no apology at all for the fact that the Government was anxious to have prepared plans for the erection of a series of public buildings, Government buildings, a national library in which we could house the <Col N="1925" /> great treasures that are in The National Library at the present time dumped away where nobody can get at them, and so forth.  It was intended that the plans should be ready so that they could be put into operation whenever there was a slack in the building trade. There was also the proposition that we should build in the Park instead of in this area.  The proposition of building in this area was thoroughly examined and finally turned down by the Government. The idea was that we should build in the Park instead.  As Minister for Finance at that time I was anxious that if the Government encroached on the Phoenix Park an equivalent area of land should be made available to the citizens of Dublin who were thereby deprived of that area of the Park.  I made the suggestion that we should see what we could do towards getting the valley of the Liffey out to Chapelizod so that that could be added to the Park and the public would have the right of access to the river.  I make no apology at all for that, nor do I for the fact that our Government was trying to have a scheme of public works which could be put into operation to take up a slack in employment in the building industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister also spoke here to-night about our crazy idea of spending £2,000,000 on the erection of offices for Government Departments in the Castle.  Two million pounds sounds very big.  That was also part of the scheme of public works which it was intended should be proceeded with in a slack time in the building trade.  I am going to put this question to the Minister one of these days.  What premises has he bought recently in order to house Government Departments?  I think that if he compares the amount of money he paid for very small accommodation with the proposition that we should spend £2,000,000 in order to house 3,000 or 4,000 civil servants it will not sound such a bad business.  The other day I understand that the Minister for Finance or the Department of Public Works said in answer to a question that they had paid £15,000 for premises not 150 yards away from this House.  The Minister for Finance himself is quite well aware that only a few <Col N="1926" /> years ago that property changed hands at £3,500 and yet he paid £15,000 for it. He knows that it only changed hands at £3,500 because it was his political Party who sold it.</P>

We have not the same access to these at the present time but I want to say that I make no apology to him for trying to solve the problem of housing our civil servants so that they would be under proper supervision and would not be stuck in holes and corners all over the city.  It is probable that we could get, by the sale of a number of private houses that the Government Departments are occupying at the present time, the money to build one or two proper office buildings to house large number of civil servants.  It would have been impossible to do the work that the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Department of Supplies did during the war if we had not had the good fortune to build the offices in Kildare Street.</P>

    <P>For the repayment of the American Loan I know that our credit is sufficiently good to meet our obligations ultimately even if the money which is put into the Central Bank is used.  I know that we have not reached the stage when we could not meet a debt of that sort but it would be good finance to make definite provision for it.  By putting it into the fund for safe investments it would be realisable quickly and you could meet your engagements at any moment.  If you sink it in drainage and expend it on this drainage scheme obviously the money would not be in  form for the repayment of your loan.  What we want to know is if you mean this.  It would be much better for the Dáil to know what is in your mind regarding it and what is in the mind of the Government, whether it is intended that the money should be utilised to provide the cash necessary for the carrying on of the drainage scheme.  We might have differences of <Col N="1928" /> opinion from the national point of view but we are anxious to know what is the intention.  We want to know if the intention is to put it in ordinary stocks and have a good realisable asset against it, or whether you are going to sink it in drainage.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the Minister for External Affairs as to the wisdom of investing in foreign securities was a proper one to put.  To Deputy de Valera I would say, that if the choice were left to me as to the investment of these moneys in English investments so as to be able to meet a demand on the fund at any time, I would not so invest.  The purpose of this section is to get these moneys out of the account and eventually into the Exchequer.  I should like to have the fund utilised in the way Exchequer moneys are.  I could use these moneys for the Electricity (Supply) Acts or for any purpose authorised by Estimate, but we have as yet no Estimate for the drainage scheme promoted by the Minister for Agriculture.  I hope that some of these moneys will go into that scheme.  The situation we are faced with is that we have got money from America.  When 1952 comes, but not until then, we have got to provide for the payment of interest; and when 1956 comes, but not before that, we have got to begin to repay capital. Before these dates we have got to make our financial plans accordingly. One way would be to exact from the taxpayer whatever would be required to meet the interest on the sum and the repayment of capital.  Such provision is made in the case of the 3 per cent.  Exchequer Bonds by way of the sinking fund arrangement.  Alternatively, it would be easy to arrange for the investment of these moneys in various schemes which create sufficient assets to ensure a direct return to the Exchequer, say, in 1956.  A third way would be to assist increased production in the country, enabling the taxpayer more easily to bear interest charge and capital repayment.  The question for the House eventually will be whether this money should be sterilised by being put into the Central Bank and left there, letting the Central Bank invest it, say, in English securities.  I would not at all urge that that should be done.  As an alternative, it may be suitably invested in <Col N="1930" /> an existing development, the controlling body of which makes interest payments with its capital amortisation obligations which might be put in gear with the obligations associated with this fund.  Otherwise, the fund may be used for development and possibly for the payment of interest and capital repayment by resort to the general taxpayer.  General productivity does make assets even though these do not provide for a direct return to the Exchequer.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but you are introducing another section in order to give you power over this money in the same way as you have power over the Post Office moneys.  That is what you stated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be the effect of this clause.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>It is because the Minister has not that power at the moment that he is introducing this section to give him the very same power as he has in relation to the Post Office funds. First of all, this is a loan from a foreign country.  It has been the practice in this House, right from the inception of this State, never to put the Government, as such, with its ordinary State loans, in the hands of another Government&mdash;apart from the manner <Col N="1932" /> in which individuals invested them. Will this not ultimately put the American money into State loans?  The Minister may say he wants to raise £10,000,000.  He can fill it all from this money, every penny of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>He is putting it into capital development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>No country, as I understand it, issues Government securities to another Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not doing that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>This is what it will mean.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been given very little time to consider this new principle in the matter of State finance. Apart from what Deputy Aiken and Deputy de Valera say, this is quite a new position.  I think we ought to be given an undertaking by the Government that there will be Dáil control as to how this money is going to be utilised.  Nobody objects to its being used for capital reproductive purposes. Naturally, that is the proper thing.  We should, however, leave it in a position where it is not a Government issue subscribed to by another Government.</P>
      <P>Sections 4, 5 and Title agreed to.</P>
      <P>Bill reported without amendment.</P>
      <P>Question&mdash;&ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration&rdquo;&mdash;put, and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Question&mdash;&ldquo;That the Bill do now pass&rdquo;&mdash;put.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not opposing it.</P>
      <P>Question agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Money Bill.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11.55 p.m., until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 30th March, 1949.</P>
