      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take business in the following order: Nos. 1, 9 (Vote 26) 2, 11 and then in No. 9, Votes 65 to 73 inclusive as on the Order Paper.  It is proposed that the consideration of Government Business be not interrupted for the taking of Private Members' time at 12 o'clock. With regard to No. 1, the Dáil will recall that last night, the House on a Vote decided to refer the Estimate back for reconsideration.  The Government met last night, reconsidered the matter as directed by the House, and they decided to reintroduce the Vote in its original form.  Following the practice of the House Item No. 1 on the Order Paper is for leave to introduce that Estimate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the action of the Government on this occasion is entirely without precedent.  A similar situation which arose earlier was met by the Executive Council of the day by the resignation of the Taoiseach and the submission of his name for re-election to the Dáil.  On another occasion, the Government in office decided that the situation was one which called for a vote of confidence.  I think that it is treating the Dáil with contempt to regard what happened here yesterday&mdash;the defeat of the Government upon a motion which was in effect a motion of confidence&mdash;as nothing more than a mere triviality, something in the nature of a misprint which has to be rectified by a formal act to-day. It is clear that the action taken by the Government can be prompted only by a decision to hold on to office irrespective of the opinion of the Dáil and of the country.  If that action is to be regarded as indicative of the mind of the Government, it can imply only that they are indifferent to the views expressed here by Deputies, contemptuous of their criticism of the Administration and propose to take no action when that criticism leads even to a defeat in the Division Lobby.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was obvious here yesterday that criticism of the administration and proposals of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs was not confined to any one side of the House.  It was expressed by Deputies who ordinarily supported the Government.  If these Deputies decided to abstain from voting, and to express their criticism in that way, then their action is indicative of their attitude to the Government and of the particular proposal that was before the House.  The Government, however, has decided that no matter what was said, no matter how valid were the criticisms expressed, they are going to ignore them.  That is a complete reversal of the position which the Taoiseach announced it was his intention to take up when he was elected <Col N="459" /> as head of the Government.  If that line is to be pursued why not abolish the Dáil?  If the sole consideration which operates in the mind of Ministers is that they must hold on to office, no matter how discontented Deputies and members of the public are with their administration, why keep the Dáil here at all?  Is not the expression of criticism of the administration of the Government a mere waste of time?  I submit that it is entirely wrong for the Government to treat this matter so lightly, that it is establishing a bad precedent, that it is contrary to established practice and is indicative of a mentality in the Government which all sections of the Dáil should be very quick to resent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>From a democratic point of view, I think the course that is being taken by the Government is about the worst.  There are a number of choices before the Government.  If they are going to take &ldquo;referring back&rdquo; the Estimate literally, as apparently they are doing, to regard it as an Estimate for reconsideration, then I think they have given very little consideration to the opinions expressed yesterday. If the vote meant anything, it meant that there was a majority against the Estimate as it was explained by the <Col N="460" /> Minister in charge.  From a democratic point of view, that ought to have been taken into consideration and an effort should have been made by the Government, if they were going to take that line, to meet the wishes of the majority.  I take it that Deputies on the opposite benches who were in the precincts of the House last night and who did not vote did not vote because they did not approve of the Estimate.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The line taken by the Government now is to force those Deputies, who apparently did not want this Estimate, to vote for it, or else&mdash; take the alternative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no truth in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>What else is the purpose of bringing in the Vote in this form but to compel people who were, apparently, so opposed to it that they could be in the precincts of the House and not vote for it?  Is it not clear that what the Government are trying to do is to force through an Estimate against the majority opinion of the House as expressed yesterday?  Of course, to treat this in the literal, technical sense is completely wrong.  Referring back an Estimate is not intended and was never intended to be taken in the literal sense.  It has been traditionally used in this House&mdash;I mean over a long period&mdash;to enable a full discussion on the Department to take place, and to make possible the widest considerations to be taken into account.  A defeat on an Estimate of that sort cannot be treated, to use the expression of Deputy Lemass, as a triviality. It is a major matter and ought to be dealt with as such from a democratic point of view by any Government.  If you take it as a literal matter, the proper thing to do from the democratic point of view is to take into account the opinion expressed here.  If, on the other hand, you do not take it as a literal matter, but regard it as a major matter, then you ought to treat it as such and the precedents here in cases of that sort have been to treat it as such.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="461" /> On a previous occasion, the President of the Executive Council came back to the Dáil and resigned and went forward again for re-election.  He said: &ldquo;We are defeated; we no longer have the confidence of the House.  We want to test that in the most formal way&rdquo;. Another course was open to the Taoiseach and the Government, if they desired to take it, which in my opinion would have been the proper way of dealing with it, and that was to go to the President and ask for a dissolution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>We were proved to have been right.  We did not want to be in office on sufferance.  We wanted to be in a position in which we would be able to do the work of the country properly and be able to say that we were the Government by the declared will of the people, tested in the most democratic way; that when we spoke we spoke for the country as a whole. That is not the position to-day.  We know that at the last election, when the various Parties were before the people for election, only one Opposition Party were explicit in telling the people that they did not expect to have a majority and that, if they were elected, they would take part in a coalition Government.  That was the Fine Gael Party.  We can certainly say, so far as the Fine Gael Party are concerned, that they did tell the people when going forward for election that they were prepared to form a coalition.  The result was that they got 31 seats&mdash;a little more than one-fifth of the total members returned to the House.  The other Parties who form the coalition did not tell the people beforehand that they would enter into a coalition.  Take the Labour Party. Were any people who supported the Labour Party in the last election&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course it is.  The Labour Party at the last election went before the electorate who had a knowledge of their past.  They asked to be re-elected.  The Leader of that Party, when here in the Dáil, made it quite clear by his previous actions that he did not want coalitions, that the policy of the Labour Party was independence, that they did not want to be dependent on any Party and therefore did not want to tie themselves up in a coalition.</P>
      <P>Then let us take Clann na Talmhan. The Leader of that Party went round the country telling of the fate of previous Farmers' Parties and at various meetings which he addressed stated that one of the things they had to fight against here, so far as their Party was concerned, was the bad odour that had been attached to previous Farmers' Parties because they had allowed themselves to be absorbed in the Fine Gael Party.</P>

The fact is that every single Party except Fine Gael that formed that Coalition formed it behind the backs of the people and they are afraid now to face the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>And the people's seats, less than one-fifteenth, roughly, opinion of them was to give them ten <Col N="464" /> of the total representation in this Dáil.</P>
      <P>What about the other parties that formed the Coalition?  We have got the National Labour Party.  Did the National Labour Party tell the people who supported them in the country that they were going to join the Coalition?  The opinions of the people who voted for them, as expressed later when they found them out, is proof that they did not.</P>
      <P>As for the Independents, the Independents, I suppose, are free to follow any line they want.  They did not, as far as I know, stand definitely either for a Coalition or the reverse.  They have 12 seats out of the total.  Therefore, I state, and I believe there is no contradicting it, that those who form the Government of to-day have not got the authority of the people for doing so. They have got the authority of forming it by virtue of having a majority vote here.  When they lose that and when that is obviously questioned, their clear duty, if they have any courage, is to get their position made clear.  Time after time, in the national interest, I have urged that if they were going to form a Coalition they should do so before an election and put their policy to the people.  They have the opportunity of doing it now.  It is bad for the country that there should be a Government of that sort in times like the present.  The people are anxious about the bad work that has been done. Already in the public mind&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an extraordinary thing that the Government, which claims to have the confidence at least of the majority of the Dáil, is afraid to put down a vote of confidence.  That is the first thing that emerges on consideration of the manoeuvre we have had this morning.  Last night the majority of the Dáil clearly repudiated any confidence it had in this Government. The results of the East Donegal election and the West Cork election showed that the people have likewise repudiated this Government.  In West Cork, the strongest Fine Gael constituency in Ireland, the Opposition vote increased by 12½ per cent. and the Government vote declined by over 2,000 votes.  In East Donegal the Opposition vote increased by over 20 per cent. and, as the Leader of the Opposition has said, if those results represent the country&mdash;and I believe they represent the minimum change over in the country&mdash;if there were a general election to-morrow this Government and all its hangers-on would be wiped out of office.  Deputy Lemass referred to the precedents that ought to rule our conduct in relation to this matter.  In a democracy precedents are important, particularly when those precedents are set by men who have some regard for the principles of democracy.  None of us will say that we on this side of the House had any great regard as a politician for the Leader of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government during the period from 1922 to 1932.  Some of us said things, I in particular, which I sincerely regret, but I never did deny that he at any rate had a regard for the principles of democracy.  When he was defeated here in Dáil Éireann he did what the present Taoiseach refuses to do.  He resigned.  That was an honourable thing to do.  It is a precedent which should become the standard of conduct here for his successors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again when on another occasion, not on this occasion on a matter introduced by the Government, when Dr. Ward brought in the Old Age Pension Bill and the Opposition succeeded in carrying the Second Reading of that Bill against the Government Whips, once more a democratic principle was <Col N="466" /> availed of and a vote of confidence in the Government was put down.  Mr. Cosgrave resigned and after he resigned a vote of confidence was put down and he was renominated as President of the Executive Council and after that of course, naturally he was entitled to form a Government and did. How was the attitude which the President of the Executive Council, Mr. William Cosgrave, took up on Friday, 28th March, 1930, expressed by him? In column 276 of Volume 34 he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Executive Council, while it appreciates that the result of yesterday's Vote was due to the fortuitous circumstances that a number of the members of the Government Party were unavoidably absent, nevertheless feels that the House, having come to the decision that it did, should be given an opportunity of electing another Executive.  I have therefore tendered my resignation to the His Excellency the Governor-General.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Were any supporters of this Government Party unavoidably absent yesterday? We had on the Order Paper for some days a motion to refer back an Estimate.  An Estimate is something for which the Government as a whole is particularly responsible.  If you turn to Article 28 of the Constitution you will see that the responsibility is specifically laid by the Constitution upon the Government which &ldquo;prepare Estimates of the Receipts and Estimates of the Expenditure of the State ... and shall present them to Dáil Éireann for consideration.&rdquo;  Therefore it was on no minor issue that the Government was defeated.  It was on an issue deliberately raised by the Opposition and of which full and ample notice was given.  Moreover in relation to that matter the Government was in a position to chose the exact time at which it would submit this issue to the House.</P>
    <P>There was a considerable number of speakers from the Opposition Benches in relation to this matter.  They were joined by some who normally support the Government in condemning the action which the Government, through its Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, <Col N="467" /> proposed to take.  It would have been quite possible, if there was a single man, a single back-bencher, with the exception, I think, of Deputy Crotty, prepared to support the action of the Government and to get up here and defend it, for the Government to have prolonged the debate until they had here any people who were, as in the case of the motion on 28th March, 1930, unavoidably absent.  But the Government did not do that.  They felt secure that they had the confidence and support of a majority.  It was their Whips' job to find out that they had.  The Government accordingly chose its own time deliberately to put this question to the House.  It was beaten, and it was beaten when there were within the precincts of Leinster House, within hearing of the Division Bell, Deputies who would normally support the Government, so there were therefore no Deputies on this occasion unavoidably absent.  There were Deputies deliberately absent because they were not going to support the Government in depriving the people of this country of a right and a privilege which they have enjoyed ever since the postal services were established&mdash;the right and privilege to approach a Government Minister or a Government Department with the least possible expense to themselves.</P>
    <P>What were the next precedents we had?  The Leader of the Opposition has referred to them.  One was in 1937 when we were beaten on a Private Member's motion by one vote.  We had the option of resigning, as Deputy Cosgrave did, avoiding a general election and asking the Dáil to pass a vote of confidence in us by re-electing the then Taoiseach.  It would have been quite constitutional to have done that, but we felt that there was a higher court of appeal, a court of appeal to which apparently this Government is afraid to go.  There was the court of appeal of the people of Ireland, and, when we were beaten on a motion put down, I think, by the present Taoiseach, we carried the issue to the people and gave the people an opportunity to judge us and to judge the Opposition <Col N="468" /> and to pass a verdict accordingly.  This Government is quite obviously afraid to submit itself to the judgment of the people.  This Government is quite obviously afraid of the verdict the people would give.</P>
    <P>We have heard a great deal about West Cork and, we have heard, I should say, a little about West Cork, but we have heard nothing about East Donegal.  However, West Cork gave as little consolation to this Government as East Donegal did.  These gentlemen have learned the lesson of West Cork and they are afraid that what East Donegal and West Cork did in the two by-elections which have taken place in the short time they have been in office, the people of Ireland would do in an even more emphatic way to-morrow&mdash;repudiate this Taoiseach and every element in that Coalition.  That is why he is able to rally behind him to-day in the Dáil the Deputies who do not care about democracy and who are prepared to put their place above their principles.</P>
    <P>This proposal, as I have shown, is an attempt to evade the obligations of the Constitution.  The Government, as the Leader of the Opposition reminds us, announced that it was the servant of the Dáil.  Very well, take it upon the narrow issue which Deputy de Valera raised.  If it regards itself as the servant of the Dáil, why does it ignore the judgment, the decision, which the Dáil gave yesterday?  The issue which was raised in the debate yesterday on the Estimate of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs was no minor matter. For years, as has been pointed out, even under the British régime, any man who wanted to get in touch with a Department of State or a State functionary could drop a letter in the post-box unfranked and it went straight to the person whose ear or eye he was anxious to catch, and, if he had a grievance, he would at least have the satisfaction of knowing that he had been able, unhindered and unhampered and at little expense to himself, to bring that grievance before the notice of the then constituted authority.  We gave the people no new right when the Free State was established.  We conferred upon the people no new right or <Col N="469" /> privilege in this regard when this Republic of Ireland was established by the Constitution of 1937.  It was a right which they had enjoyed, even under their British taskmasters.  It remained for the man who proclaims himself to be a member of a Labour Party, the National Labour Party, if you please, who holds himself out as a servant of the poor and the oppressed, to come in here and ask the Deputies, the representatives of the people, to deprive our people of a right which they have established by long prescription, a right which was willingly conceded to them by every Government established here since 1922.</P>
    <P>That was the issue which was raised and many members who normally support the Government were so strongly moved by what it was proposed to do that they refused to support the Government in its policy.  They abstained and, so far as they were concerned, they left the Government to the mercy and verdict of Dáil Éireann.  Now Dáil Éireann has given its verdict.  Dáil Éireann gave its verdict last night.  Dáil Éireann has spoken, and what does the Government propose to do?  It proposes to ignore that verdict and it proposes to ignore it with such an exhibition of contempt for its own supporters that, if there is one among them with the spirit of a man, he will vote to refuse to give them leave to introduce this motion in the terms in which it has been put before the House.  Remember that there are men on those opposite benches who refused to support the Government last night in the proposal it now seeks to ram down your throats. The Government is not merely humiliating democracy&mdash;it is asking everyone of you to humiliate yourself personally, asking you to swallow the leek, to come back like a dog to its vomit.  That is what you are being asked to do; that is what you are being driven to do, under the coercion that, if you do not do it, there will be a better Government in this country or, if not a better Government, the people will at least have an opportunity to pass judgment upon the Government which should now be going out.</P>
    <P>Dáil Éireann, I have said, has given its verdict, but that verdict is to be ignored by this Government.  There is <Col N="470" /> nothing, to those of us who know the members of that Government, very strange or very novel in that.  Members of this Government have ignored and have flouted other verdicts which have been given against them.  They have even attacked judges who delivered these verdicts&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I say that this motion is a deliberate evasion of the responsibility and obligations which Article 28 of the Constitution imposes upon the members of a Government.  Article 28 of the Constitution, paragraph 4 (1) states: &ldquo;The Government shall be responsible to Dáil Éireann.&rdquo;  Last night the Government was called upon in Dáil Éireann to answer for its responsibilities and Dáil Éireann, by a solemn vote, withdrew its confidence from that Government.  Paragraph 4 (2) of Article 28 of the Constitution states: &ldquo;The Government shall meet and act as a collective authority, and shall be collectively responsible for the Departments of State administered by the members of the Government.&rdquo;  When the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs was speaking in this House last night he was not speaking as an individual. He was speaking as the agent and as the mouthpiece of the Government of the day.  He was making their case. That case was weighed in the balance here by the Deputies of Dáil Éireann and it was found to be wanting.  Paragraph 4 (3) of Article 28 the Constitution provides: &ldquo;The Government shall prepare Estimates of the receipts and Estimates of the expenditure for the State for each financial year, and shall present them to Dáil Éireann for consideration.&rdquo; It did prepare these Estimates and presented them to Dáil Éireann for consideration&mdash;and Dáil Éireann has rejected them.  Therefore, as I have said, the position is that this <Col N="472" /> Government is defying Article 28 of the Constitution and is refusing to acknowledge its responsibility to Dáil Éireann.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>This is Dáil Éireann. The Government should not be in office to-day unless it has asked and succeeded in persuading the President to grant a dissolution.  That is the position. There were only two legitimate courses open to this Government: (1) for the Taoiseach to resign and place himself at the mercy of his colleagues here in Dáil Éireann, or (2) to go to Arus an Uachtaráin and ask the President to grant him a dissolution.  I will concede that he may have been in a difficulty in that regard.</P>
      <P>Why did the Taoiseach not go and ask for a dissolution?  The primary reason, I think, is that he knows that if that dissolution were granted, after the people gave their verdict at the polls, there would be a new Taoiseach and a new Government here.  The other reason is that knowing that the Vote last night could be taken as other than a withdrawal of confidence on the part of Dáil Éireann, the President might under the relevant article of the Constitution have refused him a dissolution. He was not in a position to ask for a dissolution&mdash;knowing that it would be granted.  However, by resigning and asking some people&mdash;if such a one would be found in the House&mdash;to propose his renomination as Taoiseach, he would then be in a position, if he wanted to face the people and take a verdict upon the issue, of going to the President as a Taoiseach who had the confidence of Dáil Éireann and asking him to give a dissolution.  But the whole purpose of this Government from the day it was elected until to-day, has been to evade its constitutional responsibilities, to flout the courts and to overturn democracy.</P>

      <P>I should like to bring this debate back to realities and to keep it on the lines of realities. There has been talk about democracy and about my duty and the Government's duty.  We are fully appreciative <Col N="473" /> of the duties that we owe to this House and to the people.  The realities of this situation which we are meeting to-day are very simple.  A number of Deputies who support this Government were not present, for a variety of reasons, at this debate last night.  Some were ill; some were attending functions officially; some could not be here; some who should have been here were not here, and some arrived late.  But, for whatever reason they were not here, not one single member of this House who normally votes for this Government voted against this motion.</P>

      <P>These are the realities.  There is no use in talking about democracy or anything else. Last night's division was not a vote of no confidence in this Government. What last night's vote was or was not can be determined here to-day <Col N="474" /> at the earliest opportunity.  Deputy MacEntee states that we propose to ignore last night's verdict.  We have accepted last night's verdict in the setting in which it took place and at the earliest moment we have come in here and have said: &ldquo;There is the vote we want; we will stand by that&rdquo;. We seek the verdict of the House upon that and on that verdict we will stand to-day.  Deputy MacEntee says we are afraid to face the people.</P>

      <P>I am not, and neither is any single one of my colleagues supporting the present Government, afraid either of the jibes of Deputies opposite or of the verdict of the people.  When I took office, by the majority vote of this House, representing a majority of those people who had voted at the last election, I explained that I was not going to regard any snap division as something which would necessarily involve the downfall of the Government.  Deputy Lemass misquoted me when he said this morning that I was acting contrary to what I said when I took office.  That is what I said.  It is in that spirit I am acting.  If I thought for one moment that what took place last night was in any sense a vote of &ldquo;no confidence&rdquo; from any section of the Parties who are supporting this Government, I would not remain in office for one second.</P>
      <P>I do not want to repeat what I have repeated frequently.  Not one single one of us, notwithstanding Deputy Lemass's jibes last year, repeated this year, wishes to hold on to office.</P>

      <P>I repeat what I said last week at Nenagh and every time I spoke to the people down the country at inter-Party meetings, that we will retain office so long, and only so long, as the people want us to do so.  We set out to do a job of work for the people of Ireland.  I believe this Government is doing a great service to the people <Col N="475" /> of Ireland and is very good for the people of Ireland, that the people of Ireland appreciate it and do not want at this stage the turmoil of a general election.</P>
      <P>We are going to do that work as long as we retain the support of the majority of the people's representatives in this Parliament.  We will go on with that work and when we have completed it we will go to the people and ask for their verdict on it, saying &ldquo;That is what we promised to do, and that is what we have done; now you pronounce on it.&rdquo;  We are not going, by jibes or snap divisions such as occurred last night, or any other device or trick of the Fianna Fáil Party, to be misled into going to the people before we have done the task we set out to do.</P>
      <P>We have a programme of work being now initiated.  We believe that we have done great good for the people, we believe that the people appreciate that. More than that, what the people want at the present time is not general elections; they want work done and business carried on.  That is what we are doing.  We are carrying on the business of the country in a democratic way, in spite of what Deputy de Valera said.  We are operating the Parliamentary machine of democracy and we say that this vote last night was an accidental vote.  In case it was not, we came at the first opportunity, the next morning, and said: &ldquo;That is our reconsideration, in accordance with the vote of the Dáil last night; we now ask you to vote upon it.&rdquo;  If Deputy MacEntee were right when he said that people were lurking outside the Lobbies or around the House not wanting to vote upon it, they have their opportunity to-day.  If that is not democracy and democratic Parliamentary procedure and practice, then I do not know anything about democracy.</P>

      <P>It was quite easy <Col N="476" /> yesterday, as the debate proceeded, to see what occurred.  In the earlier stages of the debate, from all sides of the House, and from the Opposition particularly, the greatest tributes were paid to the Minister.  In view of that attitude, Deputies on this side of the House had apparently made up their minds that, in the words of Deputy Little opening the motion to refer the Estimate back, the motion was only being put for the purpose of widening the scope of the debate.

Having created that spirit&mdash; which the Opposition were perfectly entitled to create&mdash;to lull certain members here into a sense of security, they marshalled their forces in the different parts of the House and came in and won by a couple of votes.  Deputy MacEntee says that the Taoiseach is flouting the Dáil.  The Taoiseach is not. The Taoiseach, in coming in to-day, is asking the Dáil to give a decision in a democratic way on a vital issue&mdash;&ldquo;Has this Dáil confidence in the Government or has it not&rdquo;?  That is the issue before us.</P>

Where the Government there has been defeated in the last couple of years on a matter such as this, they reintroduced the thing the following day in the way this is done and they got the confidence of Parliament. That is a precedent in a democratic country.  If we cannot create the precedents ourselves, we are entitled to look for precedents in other Parliaments similarly established and under the same form of democracy. This manoeuvre&mdash;as it is a manoeuvre&mdash; will not fool the people at all.  The people know that there is a majority in this House for the Government.</P>

I believe that is my duty and responsibility and I believe that is what my constituents sent me here for. But we have become too casual over a long period.  Deputies will not even come into the House to listen to the debates and, if I may say so, Ministers are not doing their duty in that regard either.  The moment questions are over, Ministers get up and walk out of this House.  They seem to prefer to walk around the grounds than to sit in the House listening to the debates. I say to the Ministers &ldquo;You have a responsibility to be in this House as often as you can&rdquo;.  I say there is a responsibility on every Deputy, no matter on what side he sits, to be here when a division is called, and to vote as he thinks he ought to vote.</P>

      <P>Largely, on a point of personal explanation, I want to say that when I moved to refer the Vote back I did so, it is true, as I said, in order to enlarge the scope of the debate and to deal with it from the point of view of policy.  Of course, it was in my mind, and must have been in the mind of every other Deputy, that whether he would vote to refer it back or not would depend on the statement of the Minister.  Now, there was a general appeal on the part of all Parties in the House, I might say, for a certain statement to be withdrawn because it offended against the democratic principles that the poorest people in this country should have the right of free access to Departments and to Ministers, and it was upon that issue the vote was taken.  It is a very wide principle.</P>

      <P>The issue is a very clear one.  It involves a fundamental democratic principle.  You have Deputies constantly here speaking one way and voting the other way.  Deputy Kyne, for example, got up and spoke against <Col N="479" /> the Estimate on this particular issue. He said that he would have to vote against the Government on it, and then he acted as a Whip for the Party.  What sort of confidence, do you think, the general public can have in that sort of thing, people saying one thing and doing the other?  My God, we have seen other countries wrecked because men cannot have public integrity and stand honourably by what they say.</P>

      <P>The oratorical efforts of Deputy MacEntee and Deputy Little would really be worthy of a better cause.  This, in effect, is largely a storm in a teacup.  The points made by Deputy Cowan are substantially correct.  I wish to emphasise, particularly, the point he stressed about the members of the different groups supporting the Government who were not present last night, and who should have been present.  The whole argument of Deputy MacEntee was based on the fact that members were within the precincts of the House, that they should have voted for the Government and did not vote for the Government, thereby clearly trying to establish that there was a lack of confidence within some of the Parties composing this Coalition Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, as it will be impossible for each individual member of the Labour Party to establish where he was or why he did not vote, I want to say that as far as Deputy MacEntee's statement applies to the Labour Party it is completely wrong.  It is completely mispletely wrong.  It is completely misleading and misinformed.  There were seven members of the Labour Party absent from the divison last night. That was a dereliction of duty on their part, perhaps, but this is to be clearly stated that not one of these seven was within the precincts of the House&mdash;to repeat the phrase used by Deputy MacEntee.  Each and every one of them had a legitimate excuse.  They were on business connected with their unions or with their constituencies, and in no case was one of them within telephone <Col N="480" /> reach or other mode of communication when it was established that a division was about to take place.</P>
    <P>It is quite true that the Opposition used the occasion last night legitimately, as they were entitled to, to attempt to destroy confidence in the Government, to attempt to upset the Government, to attempt to have a general election and to come back as the Government themselves.  But it would be an extremely foolish thing for any Government to allow the ball to be at the Opposition's feet at any time.  It is, obviously, the duty of the Government, if it has any sense of proportion and if it wants to represent the interests that it purports to represent, to decide when is the best time to go before the people.  That is a long established practice in which Fianna Fáil became adepts during their time.  I do not see why the present Government should have it dictated to them by the Opposition as to when they should go to the country.  It is quite true that within the past couple of weeks there has been a falling off in the attendance of Opposition Deputies.  The last division that we had in the House previous to the division on the Estimate for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs showed that they were in a minority of 14.  That lulled some members of the Government into a false sense of security no doubt.  They were lulled further by the adroit tactics and strategy of Fianna Fáil who are some of the best political masters of the game in the country by a succession of Deputies coming into the House. Eight of them came in in succession, and one after another spoke for four or five minutes, each stating that he wanted merely to raise one or two little minor points and would not detain the Minister, and each and every one objecting to this question of prepaid postage, the point of which was completely overlooked by the ex-Minister of Fianna Fáil who had moved to refer the Vote back.  He made no reference to that question.  He did not understand the import or significance of it.  It was left to a much wiser and smarter member of the Fianna Fáil Party to understand the significance that could be made out of that and <Col N="481" /> to whip his members into some form of vehemence about the matter.  All that, as I have said, lulled the members on this side into a false sense of security.  The Government is perfectly entitled to come now before the House and seek a vote of confidence as it does in this technical manner.  Even though it is done in a technical manner, I still believe that this is a vote of confidence and nothing more than a vote of confidence in the Government.</P>

      <P>It is extraordinary how excited some Deputies can become over such matters as this.  It does not do their Party the slightest good and will not affect the vote in the slightest way.  I do not see why they should be using up all this nervous energy.  This is a time when we should all keep cool, calm and collected.  I think that it is a technical matter&mdash;the mode in which the Government have decided to reintroduce this Estimate.  It has been spoken to in very wide terms.  The scope of the debate could perhaps be wider if it were on constitutional issues, but the Ceann Comhairle has ruled otherwise.  Apart from that, the scope of the debate has been very wide. The Leader of the Opposition, Deputy de Valera, traversed the conduct of all the different Parties at the last general election.  Surely that is a wide enough field for discussion.  It could be well <Col N="482" /> argued whether the formal mode of a vote of no confidence or a vote of confidence would give the same scope for discussion.  But the Government have sought to do it in this technical manner and perhaps many of us would agree that it could have been done differently.</P>
      <P>The constitutional practice of other countries may be different.  The Government may come in and sacrifice a Minister for something like this, for a defeat on his Estimate, or they may modify the Estimate.  If the Government in this case so did, then we would be faced with a different situation but, the fact that they are reintroducing the Estimate in its original form, for the original amount and covering the same field as it covered before, is every indication that it is intended as not so much a reopening of the debate on that Estimate but to test the House whether the House still reposes confidence in the Government.  On that basis the members of the Labour Party intend to support the motion for leave to reintroduce this Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Connolly, who seems to be a thrower of oil on troubled waters for the Coalition, says that this motion poses the question as to whether the Dáil reposes confidence in the Government.  Actually, the motion before the Dáil in this form is an effort to avoid putting that question to the people and, instead of asking the Deputies whether they repose confidence in the Government; they are asking the Coalition members whether they dare face the people because, if the Coalition members who abstained from voting on this dared face the people, they would repeat to-day what they did yesterday; they would abstain from voting to impose a tax on those who want to approach a Department of State on some legitimate grievance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been all sorts of promises made to the people by this Government in this last 16 months.  As far as promises are concerned, they still act in the irresponsible manner in which they acted when they were not a Government. They are prepared to promise the sun, moon and stars tomorrow but not much to-day.  The bright idea was got by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs that they would <Col N="483" /> stop the people writing letters asking when they were going to implement their promises and so they have imposed this tax upon anybody who dares to write to a Minister or to the Secretary of a Department to ask about it.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said that this motion was a method of avoiding the turmoil of a general election.  It is no such thing.  If the Taoiseach feared to face the people, as the members who refused to vote for him yesterday and who are going to vote for him to-day fear it, he had the alternative of giving the Dáil an opportunity of electing another Government and in that way the turmoil of the general election which he talks about would have been avoided.  But he is afraid to give the members who were supporting the Coalition an opportunity of electing a new Government.</P>
    <P>There is a good number of members who are supporting the Coalition who do not want the Coalition to continue, who do not want this tax to be imposed on people writing to Government Departments, who want the people to have the same access to Ministers and Government Departments as they always had, but these same Deputies who want to get rid of the Coalition do not want to have a general election.  If they had the opportunity which would have been presented to this Dáil if the Taoiseach had followed precedent and had acted in the spirit of the Constitution, these gentlemen would have voted for an alternative Government and that is why we have this motion in this form and not the resignation of the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>Let us remember that these motions to refer back Estimates have been on the paper for several months, that any financial motion has been always treated as a major question.  The Government since last night have ceased to have the confidence of the Dáil and, according to the Constitution, the correct procedure in such case is that &ldquo;the Taoiseach shall resign from office upon his ceasing to retain the support of a majority in Dáil Éireann&rdquo; unless on his advice the President dissolves Dáil Éireann.  Last night the Taoiseach <Col N="484" /> ceased to retain the confidence of the majority of the members of the Dáil but he is going to use the big stick to drive those who have no confidence in him to vote for him because of the alternative of a general election.  He does not give them the other alternative, the alternative of electing here a new Government.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said they were prepared to carry on only so long as the people wanted them.  The people never voted for them.  The people voted for the Opposition Party 2 to 1 against Fine Gael, 7 or 8 to 1 against the rest of the individual parties who offered themselves as a Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The people of this country do not forget everything in 16 or 17 months after it has happened and they know that Clann na Poblachta put up 90 candidates and they asked the people, as they put it &ldquo;to give MacBride the reins of Government&rdquo;. They turned him down 9 to 1.  He got 1 candidate back out of every 9 he put up.  The people did not elect this Government as a government.  They did not know it was going to come into operation and the Independents and some of the smaller groups that supported it supported it because they were afraid of another general election. The Taoiseach is using that fear of a general election on the part of the smaller groups, on the part of the Independents, to whip them through the Division Lobby in favour of the reintroduction of this Estimate which a number of them by their abstention yesterday condemned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my belief those Deputies are being publicly humiliated.  If they were men of honour they would give the same verdict to-day as they gave yesterday. And their fear of an election is not even real.  They are being persuaded by the Fine Gael whips that if they do not vote for the Government the alternative is an election.  There is another alternative.  If the Government lose this second vote, I take it from what the Taoiseach said&mdash;if we can rely upon him&mdash;that he will resign. <Col N="485" /> Then the course open to the Dáil would be to elect a new Government.</P>
    <P>There is no Party in this Dáil sufficiently strong to elect a Government of itself, but there are six or seven Parties in the Dáil who could elect a Government if they had not the opposition of the remainder.  There is, for instance, the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash; if they were allowed to form a Government. If the Taoiseach resigned, if we had had his resignation here this morning, as we should have had according to the Constitution, and if we had not last night got a dissolution from the President, the question we would be discussing here this morning, I take it, would be that Eamonn de Valera should be elected Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>If any other Party thought that they could form a Government and be able to carry on&mdash;that they would not be thrown out, and even that they could carry on for a few months&mdash;they could have nominated a new Taoiseach if they did not like to let Fianna Fáil carry on as the Government.  Fianna Fáil was entitled on the 18th February, 1948, to have been allowed to become the Government if the Independents and several other of the smaller groups had confirmed the wishes of the people as expressed by their giving Fianna Fáil, the largest Party, a majority over all other organised Parties.</P>
    <P>However, we have not that situation at this moment.  Instead of being engaged in the election of a new Taoiseach to form a Government to carry on the affairs of this State, we have this miserable procedure by which the small Coalition groups and the Independents are going to be humiliated publicly.  We all know that if the Independent members and the members of the Labour Party and the other Parties who did not turn up yesterday were asked privately&mdash;and they will say it privately all around the country after this Vote&mdash;they would say that if they had their will they would not impose this tax on the people who want access to the Government.</P>
    <P>Dean Swift said at one time&mdash;I forget the exact words, but the idea <Col N="486" /> was&mdash;that the British Government deprived the Irish people not only of their rights but of their right to protest, to howl, to make themselves heard.  The Coalition groups, with the help of the Independents, did deprive the Irish people of the right to have the Government of their choice&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Opposition Deputies have said that those Deputies who were absent from the division last night were absent because they disapproved of the Estimate, and Deputy MacEntee stated that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, who was in charge of that Estimate, was representing the Government under the theory of collective responsibility.  I would not rise to speak on this occasion but for the fact that I happened to be one of those Deputies who were absent from the division last night and I want to repudiate <i>in toto</i> the statements which were made by several Opposition Deputies that the reason that the absentee Deputies were absent was their opposition to the Estimate and, following that, to the Government.</P>
      <P>I had personal reasons for having to get home last night.  I do not intend to go into those now in the Dáil, but I am proving by my presence here, having left home at 6.30 this morning and travelled almost 120 miles, what my attitude would be to the Estimate last night.</P>

I said I had no intention of going into the personal reasons which compelled me to go home last night, <Col N="487" /> but if I had thought that there was going to be a defeat of the Government, as the <i>Irish Press</i> put it this morning&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Aiken, in the course of his remarks to the House, disclosed to my mind the central idea in the mind of his Party in their approach to every question.  Following his leader who, in effect, told the House that under no circumstances would the Fianna Fáil Party stoop to co-operation, collaboration, or coalition with anybody, Deputy Aiken stood up and naively suggested to the House that the point at issue was to let the Fianna Fáil Party back into office, and he tried to suggest to some of the smaller Parties forming the inter-Party Government that by the abstention they could do so.  That is the mainspring.  That idea of getting back to office is the mainspring of every activity of the Fianna Fáil Party here. That is their policy.  The policy of the Fianna Fáil Party can be summed up in one sentence: &ldquo;Let us back into office.&rdquo; Every other aspect of their enunciated policy is subordinated to that &ldquo;Let us back&rdquo;.  The Deputies of Dáil Éireann will not let the Fianna Fáil Party back into office because the people who sent these Deputies into Dáil Éireann do not want Fianna Fáil back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not grudge the Fianna Fáil Party a tribute for the very efficient Party machine and the very efficient whipping-in of their Deputies which took place last night.  I suggest to the Parties on the Government Benches that we have a great deal to learn from them in that respect.  They have a long political history behind them. They have a long experience in these matters.  They are certainly entitled to a tribute for that.  Do not let them <Col N="488" /> represent, however, the efficiency of that Party machine as enshrining some great democratic principle.  Deputy de Valera, with feigned indignation and heat, talked of democracy.  If we are ever to apply democratic principles, we are applying them this morning when the Deputies elected by the people will register their confidence in the Government.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy MacEntee can be summed up by saying that Deputy MacEntee was Deputy MacEntee.  I think that speaks volumes.  Let me assure the Opposition that the Deputies of our Party who were absent from the Division last night were not absent because of any desire to see the Government defeated and their presence here this morning, as Deputy Timoney has pointed out, is ample proof of that.</P>

On a few occasions this morning I was tempted to draw the attention of the chair to the fact that there were strangers in the House, because there were so many new faces on the Government Benches.  I am glad something has brought them in here.  I am glad to welcome all my country cousins who rushed up from the country during the early hours of this morning and late last night in case they might have to go to the country.  I can well imagine my colleagues, Deputy Keane and Lehane, going down on the one platform with Deputy Seán Dunne and preaching the one programme.  I am sure it would be very enlightening for the farmers in Cork.  It would be worth anything.  In West Cork they dropped 3,000 votes and we lifted 2,500. That was a good thing.

      <P>I am sorry we had to pull poor Deputy Keane back here.  But these things happen.  I oppose this Estimate being put on again to-day because I do not think that half an hour's excited conference last night between the members of a defeated Government <Col N="489" /> is sufficient for the reconsideration of the proposed removal of a fundamental right that the ordinary citizen in this country enjoys by being enabled at any time to write to any Government Department on any matter in which he feels he has a grievance or wants to have his rights considered.  I consider the removal of a fundamental principle of that description&mdash;a fundamental principle that is at least 50 years old&mdash; and a fundamental right of the people wrong.  I do not think that half an hour's excited conference last night between Ministers who came rushing here in boiled shirts and tails is the proper manner in which to deal with that fundamental principle.</P>
      <P>I have a certain amount of sympathy with those unfortunate Deputies who have been whipped-in here to-day to vote for something which must be obnoxious to them.  Some poor Deputies had to come rushing up all the way from Cork, without their usual clothing and in danger of getting pneumonia. I have every sympathy with them.  I can quite understand the anxiety of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and I can quite understand the anxiety of the Ministers.  The removal of this fundamental principle is definitely another sign of the utter laziness that has crept in where Government Deputies are concerned. Deputy Cowan complained of it a few minutes ago.  That laziness has crept in, too, as far as Ministers are concerned. By the removal of this right Ministers will have in future less letters to answer and less work to do for the £2,000 odd that the unfortunate people pay them to do their work.  That is another sample of the laziness.  I can quite understand the anxiety of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance because he gets a great number of those letters from the ordinary farmers making inquiries about drainage&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I can understand the position of the <Col N="490" /> Minister for Agriculture who has a new drainage scheme on hands.  I can quite understand the attitude of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Social Welfare because they undoubtedly would have any amount of queries from the ordinary unemployed in respect of unemployment assistance, saying that they are surely entitled to as much unemployment assistance as is paid by the board of assistance in Cork.  I can quite understand the number of such letters that would come pouring in and the anxiety of Ministers to prevent them coming in.  That is the sole reason behind the removal of this fundamental right of the citizen to communicate with responsible Ministers in every Department.  It is a fundamental right.</P>

This is a matter which should be more carefully considered <Col N="491" /> than is indicated by an excited rush in here this morning.  I certainly consider that the Minister would be wise in putting back his Estimate for a week so that the Government might consider, in their cooler and calmer moments, whether they have been wise in removing this right from the ordinary citizen.  It is a matter that should be considered in a different atmosphere from that which prevailed last night. For their own sake I would appeal to them to give that consideration.  It would be a wiser attitude on their part.</P>

      <P>Might I first clear a personal matter in regard to my absence from the division last night.  It seems to be a peculiarity of certain newspapers always to report what is not true.  I was not in the precincts of the House last night.  I came in here shortly after the division had taken place.  I came in here for the purpose of carrying out my Parliamentary duties.</P>

      <P>I am not too late this morning.  The interesting thing I find about this debate is that we have been given lectures both on morality and on political forms.  We have been given a lecture on the democratic basis of Parliamentary institutions.  It seems to me a peculiar thing that we get these lectures from a Party which, when it was in office, displayed not the least understanding of democracy in this House, which rode rough-shod over its own members and rode rough-shod over the most reasoned appeals made by members of other Parties.  That machine operated efficiently over the members of the Fianna Fáil Party, as it operated efficiently last night.  In opposition they seem to pursue the same course as when they were in office. Deputy Lehane pointed out here to-day that their only concern seems to be to get back into office.  Has it not been made manifest, during the past 14 or 15 months, that there has been no approach to any single question on that side of the House except the approach of how and in what manner a position can be manoeuvred to allow the Fianna Fáil Party to return to office?  Everything <Col N="492" /> else has been subordinated to that one objective.  The working of that machine went to the full extent last night, to the full distance of having Deputies of that Party concealed in most peculiar obscure places so that other people would be misled and in that the machine again worked efficiently.</P>
      <P>Members of the Fianna Fáil Party should realise that politics and democracy are something more than merely the play-acting of political Parties. Those who are members of political Parties are not members merely by accident.  We have certain beliefs and certain hopes when we accept membership of these Parties.  If I want to vote against the Government I shall vote against it but I shall decide in my own good time and for my own good reasons when I shall vote against it. I shall vote even against my own Party if at any time I find that I can no longer support that Party.  I am not going to be influenced by political Party manoeuvres or by the trickery of a political machine into voting for something for which I do not propose to stand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy de Valera talked here of the history of the formation of the inter-Party Government.  We have been over that many times.  I think that on a very early occasion, when we came back to the House after the election, I, personally, speaking after Deputy Lemass had opened the debate, told him what was our position.  It is well that he should remember that the reason that we voted against Fianna Fáil was because we went to the country, as a Labour Party responsible to members of the trade unions in the Labour movement, asking for the right to put Fianna Fáil out of office. We did that for certain specific purposes. Deputy Lemass and Deputy de Valera know as well as I do what these purposes were.  It is not correct to say, as reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> the other day, that when we were threatened with a standstill wage Order by the Leader of the Opposition we were told that it was merely for a limited period.  The specific question was asked, whether if we failed to get an agreement <Col N="493" /> voluntarily between the trade unions and employees, would a standstill Order be operated and no guarantee was given that any effort would be made to keep a fair relationship so far as the working-class people were concerned between the cost of living and wages.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Not only is that true but we were lectured by members of the Fianna Fáil Party in regard to our duties.  We got no concession from Fianna Fáil in regard to the growing gap between wages and the prices except what we were able to force from them.  We started with a complete standstill in wages and nothing else.  It was only when they found that they were starting to dig a hole under their own feet that they showed any disposition to deal with this question and it was then already too late.  Yet they were warned in advance what was going to happen. It was only when there was almost a revolt amongst the working class that we got an amendment of the standstill Order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Just because we have got to associate with Parties with whom frankly everybody knows we are not in complete agreement, we are taunted with not putting ourselves under the direction, the control and the oppression of a Party of whom we had already the experience of seven bitter years.  If there is anything lacking to-day so far as the political development of the country is concerned, there is nobody to blame but the members of the Fianna Fáil Party.  They went into office in 1932 with the support of very many people not only associated with the Republican movement but associated with the Labour movement, the support of many like myself, Deputy Lehane and others.  We had great hopes then and if these hopes do not exist to-day, there is nobody to blame only yourselves because year after year you cast aside these hopes when it suited you and you spurned the very <Col N="494" /> people who hoped to see certain things accomplished.  Nobody expects the Fianna Fáil Party to operate the Labour Party programme.  I did not expect the Fianna Fáil Party to carry out the Labour programme. That is our responsibility but I did expect that when the Fianna Fáil Party were returned in 1932, as an expression of the long-deferred hope of the ordinary people of this country, they would at least carry out their programme on the basis on which they had won the support of the people. The record of those years from 1932, starting with a fair degree of promise and, apparently, holding out further promise up to 1936 and 1937, changed to very bitter fruit in 1938 and reached its culmination in 1939 and 1940.</P>
    <P>As I said, I was not present in the House last night.  I hope I am not disappointing the Fianna Fáil members when I say that I was not present because of any lack of support of the Government or any desire to abstain from voting.  When I say I am going to vote against the Government, I will vote against them; I will not abstain. It must be galling to the Fianna Fáil members, particularly ex-Ministers, that after nearly 18 months the hope of the breaking up of the present association of Parties has not been realised, that their original estimate of three months had to be extended to six months, these six months to 12 months, and the 12 months to two years.  Why do they not give up hoping for that and deal with politics as a real issue?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to serve my apprenticeship and I am learning a great deal from you.  On many occasions in this House I have paid tribute to many of the Fianna Fáil Deputies, particularly Deputy Lemass and those who have been able to approach any question in which I was interested with a constructive mind.  Because I have done that, I am entitled to say that the members of the Fianna Fáil Party who have a serious understanding of political and social problems must at times feel very sick and ashamed, must feel that the way the <Col N="495" /> Party has carried on during the past 16 months was not very edifying or helpful.</P>
      <P>If we are going to deal seriously with these problems, as the Leader of the Opposition suggested to-day, we should realise that we have got here a democratic Parliamentary institution and that those who come in here come in with a certain mandate.  So far as Deputies on this side of the House are concerned, we had one overriding mandate&mdash;to see that there would be a change so far as the Government of the country is concerned.  That change has been justified.  So far as I am concerned, those who entrusted their confidence to me have not expressed any opinion that I did not do what they wanted and that I am not doing what they wanted.  From that point of view, I feel fully satisfied.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that, instead of attempting to try and bring about a change which would be favourable to the Fianna Fáil Party and restore that Party to office, the Fianna Fáil Party might settle down and approach the whole matter from a more serious aspect.  They are the biggest political Party in the country.  They have a contribution to make, but they have failed lamentably to make that contribution. I suggest to them that they would make a greater advance in changing the political relationships in this country if they approached the matter from that angle instead of hoping that, by playing upon various notes in the orchestra, they will create artificial divisions, divisions which do not exist anywhere outside their imagination.  I do not want to touch upon these notes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that the important thing is, not the question of a formal vote, because that formal vote is merely an expression of the support that is already appreciated outside this House, but that we should get back to the proper use of the democratic machine. Those who are lecturing us might put their own house in order.  I might also say that some sentiments expressed elsewhere during the present week by certain members of that Party are not of a kind that will help in building up <Col N="496" /> the prestige of this Parliamentary institution and make the public believe that we in this House do serve some useful purpose.</P>

      <P>I hesitate to obtrude a personal point of view on this House.  But, since my name has been coupled with that of Deputy Larkin in a morning newspaper which pointed out that we were both in this House yesterday and that our names did not appear in the division list, thereby making the clear suggestion that we were in the House and declined to take part in the division, may I say that I was in this House until 12 midnight the night before and that I was here yesterday morning at 10.45.  I was here at the opening of the deabte on the Estimate for Posts and Telegraphs and took part in that debate. After listening to a considerable amount of discussion, I left for home with the permission of my Party for reasons which I think are well understood and appreciated by most Deputies.  I want to make it perfectly clear that I was not in the precincts of the House at the time of the division and that, therefore, I am not one of the individuals referred to as being dragooned into the Government Lobby this morning.  If any impression has been created in the minds of any person in this House or outside it that I was in disagreement with the Estimate of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, I want to say that that impression is entirely erroneous.</P>

The House spent practically all day yesterday approving of the Minister's administration in every respect.  The Minister received many bouquets from many sides of the House including the Fianna Fáil side, but eventually they voted against the Estimate. There was only one minor criticism and that was in reference to the abolition of free postage for every crank.  The Minister made it clear that it was only the abuse of the free postage privilege which he wanted to prevent, and I think it is right that he should do so.  He has assured us that that privilege has been abused and he asks for the co-operation of the House in preventing it.  That is a very fair request.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>All right.  That happened last night.  We did not regard that as significant.  We had to consider the reference back and, having considered the reference back, we decided to reintroduce the Vote, as I said this morning, for the same services and the amount exactly as was provided for before.  If the Deputies opposite thought that the Vote last night was significant the lobbies have been yawning for them since 10.30 and I thought they would speed their way towards the corroboration of what happened last night, but apparently that is not going to happen.  It has been said that we were trying to force through an Estimate against the majority of the House.  That cannot be done, but what we are trying to do, what we are going to do, is to reverse a decision taken in a depleted House last night by a decision taken in a full, or more or less full, House to-day. That, I suggest, is good Parliamentarianism.</P>
      <P>The suggestion of confidence has been brought into the debate by members of the Opposition.  If their views on this matter are as strong as their language there is a way in which they can get a test of confidence, a way quite easily open to them, but I feel that the ebullience that was so strong this morning and that has waned somewhat as the sun has mounted in the heavens will be found, when next Tuesday comes, to be still more tempered by discretion.  But if Deputies want that test there is the easiest possible way for them to get it.  Part of the language used here to-day was to the effect that we had not the confidence of this House.  We propose to test that at once.  It has been said we are here on sufferance.  We propose to test that at once.  We are here as a Government representing the majority of the elected representatives.</P>

A Labour candidate on Party terms was put up and was supported by Fine Gael, Clann na Poblachta, Clann na Talmhan and Independents, everybody except Fianna Fáil.

      <P>Deputy Aiken said that this morning would see the humiliation and rebuff of the Independents and some of the smaller Parties.  On a true, as opposed to a surprise vote, humiliation and further rebuff is going to be the lot of Fianna Fáil.</P>
      <P>Deputy Larkin has so well alluded to this matter that I hesitate even to tread on the ground he has gone over. But with all the talk of democracy and duty, is it not quite clear that all that irks the Opposition at the moment is the lingering bitterness of their deep disappointment over the last election? Disappointment, not democracy.  As Deputy Larkin has said, since the Coalition was formed the whole attempt on that side of the House has been to try to drive wedges of small jealousies and personal animosities against the unity we have at the moment.  That, incidentally, is the unity, not of a swarm dependent on the clutch of the coat tails of a leader, but a unity and cohesiveness dependent on policy.  Our policy has been supported and Deputies, as Deputy Larkin has said, can leave if the policy on any particular matter fails to please them.</P>
      <P>I should like to say one personal thing.  I sat here to-day to hear Deputy MacEntee who had spent years reviling in the way only he is capable of the person who was my leader for many years, the man who was Deputy William Cosgrave and leader of the Executive Council, the man who was to be spat on in the pages of Irish history and counted with Judas, Sadleir and Keogh and the Dermot MacMurroughs, and to-day he appears through the spokesman of the Opposition as the democrat of the country. It is surprising the changes adversity can bring about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Everett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £136,980 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1950, for Salaries and other Expenses in connection with Wireless Broadcasting (No. 45 of 1926), including Public Concerts.</P>
      <P>The amount that will be needed in the Estimate before the House to defray the expenses of wireless broadcasting during the financial year 1949-50 is £204,980.  This is a decrease of £45,730 on the Estimate for the previous year.  The main decrease is in the Estimate for the provision of equipment, which is down by £39,675.</P>
      <P>I shall refer briefly to the changes in the main sub-heads as compared with last year.</P>
      <P>Sub-head A&mdash;Salaries and Wages&mdash; The sum required here is higher by £2,470 than last year.  Actually additional expenditure on the staff sub-head will amount to about £11,000, due principally to the payment of a higher cost-of-living figure as well as to such matters as increments and to the fact that 53 pay-days will come into the financial year.  The extra cost is offset, however, to the extent of about £8,600 by not making provision for certain posts which had been provided for last year for the operation of a short-wave service.</P>
      <P>Sub-head B&mdash;Cost of Daily Programmes&mdash;The estimate in this sub-head, at £61,100, shows an increase of £1,250 over last year.  It is expected that there will be increased expenditure of approximately £9,000, due chiefly to somewhat better provision for certain kinds of programmes and in particular for the variety type of programme.  About £2,900 of an increase will be payable to the copyright societies for the use of gramophone records and of copyright music. This is due to the considerable expansion that has taken place in the number of wireless licence holders.  The copyright payments are based on the number of licences.  As against the increased expenditure in the provision there are decreases amounting to £7,400, due mainly to the absence of provision for artistes for a short-wave service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sub-head C&mdash;Musical Instruments and Music&mdash;The provision of £3,500 is £300 more than that of the previous year.  Last year the provision included a sum of £1,800 for the purchase of pianos.  It was not found possible, however, to obtain the instruments during 1948 and it has been necessary to make provision for them again this year. The provision for the purchase of music is £500 higher than that of last year. Both in regard to musical instruments and music it was, of course, impossible to procure them in any quantity during <Col N="505" /> the war.  The station wants several more pianos to cater for the needs of rehearsals and performances in studios provided away from the G.P.O., such as the Phoenix Hall, and in extra studios being provided in the G.P.O. itself.  It is also desireable to purchase a good deal of music to build up a library which would, in the long run, save on the cost of hiring music.  We had to decide, however, that although all these items are badly needed, we cannot make up in one year for the deficiencies of seven or eight years and that we must procure our needs by degrees.  Some expenditure on items such as pianos must at the same time be looked for in the Estimate for Wireless Broadcasting in each of the coming years.</P>
    <P>In a long-standing arrangement with Phonographic Performance, Limited, the company representing the gramophone record manufacturers, we have been obtaining records for the use of the broadcasting service on loan without payment except for copyright fees. We shall in future have to pay for these records and a sum of £700 has been included in the Estimate this year for the purpose.  We understand that ours is the only broadcasting organisation dealing with Phonographic Performance, Limited, with which this loan arrangement has continued for so long.</P>
    <P>Sub-head D&mdash;Travelling Expenses&mdash; This sub-head at £4,000 shows a reduction of £2,500 on the last Estimate. This is due principally to smaller provision needed for certain allowances and travelling expenses of members of the orchestra.</P>
    <P>Sub-head F&mdash;Plant Equipment, Etc.&mdash; The provision required in this sub-head is £21,215, a decrease of £39,675 on last year's figure.  As will be seen from the details of the sub-head the provision for plant and maintenance of the short-wave station is down by about £48,000, the only sum remaining for that station this year being £1,660, which is required principally for the final payment of the contract figure to the manufacturers for the equipment so far installed. As in the case of musical instruments the station would need a good deal more equipment than has <Col N="506" /> been provided for to make up for the scarcity of war years but here again we are forced to proceed gradually.</P>
    <P>The remaining sub-heads in which the provision is small and shows practically no variation from last year do not call for any special observation except that I should like to refer to a token provision in sub-head I for a radio journal.  This provision was also shown last year and consideration has been given during the year as to the best method to adopt to provide the broadcasting service with a much-needed publicity medium.  The matter has not yet been sufficiently advanced to enable me to give details to the House but I hope that suitable arrangements will be made within the next couple of months.</P>
    <P>The receipts from wireless licence fees during the financial year 1948-49 amounted to £169,000 and from advertising programmes £42,000.  The wireless licence receipts for the current year have been estimated to reach £175,000 and from advertising programmes £43,000.  The total receipts are, therefore, estimated to reach £218,000.  The expenditure estimated in the Broadcasting Vote for the present year is £204,980 and in other Votes for services to be given to broadcasting the amount is £45,606.  The total estimated expenditures on broadcasting for the year is therefore expected to be £250,586 as against receipts of £218,000.  In the receipts no account has been taken of the very considerable amount of work done by broadcasting in its programmes for other Departments.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be interested to know that the number of wireless licences increased in 1948-49 from 195,000 to 272,000 that is by 77,000.  We estimate that about 60,000 of the increase is due to a special country-wide campaign instituted at the end of 1948 to ensure as far as possible that all the people who had sets paid their licence fees. The House will, I am sure, be surprised to learn that nearly one quarter of the possessors of sets had not taken out licences for them when the campaign started.  The licence fee is 12/6 a year or something less than 3d. a week.  One <Col N="507" /> would think that even those people whom we observe writing to the papers to say that they have no use for Radio Éireann would be glad to pay that sum for the privilege of grousing at the station.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>As you have heard from the figures I have given the receipts from licences and advertising programmes do not meet the expenses of broadcasting and we do not think it fair that the burden of the taxpayer should be added to further by people who expect others to pay for their broadcasting entertainment.  We intend, therefore, to keep up the pressure on any who may persist in evading the obligation to pay their wireless licence fee.</P>
      <P>Up to recent times the problem of interference with broadcast reception by electrical apparatus was not very serious but the number of complaints reaching the Department in this matter is now increasing.  This is no doubt due in part to the expansion in the use of electrical equipment but I have the feeling that it has also some connection with the result of the recent drive against licence defaulters. Listeners who had sets without licences were obviously not disposed to draw attention to the fact by making complaints of interference but once they were obliged to meet the licence obligation they were more inclined to become voluble about the quality of reception than the listener who always paid his licence fee.  Whether or not this is part of the cause of the increased volume of complaints of interference it is the fact that the problem is now of greater dimensions than before.  The House will appreciate that the broadcasting service does not itself cause the interference and equally with listeners it has a grievance that such interference is occurring.  Listeners, however, turn to the broadcasting authorities, or more precisely to the Post Office which collects the licence fees, to request relief from their trouble and we are anxious to help them as much as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="508" /> As Deputies may have observed in the Press the British authorities took legislative powers recently to deal with this matter.  I am sure they disliked having to take these compulsory powers and we, too, would much prefer if we could rely on voluntary co-operation to reduce or eliminate interference. Compulsory powers involve the creation of an inspectorial organisation with the right to search for offending apparatus and to institute prosecutions if remedial measures are not applied. Nobody wishes to have to invade the sanctity of the home in that way if it can be avoided.  It will be realised, too, that legislation in itself does not remedy a single source of interference. What it does mean is that interference by electrical apparatus is removed by compulsion instead of by voluntary co-operation.  We would obviously prefer co-operation.  Our engineering officers are at present engaged in the job of improving the organisation for locating apparatus causing interference, and where such apparatus is located we sincerely hope and expect that the owners of it will take steps to have fittings added which will improve matters.  Generally, these fittings are quite inexpensive.  It will be realised that it is sometimes a difficult job to locate the source of interference in an area when I say that such items as domestic electric irons and even electric bed warmers can cause interference over an appreciable area.  The full co-operation of set owners will also be needed.</P>
    <P>When reception is marred by noise, listeners should not assume at once that electrical equipment is causing it and write to the Post Office.  The trouble may be in the set itself or may be due to an ineffective earth or aerial. Listeners should have their sets examined before they complain of interference.  Further, when listeners in a district are pretty sure that some piece of local electric apparatus is causing interference, they can often secure the co-operation of the owner in effecting a remedy without coming to the Post Office.  There is bound to be a time lag in looking into these complaints and naturally priority will be given to those areas in which a number of complaints makes it reasonably <Col N="509" /> certain that the interference is coming from outside sources and is serious.  The Department would be obliged, therefore, if everything possible is done to ensure that complaints are made only when the owner of the set is reasonably sure that everything is in order in connection with the set and that the interference is occurring with his neighbour's reception as well as with his own.</P>
    <P>I should now like to give the House some information of the activities of the broadcasting station during the past year.  The reorganisation of the programme sections to which I referred in the last Estimate has now been firmly established.  The changes in the main took the form of having staff personnel such as actors, producers and script writers, employed permanently in the station instead of engaging persons specially for each production as it took place.  The change to permanent staff has been an undoubted success. In fact, it would have been practically impossible to have carried on broadcasting for much longer under the old system of <i>ad hoc</i> engagements.  These new staff sections have been firmly integrated into the structure of Radio Éireann, and the new officers thoroughly trained in radio techniques.</P>
    <P>Deputies will appreciate that the making of a competent and resourceful radio officer is a relatively long and difficult task, because the type of work they have to do is still unusual, radio being as yet the youngest of the media of mass-communication, if we except television.  Further, we have not in Radio Éireann, as other countries have in their broadcasting organisations, professional school which exist solely to teach newcomers the elements of their craft before they engage in the practice of it.  Again, some of these new sections and appointments represented new sorts of activity, which had not previously been attempted by Radio Éireann; so that it was necessary to establish new routines and methods in connection with them. Such of the new staff as were not already experienced in broadcasting have been given an exact and fruitful training and their contribution to the general improvement of programmes <Col N="510" /> is such as was expected when they were appointed.  On occasions such as the recent Easter programmes, the advantages were manifest of having professional staff constantly available instead of depending on odd job people. The combination of the sacred season, the national celebrations and the holidays, constituted a demand greater, probably, than any single demand formerly made on the broadcasting service.  Almost the entire resources of Radio Éireann had to be thrown into the effort, and the staff were extended to the fullest.  The job was done, but it could not have been done with the type of organisation the station had to depend on up to 1947.</P>
    <P>In 1948 I told you that we had got a recording unit with van for recordings away from the station.  This is a form of activity that Radio Éireann did not engage in previously.  A second recording van was delivered during the year and we now have two groups of officers, each group consisting of an outside broadcasts officer with an engineer&mdash;and sometimes a scriptwriter or descriptive news-writer&mdash;constantly moving about the country in search of programme material of all sorts, from folk songs to news stories. Some of the Deputies will have first-hand knowledge of the work of this section in collecting traditional lore, reporting local and national celebrations, recording talent for the programme heads to judge, and building actuality features about such enterprises as rural electrification, parish guilds, etc.  The coverage given to the '98 celebrations would not have been possible without these vans, nor would the intensive search just begun, for authentic Gaeltacht material to put into the programmes.  I regard the work done in this field as a most important recent development, important for ourselves at home, because it gives a freer public utterance to Irishmen and women throughout the country; and important for the prestige and good relations of the country with its neighbours, because in the course of it we are enabled to assist British, French, Swiss and other broadcasting bodies in reporting Irish life and affairs to their listeners.  Co-operation with <Col N="511" /> foreign broadcasting organisations extends, of course, beyond mere recording work and is an increasingly important aspect of Irish broadcasting.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the station has not the staff, studios or equipment to enable it to co-operate with other countries to the extent which is desirable, but we have given and received assistance to a greater extent than ever before&mdash;studio facilities, use of recording vans, exchanges of programmes, simultaneous broadcasts and so forth.  To me, this seems a very healthy thing and something which we should encourage and promote, by every means, primarily by the strengthening of Radio Éireann's resources. Apart from the opportunities which such activities give to our officers, to compare their work with that of other countries, there are the broader benefits, first of friendly contact between men of one craft but different nationalities and second of interpreting Irish affairs to foreign listeners.  The House will, no doubt, be glad to know that, despite our relatively modest resources of men, money and equipment, we have many times been thanked for our assistance by national and international bodies.</P>
    <P>Since I am speaking of foreign relations, I may remark here that we continued in the past 12 months the policy of engaging eminent foreign conductors, for short periods each, to direct our symphony orchestra.  The orchestra, like other units of Radio Éireann, has strengthened its position and absorbed its new talent to a gratifying extent, and the works played at the twice-weekly concerts in the Phoenix Hall and broadcast to the nation have been of an impressive range, and have, in the opinion of competent critics, received performances of good quality.</P>
    <P>Experiments have been made in the association of the symphony orchestra with choral bodies, such as Cór Radio Éireann, and with the Repertory Company of Players.  The orchestra has also been employed, as in former years, to give young Irish musicians experience in conducting, and to enable them to hear their compositions played by <Col N="512" /> a professional team.  They have also had the benefit of advice from the guest conductors.  In this same sphere of classical music, a series of Saturday chamber music concerts was broadcast and in the series listeners were enabled to hear some of the finest small ensembles that have ever visited Ireland.</P>
    <P>We did not, needless to remark, overlook the fact that a high proportion of the licence-holders demand entertainment of a lighter kind than is provided by classical concerts.  Indeed, it is safe to say that in no previous year was so much attention given to the creation of programmes which would combine comedy, popular music and leading figures in the world of popular entertainment.  So adventurously was this work undertaken that some of the most popular features were temporarily suspended to make room for new, and in some cases more ambitious, projects. The vindication of our confidence was that many of the new programmes have become as favoured as the old ones to which listeners had formed a certain attachment.  There are more light programmes being broadcast this year than ever before, and the fact is, I believe, generally recognised.  To this desirable situation, the new as well as the old sections of Radio Éireann have contributed.  Among these is the light orchestra which, like its companion combination, has settled into the framework satisfactorily.  In addition to the lightening of the programmes, practically every important sports event was broadcast or given special coverage in news reports.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding advances I have referred to in light entertainment, we would like to have further opportunities of catering for the varied tastes of listeners.  Our broadcasting hours are somewhat restricted, so that in evolving new entertainments we are, as I indicated just now, sometimes compelled to &ldquo;rest&rdquo; others which still have a large following.  I should at the same time mention, perhaps, that there are actually more programmes being broadcast in the same number of hours than was the case a year or two ago. Formerly, inadequate staffing and restricted financial resources sometimes <Col N="513" /> made it necessary to spread material over longer periods than the material actually justified.  With increased staff and some improvement in the financial situation, the time is used much more economically, in an artistic sense, and items get no more time than they can competitively secure.  At the same time, broadcasters have been given somewhat improved conditions for their work, including in many instances higher fees, and in certain directions we have found it possible to draw on higher grades of artists and to stimulate new talent more effectively by more numerous and better-rewarded competitions.</P>
    <P>The news service is another section which has been enriched with additional resources, and has profited thereby.  The sources of international news satisfactorily covered and adequately checked have been increased, and this advance and others have made our news bulletins notably efficient.</P>
    <P>I should now like to turn to the broader aspects of broadcasting.  When I brought the last Broadcasting Estimate before the House, I said that one of our main problems was insufficiency and unsuitability of accommodation. The broadcasting studios are situated in a corner of the G.P.O. building, in makeshift studios which were not designed for broadcasting purposes. The space it is occupying is at the same time making most serious inroads on the accommodation needed for its primary purpose of catering for the multifarious post office activities.  A new broadcasting house is an essential thing, but as I mentioned before that must be a long-term solution because of the magnitude of the job and its cost.  To give some relief to broadcasting, however, it has been found necessary to encroach further into the G.P.O. building and plans have been made to provide some small additional studio space there.  This is not, of course, a solution to the broadcasting studio question, but it is the best that can be done for the present.  A second small hall is being provided at Portobello Bridge for the performance of works by the light orchestra and it is <Col N="514" /> hoped that it will shortly be ready for regular broadcasts.</P>
    <P>A further important matter I referred to in my first Estimate was the need for a second programme independent of that radiated from the transmitters at Athlone, Dublin and Cork, in order that we might be in a position broadly to separate the heavier from the lighter type of programme. I said that as well as accommodation this involved wavelengths and money.  Since last year's Estimate, the delegation we sent to the European Broadcasting Conference at Copenhagen returned, having succeeded in obtaining a wavelength additional to the main Athlone wavelength on which a second programme could be transmitted. Though the power authorised for the extra wavelength is less than that for Athlone, the obtaining of a second main wavelength was a distinct achievement, in view of the pressure by the Nations of Europe for wavelength accommodation.  Seven nations declined to sign the Copenhagen Convention and Plan because of dissatisfaction with the wavelengths allotted to them.  There are many complicated technical problems connected with the utilisation of the second wavelength to the best advantage and of course heavy expenditure would be involved in providing a new transmitter or perhaps transmitters and additional staffing organisation.  The difficulty of providing suitable studio accommodation for the needs of a second programme also remains still.  I cannot, therefore, say more on this matter of a second programme than to tell the House that it is our ambition to have such a programme when conditions make it feasible, and that the problem is being examined in all its aspects.</P>
    <P>While these problems, such as accommodation, persist, listeners cannot expect such perfectly produced programmes as it is possible to give from broadcasting organisations which have studios and equipment of the most up-to-date design.  I hope that people who are inclined to complain about the technical quality of our programmes will reflect on the severe handicaps under which the director is operating.</P>
    <P>When I spoke 12 months ago on this <Col N="515" /> Estimate I said that I believed in giving the broadcasting staffs the widest possible measure of freedom to do their job in the way they thought it could best be done.  These officers were selected for their particular posts because of their expert qualifications and it appeared to me that the less interference there was with them in their day-to-day work the better it would be for the broadcasting programmes. I also said that I thought it would be a good thing if talks and discussions were permitted more freely on matters with an element of controversy. I still hold these views.  The broadcasting programme officers have availed themselves of the freedom which I said they should have in their work and many matters of live interest were discussed before the microphone during the year which would have been frowned upon in the past.  Controversial talks cause irritation&mdash;there would be no element of controversy if everybody were satisfied with what had been said&mdash;but I think, on the whole, it is better to risk irritation and have live subjects of discussion than to play entirely for safety at the expense of interest.</P>
    <P>The House will expect me to refer to the question of the shortwave station.  I said last year that we had financial commitments which we considered more important than shortwave broadcasting and that during that year at least it was better to concentrate on trying to improve the lot of our people.  Another important consideration was the availability, for use by the station, of wavelengths which are suitable for the service and are also free from jamming or interference by other radio stations.</P>
    <P>Actually we have wavelengths registered which we are entitled to use immediately, but the international agreement under which they are registered is one that was entered into before the recent world war and at present the actual position of the short-wave broadcasting wavelengths is chaotic.  However, we now have some reasons to believe that we would be able, by making agreements with a few countries, to obtain the use of some <Col N="516" /> reasonably good wavelengths, which might enable us to give a satisfactory service, particularly to North America, between now and 1951, in which year it is hoped that a new and satisfactory world-wide plan will be brought into force.  There are many difficult questions, financial, technical, accommodation and on the programme side, involved in any scheme for short-wave broadcasting.  These are being examined, but no proposals for expenditure this year, other than that required to keep the station in good order, are included in the Estimate.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the new short-wave broadcasting wavelength plan that it is hoped will come into force in 1951.  A world-wide conference to draw up this new plan was held in Mexico City, starting last autumn and finishing some months ago.  I said last year that if the station were still in existence in the autumn of that year, we would send a delegation to this Mexico City Conference.  We did send a representative to Mexico City and he has only recently returned.  An agreement was drawn up there and a plan adopted&mdash; or I should say the basis of a plan. Ireland is included in this basic plan for some wavelength accommodation. The whole plan has highly technical considerations but I shall try to explained the position to the House in the layman's language in which it was explained to me.  The same set of wavelengths is not suitable for broadcasting from a station to a particular world area for the whole year and the requirements also differ from year to year. This is because of the effect of sun-spot activity on wireless waves.  The basic plan gave to the various countries a certain number of channels in which to broadcast during stated hours to the various points and it also fixed the frequencies suitable for one particular period.</P>
    <P>To complete the plan it will be necessary to allot frequencies which will be suitable for five other periods up to 1952.  This task will be undertaken by a committee in Paris and the allocation for a complete plan will come before the World Shortwave Conference fixed for Italy in October, 1949.  No country is bound by the <Col N="517" /> basic plan until a complete plan has been formulated and accepted.  I should say here that while the basic plan and agreement were signed on behalf of 50 nations at the Mexico City Conference the United States and the U.S.S.R. were among the 18 nations which did not sign.  It is not expected that the Mexico City plan, if completed and approved in Italy, can come into operation until about the middle of 1951.</P>
    <P>In view of the developments since this time last year it has recently been decided to begin short-wave broadcast transmissions to the U.S.A. and Canada as soon as it is practicable to do so.  For a beginning it will be possible only to provide a short programme daily consisting mainly of news and news talks.  It is not possible to say at this stage when these transmissions will begin but it is hoped it will be in a few months' time.  Nothing beyond this purely emergency type of programme of short duration can be undertaken until the service has got equipment, studio accommodation and staff organisation of a kind essential for modern broadcasting.  It will probably be necessary to introduce a Supplementary Estimate to cover the expenditure to be incurred during the present financial year because, as I said already, the only money for the short-wave station provided in this Estimate is a small sum sufficient to keep the station in good order.</P>
    <P>Before I close I wish to thank the members of the Broadcasting Advisory Committee for the work they are doing for broadcasting in coming in a voluntary capacity to the station for monthly meetings&mdash;as well as for sub-committee meetings in between&mdash;to give the service the benefit of their cultural, educational and entertainment experience, in suggesting policy for programmes. I also would like to express my appreciation of the work of the director and his staff.  Only a person in official touch with Radio Éireann can realise the day-to-day problems that confront the staff of a small broadcasting organisation with restricted resources. The programme must start over the air on level terms with those of the best equipped stations, as listeners <Col N="518" /> obviously have no opportunity or disposition to go behind the microphone to see the circumstances in which a particular programme has to be provided. To the listener the programme is just good or poor, and the conditions which produce the result are no real concern of his.  That many of the Radio Éireann programmes are placed in the good category is due in no small part to the diligence of the director and the programme staffs in making the best of moderate resources.  I thank them for their untiring work during the year.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Estimate be referred back.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the principle which was in operation formerly that as much freedom as possible should be given to those who are carrying on the work of the radio.  That does not mean that there should not be criticism when the radio is used for political purposes.  I have had several complaints from various people through the year of the use which has been made of the radio for political purposes and, in particular, for advertising the wares, if you like to put it that way, of certain Ministers, particularly the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  Apparently, at one period, every move he made and every time he appeared here, there and everywhere, he was picked out specially for broadcasts. There were complaints also that in regard to debates and so on the whole atmosphere was one-sided.  Perhaps the most remarkable thing was that last night on the radio there was not a word about the division that took place in this House.  The Minister cannot get away on the ground that that was a freedom which should be exercised and that it is a kind of criticism which should not be made.  It was a single fact and could easily have been broadcast within the time.</P>

      <P>It is a source of great satisfaction to us to know that the staff are now carrying on vigorously the development of the short-wave station.  The great regret is that there ever should have been any interruption in the work on that matter.  It was sheer national sabotage.  The reactions all over the world of the Irish race, which conveyed themselves through the medium of people in all parts of Ireland, were so strong as ultimately to have the effect of bringing the Government to their senses and the work has been taken on again.  It is very reassuring to know that the services of our very expert negotiators have been effective, in what I know to be a very difficult international situation, both in Mexico with regard to the short-wave and in <Col N="520" /> Copenhagen with regard to the second wavelength.</P>

      <P>The only thing is that I do hope that when it is brought into force it will not be used for political purposes, that when the news is sent out it will be rigidly of a national nature and will not in any sense be used for any political purpose.  It is a poor commentary on what might be done with a news service if we are to judge by some of the things that have happened in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The development of the short-wave station and of the second wave length brings us to the question of proper premises.  The present position is absolutely absurd both from the point of view of the post office and of radio.  It is absurd to have all these people cribbed, cabined and confined in the top of the General Post Office in premises which should properly be used for the post office.  It is doing a lot of damage to the post office as well as to the station.  On the other hand, it is extraordinary how the staff is able to carry on in the space they have there.  The premises at Ardmore, where there is a considerable amount of ground around a fine big house as a centre, were purchased a number of years ago for a station.  That was done after the Government of the time had seen our experts from the architectural and broadcasting points of view.  An architect and an engineer were sent to Northern Europe to see all the good stations there.  Our plans were to go ahead as soon as we could with the building of a station with proper studios in the Ardmore premises on the Stillorgan Road.  That project has been held up.  It was part of the sabotage policy of the present Government when they shut down on that and shut down on the concert hall, which would have provided ample space for conferences and a magnificent concert hall which would put us on the map in the place that a civilised Irish nation should take in all these matters.  These things are in abeyance.  Perhaps if we are sufficiently vocal in making a row about them, we may induce the members of the Government who have <Col N="521" /> wider views on these things, who realise the significance of our place amongst the nations, to bring about a change of attitude on the part of the Government.</P>
    <P>Again I want to emphasis what I said on the Vote for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, that the excuse that first attention must be paid to housing and that the housing of the poor prevents us from doing anything else, is an old excuse that has been used since the Government came in.  Housing should not interfere with the development of a service which is no mere luxury.  Upon this service depends the building up of our cultural activities.  The radio should be a reflection of the very best in our cultural traditions and our ability to enlarge and improve our cultural capacities.  It is the shop window to the world but, above all, it is the closest link we can have with the Irish race all over the world.  In many places from Boston to Glasgow you find people cherishing our songs and céilidhe dances with even greater intensity than we do at home.  One of the closest bonds we have is the cultural bond and it is no mere luxury to develop that.  Also, it is the best means we have of increasing our tourist traffic, which is the biggest export commodity we have.  It is dollar earning and it is bigger than the cattle trade that we hear so much talk about.</P>

      <P>We should concentrate on it as one of the things that are essention to the nation.  There are people who complain that the standards that have been set in our classical concerts were too high, that we were too severe in the selection.  The one thing that could kill us would be mediocrity, simply turning the station into a sort of outdoor relief.  We must, if we go in for that at all, go in for a standard that will be respected by all the nations <Col N="522" /> and we must insist upon examinations which will get those standards.</P>
      <P>There was a question asked the other day about bringing in foreign conductors. We cannot hope to build up that standard immediately amongst our own conductors.  I do believe that if we get a little time&mdash;it will take some years&mdash;we shall get as good conductors and composers as there are to be got anywhere else.  There is a statue of a man in Leinster Lawn who was the founder, not merely of Irish music but of British music, Sir Robert Stewart, the man who taught this generation in England both composition and conducting. We have it in us to do that sort of thing again but, until we have created the atmosphere by bringing in foreigners, we cannot expect to build the greatness which is in us and always has been as a musical country.</P>

      <P>We have not persons of that quality at present and we must bring in people from outside to train our younger generation, to accustom them to the very best, and in due time they will come along.  It is not through any lack of searching in this country for composers or conductors that we have not got them.  Everyone who wanted a chance had a fair trial on the radio.  That is still being done and I hope it will continue, because we do want to build up our own people into first-class musicians.  But, apart from that, there will always be a certain amount of interchange, because you will get men of world reputation, such as Toscanini and John Barbirolli and people of that type, who will have the effect of stimulating home talent.  I believe the ambition we have is still in the radio station, and that ambition is to build up a real profession of first class musicians.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>No, we are not.  The door is open for talented Irishmen all the time, but they must come up and there must be no excuse for bad playing or mediocrity.  The Minister recently gave an interview to the Press in which he referred to educational programmes.  I wish he told us about these in his opening statement, because there is no doubt that there is a tremendous amount to be done in that direction.  I do not know how far he has got the Department of Education to co-operate in establishing a certain high standard of Irish for all the schools.  It was a matter we were very keen and enthusiastic about, because we believed it would help to create a standard language for the country if you had first-class Irish teachers broadcasting from a headquarters to all the schools in Ireland.  It would allow for a uniform pronunciation of the national language while it would not interfere with the different dialects.  It is a difficult subject and one about which people can get cross&mdash;that is, the merits of the various dialects.  Our aim was to do for Ireland what is being done in Germany through a standard language, Buehnesprache, which happens to be the State language.  Over large portions of Germany with different dialects they have one language which everybody speaks.</P>
      <P>The Minister then mentioned about other educational programmes and about persons getting educated over the radio.  That is a very important item and it should be given attention&mdash; to give people who have no opportunity of going to schools and universities a chance of getting the best there is, especially from the Irish point of view.</P>
      <P>I asked a question about using the short wave for radio telegraph and telephone work.  I suggest that the Department should examine that further.  I was informed by a man with considerable experience abroad that there is a good deal of money in radio telegraph and telephone work and it would be very valuable, especially if we are trying to knit up our associations with our people in America and elsewhere and give them an opportunity of closer communication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have seen from the increase in our mail service, because of the introduction <Col N="524" /> of the air mail, what a desperate mistake we made in not having our own air service to America, where we would have a channel of communication that does not spread out over Europe until it reaches the Shannon.  We should do everything in our power to develop this aspect in order to have closer communications with our people, especially in the United States, but it can also be done elsewhere.  However, I bow to the expert knowledge and energy of our engineers in the Department.  I merely ask them to give serious attention to the matter and see if it would not be possible to develop this branch, even if it means considerable expense.</P>
    <P>I wonder how the agricultural topics are going on the radio and whether you have been able to develop them. I know the difficulties that are there. It is difficult to get a farmer who is a good broadcaster and good broadcasters are generally not farmers.  This matter, however, should receive care and attention.  Some of the broadcasts were excellent and they should be developed.</P>
    <P>With regard to the interference that has been complained of, has it occurred to the Department that the co-operation of the Electricity Supply Board should be obtained?  When they are putting in various gadgets, such as heaters and cookers, they should insist upon apparatus being put in which will prevent interference.  The Minister said it was not costly and in those circumstances I do not think anybody would object if the Electricity Supply Board explained that the Government required that these things should be installed.  Very often it is impossible to know whether you are interfering with anybody else or not.  People will not think of putting these things in and then when coercion has to be used they resent it.  For that reason I suggest the co-operation of the Electricity Supply Board should be sought.  It is a very trying thing to purchase an expensive radio and then find that because of interference it is of little use.</P>
    <P>There was an area in Wexford where there was always a considerable <Col N="525" /> amount of trouble.  The late Deputy Corish used to refer to it.  I do not know whether the Wexford situation has been cured.  I think it was due largely to a geographical configuration or something of that sort.  Perhaps the Minister will be able to tell us about it.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see there is a considerable profit this year.  I think the figures show that the expenditure was £218,000 and the revenue was £250,000, and that did not include the value of services given to other Departments. This, again, raises a question similar to the one I raised on the Vote for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. There is not a clear picture, and it must amount to a big figure, which would help to increase the profits.  We always seem to have controversy with the Department of Finance as to whether we were entitled to the customs duty on imported sets. When the then Minister for Finance imposed a tax on imported sets he said the money would be devoted to the radio.  It was an outstanding book-keeping quarrel with the Department of Finance.  I always found it desirable to mention that there is that money constantly coming in and it should be taken into consideration. The reason I do that is because the work of the broadcasting station is so tremendously important that it should have as much scope as is reasonable of spending as much money as possible. The primary consideration should not be one of expense but rather the service that is given to the nation as a whole.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any other matter that I want to raise.  I do not think there is any reason to feel discouraged at the way in which the Department is carrying out all the plans which were laid originally.  The only plea I would make is that the Minister should adopt as vigorous an attitude as possible in getting the radio station, particularly the short-wave station, into operation as rapidly as possible.</P>

      <P>Dhféadfaí a lán a dhéanamh ar son na Gaeilge tríd an radio.  Is dóigh liom go bhfuil an caighdeán i labhairt na Gaeilge ar an radio chomh-tábhachtach beagnach leis an méid den Ghaeilge a labhartar ann agus an méid ama a tugtar di.  Ba chóir go mbeadh labhairt na Gaeilge go soiléir, blasta, cruinn agus furust le tuiscint chun go bhfuighidh an lucht éisteachta taithneamh aisti.  I gcúrsaí oideachais agus i gcúrsaí na teangan, cuirtear spéis faoi leith sna fuaimenna agus san fóghraíocht, mar is cheart.  Ba chóir dúinn aire faoi leith a thabhairt don taobh seo den obair mar gheall ar an lucht éisteachta, chun go gcloisfidh an t-aos óg an Ghaeilge is fearr agus go bhfeabhsóchaidh siad a gcuid Ghaeilge féin.</P>
      <P>Ansin, mar gheall ar an méid Ghaeilge a fógraítear ar an radio, ba chóir na fógraí ar fad, más féidir, a chur amach sa Ghaeilge agus rudaí tábhachtacha a cuirtear amach tríd an mBéarla faoi láthair a fhoillsiú sa Ghaeilge anois agus arís.  Chím go ndéantear na rudaí is tábhachtaí dar leis an Rialtas d'fhoillsiú tríd an mBéarla agus, uaireannta, ní tugtar amach ach na rudaí is lua tábhacht sa Ghaeilge. D'fhéadfaí eachtra agus cúrsaí na Roinne Gnóthaí Eachtranacha d'fhógairt trí Ghaeilge, cur i gcás, chómh maith le Béarla.  Is ionadh liom go mbeadhmáid sásta an dara háit a thabhairt don Ghaeilge faoi Phoblacht na hEireann.  Ní fheicim aon athrú ó thaobh dlí.  An bhfuilmíd le tuiscint go bhfuilimíd ag glacadh le Poblacht, ní amháin go bhfuil cuid di scaraithe amach uainn, ach gan aon teanga náisiúnta a bheith aici?</P>

    <P>Ba chóir drámaí agus claisceadail ón dtuath a chur ar an radio níos minice le taispeáint do mhuintir na tuaithe go bhféadfaí rudaí a bhaineas leo féin agus atá go dúchasach a craobhscaoileadh. Ní bheidh an caighdeán chómh <Col N="527" /> hárd b'fhéidir agus atá sé sna bailte, ach, i dtíortha eile, déantar iarracht chun cúrsaí na tuaithe a chur ar an radio agus suim na ndaoine i gcoitinne a mhúscailt sna cúrsaí sin.  Ba chóir fuireann aisteoirí, lán nó páirt aimsire, bheith ann, is dóigh liom.  Tá cainteoirí oilte ag teastáil gan aimhreas agus daoine le guthanna maithe acu. Is dócha gur deachair daoine le Gaeilge mhaith agus guthanna maithe d'fháil don radio, ach creidim féin go gcaithfidh go bhfuil a lán de sna céimithe óga ón Ollscoil ann agus daoine eile mar iad go bhfuil árd oideachas orthú atá i ndon ní amháin an Ghaeilge a labhairt go maith ach cur síos tuisceannach suimiúl a dhéanamh ar chúrsaí tríd an Ghaeilge.</P>
    <P>Ba chóir drámaí maithe a craobhscaoileadh uair sa tseachtain agus, mura bhfuil na drámaí ann cheanna féin a bheadh oiriúnach, d'fhéadfaí an tán nó cuid de shean-scéalta eile na hEireann, nó cúrsaí staire na hEireann, a dhéanamh i bhfuirm drámaí. D'fhéadfaí na leabhra is fearr atá againn sa Ghaeilge a craobhscaoileadh freisin trí agallaimh agus drámaíocht, cur i gcás, leabhra Shean-Phádraic Uí Chonaire agus Shéamais agus Seosaimh Mac Grianna.  Ní leor na piosaí Gaeilge a léamh amach&mdash;caithfear iad a thabhairt do dhaoine óga cáillithe a bheadh i ndon scripts maithe a dhéanamh díobh ionus go mbeadh beócht agus taithneamh ionta ar an radio.</P>
    <P>Ba chóir Trath na gCeist a dhéanamh sa Ghaeilge chómh maith le sa Bhéarla, ní amháin faoin dtuath ach sna cathracha agus sna bailte móra, chun na daoine óga a chuireas suim sa Ghaeilge a ghríosú agus a spreagadh san obair. Tá mé cinnte go bhféadfadh an radio a lán cúnaimh d'fháil chun é sin a dhéanamh ó na múinteóirí óga agus ó na céimithe óga ar fud na tíre.  D'fhéadfaí an pobal a dhéanamh páirteach in obair na Gaeilge ar an radio sa tslí sin agus ba mhór an dul chun cinn é don Ghaeilge féin.  Má chíonn na daoine go bhfuil suim ag lucht an radio, ag na hAirí agus ag lucht an Rialtais sa Ghaeilge, is dóigh liom go mbeidh suim ag an bpobal inti dá réir, agus má fheiceann siad nach bhfuil an <Col N="528" /> Ghaeilge ar an radio ach sa dára háit i gcónaí, ní féidir leis an bpobal bheith muiníneach go bhfuil an Rialtas agus an tAire i ndáirire faoin Ghaeilge a chur chun chinn.  D'fhéadfaí diospóireachtaí agus cúrsaí an lae a chraobhscaoileadh trí Ghaeilge freisin agus rudaí a bhaineas le saol na tuatha, mar a dúirt mé, a chuireadh muintir an cheanntair atá i gceist, suim faoi leith iontu.</P>
    <P>Mar gheall ar na cuirmeacha ceoil, is trua liom gur cuireadh deireadh leis na cuirmeacha ceoil poiblí.  Ba chóir cláir na cuirmeacha ceoil do craobhscaoileadh agus d'fhoillsiú in sna páipéirí roimh ré, más féidir, agus bollscaireacht i bhfad níos fearr a dhéanamh faoi na cuspóirí atá i gceist ar an radio a chur in eolas do na daoine agus innseacht dóibh faoi na pleannana agus na cláir nua atá i gceist.</P>
    <P>D'fhéadfaí bollscaireacht a dhéanamh faoi cúrsaí cuairteóireachta, áilneacht na tíre, stair ár dtíre agus na cúrsaí a bhaineas leis an tír a chuirfeadh cuairteóirí spéis ionta de ghnáth.</P>

      <P>I want to congratulate the Minister on his statement.  He has adopted a practical and progressive attitude towards this section of the Department.  I consider that the references made by the late Minister, Deputy Little, were scandalous in so far as they suggested that the wireless is being used for political purposes. That suggestion probably arises from the fact that Deputy Little knows that the news items at present refer to many schemes of a progressive nature which have been announced over the radio. During his term of office there were not so many schemes of this character to be announced and we can appreciate the jealousy which he now displays and the attitude which he adopts towards such announcements.  I can understand why he tried to describe these announcements as being political.</P>
