      <NameTxt>Mr. P.D. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare whether he will state (a) the value of all the benefits paid by his Department during the last 12 months to persons resident in (i) rural areas, and (ii) urban areas; and (b) the amounts paid in national health allowances to (i) agricultural workers, and (ii) other workers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The records kept in the Department of Social Welfare do not permit of an accurate ascertainment of the value of all the benefits paid to persons resident in (i) rural and (ii) urban areas.  In the case of some benefits certain information is available which enables an approximate division of the total amount paid to be made.  In the case of other benefits it has been necessary to assume that the amounts paid in rural and urban areas are in proportion to the number of insured persons in each area.</P>
      <P>With these reservations, the following table which, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to have circulated in the Official Report, shows the estimated amounts paid in the year ending 31st March, 1949, in respect of the various benefits:&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Pádraig Ó Cuinneáin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will state whether forms relating to unemployment assistance, national health and unemployment insurance are being issued in English in Gaeltacht areas; and, if so, whether he will undertake to have this practice discontinued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Unless English forms are expressly requested, Irish forms are used in the case of residents in the Fíor- or Breac-Ghaeltacht who attend at employment exchanges or branch employment offices for the purpose of applying for qualification certificates or for unemployment assistance under the Unemployment Assistance Acts.  Persons making application by post are, in order to save time, supplied with Irish and English forms, for use at their own choice, unless they communicate with the local office in Irish when only Irish forms are supplied.  Irish forms are used throughout where application is made in Irish.</P>
      <P>The same progress in the provision of forms in Irish has not been made in the case of unemployment insurance and it is not intended to alter this position now in advance of the changes which proposals in respect of social insurance will involve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Forms of application for membership and national health insurance cards printed in the Irish language are available for the use of the agents of Cumann an Árachais Náisiúnta ar <Col N="863" /> Shláinte operating in Gaeltacht areas. Forms for the purpose of drawing benefit are being revised and it is hoped at an early date to have a supply printed in Irish and distributed to the agents in the Gaeltacht for the use of members in these areas.</P>

The improvement works for Portaleen mentioned in my reply to the Deputy on 23rd February, 1949, have been discussed with officials of the Donegal County Council and representatives of the local fishermen, and as a result a recommendation has been made by my Department that provision for a State grant towards the outlay involved be made in the Estimates for 1950-51, provided the county council also contributes.</P>
      <P>I must, however, remind the Deputy of the contents of the answer to a similar question he put on February 23rd, 1949, when it was pointed out that full provision for safety is not practical at this place, and the present proposed works, while improving amenities, cannot be depended upon to remove risks in exceptionally rough weather.</P>

      <P>Capital investment in Ireland is considerably in excess of current savings and entails substantial liquidation of sterling investments, as shown by the deficit in the balance of payments.  The realisation of sterling assets in 1947 is estimated at £30,000,000 and in 1948 at £20,000,000. Borrowing from the United States Government, which in itself reduces our net external assets, amounted to $51,034,644, equivalent to £18,234,800 at the present rate of exchange, at 30th September last.  Capital expenditure by the State and local authorities has contributed largely to the realisation of external assets and is on the increase.</P>

      <P>The question of branch railway lines was debated at some length on the Second Stage of the Transport Bill, 1949.  I indicated in reply to the debate that I intended to introduce an amendment for the establishment of a transport tribunal, one of whose functions would be concerned with branch railway lines. Pending further consideration of the matter during subsequent stages of the Bill I do not propose to ask Córas Iompair Éireann to take any action in regard to the line mentioned by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government whether he is aware that purchasers of houses which are eligible (a) for a grant under the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1948, and (b) for the remission of stamp duty, are in grave financial difficulties due to the fact that these concessions are taken into account to the detriment of the purchaser when the valuation for purposes of the loan is being determined and, if so, whether he will re-examine the position with a view to having this difficulty removed.</P>

      <P>I understand that some housing authorities take the view that loans under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts should not include provision in respect of the items mentioned <Col N="885" /> by the Deputy.  This view is presumably based on the grounds that as the State has already given a free grant, or concessions in respect of stamp duty, it would be a duplication of financial assistance from public sources if the local housing authority were compelled, at the same time, to grant a loan including the State subsidy or any concession in respect of stamp duty.</P>

      <P>The original scheme for the conversion of the former Hibernian Military School premises in the Phoenix Park, Dublin, into a tuberculosis institution envisaged the provision of accommodation of a permanent nature for 388 patients and staff. The publicity measures instituted by my Department during the past year or so have been designed to make known fully to the general public the facilities being made available by health authorities for free treatment for tuberculosis and have had the expected result of a substantial increase in the number of patients desiring to avail themselves of institutional treatment. This has been particularly noticeable in the Dublin area and I consequently decided some months ago that it was essential that additional accommodation should be provided at St. Mary's Chest Hospital to relieve the waiting list position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This increased accommodation, which will amount to approximately 250 beds, is being made available by the <Col N="895" /> adaptation of a number of Army huts on the site and by the conversion of a swimming pool and gymnasium into temporary use for the patients.  At the moment, the permanent part of the institution has been completed to the extent of 308 beds, and the temporary part to the extent of 120, so that the total capacity of the hospital to date is 428 beds of which 396 are occupied.  I am exerting every possible pressure upon Dublin Corporation to have patients admitted to the 30 or so beds that are vacant at present and to take steps to ensure that, as the scheme of expansion of the hospital progresses, beds will be occupied as soon as they become available until the ultimate bed complement of 636 is reached.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Blowick)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="897" /> This Bill covers several matters which have an important bearing on the progress of land settlement.  First of all, there is the question of the price of acquired land.  Some months ago, when we were discussing a Private Land Bill, I told the House that the Government fully agreed with the principle of paying market value for acquired land. Section 5 of this Land Bill covers this very point.  Deputies will recall that much criticism was aimed at the divergent statutory provisions which have regulated the fixing of prices for land taken over by the Land Commission&mdash; from fee-simple owners on the one hand and from tenants on the other hand.  In the case of tenants, the Land Commission have been always obliged to fix compensation at the market value.  But in the case of owners, the law says that, in fixing the price.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;regard shall be had to the fair value of the land to the owner and the Land Commission respectively&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This existing statutory basis for fixing the price of land acquired from owners has been operated by the Land Commission with the fullest possible sympathy towards owners.  Indeed, only a very small number of cases of serious dissatisfaction with prices fixed by the Land Commission has arisen during the entire period since 1923. But the fact remains that the statutes have expressly conceded &ldquo;market value&rdquo; in the case of tenants and have not, heretofore, conceded it in the case of owners, and this distinction is a fertile ground for the growth of a sense of grievance.  Section 5 of this Bill proposes &ldquo;market value&rdquo; for owners, with the object of removing this sense of grievance.</P>
    <P>Section 7 of the Bill proposes the removal of another cause of grievance and dissatisfaction to owners of land acquired by the Land Commission. Under present law, they are obliged to redeem any purchase annuities on acquired land.  This requirement occasionally makes a big hole in a purchase money.  Tenants whose land is resumed have not to redeem purchase annuities and this further distinction between tenants and owners under the existing law has led to additional criticism and grievance.  Section 7 of <Col N="898" /> the Bill proposes to put an end to this trouble.</P>
    <P>In short, Sections 5 and 7, coupled with the existing Acts, will place owners and tenants whose lands must necessarily be taken over in the interests of the country in the very same position as regards compensation and will guarantee to both classes a just price based on market value.</P>
    <P>Until these new provisions come into operation there may possibly be some delay in price fixation by the Land Commission.  I trust that the Bill will be enacted as quickly as possible, so that any inevitable delay will be short and that the Land Commission's programme will not be disrupted.</P>
    <P>The next important matter in the Bill is the reorganisation of the Land Commission.  As Deputies are well aware, the commission is charged with difficult and contentious responsibilities. It cannot avoid disturbing the interests of certain landowners.  Then it is faced with so many applications for allotments and improvements, etc, that only a small percentage can be satisfied.  In fulfilling its responsibilities, the commission must inevitably reject or fail to satisfy many applicants; and it is no wonder that its operations give rise to so many criticisms and complaints.  I have had considerable experience of the Land Commission's activities from within and without the Department.  The more experience I have gained the more I am convinced that the Departmental structure generally, with its complementary responsibilities of Minister and Land Commission, respectively, is the best type of organisation that can be set up for the work that to be performed.</P>
    <P>As a result of many year's operations under the Land Acts, the Land Commission have dealt with the greater part of the land of the country but there still remain some 100,000 holdings and allotments to be vested.  Approximately two-thirds of these are relatively straightforward and these straightforward cases are being cleared at present at the rate of 14,000 holdings a year.  The remaining cases are much more difficult; they comprise about 30,000 holdings of congests awaiting rearrangement, enlargement or improvement <Col N="899" /> by the Land Commission before they can be vested in the tenants.  The vesting of the straightforward cases will take several years' hard work to accomplish.  The more difficult work on the 30,000 congests' holdings will naturally be even more tedious.  It is my aim as Minister to press on with the relief of this acute congestion as quickly as the resources of the State will permit.  These genuine congests will not be neglected, but all possible action will be taken by way of land settlement schemes and other measures to improve their lot.</P>
    <P>I need scarcely remind the House that since 1933 the Minister for Lands appears to have had a statutory control, in so far as he should think proper to exercise such control, in respect of the Land Commission's operations and decisions in all matters apart from the excepted matters specifically laid down in Section 6 of the Land Act, 1933.  The excepted matters under that Act were confined to transactions impinging on the acquisition and allotment of land.  The commissioners, in deciding whose land will be acquired, or who will be allotted land, or what price must be paid, or whether a particular landholder has worked his land properly, have remained completely independent of the Minister.  These are very improtant functions which should in the public interest be divorced from the domain of everyday politics.  The Government has no desire to restrict or curtail the independence of the commissioners in those and other analogous matters.  In fact, the opposite is the case, as Deputies can see from Section 10 of the Bill which proposes to extend the commissioners' independent authority to several land-purchase matters which, heretofore, appear to have been within the statutory control of the Minister for Lands, in so far as he thought proper to exercise such control.</P>
    <P>There is just one exception, and that arises out of the practical difficulties and inescapable delays associated with the rearrangement of rundale holdings under present methods. Experience has shown, and Deputies will not need to be told, that the success <Col N="900" /> of rearrangement schemes for such holdings depends upon the speedy implementation of the schemes after the tenants have accepted the proposals in general form.  This result can best be achieved by entrusting the conclusion of the details of the rearrangement schemes on the spot to the local senior inspector of the Land Commission.  This would necessitate the exclusion of these rearrangement schemes from the excepted matters prescribed in the Land Act, 1933, and this exclusion is proposed in Section 10.  For these rearrangement schemes, however, the commissioners would, as at present, first fix the general outline of each scheme by sanctioning the money to be spent on improvement works and by determining the total purchase money to be charged for the new holdings.</P>
    <P>Experience has also shown up another defect in the provisions of the Land Act, 1933, governing the relationship between the Minister and lay commissioners.  Sub-section (2) of Section 6 of that Act obviously set out to give the Minister for Lands such full authority and responsibility in all non-excepted matters as he wished to have and to exercise in respect of them but it failed, in its operation, to attain that objective.  All the Land Act, 1933, achieved in this respect was to give the Minister for Lands a power of direction and veto over the lay commissioners in non-excepted matters. The statutory functions under the Land Acts remained vested in the lay commissioners and the Minister himself could perform none of them, whether important or trivial, except through the agency of the lay commissioners. While the Act obviously was intended to give the Minister such responsibility and control as he wished to have and to exercise in all non-excepted matters, it omitted to give him the power of direct action.  This strange position appears to have resulted through inadvertence. The present Bill sets out to correct this defect in the Land Act, 1933, by giving the Minister power to perform functions in non-execepted matters, in his own right&mdash;if necessary through the agency of the permanent officials of his Department who are <Col N="901" /> answerable to him, and for whom he will have to answer on all occasions to this House.</P>
    <P>Since 1934, the Land Commission has consisted of a High Court judge (known as the Judicial Commissioner) and six lay commissioners.  The present volume of work does not justify that number of lay commissioners and four would be quite sufficient if appeals were left for decision to a tribunal consisting of the judge, alone, as was the position for many years prior to 1934.  Since that year, appeals have been heard and decided by an appeal tribunal which consists of the Judicial Commissioner and two lay commissioners, but the number of appeals etc. has declined very much since the appeal tribunal was originally set up.  For the years from 1934 to 1938 the number of appeals and applications to the tribunal averaged 470 a year but the corresponding figure for the last four years was only about 47 a year&mdash;representing a reduction of 90 per cent.  This very serious decline in the volume of work of the appeal tribunal has raised the question of the performance of alternative functions by the lay commissioners nominated to the appeal tribunal but no satisfactory solution can be found except by making it possible for these lay commissioners to engage in the ordinary appealable functions of the commission.  To make the position quite clear, I should explain that appeals can legally be taken to the appeal tribunal by aggrieved parties in almost all important land-purchase matters but naturally enough the number of appeals taken is limited.  While the right of appeal remains, the lay commissioners nominated to the appeal tribunal cannot touch any of these appealable matters unless and until an appeal arises.  This very fact debars them at present from most of the day-to-day work of the commission and the only feasible solution is to withdraw the two lay commissioners from the appeal tribunal so that they can deal with the ordinary work.  Section 12 of the Bill makes provision accordingly.</P>
    <P>The present opportunity is also taken of prescribing retiring ages of lay commissioners, as this has not been done heretofore.  It is proposed to <Col N="902" /> suppress the posts of two lay commissioners who have passed 71 years of age, and compensation will be payable in these two cases.  The other four lay commissioners will retire at 72 years of age, which is the retiring age for Circuit Court judges appointed before 1947, but future lay commissioners will retire at 65 years of age in conformity with general Civil Service practice.  It is also proposed to fix the maximum number of lay commissioners for the future at four.</P>
    <P>The remaining sections of the Bill deal with minor aspects of land law and land settlement operations, and for convenience they can be subdivided into two groups.</P>
    <P>The first group consists of six sections which propose additional powers for the Land Commission.  These powers are necessary to overcome difficulties which have arisen.  Among these sections is Section 23 which proposes that the Land Commission be empowered to buy land which may come on the market for sale by auction or private treaty.  The ordinary processes of acquisition, resumption, and purchase for Land Bonds, which have been in force during the past 25 years, will still continue in full operation, but under these procedures it is almost impossible to get holdings of convenient size which are equipped with dwellings, outoffices, fences, pumps and so on, and which are ready for immediate allotment as new holdings. At present the erection of buildings takes a very considerable time and involves very heavy expenditure.  I am confident that judicious use by the Land Commission of the power proposed in Section 23 would lead to the saving of time and money and would be of substantial and immediate help towards the relief of acute congestion.</P>
    <P>Another new power proposed for the Land Commission is the power in Section 25 to pay gratuities to herds and labourers who lose employment when estates are divided.  The number of such persons is comparatively small and in many cases the discharged employee will be found suitable as an allottee and will be given an allotment of land.  At present an allotment is the only form of compensation that <Col N="903" /> can be given to any such person and many allottees in this class who were given allotments in former years have proved themselves quite unsatisfactory. The allotments, in fact, have been wasted on them.  By getting the power to pay gratuities as proposed in Section 25, the Land Commission would be able to save valuable land for those most in need of it and most likely to work it properly, that is, the class of small farmer whose holding is uneconomic and who cannot hope to enlarge his holding without the assistance of the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>Other sections in this group are Sections 16, 21 and 22.  Section 21 proposes additional powers for the Land Commission to partition commonages. These powers are necessary so that difficulties arising in the afforestation programme may be overcome. Sections 16 and 22 deal with some unredeemed fee farm rents and mortgage payments which are being debarred from the benefits of previous Land Acts through mere technicalities. I propose to deal at greater length with these rather technical matters at a later stage of the debate.</P>
    <P>The second group of sections relates almost entirely to the removal of legal difficulties which have arisen in the construction of previous Land Acts. These sections aim at clarifying the law about the admission of land to the benefits of land-purchase and the procedure for vesting such land.  They would also clarify the law about the writing-off of land annuities on land which has been eroded or permanently submerged by the action of the sea or rivers.  In addition, improved statutory provisions are also proposed for dealing with land transferred to trustees for turbary, tillage and other statutory purposes, and for the appointment of trustees required for the purposes of the Land Acts.  For a preliminary explanation of these matters, perhaps I could refer Deputies to the White Paper which was circulated with the Bill.  I shall be only too glad to answer any queries about them when I am replying to the debate.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I should like to explain that there are a number of <Col N="904" /> other land-purchase matters for which amending legislation is desirable but they have had to be held over for inclusion in a later Land Bill.  This is the only feasible course; otherwise further long delay would result and I am well aware that most Deputies are anxious that the &ldquo;market value&rdquo; clauses of this Bill should be enacted as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Some years ago, in trying to educate myself in regard to matters of land legislation, I read over the debate on the 1923 Act, and it did not seem to me that there was a tremendous amount of enlightenment in that debate.  The Minister did not get much help by way of constructive criticism or considered appreciation. Before coming to listen to the Minister on the question of this Bill, I read the speeches of three prominent members of the Opposition on the 1933 Act and I hope to deal with this Bill with a great deal less rhetoric and with more commonsense.  The late Deputy Hogan spoke of the 1933 Act as being &ldquo;destructive, disastrous and dishonest&rdquo;.  The present Taoiseach called it &ldquo;a socialistic, bolshevistic, communistic measure&rdquo;.  The Hans Andersen of the Government, the Minister for Agriculture, prophesied that it would entirely destroy security of tenure on the land.  It is surprising that the Minister for Agriculture had to take his trip to Washington at the present moment when this particular Bill of his is not being nursed in a very effective fashion by the present Minister. All is quiet on the Potomac so far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister is to be congratulated in regard to this Bill for his courage, or maybe his impudence, in bringing it forward in the terms it has. Like the curate's egg, it is good in spots, and where it is not good it smells like Samuel Pepys' late uncle. I have always been opposed to the specific payment of market value for land.  It seemed to me that there should be some penalty accruing to the landholder who did not utilise his farm in some sense for the benefit of the community.  I had, of course, traditions of landlordism and confiscation in my mind, and I had the idea that <Col N="905" /> there ought at least to be some penalty inherent in action which had to be taken by the Land Commission.  It took me quite a long time to shed that particular idea, but I have in great measure come around to the idea that a man's property shall not be taken from him without giving him adequate compensation, and I suppose that adequate compensation must be interpreted as market value, though arriving at market value will not be a very easy matter.</P>
    <P>We are going to pay the market value; we are going to pay compensation for disturbance; and, further, we are going to pay compensation for any consequential damage that might affect the owner of the land in relation to his working of any other portion of his land left to him.  All these things are going to create a problem which the Land Commission will find some difficulty in getting over, that is, if the various statements made in this House and in the Seanad have any foundation.  It has been charged time and again by Deputies and by Senators that the Land Commission had set out in past years to rob the owners of property, that they never paid anything like adequate value for the land they acquired.  If that is true, the payment of market value, compensation for disturbance, compensation for consequential damages and the non-repayment of annuities&mdash;all these things envisaged by the Minister are certainly going to create a problem for the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>One of the sections in this Bill is rather a revolutionary one.  It proposes to purchase land in such a way as to make the Land Commission a permanent institution.  The Land Commission was never meant to be a permanent institution.  It was set up to deal with a limited problem&mdash;a large problem, but a limited problem&mdash;and one terminable by time.  The terms of this Bill will certainly make it a permanency in Irish governmental life. The completion of land purchase at any particular time is not envisaged in this Bill.  We propose to purchase and acquire land and to distribute it, and we propose to repurchase it and redistribute it, in endless rotation. <Col N="906" /> The Land Commission will go on for ever purchasing and distributing, repurchasing and redistributing, creating a new annuity, a different annuity, and a further different annuity.</P>
    <P>One particular point that strikes me in relation to that position is that it is time the land laws were codified. The terms of the various land laws are so intricate and their verbiage clouds so much the issue for the ordinary citizen as to make it <i>terra incognita</i> for him and very often a source of bedevilment to the ordinary lawyer. In one way and another, the forms of the land laws are such as to create endless irritant litigation and dispute. Apart from this Bill and apart from Acts which are not specifically Land Acts dealt with in it, reference is made to 13 previous enactments, which start with the Land Act of 1881 and go on to the Acts of 1882, 1889, 1891, 1903, 1909, 1923, 1927, 1931, 1933, 1936 and 1939.  In order to read this Bill, in order to have any understanding of it, one must go back to 1881 to examine some particular term there, if one is thoroughly to understand it.  The law of mortmain is as nothing to the law of the Land Commission.  It is impossible to decide without a complete discovery of documents what the terms are of any particular Bill or any piece of current legislation.</P>
    <P>Not merely has land legislation been difficult of understanding by the ordinary citizen, and even difficult for the lawyer, but it has been the cause of endless delays and disputes and endless cost even to the State.  The only valid argument that was ever made against the codification of the land law was that the Land Commission was not a permanency.  It was merely set up for a short while to deal, as I say, with a large but limited problem. The Minister has said to-day that the greatest portion of that problem has been solved, but yet, in another part of his speech, he pointed out that we are to indulge in an entirely new scheme which certainly makes permanent the work of the Land Commission and keeps the Land Commission there for ever.  If the Minister would confer a boon on the community, if he would do something during his <Col N="907" /> term of office to make it memorable, he should set about a codification of the land laws and not have us continuing to flounder through the various Acts back to 1881 and probably further, because, if one goes back to 1881, one will probably find it necessary to go back to the Deasy Act to find what the interpretation is.</P>
    <P>This Act of 1933 which was disastrous and destructive, according to one prominent member of Fine Gael and communistic, socialistic and bolshevistic, according to the Taoiseach, is not being repealed in its bolshevistic aspects by this Bill, and one would have thought that, when the Minister for Agriculture and the Taoiseach, who was so definite as to the evils of that Act, had an opportunity of doing so, its evils would have been repealed by this measure.  Instead of that, the Minister proposes to go a good deal further and to be much more revolutionary.</P>
    <P>I always had the idea that the Fine Gael Party was a Conservative Party. I had the idea also that the Farmers' Party, and farmers generally, were conservative. If there was any kind of revolutionary mind in the country I thought it resided among the woolly-haired, wild men of the Fianna Fáil Party but the first seven matters which appear here in Section 10 are matters which, with very inverted logic, the present Taoiseach condemned in the 1933 Act.  These excepted matters were rightly put into the 1933 Act because it is essential that, in any Act dealing with fundamental matters like land, the interpretation of that Act and the manner in which it is to be administered should not be the playthings of politics.  It was wise and necessary that these powers should be taken out of the hands of the Minister, whoever the Minister was, and so they were in the 1933 Act.  The Minister has added to these quite a number of others and these others the Minister specifically mentioned were, as far as I am aware, always activities in which the Minister did not indulge.  I think no Minister would ever interfere in the matters which the Minister specifically included in Section 10 but there are two very <Col N="908" /> significant and very revolutionary changes in the seven points of Section 6 of the Act of 1933.</P>
    <P>Section 10, sub-section (1) paragraph (d) states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The determination (other than any determination arising in or being part of a rearrangement scheme) of the persons to be selected as allottees of any land.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Paragraph (e) states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The determination (other than any determination arising in or being part of a rearrangement scheme) of the price at which land is to be sold to any such allottee.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister can decide who the allottees of the land shall be in future and he can decide what the price of the land shall be to the particular people selected.  The Minister may say that that merely affects rundale holdings&mdash;a cottage estate, for instance, or some such work.  That is rather deceitful of the Minister because, in the way this Bill is worded, the Minister can take any land and suggest, and maintain effectively, that it is part of a rundale holding or that it was being used in connection with a rundale holding.  Let the Minister not steal away with the idea that he is deceiving me or anybody on these benches by suggesting that he is merely dealing with rundale holdings.  He can, with these powers, deal with any land anywhere in the country.  The Minister who tells us that there is no work for the commissioners, who, having for four or five years during the war period pointed out that the Land Commission was doing nothing, points out now that, during those years, there were so many appeals to the appeals tribunal as compared with the years before the war.  The Minister knows as well as I know that it was impossible to carry out the ordinary work of the Land Commission during the war years and, therefore, there could not be the same number of appeals to the appeals tribunal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>But if there is not <Col N="909" /> enough work for the commissioners, why does he propose to take it from them?  Why does he propose to take the authority and the work out of the hands of the commissioners and hand them over to civil servants?  Deputy Hogan, speaking on the 1933 Act as reported in Volume 48, column 2405 said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The duty of a civil servant is to obey a particular Minister and to be his agent.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The commissioners cannot be the agents of the Minister; since they are free, independent and judicial they cannot be his agents.  Therefore he takes the work out of their hands and gives it over to civil servants who are there as his agents and are paid by him.  These people, to whom I have already referred, called the 1933 Act a political measure.  I call this a Party political measure.  It certainly displays some of the views the Minister had when he was an irresponsible Deputy and now that he is an irresponsible Minister, he is going to put his irresponsibilities into this Bill.</P>
      <P>I shall deal on the next stage with the Bill, section by section, but in an opening statement such as this I think it wise for the purposes of general discussion that I should touch on a number of major matters.  Sub-section (5) of Section 10 says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where the Minister or an officer exercises or performs by virtue of sub-section (2) of this section any power or duty, he may exercise or perform the power or duty&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) in his own name, or</P>
      <P>(b) in the name of the Land Commission or the lay commissioners.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps it is a minor matter, but when the Minister does a thing he should stand over it in his own name and when he presumes to seal a thing, let it be sealed by the seal of the Minister. Let the Minister accept full responsibility for the things he does. The commissioners, for whom there is no longer any work, are to be removed from office and the work which they have not, is to be distributed amongst civil servants.  It will be very interesting <Col N="910" /> to see the remaining commissioners moving up on their benches, making way for the old guard of the Civil Service and dividing the work they have between them.  Expressing a personal opinion, may I say that when a nation recovers its freedom and sets up its own Government, it is natural that there should be a certain suspicion of the servants of the former alien Government? Even when the new Government discovers to their own satisfaction that there is no reason for that suspicion, the suspicion will remain among the public and the public mind must be reassured.  That seems to me to be one very good reason for the appointment originally of the appeal commissioners under the 1933 Act.</P>
    <P>Further, I would say that a man whose training and experience are entirely legal is perhaps not the best man to deal with a subject which has so many intricacies as land and land law, and I think it is well that there should be associated with him men whose training and experience are on an altogether different and wider scale.  For that reason I think it was wise that the lay commissioners should have been associated with the judicial commissioner.  There is also the fact that in the courts, when there is an appeal from one court to another, it is generally not an appeal from one judge to a particular judge, but from one judge to a group of judges, and when we have a decision by two or three commissioners, the appeal ought to be not to a single individual but to a group of men as well qualified and, possibly, better qualified than the men who have given the decision.  I think it is altogether unwise to do away with the appeal tribunal.  Apart from that, I think that it creates a bad precedent.  I think that when a Government makes an appointment of that nature, except there is a definite offence on the part of the occupant of the position, there should be no derogation of status.  I think there is in this case, and a reflection on the man who was appointed to this important position.</P>
    <P>Now, in Section 14 there is something which I regard as quite reasonable, and that is making the tenure of the existing commissioners permanent. <Col N="911" /> In regard to the termination of their term of office, no injustice is being done by the Minister at the moment.  As I understand it, the position was that, up to now, the term of office of the commissioners was merely terminable at death.  That was hardly a desirable position, and I think the Minister is wise in laying down a specific age at which they shall retire, and the age of 72 is reasonable. But then he goes on to state that, in future, the retiring age of commissioners shall be 65.  I do not personally believe that that is complete wisdom. I think that the accumulated experience and wisdom of a man of 65, if he is physically fit, should not be thrown away by the State.  I think those seven years between 65 and the later retiring age should, if possible, be utilised.  That is my personal view. But, if the Minister is going to decide that the retiring age of commissioners shall be 65, let us have it 65; let us have something definite and something certain.  Some time ago the retiring age of district justices was 65. Recently, the Minister for Justice, as I understand, extended it to 70.  So far as physical effort is concerned, the work of a district justice is much harder work than that of a land commissioner. What I want from the Minister is that, if he does, in his wisdom or lack of it, decide that 65 shall be the retiring age, then let it be that and let us have no more shilly shallying in any particular case.</P>
    <P>In Section 16 we are dealing with five County Limerick farms.  I am a Limerick man and I am interested to know why County Limerick has been segregated from all other counties and gets specific treatment.  I wish the Minister would give us some clarification of that position, because the Dáil wants to know why any five particular individuals should be selected for special treatment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Deputy knows why, knows the cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy does not know and that is why he is asking. Then again, in Sections 17 and 18 power is taken to prevent in the public <Col N="912" /> interest certain people from getting the benefits of the Land Acts.  I can see the reason for that, but I think those sections demand a much clearer explanation than we have got.  I think it is only fair to the Dáil that that should be given.</P>
      <P>There is one other section which I regard as being very dangerous&mdash;Section 23.  I want the Minister to understand, so far as we on these benches are concerned, that we are 100 per cent. with him in regard to the relief of congestion.  We do know, however, that, no matter how much you do, you cannot find a definite and conclusive solution for congestion.  That is impossible. There is not enough land.  You cannot acquire enough land.  We cannot deal with the human nature that opposes in a certain fashion the relief of congestion.  I suppose Section 23 has some connection with the cottage farm at Ballyhaunis.  If we had Section 23 a couple of years ago, we would not have had ex-Deputy Cafferky and Deputy Commons present on that occasion and the Minister would not have had to make so many excuses for them. Authority is given by the section to bid for land for sale at public auctions. As I see it, that will mean the purchase of a farm at public auction as a going concern and the placing thereon of a migrant.  That seems to be what the Minister has in mind.  It does not entail any delay in solving that particular problem and it does not involve any added expenditure by way of improvements. You buy the farm at a public auction as a going concern and you put a migrant on it.</P>
      <P>Of course, under Section 10 (1) (d), which deals with the determination of the person to be selected as allottee, not merely will the Minister purchase the land at public auction and put a migrant on it, but he will select the allottee himself.  That is what the Bill says.  It is very nice, too.  The lay commissioners will fix the maximum price to be paid for the holding.  The Minister will then fix the price at which it is to be sold to the allottee.  Having purchased the farm, having ensured that the lay commissioners will fix the maximum price and, having sold it to the allottee, he will then decide how much the poor devil is going to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="913" /> Now, the type of farm which the Minister needs for that particular purpose is the most sought after farm in the country, the small farm or the moderately sized farm.  It is the type of farm that a hardworking, successful farmer, with several sons to do for, will seek out.  He will try to place one of his sons on that farm at the cost to him of years of toil and sweat. Such a farmer will have to oppose his slender resources against the resources of the State which are at the disposal of the Minister.  In the debate on the 1933 Land Bill, this particular type of farmer was mentioned by the late Deputy Hogan as being &ldquo;the best and the most deserving type of farmer in the country&rdquo;.  Whenever such a farm appears on the market, the bidding for it will be brisk and the price will be high.  I think it is an undue interference by the State to indulge itself in competition with these deserving people, especially when it will have all the resources of the State behind it as against the very slender resources of these men.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the Minister, in doing this, is doing it with goodwill and with the desire to help the question of congestion, but still he is going to create another problem.  He is interfering with an accepted and functioning system of rural economics that has stood the test of time.  If he is going to find a holding for a gentleman in a particular part of the country, he is going to deprive a deserving applicant for it who has money in his pocket and who proposes to buy the holding to work it.  I think that the one evil which the Minister is trying to destroy will be replaced by a much greater evil in another part of the country.</P>
    <P>Now, I wonder how this thing is going to work out.  A farm is advertised for sale and, naturally it will be brought to the Minister's view. There will be no difficulty about that, anyhow.  The Minister will send down one of these inspectors to whom he has delegated authority which he has filched from the Land Commission. That inspector goes down the country and walks over this farm.  He comes back and makes his report, naturally, <Col N="914" /> to the Minister.  The Minister draws the attention of the commissioners to the position.  They will make a full examination of the report and decide on the maximum price.  Then he will have to secure an agent to purchase that farm.  Naturally, the Minister himself cannot go down to do that. He is too well known; he is too big and could be seen too easily.  An agent, then, is secured.  Now, he may be a local auctioneer.  If he is a supporter of one of the various Parties in the Coalition, he might be a solicitor: he might be anybody, any pal, and, mind you, it might be wise, in getting some pal, that he would be an obscure person.  This gentleman bids for the farm and maybe he would put one across the Minister.  He may be a good-natured fellow; he may want to do a turn for a local man and tell him the price.  That could happen, too. At any rate, the commissioners will have to be very generous, and the Minister, in fixing the maximum price, because one thing that will be known about it, as well as the fact that the Land Commission is bidding, is that it will also be known the agent cannot go beyond a certain price.  I know that, within the parish where I have lived for the past 20 years, it would be impossible for any outsider to buy a farm in it&mdash;the bidding is so keen. The Minister may frighten off some people for a start, but the only effect, eventually, that his activity will have in relation to this Bill is to increase the price of the land.</P>
    <P>There are, in Section 24, some proposals with regard to the preservation of public rights.  It is unfortunate, but it is true, that wherever the Land Commission takes over an estate&mdash;and there are public rights&mdash;there is no adequate protection of these public rights.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>No what?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>No adequate protection of these public rights.  I shall go into that later with the Minister.  I know one estate in the County Limerick which was divided by the Land Commission. In the case of that estate the people of the town had one of the remaining rights that survived many <Col N="915" /> confiscations and dishonesties.  That was the right to move along the river bank: to fish there, to swim there and to take the air there, but since the Land Commission took it over, even though they put up certain stiles and fences, all these stiles have been removed.  The right-of-way has been blocked to the general public; it has deteriorated since the Land Commission took it over.</P>
      <P>I want to say this, too, that if the Minister could include in this Bill a real defence of public right as it still exists, he would be doing a great public service.  I have often seen, of course, demands for upholding rights-of-way on farms.  These rights-of-way, many years ago, were wholly desirable, but with the number of new roads that have been made throughout the country in the past 30 years, many of these rights are no longer necessary to the public.  I do realise that there is nobody so damaging to the farmer as the trespasser.  A man's farm does not want to be interfered with.  Cattle are affected by people going through land, and there may be diseases brought through land, and, so far as possible, a farmer's farm ought to be his castle and his castle grounds.</P>

      <P>As far as there are any rights-of-way that could reasonably be eliminated now, I would be totally in agreement with them.  Where there are rights-of-way, public rights, that have not been protected by the Land Commission, the Minister should take note of them and protect them from being filched.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Section 25 there is a new proposal in relation to gratuities for workers on estates.  So far as I am aware, the only workers on estates who have got land as a result of the division of the estates are those who worked on the land&mdash;no house servants or anybody else of that nature are entitled to land.  I can sympathise with the Minister in regard to that particular proposal.  I would sympathise with him far more if I could be assured that it is the Land Commissioners who will make decisions <Col N="916" /> in these cases and not any Minister or civil servant.  I can see that injustice could be done.  I realise many of those people who got land as a result of the division of an estate, being servants thereon, were not successful.  One of the reasons why they were not successful is that the Land Commission divided the land into too small portions.</P>
    <P>I would impress on the Minister, under this measure or under any other measure that has been passed, that when the Land Commission or the Minister&mdash;as he now takes power to do &mdash;gives a piece of land to anybody, he will give him a farm and not a patch of land.  If you give a labourer a farm, take him off the labour market; give him a decent farm and let him work it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one thing missing from this Bill.  Somewhere there is a section dealing with Land Commission advances.  One section limits the advance to £3,000 and in another section the limit of advance for a certain type of farm is £5,000.  Those amounts have never been adhered to. One undesirable feature of land-holding is the accumulation of numerous farms in the hands of one man.  If a man owns a farm on which the £3,000 advance has been given, why should he be given a farm on which another £3,000 advance has been given?  Why must he not be made pay the full value of the land and why should the State have to pay for a second farm for him? That is wrong, and the Minister should examine it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know there is bound to be a certain amount of attrition between the Minister and the Land Commission&mdash;between a Minister and any settled department of civil servants.  Civil servants are permanent.  They take a long view, and sometimes they take too long a view.  So long as the machine is working reasonably well, they do not worry too much.  It is the business of the Minister and of politicians in this House to worry about inequities whereever they exist.  The Minister is in a position to rectify certain inequities that exist in practice in connection with land legislation.  I hope to introduce <Col N="917" /> some amendments that will help him to get rid of these inequities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>We have heard an interesting speech by Deputy Moylan with reference to this Bill and with reference to the whole question of land division.  I was interested to hear him at one stage making reference to the policy of the Fine Gael Party. The Fine Gael Party requires no certificate or bouquet from Deputy Moylan or any other Deputy in this House with regard to its policy in connection with land division.  As most Deputies know, it was the Hogan Act that did more than any other item of land legislation in this country to undo the work of the conquest.  Any discussion in relation to land legislation or land division that does not recognise the work of the late Patrick Hogan would be a discussion without any merit whatsoever.</P>
      <P>Deputy Moylan has made reference to other land purchase Acts and, so far as I could understand, listening to his speech, he seemed to regard land division in Ireland as commencing with the Fianna Fáil Act of 1933.  Every Deputy knows that the big step in the resettlement of the land in this country&mdash;the really substantial step&mdash; was taken under the 1923 Act, which declared that as from a particular day all tenanted land in Ireland should be deemed to vest in the Land Commission. Recognising that, most of us appreciate this fact, that subsequent legislative efforts were merely efforts to improve in some small way the principal Act, which is, and always must be, the Land Act of 1923.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are certain important steps being taken by the Minister in this Bill.  The two outstanding departures are the provision relating to the payment of the market value for land acquired and the power given to the Land Commission to enter into the property market.  With regard to the question of price, I cannot for one moment share the sentiments expressed by Deputy Moylan.  As I understood his speech, he thinks that there should be some perpetual penalty attached to the unfortunate person from whom land <Col N="918" /> is acquired under our land purchase code and that there should attach to that person some kind of stigma which would entitle us continually to penalise him by giving him something less than his rights.  I do not think that type of mentality is one that should appeal to people in a Christian country.  I can well understand the mentality which regards the 1923 Act as socialistic, bolshevistic and communistic.</P>

      <P>I understood Deputy Moylan to say that that was his view in relation to that land purchase Act and that he held that view for a considerable time.  Like some latter-day saints, he has now changed his view.  I am merely referring Deputy Moylan to what was at one time the mentality which, apparently, shaped his mind in relation to land purchase, and I say that that particular view never appealed to me.  I think most of us agree that the taking of something which belongs to another is distasteful. But in this country, by reason of the events which shaped our history and by reason of the various plantations and settlements of foreigners here, we have rightly adopted the policy of restoring to our people evicted in the years gone by the lands that were formerly taken from them. That has quite properly shaped our policy in relation to land purchase. With reference to that policy, we make an apology to no one.  That being so, we must, nevertheless, attempt to be as fair as circumstances permit, not <Col N="919" /> merely to the people we will resettle on the land, but also to those from whom the land will be acquired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For that reason I welcome the proposal with regard to the market value for land.  I compliment the Minister on including this proposal in this Bill. I think it is a courageous proposal.  It is a fair proposal and a reasonable one.  Undoubtedly, as Deputy Moylan has pointed out, there may be difficulties in the practical application of market value to acquisition proceedings. Simply because such difficulties may exist, we shall not throw in our hands and say: &ldquo;We must drop the entire proposal&rdquo;.  I am sure Deputy Moylan would not suggest that. Undoubtedly, there will be difficulties. Even now there are considerable difficulties in assessing the purchase price of land under the present land purchase code.  There is no rule of thumb which can be applied in a matter like this. I welcome the power given to the Land Commission to search for what the market value may be.  That market value will be assessed upon the evidence available.  Added to that will be the practical knowledge of the administrative machinery of the Land Commission and its officials.  In that way, it should be possible to arrive at a rough market value.  I am sorry that that particular provision in relation to market value for land acquired does not operate from an earlier date than the enactment of this measure.  I can conceive there are substantial reasons the Minister might put forward for not making this provision retrospective.  I hope, however, that in relation to proceedings at present under way in the Land Commission no price will be fixed by the Land Commission pending the enactment of this Bill and that, in so far as pending cases are concerned, those who own the lands about to be acquired will share in the benefit of this particular piece of legislation. I see no reason why a man whose lands might be acquired on 1st November, 1949, should get a substantially lower price than a man whose lands might be acquired on 1st December, 1949.  I trust that, recognising the sense of that, the Land <Col N="920" /> Commission will ensure that the price paid for land pending acquisition at the moment will not be determined until such time as it can be determined under this Bill.</P>
    <P>Another novel feature of this measure is the power given to the Land Commission to purchase holdings on the open market.  I think most of us recognise the difficulties and the problems in relation to the application of that power.  I do not suggest that there is any member in the House who recognises those difficulties clear than does the Minister himself.  If that power were exercised extensively it is possible that considerable drawbacks would quickly manifest themselves.  An effort might be made to foist land on the Land Commission at an inflated price.  The tendency might lie in the other direction.  This is a new departure so far as the Land Commission is concerned.  This is a new power being taken by that body.  I believe that in the exercise of that power the Land Commission will act very slowly.  In utilising that power I hope their first concern will be to purchase farms of a certain limited size and conforming to certain specified standards.  If they do that, then experience may teach them what dangers to guard against.  Merely because the power may hold certain drawbacks and because certain difficulties may arise, we should not say that the power should not be given to the Land Commission.  Deputies who represent rural constituencies have come across particular cases time and time again where, by reason of the existing machinery for land purchase, quick resettlement cannot be effected. There have been cases of particular congests who had to wait a considerable number of years before they could be resettled because of the existing procedure.  I think we should welcome the power now given to the Land Commission to purchase existing holdings of 30, 40 or 50 acres as a going concern where no delays will be entailed apart from the usual conveyancing delays.  I think we should welcome anything which will enable the Land Commission to purchase a holding and hand it over straight away to a deserving allottee.  I welcome that particular provision contained in this Bill.</P>

      <Col N="921" /> We got from Deputy Moylan this afternoon a number of very pious statements with regard to the impartial administration of a proper land purchase code by the Minister.  I do not know to what purpose we had that particular speech from Deputy Moylan but, apparently, it was all centred on the provisions contained in Section 10 of this Bill.  Deputy Moylan fears that, by reason of the reservation contained in two of the excepted powers of the Land Commission under Section 10, the Minister is now going to have power and will exercise power in relation to who is to be an allottee on an estate and in relation to the price to be paid by particular allottees.  We all know that that is so much moonshine and so much nonsense.  Any Deputy who has any experience of conditions on divided estates at present knows that by reason of an archaic code in operation in the Land Commission not a single thing can be done&mdash; not even the repair of a Land Commission pump&mdash;unless the order comes down direct from the commissioners themselves.</P>
    <P>There is an entire machinery built up over years whereby all these matters must go up through Civil Service channels until the commissioners themselves, and nobody else, signify that certain necessary work must be done. I know of one case where an entire file grew from nothing other than that in one particular part of Offaly a pump was out of order and had to be repaired.  I take it&mdash;I do not know but I take it&mdash;that that particular type of problem is being aimed at by the Minister in this Bill.  The Bill confers power on certain delegated Land Commission officials to deal in a businesslike and in a sensible way with matters of that kind.  I think that that is a very welcome and a very necessary provision.  I have heard, in different debates on the Estimate for the Department of Lands, Deputies from all sides of the House blaming this Minister and, I suppose, previous Ministers, for the delay in the Land Commission&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and in relation to different things.  I am certain that most of the criticism was entirely justified.  Certainly, it is my limited experience that that particular type of archaic code that I have described&mdash;which provides for the exercise only by the commissioners of discretion in relation to certain matters &mdash;is responsible for a certain part of delay in the administration of estates. I welcome any legislative proposal which cuts across that red tape and provides a quicker and a clearer method of having trivial matters such as that attended to.</P>
      <P>There are other matters to which I should like to refer in relation to the Bill but which are, perhaps, more suitable for discussion at a later stage of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Moylan has expressed a certain reasonable objection to the power given to the Land Commission to purchase holdings in the open market.  He has based his objection on the time-old basis of the resources of the State being used against individuals and against ordinary persons with limited means.  That is a reasonable point of view for any Deputy to take and I am certain that it is an objection to which Deputy Moylan has listened for a great number of years while he was a Minister in this House.  I am certain that the objection itself is one that Deputy Moylan must know nearly by rote, because his Party had to listen to objections of that kind when they permitted the resources of the State to be used&mdash;for instance in the hotel business&mdash;by hotels being sponsored by State funds and by all the different activities to which, in the past 16 years, they have allowed the resources of this State to be diverted, in competition with individuals and with ordinary citizens.  However, I appreciate the motives which prompted Deputy Moylan to express that fear.  If I thought that we were going to reach a situation here where the Land Commission, for no adequate reasons, was going to purchase and use its resources to freeze out ordinary people who might wish or desire to purchase land, I would be dead against it.  But what we are doing here is giving to the <Col N="923" /> Land Commission an additional power to fulfil its functions and to discharge its duties&mdash;and its functions and its duties are to assist in the resettlement of our people on the land.  I think no Deputy could take any reasonable objection to any additional power being given to the Land Commission that will result in some quickening of that process.  I think, therefore, that while there may be good motives prompting Deputy Moylan's remarks in relation to that matter, his fears are not well-founded.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moylan has spoken with regard to the codification of our land code and I entirely endorse what he has said.  The land purchase code from 1881 down to the present Bill is a code quite immense in stature.  It is a code which, to even the trained lawyer, is completely uncharted and about which very few can possibly expect to have any real knowledge.  The land purchase code is one which affects the rights and property of the greater part of our people.  I hope that the question of codification is at least being considered by the Department of Lands. Quite apart from the temporary nature of the Land Commission, the land purchase code, the code itself and its provisions, must always remain.  After all, the land purchase code represents the documents of title of every person who has purchased a holding under the Land Purchase Acts.  The fact that we may, in the foreseeable future, expect the end of the Land Commission is no reason why the Land Purchase Acts should not now be codified.  I think that at some stage, some time in the foreseeable future, the Minister should contemplate an Act which would say to all those who have vested holdings under the Land Purchase Acts: &ldquo;Your rights, your responsibilities, are contained in this particular Bill.  Inside the four corners of this Bill you can see what is expected from you and what your rights might be.&rdquo;  I think that is something which every owner of land in Ireland is entitled to expect while the title to his land is being conferred on him and I hope that this question of codification obtains the attention and concern of the Minister.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="924" /> That is as much as I have to say concerning this Bill except to express my personal congratulations to the Minister on this Bill which he has introduced.  I was interested in hearing him say here to the House that there are&mdash;as I am sure there are&mdash;other matters in relation to land acquisition procedure that will require legislation. I congratulate him on not delaying this Bill by reason of these other matters even if it means that we will have one or two or even three more Land Bills within the next few months. The number, with all the legislation that has gone before, cannot make matters any different.  I congratulate him, therefore, on introducing the Bill and on the new powers which he seeks for the Land Commission, and I wish him every success in this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">

      <P>Deputy O'Higgins started out by rebuking Deputy Moylan, and I think rightly, for not paying full tribute to the men who initiated the legislation of 1923, but I think that Deputy O'Higgins left himself open to even more stern rebuke in that he himself did not pay tribute to the men who initiated a lot of legislation in this country, Michael Davitt and Parnell.  Those men had to start at a time when the farmers here were in the condition of serfs and they had to free them from that condition. Under the legislation which they forced through an alien Parliament, three-fourths of the land of this country was purchased from the landlords and only one-fourth was left to be purchased under our own native Parliament. That was a tremendous achievement and one which will never be forgotten by the farmers of Ireland as long as grass grows and water flows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say I am glad that the Minister has introduced this Bill. When I brought a Land Bill before this House last year I got a good deal of criticism from people who went so far as to say that I was fighting the landlords' case.  I think it is now quite obvious that I was fighting the case of the simple farmer who owns land in this country which may be acquired by the Land Commission.  The Minister last year promised that he would introduce a comprehensive measure containing <Col N="925" /> the principal point which I enshrined in my Bill&mdash;to pay owners the market value for the land&mdash;and he has done that very effectively in this Bill.  As far as I can see, the provisions of Section 5 of this Bill are satisfactory. No one can tell&mdash;certainly no ordinary layman who has not experience of the technicalities of administration&mdash;how this particular section will work in practice, but I am quite sure that with efficient administration and goodwill no owner of land will be left with a grievance such as has existed over a number of years past.</P>
    <P>I also welcome in this Bill the provision of compensation for disturbance. There are cases&mdash;and cases will occur &mdash;where land is acquired compulsorily by the State and where the owner is paid the full market value but where nevertheless he suffers grave loss inasmuch as he is uprooted out of the holding which he was working and must seek a living elsewhere.  There is absolutely no reason why such a person should not be compensated for that disturbance in his way of living and in so far as this Bill provides for that I think it is satisfactory.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moylan did a foolish thing when he was speaking on this Bill.  He made a confession.  I think if he were wise he would not make a confession in the presence of members of the legal profession.  Certainly he was severely chastised for admitting that at one time he held a prejudiced view against those whose lands were acquired and felt that they should be penalised, but that in the course of time he came to realise that that view was inequitable and unfair.  Under no conceivable circumstances should compulsory acquisition of land be regarded as a penalty upon any owner of land.  If you want to punish a man you should take him to court, find him guilty of some statutory offence and fine him for it, but you cannot impose a penalty through land legislation.  You cannot link with the resettlement of our people on the land some kind of legal penalties for perhaps unsatisfactory usage of the land.  Those two things should be kept absolutely and completely separate.  The Land Commission has a special function to perform, <Col N="926" /> to ensure as far as possible that every uneconomic holding in this country is made economic.  That, I think, is the most important of all their functions and they cannot perform it if they are also to be a branch of the Department of Agriculture or some other Department to investigate how ordinary farmers whose land is vested in them use that land or to what extent their usage conflicts with the interests of the people.  We have other legislation to deal with that.  Therefore, I say that when land is acquired adequate compensation should be provided for any injury or unjustice inflicted upon the owners through disturbance.  In the Land Bill which I introduced last year I sought to have some provision to safeguard the ordinary farmer from interference which was not justifiable, and as far as I can see, there is no similar provision in this Bill.  I think something of that nature is necessary.</P>
    <P>I have referred earlier on to the great men of the past who achieved fair rents, free sale and fixity of tenure. Those were regarded at that time as the essentials of our land policy and the basic right of the tenant farmers of this country.  But can you have absolute security of tenure or even a reasonable measure of security of tenure, as long as it is open to any political organisation to initiate proceedings for the compulsory acquisition of any holding upon which they set their eyes?  I believe that this Bill should contain some safeguard for the man who is using his land properly in the best interests not only of himself but of the nation.  Some Deputies will say that it is impossible to put in any statutory provisions of that kind without interfering unduly with the fundamental task of the Land Commission. I do not believe that that is true.  While the particular section which I framed in the Bill last year may not have been worded exactly as the Land Commission would require, it is possible to provide for some safeguard.</P>
    <P>Some people suggested that there ought to be a safeguard in regard to the size of the holding, that there ought to be a certain acreage below which the Land Commission would not interfere in any way.  That may be <Col N="927" /> one viewpoint.  On the other hand, some provision might be made by which a certificate would be given to the owner by, say, the Department of Agriculture, that he was working his holding in a proper way; and such holdings would not be interfered with. I would like to see some means by which a person who has acquired a holding, either from his ancestors or by purchase, could, by complying with certain statutory conditions, be able to say that his holding was absolutely safe from acquisition by the Land Commission.  There are Deputies who may say that there is no such provision in regard to the Housing Acts, hydro-electric development, and so on. However, the necessity for such provision does not arise in regard to those works.  In housing, for example, the sites to be acquired are determined by the needs of the city, town or locality; and by the nature of the site.  If the site is unsuitable for housing, it will not be acquired: if it is suitable, you cannot prevent it.  Also, in regard to housing, you are dealing with a basic and fundamental need of the community. No person can live without shelter, so houses must be provided no matter where the land is obtained. But when you come to the question of taking a farm from one individual to give it to another for the purpose of farming, you are dealing with an entirely different problem, a problem for which certain provision should be made in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I mention this particularly because I have noticed, in the course of proceedings in this House, questions asked again and again in regard to the same holdings.  I have been told that some of those questions relate to farms where there is really no justification for their acquisition, but perhaps because the Deputy who raises the question has some ill-will to the owner of the farm.  It is possible under existing law for any Deputy who has a family feud or dispute with his neighbour to press, and press persistently, until he forces the Land Commission, by sheer exhaustion, to acquire that farm.  I think there ought to be protection against that kind of abuse&mdash;as it is certainly an abuse&mdash;of the important <Col N="928" /> functions of the Land Commission. They should not be pestered or plagued to acquire a holding because some political organsiation or some politician has ill-will against its owner. Security of tenure cannot exist side by side with that system.  I will endeavour, at a later stage of this Bill, to include in it some safeguard for the owner of land, so that even though the price may be fair and there may be compensation for disturbance, if he wants to keep on farming on his own farm he would be allowed to do so.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Moylan, I welcome the provision of the Bill which enables the Land Commission to purchase land by agreement, that is, to purchase lands that are being offered for sale in the public market, if and when they are so offered.  That is a very welcome provision. There is no reason why, where lands are put on the market, the Land Commission should not be able to send down a buyer and purchase that land in the open market, without any of these objectionable compulsory powers that we have heard so much about. There is, of course, a danger in connection with that particular power, that the price paid by the Land Commission might be excessive, inasmuch as they might find themselves competing with other buyers.  However, it would be natural to expect that any responsible officials would value the land first of all and fix its valuation and then, if they could obtain it by agreement at that price, or less if possible, there should be no difficulty whatever.  The question of their bidding against some local buyers would be ridiculous, that is, bidding up a farm far beyond its value.  The value should be ascertained definitely first, and then the price agreed upon.  There should be no very serious difficulty in carrying out that, if there is prudent administration.</P>
    <P>I can see great advantages in extending the power to acquire land anywhere it is offered for sale and where it can be had at a reasonable price. For example, I have known certain farms offered to the Land Commission again and again which were suitable for division, but, because they did not comply with certain requirements of existing legislation, the Land Commission <Col N="929" /> had to pass them over; whereas, if they had acquired them, even if there were not congestion in the district, they would be able to use them to satisfy migrants from other districts where there may be congestion.  Anywhere land is being offered for sale and can be acquired at a reasonable price, they should have no hesitation in acquiring it, regardless of what the position may be in the immediate district in regard to congestion.  I hope this Bill enables them to acquire such land, as very often it happens that there is very little land offered for sale in areas where there is congestion, while there may be a considerable number of farms on the market where there is very little congestion.  I think the powers should be widened, to enable them to acquire such holdings. They would then get land at a reasonable price.</P>
    <P>Another point arises which concerns the Land Commission and the Forestry Department.  A large number of farms are offered very frequently to the Forestry Department, portions of which are good agricultural land and portions suitable only for forestry. The Forestry Department are always anxious to get the suitable portion for planting, but find it difficult to acquire the agricultural portion, as they have not powers to give an adequate price for such lands.  That is a provision which should be in this Bill, if it is not in it already&mdash; and I cannot find any trace of it&mdash;to enable such holdings to be acquired by the Land Commission for the relief of congestion, if you like, and then the portion suitable for planting to be handed over to the Forestry Department.  Such provision would make the operation of the Forestry Department much less difficult.  I have known the Forestry Department to lose the purchase of very useful land simply because their powers were inadequate or because the powers of the Land Commission were restricted and they could not do business with the owner. That aspect of land purchase should be very seriously considered.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister has considered the question of financing the better price which is provided for in this Bill or not.  I have always felt that it would be possible to pay a <Col N="930" /> reasonable price for land, namely, the market value, without imposing any additional annuity on the incoming tenant simply by extending the repayment period.  That aspect of land purchase legislation should be considered. The incoming tenant is not worried whether he has to pay over a period of 50 or 150 years.  It is very much the same to him.</P>
    <P>While I am very happy that the Minister has met the demand which has been made over a long period for the payment of the market value for land I regret very much that it is not provided in the Bill that that price will be paid at least for the period since the Minister took office as Minister for Lands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has made it clear beyond all question that he is satisfied that existing legislation does not provide for a fair price for land acquired.  He has been in office since 18th February, 1948.  Surely the Minister will agree that at least he should accept responsibility for the period that he has been in office.  I am not asking the Minister to accept responsibility for what was done by Deputy Moylan, Deputy Derrig, Deputy Boland or his other illustrious predecessors.  At least, he should be prepared to deal justly for the period that he has been Minister.  Once the Minister has acknowledged that an unfair price was paid, an obligation rests upon him to see that justice is done. The previous Ministers, I suppose, do not acknowledge that the price they were paying was unfair and, in that way, evade the responsibility.  There are no means by which the present Minister can evade responsibility to pay the full market value as and from the date on which he became Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was anxious to know if there were many holdings involved and I asked a question to which the Minister replied that 40 such estates had been acquired since the beginning of 1948.  I think any farm that is vested in the owner is called an estate.  At any rate, the Minister's reply covers only the first six months of this year, and a few <Col N="931" /> holdings may have been acquired during the last few months and a few more may be acquired before the Bill becomes law.  In my opinion, they should all be covered by this Bill.  The number would not be more than 50 at the outside and it would be reasonable to date the Act as and from the date on which the Minister took office.</P>
    <P>I have been informed by persons directly concerned that there has been a tendency on the part of the Land Commission to rush the fixation of price in acquiring land in the past few weeks so as to have the price fixation completed before the passing of this Bill.  I do not know how true that is but there will be a hardship on people whose lands have been acquired during the past few months or people whose lands are acquired while the Bill is going through the House.  I would therefore ask the Minister to date the Bill from the date on which he became Minister for Lands, in view of the fact that he definitely stated from the very outset that the price paid was inequitable and inadequate.</P>
    <P>It is a desirable provision in the Bill that workers on holdings should have the option of a gratuity in lieu of a holding.  It often happens that workers who have been employed on a holding for a long time and who are entitled to compensation on the termination of their employment would be very happy to accept payment in cash rather than to be saddled with the management of a farm.  They may not have any great ambition in that direction.  The provision for compensation in this Bill is a fair and reasonable proposition.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moylan seemed to be rather astonished at the suggestion that there appears to be no end to the work of the Land Commission.  The end seems to be very far from sight.  While the Land Commission are acquiring land for the purpose of relieving congestion, at the same time they are creating uneconomic holdings in many places.  Any cottage tenant whose land adjoins an estate that is being divided is entitled to three, four or five acres.  That represents an uneconomic holding and, <Col N="932" /> thereby, he is entitled at a later date to claim, as an uneconomic holder, that he is entitled to land.  If you go on creating new uneconomic holdings the work of the Land Commission will be perpetuated.</P>
    <P>Another development in regard to land is the acquisition of farm after farm by one individual and the consolidation of a number of farms in one farm.  There again the work of the Land Commission is, to a certain extent, frustrated.  Homesteads disappear and new large estates are created. There again is a problem which requires consideration.</P>
    <P>From that point of view, however, I think this Bill will be welcomed by Deputies.  It will ensure that the uneconomic holder, the person living in a congested area, will get an addition of land that will make his holding economic and he will be able to feel, at the same time, that he is robbing nobody when he takes possession of that additional land.  He will be able to feel that the former owner has been fairly and adequately compensated and that justice has been done.  That is one very satisfactory feature of this Bill and one which will commend it to the House.  I hope that the other suggestion I have made, namely, that the Minister should date the Bill from the day upon which he took office, will be accepted by him.  It is a fair and reasonable proposition and I am sure he will have no difficulty in getting the Government to agree to it.</P>

      <P>If the observations made by Deputy Moylan had been made by any other Deputy on that side, they would not perhaps merit the consideration they do merit, coming from him as the former Minister in charge of this Department.  In approaching this Bill, I think it is correct to say that its main features are contained in two sections, Sections 5 and 23.  Deputy Moylan made a number of general observations, with many of which I found myself in agreement, as did Deputy O'Higgins who followed him.  The plea he made for the codification of our land laws is one to which the Minister, or some successor of his, will at some time have to give an attentive ear.  Reference <Col N="933" /> was made to the difficulty of the ordinary layman appreciating or understanding the purport of the various Land Acts which we have had over the past 27 or 28 years, and before that period.</P>
      <P>Let me say this, that, as an ordinary lawyer, earning my living in the city, I do not find myself in any much better position than the average layman.  It is a matter which does not normally come within the scope of the business with which one deals in a city area, but, even for the country practitioner, the existing body of legislation, which we know collectively as the Land Acts, presents a very formidable mass of law, not easily assimilable and not readily comprehended, except by people making a very special study of that branch of the law.  I think the Minister must, at the same time, pay heed to the pleas which have been made to him for the codification and, if possible, the simplification, of our land laws.</P>
      <P>There are two sections which are likely to give rise to controversy, Section 5 and Section 23.  Because I accept the Minister's assurance that he is concerned with the speedy relief of congestion and with the general speeding up of land division, we in Clann na Poblachta are prepared to support this Bill; but let me make no secret of the fact that we support Section 5 with very grave misgivings.  If, in effect, it will mean that division will be speeded up and relief given in congested districts more quickly than might otherwise be possible, we will balance that favourable aspect of it against the fact that it may very well lead to increased amounts being paid, by way of annuity, by allottees.</P>

      <P>Surely there is a connection between the amount of money that is going to be expended by the people through the Land Commission in acquiring land and the general levy, if not on particular sections, on the public as a whole.  I do not subscribe to the view that any grave injustices were perpetrated in the past by reason of the figure at which lands were acquired.  There may have been <Col N="934" /> cases, few and far between, in which some injustice was unwittingly perpetrated, but I do not subscribe to the view that such cases would form any substantial proportion of the whole.</P>
      <P>In approaching a Bill of this kind, it might be no harm to relate it to the fundamental background against which it should be examined, to relate it to what we conceive to be the function of the Land Commission.  In my submission, the function which the Land Commission should be carrying out&mdash;I am afraid I am a little cynical as to whether the Land Commission ever did succeed in carrying out that function&mdash; is the undoing of the conquest, so far as the land of the country is concerned. I am afraid that that spirit does not animate the workings of the cumbrous machinery of the Land Commission and I am doubtful if we are going to get any nearer to that spirit by reason of the inclusion in the Bill of Section 5. However, our view is that if the Minister says he wants the powers contained in Section 5 in order to help him more speedily to acquire and divide land in order to relieve congestion, we are not prepared to withhold from him any powers which he assures the House are necessary to him in order to pursue that end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are inherent in Section 23 certain dangers, dangers that flow from the very essence of human nature.  The Minister is much more <i>au fait</i> with the problem than I or probably anybody on these benches, but I think he should give heed to the warning that was sounded.  I think he should try to ensure that the passage of this measure is not going to mean inflation of land values.  For a reason similar to that expressed in relation to Section 5, I should not like, nor would we be justified, in refusing to the Minister the powers which he seeks in Section 23. If the Land Commission in the past, working under the then existing legislation, has not always given cause for confidence in it, confidence in the correctness of its fundamental approach to this problem, then I would urge on the Minister that he should, at as early date as possible, consider the introduction of such amending legislation, or whatever steps may commend <Col N="935" /> themselves to him, as will make it possible for him to assure this House that we can in the foreseeable future look forward to the time when the Land Commission will have completed its job, namely, to restore to the Irish people the land taken from them by conquest.</P>
    <P>One final matter with which I should like to ask the Minister to deal in his reply is: will he give the House an assurance that in no case will the market value of land be paid to aliens who bought land?  I should like the Minister to deal with that in his reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the part of this Bill which deals with the payment of the market value for land.  The land, with which we had to deal in the old days under the Hogan Act, practically all consisted of estates owned by landlords.  As time went on, the Government came to acquire smaller parcels of land until now, apparently, we have reached the position where the only land left to be acquired is land owned by the ordinary farmer.  I think the Hogan Act was the first Land Act under which the landlords were compelled to sell and for that I give the then Government credit.  There were, however, always the outside cases of men who were wronged and, unfortunately, in my constituency there is a large number of people who were wronged, and gravely wronged, by the Hogan Act.  As the Minister knows, men who fought the landlords in my constituency in order to prevent the filching of a right that they said they should have and which they felt should be vested in them&mdash;sporting and fishing rights&mdash;and who refused to purchase because these rights would not be vested in them, were compulsorily purchased under the Hogan Act and are now being compulsorily vested by this Government, again under the Hogan Act.  That is one of the wrongs that one meets in dealing with these Acts.  As time went on, we found many anomalies.  If Deputies would go to the trouble of looking up the files of the Land Commission over the years 1934, 1935 and 1936, they would find that there was an enormous area of land which was left outside the Hogan Act.</P>

When the 1933 Act was being prepared, we had to bring up those leases, if you like to call them such, and make sure that the Act would cover them and that those people were at last enabled to get out from under the load imposed on them.</P>

      <P>This Bill, like the curate's egg, is good in patches.  I listened very attentively to-night and the discussion took my mind back to what occurred in this House on the Land Commission Vote last year.  I am quoting from Volume 111, column 292, of the Official Reports, when I was repudiating a statement made by Deputy T.F. O'Higgins, as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I trust that the Minister will endeavour to get away from the basis upon which land was divided in the past.  I regret to say that land division was concerned with the particular colour of the applicant.  I do not know whether Deputy Beegan spoke with his tongue in his cheek but he had the gall to stand up in this House and suggest that there had been no political interference on the part of the last Government as far as land division was concerned.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I quoted Section 6 of the Land Act, 1933, as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The following matters shall be excepted matters for the purposes of this section, and the expression &lsquo;excepted matters&rsquo; shall in this section be construed accordingly, that is to say&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  The determination of the persons for whom land is to be acquired or resumed;</P>
      <P>(b)  The determination of the actual lands to be acquired or resumed;</P>
      <P>(c)  The determination of the price to be paid for land so acquired or resumed;</P>
      <P>(d)  The determination of the persons to be selected as allottees of untenanted land;</P>
      <P>(e)  The determination of the price at which land is to be sold to any such allottee;</P>
      <P>(f)  The determination of the new holding which is to be provided for a tenant or proprietor whose holding has been acquired by the Land Commission;</P>
      <P>(g)  The determination of whether or not a holding has been used by the tenant thereof as an ordinary farm in accordance with the proper methods of husbandry.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was the law and is the law at present.  I stated then that the Minister had no power whatever in connection with any one of these items.  All these matters were handed over to the Land Commission and since that Act was passed any charge of interfering <Col N="938" /> with the division of land or anything else was a charge not against any Minister, but against the Land Commission and its officials.  That was the position.  Now we find that under Section 10 the Minister is taking over certain of these functions and will now have power to say what allottees shall get land and the price that the allottee shall pay for it.  I do not think that the Minister is wise in taking that power.  He is laying the foundation for the making of allegations such as these which were very falsely and wrongly made in this House.  We were told by Deputy O'Higgins that this change which is being made is only giving power to deal with Land Commission pumps which are out of order. That is rather a joke.</P>
    <P>The next thing I am concerned with is Section 23.  We are rapidly approaching the time in this country when every man can get land except a farmer's son.  The majority of Deputies represent rural constituencies and they should know the position in their own immediate district.  They know that when a farm is put up for sale in a district there are five or six local bidders.  There will be a number of farmers with two or three or four sons who have been working all their lifetime on their father's holding&mdash;generally a farm of 40 or 50 acres.  By their industry they have collected what they think will buy a farm for one of them. The usual openings for these young men have been gradually closed year after year.  If you want to become a baker now you must be a baker's son; if you want to become a mason, you must be a mason's son, and so on. Trade unionism has closed the ordinary avenues of employment into which these young men would naturally go, so that they have no outlet except emigration or becoming an agricultural labourer.  We were told by Deputy O'Higgins to-night that the Minister's activities in that direction are to be in connection with farms of limited size.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Farms of 30, 40 or 50 acres.  These are the very farms which <Col N="939" /> are watched with anxious eyes by the young men in each parish, the very farms they are looking for.  If the Minister takes power, when a farm is put up for auction, to send a buyer to purchase it, he is closing the outlet for those young men.  He is going to go in with the wealth of the Land Commission behind him and will wipe out any hope these young men have of getting land.  In my opinion it would be wrong to deny such men the right of getting a decent livelihood in their own country.  I certainly think that is a power which the Minister should not have.  I can see it leading to endless abuse.  One of the greatest abuses would be that the Minister would be closing the only avenue left to a farmer, who has three or four sons, of settling a second son on the land.  I do not think the Minister should do that, and I think it would be wrong for the House to give him such power unless he can produce much stronger reasons than those he has already advanced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am congested enough, but where you find a farmer even with 100 acres of land and four sons to provide for, that holding, if it be divided into two economic holdings, can only give a livelihood to two sons.  What is to happen to the other two?  Suppose a holding is advertised for public auction, what hope is there of a neighbouring farmer buying that holding for his son if the Minister's representative is there?  He may be some official of the Land Commission, a lawyer with some pull or some auctioneer, but what hope is there of a neighbouring farmer being able to buy against the Minister's representative, even though that farmer has a son who has worked on the land all his life and he is anxious to get that farm for him?  Has not that farmer's son as good a right to that holding as any congest that <Col N="940" /> the Minister speaks of, if his father can buy it for him?  I maintain that he has.  All that I want in this is fair play.  I think the Minister is making a mistake in doing what he proposes in the Bill.</P>
      <P>I should also like the Minister, when replying, to deal with the proposed change in regard to the Judicial Commissioners. Over a number of years, up to 1933, I definitely opposed in this House the idea of one Judicial Commissioner. He was only a lawyer.  I think that during all that period I gave very good and sound reasons for the objection I made to having one Judicial Commissioner.  As a result of my objection, we got three commissioners. We succeeded in getting on the Appeal Tribunal the opinion of the man with practical experience as distinct from that of the man of legal training.  That system has since worked pretty successfully.  I would advise the Minister to read the debates that took place in this House previous to the appointment of three commissioners on the Appeal Tribunal.  If he does he will find instances such as this: that in cases where a value had been placed on land by the Land Commission in the first instance it was increased by 150 per cent., and in one case by 250 per cent.  I ask the Minister to imagine a Government Department paying a value to go down the country to value an estate, and later, on appeal, his value being increased by 250 per cent.  If he studies cases of that sort he will get some idea of why it was a practical impossibility afterwards to put a man into a Land Commission holding without putting on his back a burden that he could not bear. I want to tell the Minister that that was the effect of having one Judicial Commissioner.  When, as I have pointed out, we afterwards got three commissioners and thus secured the opinion of ordinary lay commissioners, better results were obtained.  I would ask the Minister to go into this matter himself and to read up the debates that took place between 1927 and 1933.  If he does he will discover two things: (1) the decision of the commissioners; and (2) the appeal decision.</P>

      <P>These are the only matters that I wish to deal with now. I regret that the Minister did not take a little more time in the preparation of this Bill so as to include something in it that would give those unfortunate men, whom he is compelling to vest in the Fermoy area, the right to own the fishing and sporting rights on the land for which they are paying annuities and rates and not leave those rights to be held, as they are at present, by an alien in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill, and particularly the revolutionary part of it, which is long overdue.  When this House reflects on what has taken place in this country under the operation of our Land Acts, I think it will have a considerable amount to be ashamed of.  Perhaps it is better that we should forget what has been done in the past and try to do justice in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The important part of this Bill is that portion of it which relates to paying the market price for land.  Deputy Moylan appeared to be considerably perturbed about that.  I do not see that anybody should be perturbed about paying the market price for land. That price has always a way of finding its own level.  I feel ashamed of having been a member of this House and a party to the things that have taken place under this Department, which gets its authority from this House.  I wonder have Deputies of the House ever reflected on what has been done under our land legislation?  Have they <Col N="942" /> reflected on the utterly indefensible things that have been done?  There were certain things done by landlords when I was a youngster and I need not say here what happened to them.  As to what has been done under a Government Department, of course there was not a word about it.  I say that cruel injustices were done and they were done silently, but the victims had to suffer.  Where they are to-day, I do not know.  It is to be hoped that somebody has looked after them, that somebody has made provision for them.  But certainly this State has not so far done so.</P>
    <P>I would like to give some examples of what has been done.  There are two cases which, for years, I presented to the House in order to draw attention to them so that some justice might be done.  I have no interest in these cases at all. I do not know the people and I merely give the facts from the records of the Department.  There is the case of a farm in Westmeath.  The husband died and the Estate Duty Office assessed the value of the farm at £7,000.  I am giving these things from memory and I wish to be as accurate as I can.  The estate duty was levied and the widow had to pay on the £7,000 valuation. She had one child and, of course, she wished to retain the farm for the daughter.  She struggled for some years and then found it was impossible to continue.  Finally, she decided to put the farm up for auction.  The highest bid was £3,500.  She thought she was being cheated when such an offer was made, that she was being taken advantage of by the people at the auction.  She refused to accept that offer.  The final act came when the Land Commission stepped in and acquired her farm and, after the redemption money was taken from the price, she got £1.  I ask Deputies to consider the circumstances of that case. We call ourselves not only a Christian but a Catholic country, yet we threw the widow and her orphan on the roadside and gave her a pound note.  You would give that as a tip to somebody if you were in a generous mood.  There was wailing in the House this evening because the Minister came in here to remedy that state of affairs.  If he does <Col N="943" /> nothing else for this country, he will do a great thing by effecting that remedy.</P>
    <P>The second case comes from the County Roscommon.  There, a man's farm was acquired and, when the account was settled, the Land Commission served him with a demand for £15 &mdash;they said he owed them £15 after they had taken his farm.  What justification is there for such conduct?  Can anybody justify it?  Is there any man here or outside who would dare defend such action, unless he was playing on the passion of some people whom he wanted to placate or pacify?  I suggest that nothing would justify such conduct. It is a violation of the natural law.  It would be unjust for any man to do it.</P>
    <P>What principle could there be behind such a thing?  Would it solve congestion or give land to landless people? Does it justify confiscating a person's property in order to do justice to another?  Are you justified in committing an injustice in order to pretend that you are doing justice?  No crisis could justify some of the things that were done in the exercise of the power that is obtained under the Land Acts. I am proud to be here this evening to give my approval to the principal part of this Bill which is contained in this section.</P>
    <P>I have some reservations arising from this Bill.  There is a section which gives power to the Land Commission so that they will be the sole judges of the price to be paid for land. I am troubled in this connection and I should like to have an explanation from the Minister.  For example, will they go to an auction where there will be other would be purchasers and, if somebody else bids higher than the Land Commission, will they make offers on the one hand and issue threats on the other hand that if anybody bids above what they think is a fair price, they will say: &ldquo;We will veto that and we will not permit a conveyance to be made to the bidder&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>I want to protect the public in these matters.  This section would be worthless if we allow the deduction of the redemption money from the price fixed for the land and if we give absolute <Col N="944" /> power to the Land Commission to permit their agent to go to an auction or anywhere else when land is being sold and to say to the person who makes the highest offer: &ldquo;We will not authorise that, we will veto that and we will not allow the conveyance to be made to you.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Moylan has raised what would appear to be a spot of trouble. He said that under this measure you will increase the price of land.  I cannot see any difficulty in that regard. A Land Commission official bidding for land will, if he is a competent official, know the current market value of land.  The Land Commission officials are men of ripe experience. They will know if there is a puff bidder present and they can sit down and leave the land there.</P>

      <P>The difficulties will solve themselves.  Deputy Moylan was perturbed about some of the criticisms made in this House against the Land Act of 1933.  Possibly some adverse criticisms were made, but I think they were justified.  I am sure that Deputy Moylan will agree with me now that there is a provision in that Act which destroys the value of land as a security.  There was never a Land Act passed since 1880 which did not contain some outstanding section that laid hold of the imagination of the people who owned land.  The particular section of the land Act of 1933 that left its mark on the country and on the tenant farmers was the provision that the Land Commission could at any time enter upon land and acquire it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not discussing this in any spirit of controversy.  What <Col N="945" /> was the result of that particular section? The title deeds or the certificate of the Land Registry was not worth tuppence in any bank in Ireland.  Our farmers were in the position that, if they wanted credit, they were compelled to go to the Agricultural Credit Corporation and pay interest there at the rate of 6 per cent.  I know that was not the intended result and I know that such a step was never taken.  But the power was there and that is what did the damage.  When one is dealing with property, be it house property or land, one is dealing with a very delicate matter.  Any very vital step in the wrong direction spells ruination.  That particular section was the death knell of the Land Act of 1933.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>All the Land Acts, as I have said, were known by a particular section.  It was that particular section which made a particular Act remain in the minds of the tenant farmers as their charter.  A particular section of the Act of 1933 empowered the Land Commission to acquire any farm of land in Ireland.  I know perfectly well that it was never intended to take drastic action under that section. But the power was there and the banks picked on the significance of that particular section and refused to give credit to the farmers.  That, in turn, was linked up with another matter.  I do not want to discuss this matter in a controversal spirit but, contemporaneously with the passing of the 1933 Land Act, there was the economic war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of our farmers were financially embarrassed as a result of that.  When the economic war ended in 1938 they wanted credit. Some of them wanted extensive credit in order to restock their lands to make up the losses during the economic war. I make no comment upon that matter beyond stating that.  I merely draw the analogy.  Not one farmer in the country, generally speaking, could get credit in any bank in Ireland.  Before the passing of that Act a farmer could <Col N="946" /> always borrow £50 or £100 if two neighbours were prepared to back him.  He could get that sum in order to restock his lands if he had lost stock through disease and could not replace it out of his own resources.  Farmers could always get a loan like that and they always paid it back.  As a result of the provision in the 1933 Act they could get credit nowhere.</P>
      <P>There was some reference made here about the resettling of evicted tenants. In my own county evictions took place on a very considerable scale.  I am sorry to say that nothing at all has been done for the descendants of the evicted tenants.  I have a list of them in my own house.  I think the most generous thing to do, remembering all the talk there has been in the past about resettlement, is to draw a veil over the matter and forget about it. Nothing whatever has been done for them despite all the talk.</P>
      <P>Comment has been made on the powers given to officials to do certain things.  Surely Deputies will agree that it is ridiculous for them to be writing to the Land Commission about relatively unimportant matters in relation to which the local officials of the Land Commission are quite competent to give them information.  There is not a Deputy in the House who does not know the chief officer of the Land Commission in his respective county. He knows that officer is fully competent at his work because he knows the local facts.  I certainly would prefer to approach the man on the spot rather than help to build up files and increase expenses unnecessarily.  I certainly approve of that method as against that of delay, the creation of files and the building up of expenses and costs, when it could be done by the local officer.  There is a local officer in charge in my native county and I have every confidence in his integrity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Moylan thinks that the Land Commission is to come to an end.  I cannot foresee that.  It seems to be forgotten that under the Land Acts, particularly when it came to the Land Act of 1923, the entire operation of 300 landlords' offices in this country was amalgamated and centred in Merrion Street.  They were concerned <Col N="947" /> with anything at all from a turf bank upwards.  If somebody comes to me in Donegal and asks: &ldquo;Will you give me a bank of turf?&rdquo;  the answer will be: &ldquo;No, I cannot, until I see the Land Commission.  They have the final say about it.&rdquo;  Then the whirligig begins&mdash;I write to the local officer and the matter proceeds to Dublin.  It would be, perhaps, two years afterwards before the matter would be finally settled of whether or not a man is permitted to cut turf on my land.  I hold that that system is positively ridiculous.  In the past, those powers were vested in the landlord's agent. We collected all these small, infinitesimal things that were done down the country in the landlord's agent's office.  He attended to the question of turf banks and so forth and used his own discretion.  Surely, if a man can trust his bailiff to do that, this House can trust officials who have had long years of experience and of training, who have had a good education and who are men of the highest integrity to do all those things.  I think it is an excellent provision and that it is a matter which should have been attended to long ago.</P>
    <P>I cannot see the Land Commission going out to buy farms, say, at auctions, of 40, 50 or 60 acres and I do not see any difficulty in that respect.  What are you going to do with them?  I cannot see the possibility of the Land Commission subdividing a farm of 30, 40 or 50 acres. If there is a larger farm, and if the Land Commission considers that it is an amenity for the good development of some scheme they have already, I am quite prepared, as far as I am concerned, to trust the judgment and the integrity of the officers of the Land Commission in regard to the price they will offer.  However, I want to be assured, in giving my assent to that, that these men will not exercise any redeeming power.  Already, officers of the Department of Lands, when men have put up their farms for auction and the sale was completed and the conveyance prepared, said: &ldquo;You should not have sold it,&rdquo; and, as a consequence, the vendor would not <Col N="948" /> execute the deed.  The inference I draw from that is that the officers of the Department have already been instructed that they are to inquire as to the price that a man will accept for a farm of land that he is offering for sale and that they know he is offering for sale.</P>
    <P>In one particular case the sale was completed and the deed was prepared but the vendor would not execute the deed because the Land Commission officer had said to him: &ldquo;You should not have sold that farm.&rdquo;  What is the position?  Have we, on the one hand, a section in this Bill which purports that everything is free and open and, on the other hand, a state of affairs whereby the Land Commission, who purport to be there at the market to buy, will be there not only as a competitor but also with the power of veto in regard to anybody getting the holding against them?  That would nullify the whole thing because you can then destroy what you purport to give to the people from whom you are taking land by the way you are abolishing the redemption money, and you can destroy it otherwise by holding the price of land by this veto, at the same time pretending that there is absolute freedom.  I hope nothing of that kind will take place.  I want to issue that qualification in my subscribing to my acceptance of this Bill.</P>
    <P>There is nothing else of a very serious character.  That is a part of the matter which I like.  I am not concerned about the cost of it.  What I am ashamed of and the feeling of regret that I have is in respect of those people who have been thrown on the wayside in absolute poverty&mdash;people who for generations lived well, worked well, farmed well and who, through the operation of a State Department, were hurled on the roadside as if they had committed some major crime.  If they had committed treason they could not have been worse treated by the State. What can we say to those people?  I know that the Minister is not to blame. Nevertheless, these people have suffered&mdash;and at the hands of Departments set up by this House.  I feel remorse that I have been a member of this House all these years while these <Col N="949" /> things were taking place and that nothing was done for them.  However, it is well that the Minister has the sense of justice, at least in his time, to put an end to that state of affairs. Therefore, I congratulate him and I welcome this Bill.</P>

    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;be&rdquo; in line 24 to end of the section and substitute the words &ldquo;the preparation, dissemination, distribution and publication of articles and news of a high literary and cultural standard in the interests of the Republic of Ireland outside the State.&rdquo;&mdash;Peadar Cowan.</P>

      <P>When progress was reported on the last occasion this Bill was before this House, I was explaining to the Dáil my reasons why the amendment in my name should be accepted in preference to the sub-section as it stands.  I indicated that the section was dangerously wide and that it enabled this news agency to be operated for the dissemination of news within the jurisdiction of the State. I pointed out what I considered to be an objection to that in view of the observations made by the Minister on the Second Reading of the Bill, and the Minister invited me to quote what he had said on the Second Reading of the Bill with regard to that.  I find the Minister's observations reported in column 843 of the Dáil Debates of Wednesday, 13th July, 1949, Volume 117, No. 6:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I want to make it quite clear that it is inevitable that in any publicity, inside or outside the country, statements made by the Taoiseach or by myself, as Minister for External Affairs, are bound to get more publicity than any other statements.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those were the observations of the Minister to which, speaking from recollection, <Col N="950" /> I drew the attention of the House and I find that my recollection was quite good with regard to what the Minister did say.  What perturbed me about that is that at that stage of the Bill the Minister should consider it desirable or necessary to make such an observation that in any publicity inside or outside the country statements made by himself or by the Taoiseach were bound to get more publicity than any other statement.  Obviously the Minister must have been giving some consideration to the value of the news agency from the point of view of publicity for the Taoiseach and for himself because otherwise I could not imagine a statement like that being made on the Second Stage of the Bill. I think that the Minister made that statement clearly so that if in the future there are objections or comment about propaganda or publicity given by the news agency he would be in a position to say: &ldquo;Well, I warned the House clearly on the Second Reading of the Bill that it was inevitable that statements made by me were bound to get more publicity than other statements.&rdquo; This House would then be faced with the position that having heard that very clear statement from the Minister they had given him the Second Reading of the Bill.  I think, therefore, that it is undesirable and dangerous to agree to the sub-section as it stands, which says that the principal function of the agency shall be to ensure the collection, dissemination, publication and distribution of news and intelligence inside and outside the State.  My amendment would probably be too restrictive because it would limit the agency to articles and news of a high literary and cultural standard in the interests of the Republic of Ireland outside the State.  When, again on the Second Stage of the Bill, the Minister was queried as to what this news agency would produce he said, reported in the same volume on the same date at column 841:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I consider that the news agency, when in operation, should aim at issuing approximately anything from 500 to 1,000 words a day, reckoned with a view to the particular market where it is directed.  The news items should be selected to be of interest <Col N="951" /> in the particular part of the world to which they are being sent.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It was the Minister's view&mdash;and I take it that he had given some consideration to the matter&mdash;that this elaborate news agency would produce 500 to 1,000 words a day and that is not what one would call extensive writing.  I make a rough calculation that it would be about 750 to 800 words, in other words there would be produced by this news agency the amount of print that fits in one page of the Official Reports. There are approximately 800 words in one page of the Official Reports.  The Minister, therefore, visualised at that stage of the Bill that this elaborate machinery, which incidentally is going to cost us £25,000 a year, will produce an article each day about the size of one page of the Official Debates.  I felt that if that is the limit of production visualised by the Minister then clearly, on the lines of my amendment, it should be of a high literary and cultural standard.  I do not think it is asking too much of the gentlemen or ladies that the Minister will find to govern, advise and operate this news agency.  I think that the House should know clearly at this stage whether the Minister has revised his thoughts and views regarding the productive capacity of the news agency since he made that declaration on the Second Reading.  If he has not, this 500 to 1,000 words a day will cost roughly £500 a week and allowing people of the standard and quality the Minister has in mind to work a five-day week this production of 800 words will cost £100 a day.  If it is reasonable to ask for £100 a day, for 800 words, we ought to have a very high literary and cultural standard and that should be insisted on.  It is for those reasons that I put down that limitation in the amendment to which I am now speaking.</P>
    <P>At any rate, whether the Minister will continue to work on the lines of his original estimate or not, I think it is particularly dangerous to have the very wide powers that are contained in the section.</P>

      <P>We are discussing the objects of this news agency as set out <Col N="952" /> in the Bill, and to the sub-section of Section 7 which defines the objects of the agency both Deputy Cowan and myself have moved amendments.  These amendments may have technical defects, but the Minister cannot be unaware of the fact that the vagueness in the definition of the objects of the agency, in sub-section (2) of Section 7, has caused considerable anxiety amongst professional journalists.  I believe that all Deputies have received a communication from the Chairman of the Social and Welfare Committee of the National Union of Journalists, one of two trade unions of journalists operating here.  In the course of that circular, it is stated:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;National Union of Journalists members attached to the daily and periodical Press are perturbed by (a) the general air of vagueness which surrounds the manning, intentions and scope of the proposed agency; (b) the fact that the articles of association and memorandum have not yet been approved by the people's representatives in Dáil Éireann&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The circular continues:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c) the possibility that trade unionists who are not acquainted with the terms of the articles and memorandum may unwittingly support a matter that might eventually jeopardise the livelihood of trade union journalists; (d) the fact that the descriptive word &lsquo;news&rsquo; in the title of the proposed agency may bring about a position whereby foreign newspapers and magazines will be supplied with &lsquo;free news&rsquo; by civil servants, while trade union journalists who depend for a living on the dissemination of news to foreign journals will be forced into unemployment.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="953" /> The anxiety which professional journalists have over the wording of this sub-section arises in two forms.  The wording suggests that the news agency can engage in the publication of news inside Ireland.  The Minister explained that it was not the intention to trade in news here and that the reference to &ldquo;inside Ireland&rdquo; was necessary because of the wording of the sub-section, which refers not merely to the publication of news but also to its collection.</P>
    <P>The amendment which I framed was an effort to meet that argument and, while it may not be technically perfect, it is intended to ensure that the news agency will be limited by statute to the publication of news outside the country.  The Minister has said that that is its main, if not its sole, purpose. If there is any reason why it cannot be limited to that function by the terms of the section, then we should have at least from the Minister a very clear definition of the policy that he intended that the news agency should follow.</P>
    <P>The anxiety of journalists, however, is not merely due to the fact that the terms of the section appear to permit of it trading in news in Ireland.  There is a number of professional journalists in this country who make a living, or add to their livelihood, by acting as correspondents for foreign newspapers; and while the Minister may say that it is not intended to interfere with the practice of journalists as correspondents of foreign newspapers, it is anticipated that, in its effort to provide some sort of service for foreign newspapers, the agency will, in fact, be cutting across the work done now by professional journalists or, alternatively, that foreign newspapers occasionally desiring any feature story about Ireland will communicate with the agency for the purpose of getting such a story, rather than with the professional journalist whom they previously employed.</P>
    <P>The statement made by the Minister to the effect that the agency will not deal with &ldquo;hot news&rdquo;&mdash;that is, the type of news which a professional journalist will send to a newspaper, knowing that it will be welcome because <Col N="954" /> of its character&mdash;does not meet the case at all.  Most of the professional journalists who are earning a livelihood acting as correspondents for foreign newspapers are supplying a weekly letter, or a general review of events or, as I have already mentioned, writing commissioned articles.  As I understand the Minister's statement, that is precisely the type of thing that the agency is going to do.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister would be well advised to reconsider the terms of sub-section (2) if he desires to make it clear that this agency will not intervene in any part of the work now being done by professional journalists.  He will understand that Deputies here, and professional journalists and their trade unions, would prefer to have that limitation upon the functions of the agency expressed in the form of an amendment to the Bill rather than in a vague declaration made by the Minister during the course of the debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a good deal of repetition in the debate and the points made by Deputy Lemass are points that I also was going to make. I have a similar letter to that which he has quoted and if he had not read out the points I would have done so. To avoid repetition, I would merely ask the Minister to give some safeguard to journalists who are correspondents for newspapers outside this country that this Bill in no way will interfere with the additions that they may have to their earnings at home. Furthermore, if through any set of circumstances information is supplied by his Department to these news agencies, could he suggest some amendment that would give the journalists credit for such news, by having it sent out through the local representative of that paper who was resident in Dublin?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree that it is necessary to have an agency of some kind to put over news in foreign parts.  It is most annoying to find articles in continental papers, even American and English papers, that are detrimental to this country or to public men in this country, and which are not contradicted. Often I have been tempted to reply to some of these attacks and have decided, <Col N="955" /> on second thoughts, not to do so.  The Minister should take steps to ensure that any denials that are found necessary or any information that it is desired to give that would be of benefit to the country should go through the Irish representative of the paper in which it is proposed to publish the denial or information.  I would ask the Minister to see that any publication in any part of the world that is detrimental to this country will be contradicted, if he thinks contradiction is necessary.  There are large numbers of Irishmen all over the world.  It is difficult to get people here to appreciate that there are more Irishmen abroad than there are in Ireland. These people have a keen interest in this country.  I have been asked the question by Irishmen in Liverpool, London, Birmingham or the Continent or America: &ldquo;What are you people at home doing for us?&rdquo;  Recently, I was away from home and I was told to listen to a broadcast from a foreign country by a lady who, apparently, has a weekly half-hour programme from the particular station.  I was rather late for the programme but I understand that that person made a very dirty attack on this country, which caused indignation on the part of those who heard it.  It was their opinion that if such broadcasts could not be contradicted by permission of the international organisation controlling broadcasting, somebody representing this country should be authorised to broadcast a repudiation from the same station.</P>

      <P>I am not talking about Canada.  What I want to know is, if somebody has the right to go to a broadcasting station and indulge in an attack on this country, will the international organisation controlling that air line give this country ten minutes or half an hour in which to reply to the charges?  If it cannot be done that way, the news agency would be a good way of dealing with it.  At present we are doing nothing.  I have read in <Col N="956" /> newspapers and weekly journals from many parts of the world scurrilous arguments attacking this country and I have watched for months afterwards in the particular papers for a contradiction. Our countrymen abroad have to suffer the consequences of such publications or broadcasts.  It is nothing new.  Forty years ago I remember the point being made in another Parliament that the English Press was holding our public men of that time up to ridicule.  It was a terrific job to live it down.</P>

The Minister has been asked to see that they will get some credit for publications in the journals they represent.  I earnestly hope that the earliest opportunity will be taken to deny, if necessary, attacks upon this country in foreign papers or by foreign broadcasts and that people will not be allowed to get away with false statements that are harmful to Irishmen abroad.</P>

      <P>Is it suggested that the acceptance of Deputy Cowan's amendment by the Minister would automatically protect the association of journalists on whose behalf Deputy Lemass pleaded, because, if that is Deputy Lemass's argument, it seems to me to be the grossest insult to the journalists of this country to put forward the argument that articles of <Col N="957" /> high literary merit would not be handled by journalists and, therefore, it would not affect their livelihood?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very indebted to Deputy Byrne and Deputy Little for having raised this particular question. The very point which they both raised, of course, is one of the reasons why it would be fatal to limit the distribution or dissemination of news to places outside the country because, as Deputies know, when a corporation is limited, either by statute or by its memorandum and articles of association, to certain functions, it cannot go outside them.  The news agency would be precluded from disseminating news to correspondents over here.  That is one of the reasons why it is necessary to leave this provision in the Bill as presented to the House.</P>
      <P>In dealing with this particular point, another function which I hope the news agency will be able to fulfil will be to supply news to the short-wave broadcasting station, when it is operating. Much of the material which the news agency would issue would be material that would be useful also for the short-wave station.  In other words, it would be specialised material for America, for Australia and for places abroad, matters of particular interest there, matters of certain news value there.  For those two reasons alone, it is necessary that the news agency should have power to disseminate news within the country as well as without the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope, too, that on occasions the news agency may be of assistance to our own newspapers here in furnishing them with news items of Irish interest abroad which they at present do not receive.  There are a great many articles, a great many references to Ireland, that are of news value at home that very often do not get into the newspapers.  We try in the Department at the moment, but we are not equipped for that, to convey these to the newspapers whenever we come across them but there is no systematic organisation for distribution of matters <Col N="958" /> of that kind.  So that I hope the news agency may be in a position also to give news to our own papers here on matters of Irish interest abroad that are not of sufficient news value for the ordinary news agencies or which the ordinary news agencies miss for some reason or another.  That deals with that particular point.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass read a circular which he received, and which, I gather, some other Deputies received, from Mr. Brennan, who is chairman apparently of the social and welfare committee of the National Union of Journalists.  It is the first time I have seen the circular. I was away in Donegal and did not see it, but it may have reached my house while I was away.  I had the pleasure to-day of discussing the position with a deputation from the National Union of Journalists.  Their anxieties, quite naturally, were that, in so far as it was possible, the staffing of the news agency should be from members of the National Union of Journalists or some other recognised trade union.  I sympathise entirely with their views in that respect, and, in so far as I can possibly ensure it, I will ensure that only qualified and trained journalists are used in staffing the news agency.  The other matters mentioned in the circular were not raised as such by the deputation. I had seen a letter in papers and I mentioned some of the points in it, but the deputation did not seem to attach very much importance to them.</P>
    <P>What occurs to me is that the points which have been made by Deputy Lemass are all points which can be made against any news agency, and, on that basis, the journalists should oppose the formation of any news agency.  Reuter, Press Association, Associated Press and the United Press are all news agencies catering for news, but, in fact and in experience, it has been established that they do not in any way cut across the work which is available for what we might call freelance journalists or correspondents of individual newspapers.  I have no reason to think that the Irish news agency would in any way cut across the work which is being done by any Irish journalists at the moment. <Col N="959" /> As a matter of fact, I am quite certain it would not, but that, on the contrary, it would stimulate more work for journalists in Ireland.  At the moment, the position is that the supply of news from Ireland, apart from a few newspapers which have their own correspondents here, is left to the sole monopoly of news agencies which are not Irish, which are, in the main, English, and therefore most of the news emanating from Ireland emanates via London and that is the very evil which we want to try to remedy.  I imagine that the effect of the Irish news agency on other institutions and papers will be to stimulate their interest and their competition in the matter of supplying better news on Ireland.</P>
    <P>On the question of the type of news and the question of the need for this agency, I have here a number of articles&mdash;editorials and editorial comments&mdash;from American newspapers and from the <i>Manchester Guardian</i>, emphasising the need for the creation of this news agency and applauding the action of the Government in creating it.  If I may read to the House an extract from an editorial, it will possibly help to emphasise the reasons which make the creation of an Irish news agency so essential.  Here is an editorial in the <i>Gaelic American</i> of 23rd June of this year:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;For some time now, the official views of the Irish Government have not enjoyed the world-wide newspaper coverage to which they are entitled. Frankly, anti-Irish propaganda, skilfully presented from London, has robbed Irish views of widespread publicity.  The British are experts in this line.  They have taken every advantage of their position and the value of a London &lsquo;dateline.&rsquo; The result has been that Irish views remain in the background, and if published, come along long after the alert British Information Service have presented their views to the world.  That puts the officials of the Irish Republic at a great disadvantage, and they suffered from it in the formation of all important world public opinion.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="960" /> We have known for some time that the officials of the Dublin Government realised the disadvantages of this situation.  They have talked and considered means of meeting the problem for some time.  Now, they have decided to act and we are delighted. It was announced in Dublin this week that the Government contemplates the organisation of an Irish news agency.  For this purpose a Bill will be introduced in the Dáil making the news agency an official body which will supply official Irish news to the newspapers of the world.  The agency will give the official views of Ireland on all public affairs and will be ever alert and ready to counteract anti-Irish propaganda from whatever source it may come.  This should have been done years ago.  Had it been, much of the misunderstanding concerning Ireland and her views would have been avoided.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The <i>New York Inquirer</i> of June 27th carried a sub-editorial headed: &ldquo;Good News from Dublin&rdquo;:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Government of Ireland has decided to establish an Irish news agency for the purpose of furnishing Irish news to papers all over the world, to make known Ireland's views on public affairs, and to defeat anti-Irish propaganda.</P>
    <P>This decision is to be heartily commended.</P>
    <P>Ireland has suffered greatly from distortion, falsehood and suppression in the field of news dissemination concerning matters of the utmost importance to her.  She must make herself heard and understood by all the world with that success which is so necessary to the attainment of her absolute independence and so that she can gain and maintain for herself that high international standing to which she is so rightly entitled.</P>
    <P>The establishment of an official Irish news agency has been very long overdue.  Ireland's friends in the United States, who have observed the evils of anti-Irish propaganda in this country, are gratified by the action of the Irish Government.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have numerous other articles in the same strain.  I feel that from that point of view the importance of creating <Col N="961" /> an Irish news agency is obvious and it would defeat the purpose if the emission of news from Ireland were to be left the monopoly of news agencies which operate outside the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowan quoted what I said on Second Reading.  What I said was said in reply to suggestions made during the course of the debate that this news agency might be used for the purpose of giving undue publicity to members of the Government, to them or to their policy.  I dealt with that and pointed out that it was inevitable that members of the Government&mdash;the Taoiseach and myself in particular&mdash; were bound to receive more publicity abroad, in relation to statements made concerning Government policy, than other persons.  That is inevitable and I want to point out to the House that no matter who is Taoiseach or Minister for External Affairs, naturally their statements will receive wider publicity than the statements of other persons here.  That was the position under the last Government.  It is the position under this Government and it will be the position under future Governments.</P>

      <P>You cannot detract from a Minister the fact that he is Minister.  You cannot detract from the Head of the Government the fact that he is Head of the Government and you cannot represent abroad that the Minister for External Affairs is not Minister for External Affairs, no matter how much you may dislike him personally.  Deputy Cowan wielded an ingenious argument about 750 words. I should be extremely happy to think, or if I could feel satisfied, that this news agency was going to get 250 words published every day in the Press of the world.  It would pay extremely high dividends if we could ensure that.  I pointed out that I thought that the news agency should aim at furnishing from 500 to 1,000 words per day, for different parts of the world.  I have not totalled what the aggregate amount of words would be but it is quite obvious that matters that may be of news value in the United States may have absolutely no news value for Australia, Germany or England.  I <Col N="962" /> would feel that the news agency was fulfilling its task quite efficiently if it could provide 500 to 1,000 words, beamed on different parts of the world and specially prepared for consumption or use in different parts of the world.</P>
      <P>I do not think that I need deal seriously with the question of the proposed amendment to limit the material to be distributed by the news agency to articles and news of a high literary and cultural standard.  I do not know who would determine the highness of the literary or cultural standard.  I should feel very sorry for the unfortunate editors or sub-editors of the news agency if that onus were cast upon them by statute.  Besides, part of the functions of the news agency will be to deal also with political matters.  If it has to refute, as no doubt it will have to refute, various pieces of anti-Irish propaganda it will have to deal with political matters.</P>

      <P>The Minister should forthwith inform their papers that he is not establishing the type of agency to which these articles refer.  It is quite clear that these newspapers have been misled by the statements made by the Minister here into believing that it is a news agency, but if we accept the Minister's word, it is not going to deal with news at all.  It is really going to be a sort of extension of the information services of his Department.</P>

      <P>That is the Minister's speech as reported in columns 761-2 of the Dáil Debates of the 13th July last. A number of statements made by the Minister would appear to suggest that this organisation is going to deal with news as journalists understand that term, not merely with matters of a cultural, trade or general interest, which was the phrase he used when introducing the Bill.  He need not be getting annoyed.</P>

      <P>A very great part of the confusion that has arisen in the minds of Deputies and journalists, and in the minds of the editors of the <i>New York Inquirer</i> and the <i>Gaelic American</i> arose from the fact that this agency is being called a news agency.  These people thought of it as something which appears to be different from what the Minister has in mind.  If the Minister had not called it a news agency the conclusion might still exist but it would be very much less pronounced. He has spoken about supplying Irish newspapers with news on matter of Irish interest which the ordinary news agencies might not handle. There is no news agency supplying any Irish newspaper which will not supply that newspaper with any type of news it requires.  It is a common matter for a newspaper to direct one or other of <Col N="964" /> the agencies supplying it with news to cover matters of special Irish interest in the field of sport, culture, politics, trade or any other phase of news. Such special coverage is, I think, a regular feature of news agency work. If there is to be a service of news supplied to Irish newspapers from this agency dealing with matters of Irish interest, what form is that service going to take?  Will the newspapers be expected to pay for it?  Will they enter into a contract with this news agency as they enter into a contract with other agencies for a regular supply of news or for the supply of particular news or for the special coverage of events of a particular kind as they arise?</P>

      <P>It is quite clear, as I understand it, that this agency is not going to supply news in the accepted sense of the term to the <i>Gaelic American</i> or the <i>New York Inquirer</i> or any other newspaper but the general type of letter which these papers may get from professional journalists now, or should be getting from our diplomatic representatives abroad, just as we are getting them here from foreign diplomatic representatives accredited to this country.  If there is misrepresentation of the Irish position in newspapers abroad, have we not got people paid already to deal with it, either diplomatic representatives or Press <i>attachés</i>?  If the agency is to supply news to Irish newspapers, on what terms is it contemplated they will do so?  Will newspapers be expected to enter into a contract for the supply of the news, will they be expected only to pay for the news they use, or will they get news free?  Are not these question that should be answered before the Dáil passes the section?</P>
      <P>We are told that this agency will supply a news service to the short-wave broadcasting station.  As I understand it, Radio Éireann for its news service requires to employ whole-time journalists at present.  Is it intended that the short-wave station will not require the same service as Radio Éireann, that the journalists employed by Radio Éireann will not be able to assist in the work for the short-wave station, and that that work, in so far as it relates to the dissemination of news, will be so inadequate that it can be done on a part-time basis by people employed in the news agency whose main concern will be directed to work of another character?  If the short-wave station is to function as efficiently as Radio Éireann&mdash;and that does not reach a very high standard&mdash;in the matter of the distribution of news&mdash; then presumably it will require its own professional journalists to prepare its bulletins and to arrange for their publication, just as Radio Éireann does.</P>
      <P>The statement that news at present supplied to the world about Ireland comes from British agencies, while not quite correct, because there are other than British agencies operating here, again raises doubt.</P>

      <P>That statement again raises doubt as to what this agency is going to do.  Is it going to compete with the commercial agencies in the supply of news?  The trouble which Deputies have in understanding the purpose of the proposed agency is that the Minister is contradicting himself, because we all understood after the Second Reading debate that the agency was not going to compete with the commercial agencies in the supply of news.  Now, the clear implication of his remarks is that it will.  My amendments certainly were tabled, and I assume Deputy Cowan's also was tabled, for the purpose of clearing up the situation&mdash;to get the Minister to reveal to us what is in his mind.  It is what appears to be his deliberate vagueness which has given rise to all the suspicion attached to this proposal. We feel something is being submitted here which has ulterior motives behind it and, if the Minister wants to remove that suspicion, to make it clear that his proposal is above-board, he will have to be a great deal more frank than he has been.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of his reply, on the question of the danger of journalists being disemployed or losing a portion of their work, the Minister stated that the establishment of this agency would provide more work for journalists.  I presume that was an attempt to allay the fears of the National Union of Journalists and of some Deputies who spoke on behalf of journalists generally.  I should like to ask the Minister, having regard to the wording of this section and the whole tenor of his reply that journalists are not justifiably suspicious of this particular section, why he states that the agency may publish news and intelligence inside and outside this State.  I take it from that and from what the Minister stated that the news agency may supply direct to newspapers items of news and intelligence generally. Does not that in itself mean that ordinary journalists, apart from whatever journalists or civil servants will be employed on the news agency, will be cut <Col N="967" /> out from at least a certain portion of their work?  Everyone knows that newsprint is in short supply at present. So far as I can see, it does not appear that there will be much improvement in that respect in the near future.  Journalists from all over the country supply items of news to newspapers and, from want of space, it often happens that these items never get into the newspapers. Therefore, if this news agency is to be permitted to supply the newspapers of this country with items of news&mdash;and newspapers, I take it, will be more apt to accept items of news from the news agency than from the ordinary independent journalist&mdash;does not that necessarily imply that there will be less work for journalists as a result of the establishment of this agency?  I ask the Minister to clarify that point for me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is only right to call the attention of the House to the justification which we have just received from Deputy Lemass of the charges of vexatious obstruction which the Minister has made against him in relation to this Bill.  Deputies who were in the House when Deputy Lemass first intervened on this amendment will remember that the reason he gave for supporting the amendment and the reason which he said motivated him in putting down a somewhat similar amendment&mdash;I think amendment No. 11&mdash;was because he was afraid the livelihood of journalists in this country might be affected by the passing of the Bill.  Any Deputy who is in any way fair minded in his approach to this Bill might have sympathised with Deputy Lemass in putting up that viewpoint, particularly because of his interests in the newspaper world and because he had been approached on behalf of journalists to do so.  But the Minister met that point very fairly and made it quite clear to Deputy Lemass, Deputy Cowan, Deputy Byrne and others interested in this question that, as far as he could ensure it, he would see that this agency was staffed by qualified journalists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It was in the <Col N="968" /> Minister's reply.  Having been met very fairly with regard to the reason which motivated him in putting down the amendment, Deputy Lemass then trimmed his sails very quickly and decided that he would try to create a little bit of confusion in order to cause anxiety to journalists who might be affected and he gave out that type of nonsense to which we have just listened.  Deputies will remember that the Minister also, in reply to a question put by Deputy Little, did mention that there would be no difficulty at all in seeing that Irish journalists receive copies of whatever material is being made available by the news agency.  Deputy Lemass apparently overlooked that, and went on to attack precisely the opposite.  In other words, he was attacking the suggestion which had been made by Deputy Little.  Whatever confusion has arisen on this measure has been caused by Deputy Lemass alone, and it is because Deputy Lemass wanted to cause confusion.  Let there be no mistake about that.  Deputy Lemass wants to have the argument two ways: either the news agency is a fake and, consequently, it could not be supported by Deputies, or else the news agency is something that is going to be a success, and then it should not be supported by Deputies because it will endanger the livelihood of journalists.  Now Deputy Lemass cannot have it both ways.  If he would make up his mind and let us know what is in his mind on this, for whatever that is worth, then a certain amount of the confusion which he is endeavouring to cause will gradually creep out of this debate.</P>
      <P>The amendment which we are discussing is amendment No. 10.  It has been moved by Deputy Cowan.  It proposes that, in sub-section (2) of Section 7, instead of the words &ldquo;to ensure the collection, dissemination, distribution and publication of news and intelligence inside and outside the State&rdquo;, we should insert the words &ldquo;the preparation, dissemination, distribution and publication of articles and news of a high literary and cultural standard in the interests of the Republic of Ireland outside the State&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Cowan to this <Col N="969" /> extent, that I would like to see whatever is produced by or on behalf of the Irish news agency at least up to some standard of literary merit.  Deputy Cowan may be trying to kill this Bill by kindness.  He knows as well as I do the type of work which it is contemplated should be done.  There is really no need for any confusion about this. It was made quite clear on the Second Reading of the Bill.  I have not heard the matter discussed on this section, but it was made clear on the Second Reading that the type of work in which this agency will be interested will be in connection with Partition.  I do not want to discuss again the principle of the Bill.  I think Deputy Cowan will appreciate that the work to be produced by the agency must be of a type, and up to a standard, which will attract attention rather than that we should seek for flowery phrases or high literary merit, and particularly if there is any justification at all for Deputy Cowan's fears that in any event it does not matter a whole lot because it will go into the waste paper basket without it ever having been opened.</P>

      <P>My speeches are always pretty short.  The Deputy is confusing everything that Deputy Lemass has said.  There were several queries in the points that Deputy Lemass made. There is the question of journalists getting the news.  I assume that the news agency will give journalists, who <Col N="970" /> are correspondents for papers abroad, these items free.  Now, that has nothing to do with the newspapers in this country or with the other commercial news agencies, or the broadcasting station.  These are different matters. In the case of the broadcasting station, there will be a certain amount of overlapping. As a result of a considerable amount of care and trouble an excellent staff was established in the broadcasting station.  That was done through the channel of the Appointments Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not suggest that we should interfere in any way with the present news agency for the broadcasting station.  It is quite obvious that, in preparing a news service for the short wave station, it will have to be news of a completely different type from the news which we use on our own station here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>When the staff was being built up in the broadcasting station we had in mind that the news service on which a good deal of money was being spent, would also be used by the short wave station.  That being so, it seems to me that there is a certain amount of overlapping.  I think Deputy O'Higgins is just as confused in his mind on that as he is on other matters. I should say that he was obstructing in the debate more perhaps than anybody else.  What we want to get are answers to the questions which were asked by Deputy Lemass with regard to newspapers in this country and the commercial news agencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that the position is not being clarified, and that, in actual fact, it has become a little bit more cloudy and confused than it was. I think part of that arises from the fact that the Minister plunged into this idea of a news agency.  He gave us, on the Second Reading, certain ideas that he had in his mind as to what that news agency was to be, but having come up against some practical difficulties he has different ideas now.  I can understand the anxiety of journalists in regard to this position.  I understood from the Minister that he had an interview with representatives of the National Union of Journalists <Col N="971" /> to-day.  As a result of that interview, he told us that, in so far as he could do it, he would ensure that there would be qualified and trained journalists to staff the news agency.  Now, clearly that is not what he was asked to do by the National Union of Journalists. What he was asked to do was to staff it with trade union journalists which is a different thing.  It would be a simple matter for the Minister now to clear this up once and for all&mdash;for the House and for the journalists&mdash;by saying that this news agency will be staffed by trade union journalists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>If I did not say that when speaking, I certainly told the deputation to-day that, so far as I could influence it, it would be staffed by experienced trained journalists who were members of one or other of the unions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, he did not.  I took down what he said.  I wanted to have that point clear.  It is clear now that, in so far as the Minister can influence it, it will be staffed by trade union journalists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>That point is clear, that they will be trade union journalists. The other matter that concerns journalists is the point as to whether or not their livelihood will be affected by this agency.  The Minister has just said that he is going to make this available for the newspapers and I take it when he says &ldquo;newspapers&rdquo; he means the daily newspapers and the weekly newspapers.  If this is made available for the newspapers here, it is clear that a considerable amount of it will be used, particularly by the newspapers in the country, weekly newspapers. It is further clear that if it is used extensively it must affect employment on these newspapers; certainly it <Col N="972" /> must affect the employment of people who send particular articles to them.</P>
      <P>On the last day when we were discussing this there was some idea in the Minister's mind that journals might contract with the agency to buy material from it.  I do not know whether that is the Minister's viewpoint to-day.  I do not know if there is any point in that as to whether or not there will be a contract to purchase news from the news agency, or whether there is the idea that the Minister had in mind on the Second Reading, that this news would be circulated.</P>
      <P>On the Second Reading the Minister was asked a question on that point and he said that he then visualised that the news agency would be organised somewhat on the following lines:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There will be a small office here whose function it will be to select and rewrite items of news that are likely to be published, say, in America. These particular items will then be transmitted to a small distributing office in the United States.  The function of that distributing office will then be to transmit the news so received to the newspaper desks and news agencies in the neighbourhood. Likewise, in London I visualise a small receiving and transmitting office.  According as news is received from here, from the small central office here, news, say, for Australia or New Zealand, it will be transmitted to the London offices of the Australian and New Zealand Press. The same will apply to India, the British newspapers, the Canadian newspapers, and so on.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That clearly visualises a free distribution of news, and I gathered from the Minister to-night that, so far as our own journals are concerned, that is, the daily and weekly and monthly periodicals, there will be a free supply of news to them.  Obviously, journalists must have some concern in regard to that and that is one of the matters on which journalists, as I understand it, would like to have some assurance from the Minister now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, with regard to America, the Minister told us that there are 3,000 <Col N="973" /> to 4,000 newspapers there, that 700 of them are important, and that one of the principal functions of the news agency will be to place on the news desks of these 700 newspapers news of political, cultural, trading or tourist importance that would not otherwise be supplied to the news desks of these newspapers.  I take it the two journals, the <i>Gaelic American</i> and the <i>New York Inquirer</i> come within the category of the 700 important newspapers out of the 3,000 or 4,000 mentioned.</P>
    <P>The reason why I am so keen on either my own amendment or Deputy Lemass's amendment being adopted is that I can see serious danger in the future, if we pass the Bill with the section as it stands, because clearly there will be power there to flood the Irish newspapers with matters that may be of a difficult propaganda kind, and I want to avoid that.  The Minister may say he has no intention to do that, but, after all, Ministers and Governments change, and a Government does not necessarily follow what the preceding Government was doing or intended to do.  I can see that there would be a very serious and dangerous weapon in the hands of a future Minister for External Affairs who might be unscrupulous and that is why I think it is the duty of the House to protect the people against that danger.</P>
    <P>It is clear, I think, that we cannot hope to compete with some of the big news agencies that have been mentioned by the Minister.  The Minister said that the British news agency was a powerful one, but I gather from the extracts which he read from one of the American newspapers on the Second Reading that it was one of the complaints of Britain, great and powerful as she was pre-war, that they were not able to compete successfully in South America with a French news agency. Now, where do we stop?</P>
    <P>With regard to the cultural aspect&mdash; in relation to which Deputy O'Higgins has spoken rather kindly about my amendment&mdash;I understand that the directors the Minister proposes to appoint under this Bill will be civil servants.  The number of directors will be not less than three or more than five, and I understand it is the Minister's <Col N="974" /> intention to appoint civil servants to the positions.</P>

      <P>I do not believe that Myles na gCopaleen will be one of the directors of this.  We have now our staff of trained journalists.  We have the provision of 750 to 1,000 words per day.  Clearly those 750 or 1,000 words could not be permitted to be circulated without these three or five civil servants examining them very carefully. What then shall we get?  I think we are driven back to some of the descriptions applied by Deputy Lemass to this entire business.  I would ask the Minister to clear up the point now. Will these items prepared for circulation have to be approved on a Civil Service standard?</P>

      <P>Clearly, if they have, it is immaterial whether the Minister places them free on the tables of newspaper offices or distributes them from an aeroplane because they will never see print except in some poverty-stricken newspaper in the back of beyond. I ask the Minister to clear up that point now.  If the Minister will even go so far as saying that he is <Col N="975" /> prepared to consider the case made here and to endeavour to remove from the section those words which make it a menace and a danger in the future, then I think the House would accept that.  I ask the Minister to give the matter consideration and to tell us that he will remove from this section the extensive powers to which we have taken objection this evening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCann</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that the Minister has said nothing yet to allay the apprehensions of the journalists in this country.  Deputy O'Higgins said that Deputy Lemass was merely obstructing this Bill.  As I understand the position, I believe that the Minister met a deputation of the National Union of Journalists. On the last occasion here I spoke on behalf of those journalists.  I do so again to-night.  The Minister is sufficiently conversant with the working of newspaper offices to know that this Bill, if made an Act, will adversely affect journalists in relation to their livelihood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcCann" hpid="Mr. McCann Mr. McCann">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCann</NameTxt>
      <P>The apprehensions which I stated here.  One is the simple apprehension that these men's livelihood may be taken away either in whole or in part.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcCann" hpid="Mr. McCann Mr. McCann">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCann</NameTxt>
      <P>Because the Minister will send out news.  At one stage the Minister says that news will be free and the next moment he says that he hopes the agency will ultimately be a paying proposition.  I do not know what the Minister means.  The only thing I do know is that, if this Bill becomes an Act, journalists will be very seriously affected.  Why could the Minister not indicate to the journalists the particular papers in America, Australia, New Zealand or elsewhere that are prepared to take news of a certain type?  That would seem to be the obvious thing to do.  Is this to be merely a propaganda news agency?  If it is, then what is going to be done with the £50,000 collected at the church doors throughout the country for the <Col N="976" /> anti-Partition campaign?  One will cut across the other.</P>

      <P>The Minister says that he will safeguard the position by putting in journalists where possible.  I do not know what he means by that.  Will he be able to influence the employment of trade union journalists?  They are the words he used to-day to the deputation of the National Union of Journalists. That is not a guarantee.  The journalists want a guarantee that it will be staffed by trade union journalists.</P>

      <P>I am concerned with a matter to which Captain Cowan referred a moment ago.  That is, the board of control.  It does not come under this section, but I understand we shall have an opportunity of discussing it under another section.  I am interested in the advisory body.  These are the trimmings to make the Bill look all right in the public eye.  Will the Minister get down to hard facts? Will he tell us precisely what this agency will do?  What type of news will it disseminate?  There are journalists in this country who make an additional income out of sending news to other countries, such as those mentioned by the Minister.  The establishment of this agency will be a serious matter for them.  Is it right that Parliament should vote public money for the purpose of going into competition with these men?  I do not like the trend shown in this measure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to ask one question to clear up the position.  The Minister stated that trade union journalists would be employed.  When he met the deputation to-day did he satisfy them?  Is it his intention to bring in an amendment or to modify this Bill in such a way as would satisfy the representatives of the journalists?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no possibility of bringing in an amendment to the Bill to meet that position.  I told the National Union of Journalists, firstly, that I have had the privilege of being a member of the National Union of Journalists myself for a great many years.  I was probably the only member to go out on strike and picket a newspaper office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that I would, so far as I could, ensure that working experienced journalists who were members of a recognised trade union would be employed in the news agency.  I pointed out to them that it would be impossible to include an amendment to that effect in this Bill any more than it would be possible to include an amendment, say, in the Transport Bill, to provide that everybody employed by Córas Iompair Éireann would be a member of a given union.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>The nearest equivalent, I understand&mdash;I have not had an opportunity of looking into it&mdash;is a fair wage clause which is inserted in some circumstances.  I would be prepared to consider the insertion of a fair wage clause, but I do not see the necessity for it.  I cannot visualise that this news agency would refuse to pay the trade union rates of wages or salaries to those employed by it.  It is not <Col N="978" /> usual to include such clauses in the various Bills passed by this House setting up such companies.</P>
      <P>On the Second Reading I went very fully into the reasons which made the setting up of this news agency necessary. I outlined these reasons in detail. I outlined in detail the purposes which this news agency would fulfil&mdash; including the type of news it would issue.  I am afraid that I am driven to the conclusion that the attitude of the Opposition has been a deliberate attempt, to confuse, to mislead, and to obstruct.  I cannot take the amendments that have been put forward as serious amendments.  Deputy Lemass's aim has been to try to stir up suspicion and trouble in the minds of the journalists in Dublin.  I wish that he would see that the editors of his papers are members of a trade union before he speaks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcCann" hpid="Mr. McCann Mr. McCann">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCann</NameTxt>

      <P>Deputy Lemass has already done untold damage in this House on this Bill.  His remarks about &ldquo;a bogus company&rdquo; have been featured in the Unionist press in Belfast and will, no doubt, be utilised by the Unionist propaganda organisations in England and America later on.</P>

      <P>The position was set out extremely clearly when I was asked by the Leader of the Opposition some years ago to investigate the starting of an Irish news agency and when the considered view of the Government then was, as stated in a letter to me on the 30th November, 1945, as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The help given to any Irish agency would be so misrepresented publicly as to kill all hope of the agency ever succeeding.  It is for that reason that another course must be taken.  The agencies abroad to which you refer were helped either without public debate or at the time when the state of politics in the particular countries left the Government free to do a good, national act without it being made into a crime.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The attempts of the Opposition in this debate have been to confuse the issue, to try to stir suspicions in the minds of the journalists who have nothing to lose and everything to gain by the creation of such a news agency.</P>

      <P>These offices in the United States and in Great Britain are not merely going to be small distributing agencies.  They are going to be collecting agencies.  From whom are they going to collect the news?  Are they to maintain their correspondents in various parts of the world or are they going to get the news from existing news agencies?  A lot of what has been said in this debate has been irrelevant to the particular amendment. With regard to the question of the employment of trade union journalists, will the Minister agree to insert in this Bill exactly the same provision in relation to that matter as now exists in the Railways Acts?  Deputy Davin would, I think, accept that as being a reasonable safeguard, to ensure that the conditions of employment of journalists would be settled in accordance with agreements made with the trade union of journalists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister scoffed at the idea of the law relating to the railways but I would point out to him that that is the law relating to railways and I think that a similar provision in this Bill would meet completely the anxiety of journalists on that score.  But of course we are discussing here their <Col N="982" /> anxieties on other scores, not that score at all.  That point might arise on a subsequent amendment.  The point we are discussing relates to the work of the agency, not who is going to do the work, but the manner of doing the work.  Is it going to interfere with the additions to their incomes that professional journalists now have, many of them professional journalists employed on daily papers, in acting as correspondents for foreign newspapers and writing articles commissioned by foreign newspapers?</P>

      <P>Every appointment to any situation in the service of the agency shall be made by means of competitive examination conducted according to regulations to be made by the Civil Service Commissioners.</P>

      <P>From recollection, I can mention the Act which established <Col N="985" /> the Institute for Industrial Research. I think I am also correct in saying that a similar section appears in the Act which relates to the establishment of a National Stud Company.  There is certainly a number of the Acts of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Do the Civil Service Commissioners appoint the members of the staff of the National Stud Company? I would not like to think that they sit for a Civil Service examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us be clear as to what we are asking for.  It is that the appointment of the servants of the agency would be conducted by some competitive test in accordance with regulations made by the Civil Service Commissioners.  I do not know whether all Deputies feel that it is desirable that appointments to positions in organisations of this kind, established by statute and financed out of public funds, should be on the basis of merit. Assuming that there is agreement that it should be on the basis of merit, then, obviously, there must be some impartial method of determining the merits of applicants.  The Civil Service Commission was established to discharge that function in relation to the Civil Service and it is quite capable of discharging that function in relation to the staff of this news agency also.  Perhaps the Minister would tell the Dáil how he thinks the staff of the agency should be appointed, by what precise method of selection they are to be chosen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>The staff of the news agency will be appointed presumably by the directors, who will determine the manner in which they should be chosen.  I am not aware that similar provisions to that in the amendment exist in other statutes.  Even if they do, I do not think that a Civil Service examination or an examination laid down by the Civil Service Commissioners would be a suitable way of appointing newspapermen to positions in the news agency or as correspondents abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not aware that the Deputy, when he was Minister, was so careful <Col N="986" /> in the appointments under his régime, either in relation to the chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann or the general manager of Córas Iompair Éireann.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister examine the way in which the staffs on the radio were appointed?  It was certainly done in accordance with Civil Service regulations and done very effectively.  The examinations were conducted and the decisions were made on merits by a neutral body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's attitude is particularly childish.  May I say, for the purpose of the record, that I did not appoint either the chairman or the general manager of Córas Iompair Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>

    <Title>Private Deputies' Business. - Derating of Agricultural Land&mdash;Motion.</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That, in order to secure a more equitable system of financing local administration and to promote increased employment and production, Dáil Éireann is of opinion that agricultural land should be completely derated and, furthermore, that rates on houses and other property should be stabilised at a moderate and reasonable level.&rdquo;&mdash;(Deputies Cogan and P. O'Reilly.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as this Party is concerned, we are opposed to the motion moved by Deputy Cogan and seconded by Deputy O'Reilly and the amendments by Deputy Lehane and Deputy Corry, for the reason that we do not believe that the principles advocated in the motion will solve the problem of the cost of rates to the agricultural community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that the rates on agricultural land are getting to the stage when they are almost a blister on agricultural production.  If this motion were passed by the House, it would not solve the problem.  It would <Col N="989" /> mean that the money at present found on agricultural land would have to be found otherwise.  It would have to be found in taxation of one kind or another.  Probably it would mean taxation in the form of an increase in the price of unrationed tea, unrationed sugar or unrationed flour.  That is one way in which the money might be found if agricultural land were derated. We as a Party could not advocate or stand over such a policy.  There are many ways by which the agricultural community may be helped by a relief in the burden of rates other than by fully derating agricultural land.</P>
    <P>The case made by Deputy Cogan that agricultural land was derated in Northern Ireland was the weakest case that might be made for derating agricultural land.  We know that agricultural land has been derated in Northern Ireland.  We know also that in Northern Ireland they pay their full land annuities.  We know also that they pay a big portion of the cost of education, furthermore, that there has been a revaluation of agricultural buildings and other buildings in Northern Ireland and that valuations have gone up by 300 per cent.  We are aware that the farmers of Northern Ireland are paying in one way or another just as much per annum for their land as we are paying here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>They are getting £10 an acre subsidy, which is for a different purpose altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is derating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>They are getting a subsidy for their agricultural produce, because they plough certain land or something else.  We have other types of subsidies down here.  It is no harm to suggest to Deputies that, whatever is done in other countries, in Northern Ireland, England, Sweden, Norway, or anywhere else, this country and this Dáil make the plans we consider are in the best interests of the people of this country.  We are not, never have been and I hope never will be, influenced by what any other country <Col N="990" /> may do or how it may manage its affairs.  Deputies should cease quoting what is done in Britain, Northern Ireland, Scotland, Sweden, Norway or anywhere else as an example to us. Those who manage the affairs of this country are just as capable as the people of any other country of deciding what is in the best interests of our people.  In fact we are in a better position to do so.  It is belittling our institutions and our State to suggest that because they do a certain thing in other countries we should follow suit. It is time to stop talking like that.  It does not hold water and makes no case for derating agricultural land.</P>
      <P>It is true that owing to progressive increase in rates over the years the burden of rates on agriculture is a serious matter at present.  The indications are that the burden is not at its peak yet.  I want to suggest to the Government and to the House that one means of easing that burden would be to increase the present agricultural grant.  That is a direct and certain method.  The previous Government during their term substantially increased the agricultural grant.  I am not sure of the exact figures but the grant was increased when they took office and during the emergency it was doubled.  I would be safe in saying that the grant was increased by 250 per cent. of what it was when Fianna Fáil assumed office in 1932.  The Fianna Fáil Government were never remiss in taking into consideration the burden on agriculture owing to local rates and the increases due to housing, sanitation and all the other social services that were provided from time to time during their term of office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Only a few months ago, on the Finance Bill, in the Seanad, the present Minister for Finance made a very serious statement and I hope that his colleagues who keep him as Minister for Finance will take serious note of that statement and will see to it that future Budget to carry out the threat he made in that speech last May or June in respect of the agricultural grant.  It was a very significant statement. I hope that Deputy Cogan and those other Deputies who are helping <Col N="991" /> to keep the present Minister for Finance in office will see to it that, instead of decreasing the agricultural grant, next year the agricultural grant will be increased.  Deputy Cogan, Deputy Lehane and Deputy O'Reilly have it in their power.</P>

Deputy O'Higgins, I am sure, will not be averse from supporting Deputy Cogan, Deputy Lehane, Deputy Halliden, Deputy O'Reilly and other Deputies who would like, as we all would like, to see the burden on agricultural land reduced. He represents an agricultural constituency and understands the needs and has been told about the needs of the farmers there.  I am sure that he has been told that, as a result of action taken by the coalition Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;their rates have gone up considerably within the past year. I am sure that his constituents have informed him that, as a result of the withdrawal of certain moneys previously paid to county councils in relief of rates, for home assistance and other social services, the rates on agricultural land have been put up within the past year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's constituents are quite happy, thank you.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy will be only too happy to give his colleagues a hand in persuading the Minister for Finance to provide additional moneys for the agricultural grant next year to relieve farmers.  That is a far more equitable way of doing it than to relieve agricultural land completely of rates.  Agricultural land at present enjoys certain fairly substantial reliefs. They are given on the basis of employment&mdash;a sound basis&mdash;and all that is necessary is an increase in the funds provided each year in the Budget to enable relief to be given directly in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principle of rating in respect of any property is a sound principle.  All property, we in this Party believe, should contribute its just share towards the maintenance of the social services of the country.  The only question at issue is what is a fair share for any section of the community&mdash;for those <Col N="993" /> who have agricultural land and those who live in urban areas.  It is all-important at present, as it will be all-important in future, that the burden of rates on agricultural land should not be such as will retard production. Agriculture is a primary industry, producing the wealth of the country, and any increase in the burdens on agriculture must damage agricultural output. At the same time, the principle that all property, whether land, buildings or other property, should contribute towards the social services of the country is sound and one that should be maintained.  Agricultural land has no more right to claim complete exemption than has, say, the working man who is paying rates on his plot of land. Such land should not be fully derated, but should continue to pay its just share, a share, the paying of which will not injure it in any way.</P>
    <P>With regard to the amendment moved by Deputy Lehane, that there should be a fixed annual charge of not more than 7/6 in the £, I wonder whether the Deputy gave serious consideration to what the proposal might mean.  He is aware that, in many county council areas up to a year or so ago, the rates were not 7/6 in the £ on land, taking into consideration the agricultural grant.  The average rate is higher in the present year, but there are some counties in which the rates is not much over 7/6 in the £, if we take into consideration the agricultural grant.  Others are much higher, I know, and the signs are that there will be increases in future, and the Government must keep it under close observation.</P>
    <P>As local authorities continue to provide more houses, more sanitation and water schemes, and more social services in many directions the rates will tend to increase.  Like my colleague, Deputy Corry, I should like to protest against the policy which has been in operation since this Government took office of sending down cut and dried increases in the wages, salaries and so on, to local authorities.  That has been the fixed policy of this Government.  I think it is a dangerous policy and the two Ministers who are here at the moment will agree with me that it is <Col N="994" /> far from being a democratic policy. Local authorities had the experience within recent months of receiving from the Minister for Local Government, the Minister for Health and the Minister for Social Welfare circulars to the effect that the Minister was prepared to sanction increased allowances or salaries for certain types of officials, provided the local authority was prepared to raise the money.</P>
    <P>When such a circular came down local authorities had no option but to provide the money, and I want to protest against it.  I am sure that the Ministers who sent out these circulars never stopped to consider the effect of them.  We had a circular during the year from the Minister for Health, telling us that a certain type of official in our hospitals was to get a 96-hour fortnight. He seems to be hedging on that recently, as it would cost hundreds of thousands of pounds, it being directly a matter of expense for the Exchequer, but, inside a few years, these charges will come to be borne in part by the local rates.  Local authorities are given the function in that matter of providing taxation, and, where additional taxation is being put on local rates, it should not be put on directly by any Minister.  It is outside his duty and his function altogether and he has no authority in law to do so.  No Minister of the State has authority in law to fix the wages, salaries or allowances, except in certain specified cases, of local authority employees.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy will stand still for a moment, we will be able to get on.  Agricultural land is unable to bear the full burden of the agricultural rate at the present time and without the grants given under various Acts from the central authority, the burden would be altogether intolerable and <Col N="995" /> ratepayers would find it absolutely impossible to pay their rates.  As I have said before, the burden has reached breaking point and something must be done to lessen it.  I suggest that the way to do that is to increase the agricultural grants as the probability is that the rates will be further increased as local authorities continue to expand their services in the matter of housing and other amenities which they are bound to provide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government is concerned with the collection of rates and with the maintenance of public services like roads, housing, sanitation and health services.  He is fully aware of the fact that every house erected by a local authority puts an added burden on the agricultural community.  He is also aware that with the increased motor traffic more money has to be spent year after year on the roads.  He is further aware, I am sure, that in the present year, instead of increasing the amount of the road grant, this Government saw fit to reduce it. I hope that will not be repeated next year and that we shall see a big increase in the road grant in the coming spring.  Within a few short weeks the Government will be considering that matter and I hope that Deputy Cogan and those who are supporting this motion will use their good offices with the Minister for Local Government towards securing an increase in that grant.  Now is the time to insist that an increase should be given.  The cost of road maintenance has been increasing year by year.  Even in the present year local authorities have had no alternative to spending very large sums of money&mdash;much more than the ratepayers can afford&mdash;to maintain the roads in a fit condition to carry the traffic passing over them.  Motor traffic has almost doubled since the emergency ended and no roads, except tarred or concrete roads, can stand up to the heavy traffic which we see in every part of the country at present.  I therefore hope that those who are supporting this motion will see to it that something will be done in the way of providing direct grants from the Road Fund or in the way of increased agricultural grants to relieve this heavy <Col N="996" /> burden.  That is a much better way and a far safer way of dealing with this problem.  The ratepayers and farmers generally are prepared to play their part so far as possible; they have always done so and I am sure they will continue to do so as far as lies in their power.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture, on the last evening this motion was debated, told us that there was no necessity for any relief in the rates on agricultural land at the present time.  The Minister for Agriculture was one of those, with the Minister for Lands and other members of the present Government, who were always strongly in favour of derating in years past.  I am sure the Minister for Lands has the very same view to-day.</P>

I challenge anyone to deny that.  I make that statement very definitely.

Deputy Halliden from Cork was also always very interested in the derating of agricultural land.  He has advocated it in season and out of season for many years.  I am suggesting to Deputy Halliden that he and his colleague, Deputy Lehane, and the leader of their Party, the Minister for Lands, now have the matter in their hands and they have full power to give this much-needed relief to agriculture.</P>

      <Col N="998" /> I have no doubt that within a short time, as a result of the combined efforts of the farmers' group in the present Government, the farmers will get the much needed reliefs they have been crying out for and which this farmers' group has been advocating here in season and out of season when rates were not as high as they are to-day and when the price of agricultural produce was just as high or higher than it is to-day.  It would be an extraordinary thing to let this golden opportunity pass of getting this relief which they so much desire and which we all desire so much.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Keyes) Michael Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Keyes)</NameTxt>
      <P>This particular motion has been moved at various times over many years and has each time been defeated by whatever Government was in power.  The motion is unquestionably inspired by the idea of bringing relief to farmers and land owners, an object which undoubtedly has the support of everybody in the House. Deputies on all sides are desirous of helping the farmer and making him prosperous, but the best method of approaching the question would not appear to be a motion such as this, having regard to its fate each time it came before the House.  I suggest that all through that time it was desired to help the farmer because in helping the farmer naturally every Party was helping itself as the farmer controls the basic industry of the country and it is in the interest of the country as well as the farmer that he should be made as prosperous as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In moving this motion, Deputy Cogan seems to have raised doubts as to the efficacy of the particular method, because he suggested that, even if it were passed, it was not going to solve the problem nor even bring a great measure of relief to farmers, but he thought it would probably lead to a general revision of the system of rating.  Possibly, such a revision is necessary.  But the system of rating is pretty old now.  It has oftentimes been grumbled against.  The paying of rates is by no means a pleasurable duty at any time, nor is the paying of taxes, particularly if a person feels that he to pay or capable of paying in com-is charged in excess of what he is liable <Col N="999" /> parison with his fellows.  Sometimes, I suppose, farmers may feel a genuine grievance that their rating is too heavy for them, that they are not able to meet it, and that some other section of the community is getting away with it, but I think that, while figures are rather cold things, they will be fairly illuminating in this debate when I come to indicate the position that farmers occupy in comparison with other citizens.  I am sure farmers are not anxious to be put in a privileged position, to be constituted a sort of ascendancy.  They only want a reasonable and fair crack of the whip in order to get an opportunity to develop their land and to pull their weight as citizens in common with everyone else.</P>
    <P>The cost of this motion, if it were to be passed, would be something in the region of £7,000,000.  At the moment the agricultural grant has piled up to £3,962,000.  That grant has had a varied career.  It has been at different figures right through the years and it would be interesting to read them in order to show what it has reached now and to see how it has kept pace with the expenses and costings of the agricultural industry.  The grant was fixed at £599,011 under the 1898 Act.  In 1925 it was doubled, bringing the amount to £1,198,022.  In 1931 a further supplementary grant of £750,000 was added, bringing the total to £1,948,022.  In 1932, an additional sum of £250,000 was provided, to bring the total grant to £2,189,022.  The first reduction in the amount of the grant was effected in 1933 when the grant was reduced by £448,022 to £1,750,000.  In 1935, however, a sum of £220,000 was added to make a total grant of £1,970,000.  In the year 1936 the amount of the grant was again reduced, on this occasion by £100,000, to £1,870,000, at which figure it remained until the provisions of the 1946 Act came into operation in the financial year 1946-47.  The 1946 Act, in addition to increasing the grant substantially, made the fundamental change that a grant of a fixed amount was no longer provided.  Instead, it laid down that the grant would be the amount needed to give reliefs on the following basis: (1) A primary allowance at the rate of 3/5th of the general <Col N="1000" /> rate on land valuations not exceeding £20 and the first £20 of higher valuations; (2) a supplementary allowance of 1/5th of the general rate on the whole of the land valuation above £20; (3) an employment allowance calculated at the rate of 10/- in the £ on the land valuation above £20, subject to the limitation of £6 10s. 0d. for each man at work.</P>
    <P>With the inevitable increase in rates which is a feature of local expenditure, the grant under the Act of 1946 shows an annually increasing liability on the Exchequer.  The amount of the grant, as determined on the new basis provided for under the Act of 1946, amounted to £2,910,378 in 1946-47, £3,175,726 in 1947-48, and £3,624,035 in 1948-49.  That is to say, it increased by over £1,000,000 in the first year of operation of the new Act; in the second year it increased by a further £300,000, and it increased by a further £450,000 in the third year.  It is not yet possible to give a final figure in regard to the amount which will come in course of payment from the grant for the current financial year, but it appears likely to exceed £3,900,000.</P>
    <P>I suggest that at no time has there been neglect of the farmers' interests, and I consider that the continuance of this grant on an increasing and varying scale is a more equitable and fairer method of compensating the farmer than the proposed method of derating. On the basis upon which it is working now, it has had the effect of reducing the rating commitment of the farmer from an average rate of 22/7 to an average rate of 11/3¼ and the percentage that he contributes in rates as against his agricultural income is now 2.6.  The income of the agricultural community is returned at £119,000,000 and the rating contribution is 2.6 per cent.</P>
    <P>It was stated during the debate, rather glibly perhaps by Deputy Corry, that the Minister for Local Government, the Minister for Lands and the Minister for Health were, in the main, responsible for the heavy rate operating in recent times owing to circulars sent out from their Departments instructing, in a mandatory <Col N="1001" /> fashion, local authorities to pay increased rates of wages which had to be piled on the backs of the agricultural community.  I do not mind very much Deputy Corry making that statement. He was followed by Deputy Allen, but both Deputy Corry and Deputy Allen are, of course, perfectly aware that what they said is not so. No mandatory circular went out from my Department, and neither I am sure did such a circular go out from the other Departments.  A letter did go out, a paragraph from which I propose to quote in order to show the character of it:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Should any local authority wish to grant a special allowance by way of pension increase to any local pensioner of that authority who retired on an inclusive pension before the 1st of July, 1943, in accordance with the limits set out in this circular letter the Minister will raise no objection to the adoption of that course.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That circular suggests to the local authorities a ceiling figure beyond which they would not go.  There was nothing mandatory about it.  It was left to the discretion of the local authorities to grant the increase or not if they wished.  That was not by any means a new procedure.  A similar procedure had been adopted by the previous Administration, with this difference, that instead of sending a circular they sent an instruction to county managers in connection with salaries.  It put the county managers into a position which they felt was a rather awkward one, and they had to say that they were acting on the authority of the Government.  At no time did a circular of a mandatory character issue from my Department. We have too much respect for the local authorities to do that.  The representatives on the local authorities are the people to give or to refuse increases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I would say at no time did we send a circular out to try and fix a ceiling for workers' wages, and if there were many members on county councils actuated by the same viewpoint as Deputy Corry, such a procedure would be unnecessary and a waste of time, because Deputy Corry had his ceiling already fixed.</P>
      <P>Deputy Allen suggested that the agricultural grant ought to be increased. It has been.  The Fianna Fáil Party, of which Deputy Allen is a distinguished member, reduced the grant in 1933 and 1936, and it was not until 1946 or 1947 that they raised it again above the figure at which they had kept it for so many years.  Since that date the grant has been elastic and fluid to enable it to meet the farmer's difficulties.  It now stands at £3,962,000, and goes in direct relief to the agricultural community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Allen also referred to the reduction in the Road Fund grant, but he omitted completely from his mind the fact that the Local Authorities (Works) Act provides 100 per cent. direct relief from the Central Exchequer to the various local authorities to replace the Road Fund grant.  In the first year of its operation, that Act has been very widely availed of by local authorities, and is bringing big and definite reliefs to every section of the people throughout the country.  It has to be pointed out that if that trend goes on, as it has been going on, you will have an overloading of contributions and subsidies from the Central Fund with no corresponding equitable contributions from the elected representatives of the local authorities.  I think that would create a very undesirable position.  It would rob the local people of any authority and probably would vest in the central authority even more control and influence than that which Deputy Corry complains of.  With bigger contributions from the central authority there would be the tendency for it to see how the money was being spent, and a corresponding irresponsibility on the part of the elected representatives to spend more lavishly.  There would be no incentive to good housekeeping when they knew that the money was <Col N="1003" /> not coming from themselves but from the Central Fund.  I believe all that would create a very difficult position.</P>
    <P>At the present time I think that rating charges are being more than fairly met.  I have here a table which makes a comparison as between the amount of rates collected and the contributions made from the Central Fund.  In the year 1938-1939, State grants to local authorities amounted to £5,145,000; in the same year the amount of rates collected was £6,720,000.  In 1946-'47 State grants amounted to £7,269,000 while the rates collected amounted to £8,001,000.  In 1947-'48 State grants to local authorities amounted to £8,411,000 and the rates collected in the same year amounted to £8,800,000.  In 1948-'49 State grants to local authorities amounted to £10,749,000 (estimated) as against rates collected in the same year, £9,500,000 (estimated).  The total rates collected increased from £6,720,000 in 1938-'39 to £9,500,000 in 1948-'49.  The increase of 41 per cent. in the rates collected compares with an increase of more than 100 per cent. in the State grants to local authorities.</P>
    <P>I suggest, with all seriousness, to the mover of the motion, that the present trend of affairs is not by any means to the farmer's disadvantage.  I believe that the agricultural and other grants which are being made available to him on a generous scale compensate him for the responsibility he has to pay the rates on his land.  If this derating motion were to be carried it would mean transferring the rates charge from the farmer to the shoulders of somebody else.  Even if it were to be transferred, it would have to be made up again by taxation.  You would have to select the types of articles and goods which you would tax because of course you must avoid putting the charge back in some other form on the farmer.  If bread, sugar and tea had to be taxed further in order to bring in the sum required to meet derating the farmer as well as everybody else would have to pay his share of the tax.  You simply cannot tax things to do this which would mean hitting very hard the industrial and commercial workers in <Col N="1004" /> our cities and towns who, I am sure, already feel that they are paying sufficient in taxation.  The industrialists, I am sure, would not like to have all their extra profits handed over completely to provide revenue for the relief of the farmers.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the farmer who is paying his rates is a better man, a better citizen and a happier man and has a better right to have his voice heard on public boards under the present system&mdash;that is provided he gets reasonable relief from the Central Fund.  The Government are always prepared to have due regard to the importance of his work.  I suggest that derating is not a solution for this problem. I think a far better method has been adopted by the Government to make the land more profitable and productive for the farmer through the operation of the £40,000,000 land reclamation scheme which is being carried out by the Minister for Agriculture. It will provide a speedier way of helping the farmer than derating would.  It will enable him to make his land more productive.  It will also give him the opportunity of employing more people, and will provide him with relief in respect of the employment which he provides.  I do not think a case could be made and, even if this were granted, it would be a hardship on the general community.  Even if granted, I doubt if it would be an advantage to the farmers.  I think the present method is a better one.</P>
    <P>With regard to the amendment by Deputy Lehane, I do not know how it would be feasible to fix the limit of an agricultural rate.  The local authority have to bear their rates according to the circumstances they meet from year to year.  I have been on public boards for 25 years and I have never known a year in which we did not have a fluctuation of the rates.  Why should you fix a definite limit such as is suggested by Deputy Lehane at 7/6?  In my opinion, that would only create inequalities and difficulties that might not easily be overcome.  If you have a fixed rate of 7/6, then the agricultural grant would not rise in proportion to the increased costs the farmer may have to meet.  I believe it would be better to leave things in their present <Col N="1005" /> state.  If the county authorities strike a rate, the farmers are aware of the proportion of the agricultural grant they will receive.  If you have a fixed rate you will probably have a reduced agricultural grant.  I suggest there is nothing in that point that would bring relief to the farmers.  On the contrary, I believe it would raise very serious difficulties that would not be counteracted by the proposal in the motion or in the amendment.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is much more that I can say.  Nobody wants to inflict hardship on the farmers.  We have to have regard for the community as a whole, and I feel that the farmers themselves have that in their minds. The operation of this proposal would not be sufficient.  I suggest the Government are adopting methods which will tend to bring a speedy relief to the farmers in that there will be increased production, with consequent advantages, through the methods that have been proposed.  In these circumstances I believe that neither the motion nor the amendment would improve the position.</P>

      <P>This question of derating may seem very popular, but what the mover of the motion did not point out is where this money will come from.  As a Deputy from a western county, I cannot see my way to vote for a motion of this description. It is a well-known fact that the small farmers have the biggest families.  As the Minister pointed out, the money must come from somewhere else&mdash; something has to be taxed for it.  I fail to see how any Deputy could vote to relieve the rancher and tax the bread, butter and tea of the small farmer who rears a big family.  I think that the cutting of the grants was a bad thing. Every Government&mdash;I do not say this Government in particular&mdash;in giving money makes it conditional that there must be a contribution from the local body.  It is about time that practice should cease.  If Deputy Cogan or any other Deputy brings in a motion to relieve from taxation every acre that goes under the plough, I would be prepared to vote for it.</P>

      <P>I think that Deputy Cogan, by putting down a motion of this kind, whatever reception it may get from the House, has served a very useful purpose.  The whole question of rating is one for very serious consideration by the Government.  I take very grave exception to the statement made this evening by none other than Deputy Allen.  Speaking on behalf of the ratepayers he represents, he told the House that the vast majority of the farmers are not as well off as they were some years ago.  I say the farmers were never so well off in their lives as under the present Government.  Despite what Deputy Killilea and others have said, that is a fact.  He and other Deputies have been in Donegal for the past week or two.  Is it not a fact that in Donegal the farmers are getting 1/10 and, I am told, even 2/4 a lb. for their wool, whereas under the last Government they got only 3d. or 4d.? That is something worth while going into the pockets of the farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I represent as many farmers as any other Deputy and I say it would be most unfair if relief of rates was granted to one section of our people and not to other sections.  We must take into consideration the agricultural worker who lives in a county council or board of health cottage.  He is a ratepayer, and so is the road worker.  The business man, the professional man, whether he is a doctor or a solicitor or in any similar walk of life, is also a ratepayer, and it would be most unwise to grant relief to one section and put the taxation for it on the backs of the other sections.  I <Col N="1007" /> happen to be the chairman of a local authority and the position we have reached there is that we cannot put any additional burden on the ratepayers. The rates are severe on all sections.  Despite the fact that the farmer is in a better position to pay now, we must take into consideration that he has extra services to meet and he has to bear his share just as well as other sections of the community. Every county council that meets to consider estimates is confronted with a difficult task.</P>
    <P>Some measure of relief must come from the Government&mdash;if not from this Government, then from some other Government.  We did not get it from the last Government or the one that preceded it.  We must keep up the pressure until we get that measure of relief.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the mental and all the other hospitals should be taken off the local rates.  The social services should also be taken off the local rates and the main roads should be made a national charge.  In Leix we contribute generously to the upkeep of the main road from Dublin to Cork.  There is a heavier volume of traffic over that road, I believe, than there is in any other county.  The same applies to Kildare, parts of Tipperary and parts of North Cork.  I suggest that steps will have to be taken by the Government to relieve local authorities of these burdens.  Definitely they should be the responsibility of the Government. Also, as regards drainage, no contribution should be asked from local authorities.  This is another matter regarding which funds must come from the Government&mdash;from some central authority.  If these burdens were taken off the local authorities the rates would be light.  We are living under an out-of-date financial system.  We find it very difficult to work under that system.</P>

      <P>I am sorry the Minister for External Affairs has left the House.  He has been going through various parts of the country strongly advocating a change in our financial <Col N="1008" /> system.  I submit that if we want to see a real measure of relief the only way to get it is to tackle the financial system under which this country is endeavouring to exist.  I will remind the Government that a fair share of the rates paid by the farmers is being sent by the local authorities to the banks in the form of bank interest.  It is a most unfair interest; I believe it is altogether unjust.  Under our present monetary system the banks have their hands deep down in the trouser pockets of the community.</P>

The financial system is one of the pet subjects of the Clann na Poblachta Party and I suggest that, if that Party put down a motion on it, there would be no stronger supporter of that motion in the House than myself. What Government ever before spent £40,000,000 on a scheme to improve arable land?  That has been welcomed by every farmer and by other sections of the community as well.  The Minister for Local Government has pointed out that people take no great pleasure in paying rates.  We all know that.  But rates and taxes will have to be paid so long as we labour under our present financial system.  Until such time as the Government tackles that system we shall go deeper and deeper into the mire.  The root cause of all our troubles, as I said before, lies in our financial system.</P>

      <P>Derating has always been very popular but in my opinion the subject would need a much more careful examination than we have given it up to this.  If the agricultural community benefits by derating on to what section of the community will the increased burden be passed in order to make up the deficit?  A whole series of alternatives suggest themselves, but I do not propose to discuss them in the time at my disposal to-night.  None of us would like to relieve the land, as some Deputies have pointed out, at the expense of the labourers.  Again, the problem is one of direct taxation as against indirect taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, however, something to be said in favour of the motion.  There is an old saying that democracy must have representation where there is taxation. That is logical enough.  In recent years general franchise has been extended to local administration and all over 21 years of age now have representation on local authorities without the necessity of being ratepayers. One might argue from that, that since there is representation without taxation, we could have taxation without representation.  Taxation without representation would mean that the entire community, through the Central Fund, would have to contribute to the general maintenance of local administration.  Property and land would thereby be relieved of the burden of rates.  But this motion does not propose that all property should be relieved.  It proposes that only agricultural land should be relieved. I am afraid I could not go that far. There is an amendment which proposes to fix rates on agricultural land at a ceiling of 7/- in the £.  That, of course, is not a serious proposition but, in so far as it relates to a problem present all over the country, I would be inclined to support it.  I do not believe it is a practical propostion but there is an outcry all over the country against the increase in rates at the moment and there is a general feeling that, if these increases continue, there will be a breakdown.  I suggest that there must be some limitation upon rate increases.  Rates should not be allowed to go beyond a specific point. In my county we are paying a rate of <Col N="1010" /> £1 6s. 0d. or £1 8s. 0d. in the £.  My county is a poor county and the ratepayers are not able to bear the burden. In order to bring home to the Government that there must be some limitation on rates, I support this motion to the extent of voting upon the amendment, which does suggest a specific figure denoting the necessity for having a ceiling.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that the time limit has excluded a number of Deputies who might have added their plea in this matter.  First of all, I would like to compliment the Minister upon the able manner in which he met this motion.  He has made a reasonable case against it in so far as it is possible for anyone to make a case against a proposal of this kind.  The Minister has pointed out that I have introduced this motion, or a similar motion, on a number of occasions in the past.  In every Dáil of which I have been a member since 1938 I have put this proposal to the House.  On each occasion the motion has been defeated.  On each occasion Deputies, while expressing sympathy with the general principle laid down, invariably found fault with the terms of the motion.  I varied the wording from time to time in an effort, if possible, to meet the wishes of the House generally.  But on each occasion I found myself up against a wall of opposition.  It is difficult to understand why that should be so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Minister for Local Government was reasonable in his approach to this motion, I doubt if the Minister for Agriculture in the short period which he had at his disposal was equally reasonable.  He said that when he was in opposition he always supported derating because there was then a rotten Government in power but, now that he has come into power himself, he is opposed to it.  I think nothing is more immoral than for a public representative to make a solemn pledge to the people to do a certain thing and then, when he is in a position to do that thing, to blandly inform them that they have gained such an advantage by basking in the sunshine of his reign that there is no longer any obligation upon him to carry out his pledge.  It is time this House protested against <Col N="1011" /> such a flagrant abuse of democracy. Democracy cannot survive unless the elected representatives keep faith with the people.  I have kept faith in this particular respect with those who elected me.  On four occasions in four different Dáils I have put this proposal forward.  If the Minister for Agriculture was correct in stating that he supported derating when the Fianna Fáil Government was in power why did he not support a similar motion to this put forward in 1944 when Fianna Fáil was in a minority.</P>
    <P>That was the time to carry a proposal of this kind to the House.  At that time I put forward a motion which was similar, to all effects, to this.  Fianna Fáil voted against it but, in addition to Fianna Fáil voting against it, Deputy Dillon voted along with Fianna Fáil.  He walked into the Division Lobby with Deputy Martin Corry to vote against the proposal. Therefore, I say that there is no consistency in the attitude that the Minister for Agriculture has taken up. Deputy Allen has said that we should not compare conditions in Northern Ireland or in Great Britain with conditions here.  He overlooked the fact that the farmers of Ireland sell their produce in the same market as the farmers of Northern Ireland and Britain. They have to compete with those people and under disadvantageous conditions. The farmers of Northern Ireland and Great Britain not only enjoy complete derating but they enjoy substantial subsidies upon their tillage crops.  Irish farmers have to complete with them.  That is, I think, a condition of affairs which ought to be brought to an end.  I was glad to see that, from all sides of the House, there is an admission that rates are too high and that definite action must be taken to reduce them.</P>
    <P>I think there was a little misunderstanding, which I was unable to clear up, in regard to this motion.  This motion not only seeks to derate agricultural land but seeks to fix a ceiling upon rates on other property.  Therefore, it is not right to say that this was an attempt to relieve farmers at the expense of the rest of the community. <Col N="1012" /> It is an attempt to keep rates within a limit and under control.  I believe the time for that has come.  The Minister quoted startling figures showing the manner in which the burden of rates has increased year after year during the past 10 or 15 years.  I think his words prove how essential it is that this House should fix a statutory limit beyond which rates ought not to be increased.  I think everybody will agree that it is a highly dangerous thing that a locally elected body, representative of only a small area, should have the supreme function of deciding what direct contribution each citizen should make in the form of rates.  The fixing of direct taxation is a matter which should be reserved to the central Government.</P>
    <P>So many points have been raised in this motion that it is not easy to deal with them all.  I have consistently advocated rating reform over a long period. It is 21 years ago since 21 farmers came together in the City of Dublin and formed an organisation to press for the derating of agricultural land.  I was one of them.  Twenty-one years is a long time.  I have kept endeavouring to secure justice for the agricultural community.  People will ask where the money is to come from.  Twenty-one years ago they asked where the few millions that are necessary to finance derating were to be found.  Notwithstanding the fact that general taxation at that time amounted to not more than £25,000,000, people asked at that time where the additional money was to be found.  But, since then, a sum of £50,000,000 was found out of general taxation and still the farmers are bearing an excessive burden.  It is an excessive burden because rates, unlike general taxation, are a direct charge and the ratepayer has no option.  He has to pay, regardless of his means. There is no allowance made for the man with a small income, as there is in the case of income-tax.  There is no way of evading the tax as there is in regard to general taxation.  It is a direct burden and a direct tax on the most important classes of the nation&mdash;on the homes of our people and on the lands of our people.  Anybody who has given the matter serious consideration will <Col N="1013" /> acknowledge that the time has come when something definite and drastic ought to be done.</P>
    <P>I have great sympathy with the views expressed by Deputy Flanagan in respect of the burden imposed by the interest charges which local authorities have to pay for the moneys which they require for the necessary works of development.  I hope that this problem will be tackled and solved. I hope there will be a general revision of the whole policy in regard to the financing of national development works whether they are to be undertaken by the central authority or by the local authorities.</P>
    <P>While there have been a lot of very loud protests about this proposal to relieve the burden on the ratepayer&mdash; and the question has been asked from many sides of the House of where the money is to come from&mdash;nobody seems to ask where the huge sum required for the social welfare schemes is to be found.  Evidently, some means will be found to provide £4,000,000 in general taxation for that scheme and another £8,000,000 out of the pockets of the employers and employees.  Nobody seems to be alarmed about the amount of money involved there.  However, when it is a question of giving some little relief to the farmer everybody seems to cry out and ask where the money is to come from.  I have found out, when introducing this motion, that one way would be to cut down all extravagance in administration.  It is time a commission was appointed to supervise Government Departmental expenses generally.  I put a motion before the House, when the previous Government was in power, on that question.  I think it is essential that a searching inquiry should be made into every branch of Departmental expenditure in an effort to eliminate waste.</P>
    <P>In addition, I believe a substantial saving could be effected in the cost of money which the local authorities have <Col N="1014" /> to pay in the way of rates of interest. It is not fair to say that a farmer is getting an undue privilege or favour amongst the community.  We have only to consider the farmer's income as compared with the national income generally in order to be satisfied that the farmer is not extracting out of the sum of taxation or out of the national income an undue portion of the reward that is due to him.  The total net income from agriculture is only a little over £100,000,000.  That figure, divided among the whole farming community, gives an income of £3 per week for each person engaged in the industry&mdash; both farmers and workers.  I do not think that that figure is so huge that people should cry out that farmers are unduly prosperous.</P>
    <P>I was not satisfied with the figures the Minister for Agriculture set out before the House.  He compared exports of 1949 with exports of 1947. Those unfortunate farmers who lived through 1947&mdash;who knew the conditions during the harvest of 1946 and the winter of 1947&mdash;know that it was a miracle that there were any exports out of this country during the year 1947.  I think that there is a tendency to seek to put the farmers in the wrong and to exaggerate the farmers' profits, but I think that in matters of this kind it would pay Deputies to be reasonable. I am attempting to be reasonable in this motion and because of that and because of the reasonable way the Minister has met this question I am willing to accept the proposal of one Party.  It does not go very far but it will relieve the burden on the agricultural community and I hope that eventually there will be a general reduction in the whole burden on every section of the ratepayers.  I am, therefore, accepting the amendment to my motion.</P>
