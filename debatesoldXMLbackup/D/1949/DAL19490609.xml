      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Irish citizens temporarily employed in Great Britain are not liable to compulsory military service, but, if they become ordinarily resident in that country for a period of two years or upwards, they are liable to be called up under the provisions of the British National Service Act, <Col N="316" /> 1948, if they come within the statutory age limits and are not classified within any of the prescribed categories of exemption.</P>
      <P>Even if they are ordinarily resident in Great Britain for more than two years, Irish citizens do not incur liability under the British Act referred to if they are resident in Great Britain for a course of education or some other temporary purpose.</P>
      <P>Any Irish citizen who is called up under the Act, and raises objection on the ground of his Irish nationality, is free to avoid the liability by returning to this country.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice (a) if he is in a position to decide to limit the number of hackney licences being issued by the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána, and (b) whether he is aware that considerable hardship is being experienced by those who depend on hackney driving for a living by the issue of licences to persons who engage in it as a part-time occupation, and who are already in other employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to deal with Questions Nos. 6 and 7 together.</P>
      <P>Under the Road Traffic Act, 1933, licences for public service vehicles are issued by the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána, and the Commissioner is authorised to refuse an application for a licence only if he considers that the vehicle is not constructed and equipped in accordance with regulations made under the Act, or that it is not in a proper state of repair, or that the applicant, by reason of his character or previous conduct, is not a fit and proper person to hold a public service vehicle licence.</P>
      <P>Representations have been made to me that there are too many hackneys and taxis for the available business, and it has been suggested that I should introduce proposals for legislation to restrict the issue of new licences.  I have considered these representations carefully, but I consider that there would be serious objections to such legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that there is in his answer a departure from the principle of one man one job and that the people who are earning their livelihood wholetime in this occupation are prevented from engaging in it profitably by reason of the fact that persons who are engaged in it part-time are also engaged in other business?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think any such thing is implied in my reply.  There <Col N="319" /> is no condition at the moment under which the Commissioner can refuse any person who fulfils these statutory qualifications. I do not think I could apply a means test.  It would create more hardship than good.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that at the end of the emergency a number of members of the Defence Forces bought these vehicles as a means of making their livelihood? These men now find it impossible to make a livelihood because so many people in other employment&mdash;not as owners of the taxi business but actually in other employment&mdash;are engaging people to drive taxis for them.  It appears to be somewhat unfair that men who served their country and who spent their gratuity in buying vehicles of this kind now find themselves up against such competition.</P>

      <P>I regret that the financial position of Córas Iompair Éireann is such that it would not be possible to adopt a scheme of free transport for school children such as that suggested by the Deputy.  As I intimated in reply to a question in Dáil Éireann on the 25th May, certain issues affecting the extent of the fare concessions for school children are at present under <Col N="320" /> consideration by the transport company. The Deputy is, no doubt, aware that when approving of the recent increases in bus fares I made special conditions that the 2d. minimum fare should not apply to children under 14 years and that children should be carried at half-fare.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add at the end of the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Every regulation made under this section shall be laid on the Table of the Dáil as soon as may be after the making of such regulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister was introducing the Bill, he explained the necessity for the change proposed in Section 2 on the ground that, while the Act of 1927 gave the board wide powers of making regulations, the provisions of that Act were defective in various ways, particularly in so far as they made no <Col N="322" /> specific provision for the publication of regulations made by the board.  During the discussion on the Second Reading I inquired, but without success, as to how that position was being remedied by the substitution for the sections of the 1927 Act of the proposed section in this Bill, which itself makes no provision for the publication of the regulations by the board even when these regulations have been confirmed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce. I do not know if this amendment of mine, which provides for the laying of copies of regulations confirmed by the Minister on the Table of the Dáil, provides for sufficient publication to meet the legal objections to the provisions of the 1927 Act.</P>
    <P>One of the sections of the 1927 Act which is being repealed contains precisely the same provision for the tabling of regulations which I am proposing to insert here.  It is that fact which has left in my mind a doubt as to whether the defect of that Act is being remedied by the amendment.  If there is a question as to the validity of regulations made under the 1927 Act on the ground that there is no specific provision for the publication of those regulations, then that position can only be remedied by the inclusion of such a specific provision here.  That may be something more than I am proposing. In any event, I think the Dáil should press that regulations which are confirmed by the Minister should be laid on the Table of the Dáil.  By taking the power to confirm regulations made by the board, which the board previously could make on its own initiative without reference to the Minister, the Minister is putting himself in the position that he can now be questioned by the Dáil on the effect of these regulations in so far as he takes responsibility for them, and, if the Dáil is to fulfil that new function in relation to the board, it clearly must have the information which can be given only by the formal submission to it of the confirmed regulations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Cosgrave) Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Cosgrave)</NameTxt>
      <P>No doubt the Deputy is familiar with the reason for this <Col N="323" /> change&mdash;that regulations made by the board were not judicially noticed in the event of a dispute and an elaborate procedure had to be carried out under which, if the regulations were challenged, the secretary or some authorised officer of the board had to come to court to prove the regulations. Under the provision here it will be possible to have the regulations confirmed by the Minister and published by the Stationery Office, and the regulations so published, as statutes are published, will be accepted on production of a copy of the regulations or, in the case of a statute, a copy of the statute.</P>
      <P>So far as the Deputy's amendment is concerned, I do not think there is any objection to accepting it.  I think, however, it should be widened to include presentation to the Seanad as well as to the Dáil.  It is usual to include both Houses.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Certain observations made by the Minister last night created a doubt in my mind as to the exact significance of the section.  He referred to the fact that the section proposed to give the board power to make regulations relating to any aspect of its business.  Under the Act of 1927, the board was given power to make regulations, regulations which were required either to bring any part of the Act into effect or to define the procedure to be followed in relation to certain specified things, such as the acquisition of a private undertaking, the protection of the board's generating stations and transmission lines, or public safety.  I want to have it quite clearly stated that by the alteration of the law in the matter of the making of regulations by the board we are not altering the powers <Col N="324" /> of the board and that the regulations contemplated in this section are regulations defining procedure and not of a character which would be indistinguishable from legislation.</P>
      <P>By way of illustration I may mention the fact that last night the Minister referred to the 1945 Act for the purpose of showing that the wording of a section of that Act in the matter of giving the Minister power to amend regulations made by the board was similar to that proposed here.  His reference to it created a doubt in my mind.  The particular part of the 1945 Act to which, the Minister referred was one which was intended to set forth the general conditions that would apply in relation to all hydro-electric schemes proposed by the board.  Previous to that Act, a separate Bill had to be produced and passed by the Dáil whenever the board undertook the establishment of a new hydro-electric station.  It was hoped that the work of the board would be speeded up by having one general Act setting out the provisions which would apply to all hydro-electric stations and providing merely for the drafting of the proposals to be approved by the Minister and for their publication to the people of the affected districts.  I take it that nothing we are doing here is giving the board power to amend that law, to alter the provision of the 1945 Act regarding the publication of proposals for new stations or modifying the provision of the Act as to the manner of publication.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary will satisfy me if he says that what we are doing here is merely changing the manner in which the powers previously exercised by the board will be exercised and that, in fact, we are not giving the board any new power or in any way giving it authority under this section to modify the duties or the functions conferred upon it by previous legislation.</P>

If there is a dispute between the Minister and the board he may return the regulations to the board for amendment. It does not impose the Minister on the board in any way in so far as the carrying out of these regulations is concerned or in so far as the 1945 Act is concerned.  However, a similar power exists in the 1945 Act under which when the board submits a scheme to the Minister for the generation of electricity he may confirm it or return it to the board for amendment if he thinks proper.  Actually this section has no direct connection with that but the same power is conveyed.</P>

      <P>When the amendments to this section were being discussed last night Deputy Lehane&mdash;I do not want to misconstrue what he said&mdash; gave me to understand, at least, that the section that is now being proposed met a point of view held by his colleagues <Col N="326" /> and himself that the Minister would now have responsibility to the House in answering for the activities of the Electricity Supply Board.  It appears to me from what the Parliamentary Secretary says now, that is not the case nor the intention.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to make it clear to the House.  Last night I said that I strongly agreed with the point of view suggested by Deputy Larkin and Deputy Lehane that the time had come when this House should have a right, through the Minister, to question certain of the activities of the board.  It would appear to me from what the Parliamentary Secretary now says that the section in no way will alter the situation that hitherto existed and that the Minister will still be in a position to say in answer to a question put by anybody in this House that he has no responsibility.  I should like to get that clear now and I think Deputy Lehane ought to get it clear.  It is no use letting the section go because we may think it means something when, in fact, it means something else.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to be frank with the House and make it quite clear.</P>

There may be a big difference of opinion between the views I hold on this and those held by my colleagues on this side of the House.  I feel it is wrong for this board and other boards to be in a position where they can command whatever they require in the shape of finance from the State, where they control certain conditions of every single person of the State when we get the rural electrification scheme <Col N="327" /> through.  The public, through their representatives, are going to have no rights of protection.  Deputy Sir John Esmonde mentioned that they are going to be entitled to introduce new offences.  They have powers under the existing Act which I object to very much of entering into people's houses, disconnecting services and inflicting sheer hardship in the shape of charges on people.  I think they are going beyond what they are entitled to do.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary is it not possible for members of the House to ask questions concerning the activities of the board under any circumstances? For instance, my colleagues have drawn attention to the fact that there is a system of collection in the Electricity Supply Board where, if the tenants are not in at the given moment when the collector calls, in many cases it has been proved that not alone did they take action against them but they cut off the light there and then.  People in Crumlin, Kimmage, Drumcondra and Whitehall at very short notice have had their light cut off completely. Then, when the light is to be reinstalled, the Electricity Supply Board demand that they pay £2 2s. 0d.</P>

      <P>I would like to say&mdash; this is a purely personal opinion&mdash;that I am very much inclined to the same view as that expressed by Deputy Larkin, Deputy Briscoe and Deputy Lehane unless the section goes further and gives to this House, to some extent, a reins on the Electricity Supply Board without, of course, defeating the purpose <Col N="328" /> of the section.  I think that some of the regulations under which the Electricity Supply Board act at the moment merit very close investigation. Where these regulations turn out to be penal and to inflict a hardship, then I think the Electricity Supply Board should be accountable to this House.  I should be glad if the Parliamentary Secretary would let us know whether or not some of us are right in thinking that, in this section, there is the possibility of this House, through the Minister, being able to keep a practical check on the Electricity Supply Board. If that is not so, then my personal view is that now is the time&mdash;or on the Report Stage&mdash;to put before this House some amendment that will give power to it to inquire into some of the activities of this board when it considers it necessary to do so.</P>

      <P>I think it would be unwise for Deputies to read into this section less than what is in it, and that it would be equally unwise for them to read into it more than is in it.  As I see the section, it empowers the board to make regulations in connection with the various purposes set out in paragraphs (a) and (b) inasmuch as sub-section (2) confers on the Minister the responsibility of confirming those regulations.  In so far as any future regulations are made and are so confirmed by the Minister, the Minister will be amenable to this House in respect of them.  I think that is the effect of the section.  I would not like to be taken as being dogmatic about it, but it appears to me to be abundantly clear that it confers that power and does not go any further.  I certainly would view with horror the position wherein very minor matters could be raised here.  I am afraid that some of the matters to which Deputy Alfred Byrne referred would come within that category, and, as I say, I would view with horror the position where the time of this House would be spent in discussing matters of very minor detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think in so far as the broad general regulations are concerned, that as these will, under this section, be confirmed in future by the Minister, <Col N="329" /> then to that extent the Minister will be amenable to this House for the regulations so confirmed by him.  I must confess that, on a more mature reading of the Bill, it does not go as far as I would like it to go in making this corporation completely amenable to this House, but, as I say, I think, in so far as any future regulations confirmed by the Minister are concerned, that then the Minister will be responsible to this House in respect of them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that Deputy Sir John Esmonde drew attention to a very important matter when he referred to sub-section (6) which, in effect, gives the board, with the authority of the Minister, the power to create summary offences&mdash;to make any citizen liable to be brought to court under these regulations and be fined the sum of £10.  I think that, before power of that kind is given, it should be given only after very serious consideration and that it should not be permitted to get into a section which deals with the power to make regulations. The power to create offences is one which, I think, should be taken completely out of this section and put in as a separate section.  That separate section should then be open to discussion by itself.  This is a section which gives power to make regulations, but while that is so, it contains a sub-section which gives power to the board to create summary offences.  I think that the Parliamentary Secretary might, between this and the Report Stage, recast this section by eliminating from it that particular sub-section and put it in as a new section to be considered by the House.  I think that Deputy Alfred Byrne drew attention to a very important matter in regard to some of the things that are done by the Electricity Supply Board.  I think it is wise that this House should have the right to examine regulations so made and to see that powers of the kind mentioned were not given to the board. For example, the officials of the board may arrive at a person's house because that person, through absence from home, or for some other reason, has not paid his bill.  The officials arrive and the person there and then tenders the cash due to the board.  The officials <Col N="330" /> say that they have no power to take it, that all the power they have is to cut off the light.  Such a thing as that has happened to my own knowledge. I think it is right that this House should have the power to review regulations of that kind.</P>
      <P>Sub-section (7) disturbs me somewhat because here we are providing that regulations may be made by the board with the approval of the Minister, and that those regulations will be laid on the Table of the two Houses and will be subject to a motion which any Deputy or Senator may wish to bring forward in regard to them.  Sub-section (7) states that:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Any regulations which were made by the board ... and which were in force immediately before the passing of the Act shall be regarded as regulations under this section and shall continue in force.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That means that they do not require approval by the Minister and that they are not open for consideration by any member of the Oireachtas.  I take objection to the way in which sub-section (7) is framed.  I think that the Parliamentary Secretary should put a limit to the period during which those regulations will remain in force, and that period, I submit, should be written into the section, and further, that after that date, only the new regulations made by the board, and approved by the Minister and made available for inspection by members of this House, would be in force.  I submit these objections to the Parliamentary Secretary for his consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that if we accept what Deputy Cowan has just said we are going to create very grave difficulties because, in the main, these are working regulations and were made for the purpose of enabling the Electricity Supply Board to carry on its day-to-day business.  There is another point that Deputy Cowan referred to.  If we are to regard any regulation already made as still being effective and in force, if it is to be regarded as a regulation under this section, and if we accept, further, that in so far as new regulations are made they will be <Col N="331" /> laid on the Table of the House&mdash;we would all agree with that&mdash;then we would be entitled to direct questions to the responsible Minister so far as the old regulations are concerned; but would we not be equally entitled to address questions to him in respect of previously made regulations now given the effect of regulations made under this section?</P>
      <P>I do not want to press this particular matter of Ministerial responsibility to the extent that Deputy Briscoe does, especially in regard to some of the objections that he has raised.  I say that because here we are not just dealing with the Electricity Supply Board, but with a very important question of public policy&mdash;the relationship between the Legislature and bodies under State control or bodies established by the State, as well as the form of the control that should exist between the Government, the public representatives and those bodies.  I think it would be wrong to deal with an issue of that magnitude on an amending Bill which deals only with superannuation.  I think that, if we are going to discuss that particular question, we should do so on a much broader plan with a full understanding of what we are doing. I think that on this occasion we can go this far, that to the extent to which the Minister confirms regulations I think we are entitled to direct questions to him in respect of the matters covered by those regulations.  I do not think that we are entitled to go outside of that.  There is also the point to be considered that, under sub-section (7), we would be afforded the right to address questions to the Minister in respect of regulations previously made by the board and now given the same force as the regulations that will be made under this amending Bill when it becomes law.  I think that is a point we might have cleared.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of the questions raised, particularly by Deputy Briscoe, go to the root of the relationship between State companies and the responsible Minister.  I think the best approach to that matter is one which leaves the question of policy to be decided by the Minister and the day-to-day <Col N="332" /> administration to the board set up under the enactment establishing the company or the corporation.</P>
      <P>As to whether fixed charges should be brought before the Dáil for discussion, and the manner in which the board's officials cut off connections, I think that is a matter of day-to-day administration.  I do not think Deputies will suggest that if a customer cases to pay for the service which he is getting he should continue to get free service.  There will be certain cases where the board or their officials may be a little bit abrupt in dealing with the public, but I think, generally speaking, they give adequate time to people who fail to meet their obligations in respect of payment for current used.  I do not think anyone will suggest that any State company should provide a service unless the public are prepared to pay for it.</P>
      <P>General policy can be reviewed when the annual accounts are laid on the Table of the House.  That will afford the Dáil at least one opportunity every year to discuss policy and the general working of the Electricity Supply Board.  In between that there may be at any time amending legislation, but assuming there is no such legislation from one year to another, the Dáil will still have an opportunity of discussing these matters.  Any Deputy can table a motion to have the accounts discussed, and that affords an adequate opportunity to discuss the general policy.  Under this section, whatever regulations are made will be laid on the Table and Deputies can discuss them.</P>
      <P>What Deputy Larkin says about past regulations is correct&mdash;these will be in the same position as regulations to be made in the future.  As the Deputy pointed out, quite a number of these regulations deal with ordinary day-to-day working matters that no one other than the board and the people directly concerned would be interested in.  For that reason the objections of Deputy Cowan to Section 2 (7) are not very valid.  This section merely continues the existing regulations and instead of being in force under Sections 33 and 34 of the 1927 Act they will be in force under Section 2 of this Bill.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1) to insert after the word &ldquo;employment&rdquo; in paragraph (b), line 11, the words: &ldquo;or would have been entitled to such gratuity but for the fact that he had less than two years' service&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the section is to give a free pension to certain employees of the board who were previously employed by the Dublin Corporation in connection with the running of the Pigeon House station.  It will, perhaps, help Deputies to understand the purpose of this, and another amendment which I shall move later, if I explain what happened when the Pigeon House station was taken over by the Electricity Supply Board.  At that time the Pigeon House station was run by the Dublin Corporation and staffed by officials of the Dublin Corporation who, as such, had pension rights.  When the Electricity Supply Board took over the Pigeon House it closed it down and the employees of the Pigeon House were dismissed.  Those who had five years' service, or more, got pensions appropriate to their length of service.  Those who had less than five years but more than two years' service got compensation by way of gratuities.  Those who had less than two years' service got nothing.  The purpose of this section is to give free pensions to those who were compensated by way of gratuity on loss of employment by the closing down of the Pigeon House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By earlier legislation we had ensured the rate of pension for the employees of the Electricity Supply Board who <Col N="336" /> had been transferred from the service of local authorities.  These persons who were disemployed in 1929 and compensated by way of gratuity were in that category, even though they may not have established at that time rights to pensions under the Dublin Corporation scheme.  I do not know upon what basis it was then decided that those who had less than two years' service should receive no compensation at all. My information is that there are only three such persons now in the service of the Electricity Supply Board and it seems to me rather harsh to exclude them from this section.  When they entered the service of the Dublin Corporation as workers in the Pigeon House they thought they were entering into permanent and pensionable employment; and certainly it would have been permanent and pensionable but for the fact that the Pigeon House was taken over by the Electricity Supply Board.  Presumably, the decision to exclude from compensation by way of gratuity those who had less than two years' service was a decision arrived at arbitrarily, probably under the influence of the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>There is no logical basis to justify giving compensation by way of gratuity to a man who had two-and-a-half years' service and denying it to a man who had one-and-a-half year's service when the gratuity was calculated in accordance with length of service.  I propose later that, in determining the amount of the free pension to be given those who were compensated by way of gratuity for service given prior to the acquisition of the Pigeon House should also be taken into account.  But the purpose of my amendment is to get that same right of free pension for those who got no compensation because they had less than two years' service. There are only three such persons to my knowledge still in the service of the Electricity Supply Board.  It seems both unfair and illogical to exclude them from the same benefits which those persons compensated by way of gratuity are now receiving under the section.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that we are now trying to tie up some loose <Col N="337" /> ends since the Act of 1942, even to the extent of an individual case.  The plea made by Deputy Lemass for dealing with the two or three remaining cases of those men who were in the Pigeon House and who fell, so to speak, between two stools, should receive sympathetic consideration.  The superannuation scheme has now been in operation for some years.  It has naturally been discovered that there are some weaknesses and defects.  A number of such have come to light and the Minister now wants to remedy them by this Bill.  I think we should utilise this opportunity to get rid of all the loose ends left.  I think the number left is so small that these men could properly be dealt with under this Bill and we shall thereby get rid of one of the existing difficulties.  These men had service in the corporation. Naturally, when they were taken over, they expected that they would remain in pensionable employment.  If they had remained in the service of the Dublin Corporation they would have qualified to become members of the clerical staff at the expiration of two years' service.  That was their normal expectation in the corporation.  I think it would be harsh to stick to a rigid period of two years to the disadvantage of this small group concerned.  If the Minister can see his way to doing so, I would suggest that he should accept the amendment in order to clear up these odd cases.</P>

Since we are on the question of tying up loose ends, to use Deputy Larkin's expression. I want to raise the problem of another set of employees who were also rather harshly affected.  Not more than five are concerned.  If this legislation is taken advantage of, they will have a grievance remedied in their favour.  The case to which I refer is that of a number of young men who entered the employment of the old Dublin United Tramways Company as trainee engineers before the Pigeon House station was taken over.  The old company had a scheme under which <Col N="338" /> these young engineers were dispersed throughout a number of electrical workshops in the city for the purpose of training.  Unfortunately, when the Pigeon House was taken over, their services were not required and they were excluded from the Act.</P>

      <P>They were employees of the Dublin United Tramways Company, but they did not come-under the first Act.  They are only five in number and they merely ask for an adjustment in so far as credit may be given for that service for superannuation purposes.  The maximum service excluded from them is ten years.  If they are credited with that service, their contributions, which are very high for pension purposes, will be reduced and when the pension ultimately accrues it will be of more material advantage to them.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary, in conjunction with Deputy Lemass, to consider these five employees, who are now designated as operators and particulars about whom are with the Department.</P>

      <P>As Deputy Lemass says, it is rather illogical that persons who have less than two years' service should receive no gratuity while those who had two years or two and a half years got a gratuity.  Whatever the reason for that distinction, however, there is a difference between the people who got a gratuity and were subsequently re-employed and those who got a pension.  In so far as the pension is concerned, the pre-employment period with the old Pigeon House and the subsequent period with the board are reckoned and the contributions are accordingly abated.  In so far as the gratuity is concerned, there is no way of abating contributions.  The person gets the gratuity and that is that.  The board cannot recover.  It may not be easy, therefore, to make up the full period of service from the point of view <Col N="339" /> of contributions.  However, in view of the fact that there are only two or three persons involved, I shall have this matter examined between now and the Report Stage and also the position of the operatives to whom Deputy O'Sullivan referred.</P>

      <P>To delete paragraph (b) of sub-section (6) and to substitute therefor:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the service of a person to whom this section applies shall be taken to be the aggregate of:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  his service in the employment of former undertaker,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="340" /> (ii)  his continuous service (both before and after the passing of this Act) in the employment of the board.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment relates to the same matter we have been discussing but from a different point of view.  Those who were employees of the Dublin Corporation, on the transfer of the service to the Electricity Supply Board, are entitled now to a free pension.  They had a right of pension in the Dublin Corporation service and they have similar pension rights in the board service.  Those who were employed in the Pigeon House and who had more than five years' service when the Pigeon House was closed are entitled to a pension in respect of their earlier service and a free pension in respect to their later employment under the board.  Those who had less than five years' service there got compensation by way of gratuity and are now going to get a free pension as from the date the Pigeon House was reopened. Having drawn the gratuity paid in 1929. it is now held that they have no claim for pension for their service prior to 1929.  While it is possible to say that that is a logical course to follow, taking it from the ordinary human aspect, it is likely that the comparatively small gratuity which these men got in 1929 was completely absorbed in maintaining themselves during the period in which they were out of employment between the closing and the reopening of the Pigeon House and in no way represented a fund which they invested and which would increase their income on retirement later.</P>
    <P>The proposal in the amendment therefore is that, in determining the amount of pension which these men will get under this section, not merely should their service with the board be taken into account but also the two or three years which they had as servants of the Dublin Corporation in the Pigeon House before it was closed in 1929, even if they have already got the gratuity provided for in that year.  I have said that I admit that the fact that they got that gratuity appears on the face of it to be legitimate ground for dating their pension <Col N="341" /> from the date of re-employment but we all know that there was no permanent accession to the income of these men by reason of getting that gratuity which was, in fact, a comparatively small sum and which was absorbed in maintaining them while they were awaiting re-employment. Again the number is comparatively small and, while the Parliamentary Secretary may tell me that this Bill is as I framed it myself before the change of Government, I think we should clear up that situation because otherwise there is going to be a continuing sense of grievance amongst a comparatively small section who have long since forgotten the benefits they received by reason of the gratuity payment 20 years ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>If this amendment were accepted, it would mean that these persons would not only be compensated by way of pension for past services but would also be compensated by way of gratuity.  I do not think there is any justification for that. Although I agree with the Deputy that anyone who was compensated by way of gratuity some years ago probably absorbed that gratuity during the period he was out of employment, if this amendment were accepted he would be entitled to receive a pension in respect of a period for which he has already received a gratuity.  It would be quite exceptional to give double compensation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit that it would be quite exceptional but, in so far as we are going now further than we originally intended in the matter of clearing up the situation resulting from the transfer of employees from the Dublin Corporation to the Electricity Supply Board, we should try to make a complete job of it.  These men had service with the Dublin Corporation and, if the Pigeon House had never been taken over by the Electricity Supply Board, they would have remained in the service of the corporation and they would have been entitled to a pension calculated on the basis of their whole service from the first date of their employment.  The closing of the Pigeon House, therefore, was a disaster for them.  The mere fact that they got a <Col N="342" /> certain sum into their hands by way of compensation is of no benefit to them now.  What they are facing now is that they are going to retire on a smaller pension than that to which they would have been entitled if they had remained in the service of the Dublin Corporation.  They are being comparatively worse treated than those who have a slightly longer service with the Dublin Corporation and who will get a pension in respect of that service.  That pension is in suspension at the moment, but it will be payable to them when they retire. Those who had five years' service will get the full pension whereas those who had only four and a half years' service will get a pension calculated only from the date of the reopening of the Pigeon House.  The amount involved is very small and I think it would be far better to remove any sense of grievance which may exist amongst these men.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose the amount is small but it would be rather exceptional to give both a gratuity and a pension in respect of any service. While it is true that the conditions of these people were worsened by the closing of the Pigeon House, the fact is that they received a gratuity in respect of that.  The amendment would not only create an anomaly in this Bill inasmuch as these employees who were working in the Pigeon House would get a gratuity and a pension, but it would also set up a very bad precedent for legislation dealing with other matters.  It would be regarded as a very bad precedent and might involve other companies.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Parliamentary Secretary that if it was a question of double compensation serious difficulties would arise but, as Deputy Lemass said, the circumstances are not likely to be repeated and, in fact, if one takes the facts as I understand them, there is not double compensation.  I speak subject to correction, but I understand that on the <Col N="343" /> termination of their employment under the old Dublin Corporation these employees were given a certain nominal compensation for the period they had worked.  Then they were out of employment for some time owing to the temporary closing of the Pigeon House, and, if I am right, that compensation given at that time was to be regarded as compensation for the immediate damage done to them at that particular time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite understand that, but now you have to look forward to their position <i>in futuro.</i> The question of calculating their pension rights and the question of a pension to enable them to subsist during the days of their retirement are two different matters.  It is not a question of compensating them if one regards the compensation awarded in the past as compensation for abnormal damage to them personally at that time.  If one relates the compensation given at that time to the abnormal damage, I think one can make sufficient distinction for the future.  I am just suggesting that as a way out for the Parliamentary Secretary, having regard to the difficulty he might be in if we were creating a precedent.  The circumstances, as Deputy Lemass said, are altogether peculiar.  The numbers involved are small and if we make it quite clear that we are acting in relation to that abnormal circumstance we create no precedent.  It all arises from the fact that, having terminated their service, there was a hiatus in their employment although they did go back to the board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody thought at that time that electricity was going to become in such general use and the board, no more than anyone else, was shortsighted in that.  When the Pigeon House closed gratuities were paid in respect of short service and pensions in respect of longer service.  This would involve that those who got gratuities in respect of previous employment with the board and were again employed by the Electricity Supply Board and re-employed in the Pigeon House would be entitled to pension and gratuity, that is double compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The actual gratuity paid at that time did not much more than pay them for the period they were out of work.  Look at the actual picture with regard to their service. In the case of any man who had a certain service with Dublin Corporation, had the situation continued for him as he would have expected it to do, if this Parliament had not interfered by setting up the Electricity Supply Board and conferring certain powers on them, he would have looked forward to continuous employment from the date of the commencement of his employment with the corporation up to the date he would retire, which would be approximately the date at which he would retire now.  As his situation was prior to the interference by this Parliament in his affairs in the various Acts, he would have looked forward to a period of continuous remuneration for the work he would have done and&mdash;I am not conversant with this&mdash;probably a pension to follow.  If not, the outlook has changed on that matter in the meantime so that whether he would have expected a pension or not does not matter to the argument.  That was his position and that was what he expected.  In fact what happened?  In fact, through <Col N="345" /> causes over which he had no control, as Deputy Lemass said, circumstances changed and he was thrown out of work.  Not only were his expectations defeated but he was thrown out.  The gratuity given to him did very little more than compensate him for that unemployment period.</P>
      <P>Out of that gratuity therefore you must deduct, at the very best from the Minister's point of view, the remuneration he would have got during that period of unemployment in the ordinary course of events.  Make that deduction and you have nothing left.  He has got no compensation, certainly no comparable compensation to compensate him for that period of unemployment. Whether he would have got a pension under his old conditions or not is immaterial because the outlook has changed here and he would have been entitled to the benefit of that change in the matter.  He is now to be regarded as being merely in the position of an employee with so many years' service from the date of the commencement of his employment and anything he got was merely remuneration for the period he was out of work.  If that is a fair, equitable and factual picture of the situation, there is no difficulty in making the legal picture and there in no difficulty about the principle having regard to the abnormal facts. I would press, in conjunction with other Deputies such as Deputy Cowan, that the Parliamentary Secretary should at least reserve the matter for the Report Stage and consider it.  These people are entitled to consideration.  Otherwise you are going to leave them in the position of being victimised as a result of changes made for the benefit of the community at large.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like to be taken as opposing the rights of these people, but I do not think that Deputy de Valera painted the picture accurately. The picture is that these people on the date of the closing of the Pigeon House were disemployed.  Some by reason of the length of their service were entitled to a pension while some with shorter service were given a gratuity.  When the Pigeon House closed they were left in this position: <Col N="346" />&ldquo;You have been given a certain amount for your service and it is now a question for yourself to find alternative employment and make a new start in life.&rdquo;  I think we are overlooking the fact that this might create, as the Parliamentary Secretary says, a serious precedent.  One analogy that occurs to my mind probably strikes Deputy Traynor.  A certain type of service was given by legal officers in the Army who subsequently became district justices. They got a gratuity on the cessation of their service as legal officers and an effort by them afterwards to have that service recommended as pensionable service as district justices was resisted on the basis that they had already been compensated for their period in the Army.  The same position must obtain here.  No matter what the circumstances were subsequent to the discontinuance of their employment, a gratuity was paid by way of compensation for the service they had given under the old Dublin Corporation.  It was given on the basis that there was a cessation of employment and the fact that subsequently, on the maturer judgment of the board, the Pigeon House was reopened and they were re-employed was, I think, a fortunate circumstance for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the very time the compensation was paid, that possibility was not very prominent to their minds.  My knowledge of the case is very limited, but I know people who were disemployed in the Pigeon House at that time and, in the belief that it would not be reopened, they sought completely alternative employment.  Therefore, even though there may be sympathetic merits for the case and I, like other Deputies, might feel that in a generous mood these loose ends might be tied up, I am inclined to submit to the view of the Parliamentary Secretary that to do it in this way might be creating a precedent.  There may be an alternative way, without crystallising it into this actual Bill, by which the board, by regulations which it may make subsequently, if the Minister is disposed to be sympathetic in this way, could add a certain number of years' service in lieu of that, if they so liked.  It <Col N="347" /> would, however, be a dangerous precedent to put into legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HarryColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the amendment.  I do not think the case quoted by Deputy Collins is definitely on all-fours with the case of these men.  It was not due to the action of this House that those people were changed in their employment nor were they actually thrown out of employment through the action of this House.  At the time this took place, I happened to have some personal knowledge of it.  Any man who was under the corporation in the Pigeon House at the time would be automatically entitled to permanency of service after two years and to pension rights.  If he had continued under the corporation, those pension rights held.  Instead of that, through the action of this House, those men were actually thrown on the street, and the amount of compensation they got would not at all cover them, as has been mentioned here.  It only barely covered them for the period of unemployment, if it did even that, and it did not cover them for loss of rights.  I cannot see that it would create a precedent for such cases as mentioned by Deputy Collins.  Our first duty is to do right by these men.  It was the action of this House that brought it about; we have an opportunity now to settle it, and it is our duty to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">

      <P>I think the Deputy has slightly misunderstood what I am driving at.  It is not the fact that these men should be compensated or anything made up to them that I am opposing.  I am in complete sympathy with the idea.  My only objection is that we may be making this the thin edge of the wedge&mdash;if we grant one group of people this, others will interpret it as a type of double compensation and it may cause agitation of another nature which we do not want. My suggestion to the Parliamentary Secretary is that it may be possible to do this in a less conspicuous way and still have the same effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>There is this difference straight away from Deputy Collins' argument.  To take the <Col N="348" /> example he has quoted, in the first instance the employment was of a temporary nature, where a gratuity was given.  It was a temporary one, and one that automatically determined the gratuity or compensation which was given in respect of the time already lost and the opportunities lost owing to service in the Army rather than anything in the nature of compensation covering future periods.  With regard to the subsequent appointment the Deputy mentioned, these are appointments which, of their very nature, cannot be related to any particular duration in time.  They simply start from whatever day the person happens to be appointed.  You have two very distinguishing facts in the illustration the Deputy gave to differentiate them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The point that Deputy Colley has made is fundamental. Here were these people with permanent, pensionable employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The expectation of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the expectation was there.  Everyone who knows the Dublin Corporation system knows that once a person is in satisfactory employment there it becomes permanent employment.  That being the position, there was a break, or an interference which brought a break.  The compensation was hardly anything more than would remunerate them for the actual break.  Therefore, at the end of it, on re-employment, they were no better off than they had been.  In other words, the compensation given at that time, taken together with their re-employment, did nothing more than restore them to the position in which they were.  Therefore, having regard to that and, if necessary, to the change in our outlook to which I have referred already, they were clearly entitled to reckon their pensionable period from the beginning to the end.  I think there is no difficulty in making an equitable distinction and, if one can make a clear cut equitable distinction in the matter, such as we can make on the facts here, there should be no difficulty about making a legal distinction, <Col N="349" /> and there is no reason why a technicality should prevent it.</P>

      <P>It is only when looked at in retrospect that there was disruption of employment.  When compensation was paid to those people, their employment had ceased, the Pigeon House was closed, and in respect of the period of service they were given gratuities.  Subsequently, when the Pigeon House was reopened, they were re-employed.  Some of them had pensions and the pensionable employees became entitled subsequently to pensions in respect of the previous employment and are now entitled to pensions in respect of the period served since.  Those who were entitled to gratuities are entitled to pensions from the date of their re-employment and got gratuities in respect of the previous period.</P>

      <P>The situation in which these men found themselves was, more or less, brought about, I believe, by an over-estimation by the officers of the Electricity Supply Board at that particular period.  They believed, and honestly believed, that they would be able to produce more than sufficient current through the medium of the <Col N="350" /> Shannon at that particular time and that the necessity for the Pigeon House would not arise.  As a result of that miscalculation, these men found themselves unemployed.  There can be no doubt about it that they did not go voluntarily from the corporation.  I have a very clear recollection of the particular period, when some of these men made representations to those of us who were members of the corporation in order to secure them in their position in the corporation.  They felt that it was not in their interest to have themselves transferred.  However, they were transferred in due-course and, through this miscalculation, in the course of time they found themselves unemployed.</P>
      <P>I understand that the period for which the Pigeon House was closed was a rather brief one&mdash;I think it only ran into months.  The gratuity which they received could very easily be regarded as being merely the equivalent of what many employers give to their employees, in lieu of notice.  It is a very usual procedure for an employer to give a sum of money in lieu of notice and I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to regard the situation as being something like that and not to allow himself to be overawed by the fact that this is a precedent.  If a precedent stands between us and our doing something which we believe is right, I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary will not let it stand in the way.  All we are doing here is asking him to defer judgment at the moment and to have it examined and if, after examination, he feels that he cannot accede to the request made by Deputies, we shall have to accept his judgment.</P>

      <P>I am entirely in agreement with Deputy Traynor's attitude to that extent, and, in so far as it is possible to re-examine the case in a sympathetic way, I will urge the Parliamentary Secretary to do so.  The only reason I made my argument at all is that there is a danger, looking at it from the purely legal point of view, that, where you create a precedent in one way, you will create bulges in another way, and you will have people feeling, even though their cases are not <Col N="351" /> and could not be on all-fours with this, that they have a grievance.  I wonder if the Parliamentary Secretary could examine it with officials of the Electricity Supply Board with a view to finding some way in which he could tell the House that the matter was being looked after by the board in their own normal way rather than to have it enacted as a principle in the Bill.  If the Parliamentary Secretary explores that possibility, he will possibly be able to meet the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>May I draw the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to something which is not clear to me? We have here two groups of men&mdash;one group to whom pensions were given on the cessation of their employment and another group to whom a gratuity was given.  It is proposed in the Bill that we should allow these persons to have their service counted from the date of their re-employment by the board and the point at issue is the creating of the precedent of giving double credit for the same service.  I happened to look at the White Paper which has been circulated and, in regard to this group of men who went out and who were given pensions, I take it that they spent their pensions while unemployed, and I notice that on their reabsorption into the employment their pensions were abated and their new pensions were to be calculated upon the aggregate service (a) up to the closing of the station, and (b) from the date of re-employment <Col N="352" /> to the date of final retirement.  Does that mean that they did, in fact, draw pensions in cash during their period of unemployment which they spent and now are to have their service calculated for pension purposes on the basis of their service prior to the closing of the station?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <P>The White Paper says that the pension already awarded at the time of the closing of the station was to be terminated and a fresh pension substituted, the latter being based upon the aggregate service (a) up to the closing of the station, and (b) from the date of re-employment to the date of final retirement.  If we substitute &ldquo;gratuity&rdquo; for &ldquo;pension&rdquo;. it is exactly the case we are discussing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned on the Second Reading that, as the Government were proposing to go ahead with this legislation, which reopens to some extent the question of pension rights of persons who entered the board's service from the service of other electricity undertakings, it was inevitable that claims would be forthcoming from <Col N="353" /> those who were not covered by existing legislation.  The position, as I understand it, is that those who transferred to the board's service from pensionable service with local authorities have, under legislation promoted by the Minister for Local Government, the right to a pension from the board equivalent to what they would have got from the local authorities.</P>
      <P>Those who are in the board's service and who entered it from the service of local authorities but had not got pension rights on the date of the transfer have also been given pension rights, if the employees of the local authorities which previously employed them have since got pension rights. Section 15 of the 1942 Act gave the board power to supplement the contributory pension of persons who entered the board's service from the service of authorised electricity undertakings where the amount of the contributory pension, by reason of the age of the employee on the date on which the scheme came into operation, would, in the opinion of the board, be unduly low, or the contributions he would have to pay to get an adequate pension would be unduly high.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are people who entered the board's service from the service of electricity undertakings which went out of business because of the establishment of the Electricity Supply Board for whom there is no provision and who are, I think, even excluded from the provisions of Section 15 of the 1942 Act.  I have in mind particularly the former employees of the power station of the Dublin United Tramways Company. Deputy M. O'Sullivan referred to certain trainees of the Dublin United Tramways Company, and their case appears to be a special one, but there are ordinary workers who were employed in the Dublin United Tramways Company power-house and who are now in the service of the Electricity Supply Board.  It is true that the company could have continued to operate its power-house and that its successor, Córas Iompair Éireann, could have continued to do so, but, in fact, the Electricity Supply Board were keen to get that business of supplying <Col N="354" /> power for the Dublin trams, and, when in a position to undertake the supply, quoted a price for electricity which was lower than the tramways company could produce it for itself and, in fact, a price which involved the board in a loss.  As a result, the Dublin United Tramways Company took the offer and went over to the Electricity Supply Board supply and shut down their power-house.  The employees of the power-house were at that time not entitled to pension.  A pension scheme for the employees of the Dublin United Tramways Company came into operation subsequently, just as pension schemes came into operation for employees of local authorities, subsequent to the acquisition of local authority electricity undertakings by the board.  These men are also in this position, that if the Dublin United Tramways Company power-house had kept going for a little while longer they would have come under the Dublin United Tramways Company pension scheme, whereas they are now, in the service of the board, entitled only to such pension rights as they can get under a contributory scheme, which for many of them will be low because of the fact of their being advanced in age when entering the board's service.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to consider whether or not it is possible to extend the provisions of Section 15 of the 1942 Act to give the board discretion to pay in such cases a pension supplementary to the contributory pension.  I would not attempt to draft an amendment to have that effect.  It would be completely beyond the resources of a private Deputy and I can see at once the danger that the extension of the provisions of Section 15 to a distinct group like the former employees of the Dublin United Tramway Company power-house may lead to similar applications on behalf of persons who were merely employed as salesmen for electricity apparatus or something of that kind and who entered the board's service as individuals.  There is, in the case that I refer to, the particular hardship that the company that employed them was also operating a public utility which has since become <Col N="355" /> subject to legislation, the present employees of which have now got pension rights.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 14:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 12 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  The provisions (other than the excepted provisions) contained pursuant to sub-section (3) of Section 7 of the Superannuation Act of 1942 in the manual workers' superannuation scheme shall cease to have effect.</P>
      <P>(2)  In sub-section (1) of this section, the expression &ldquo;the excepted provisions&rdquo; means the following provisions contained pursuant to sub-section (3) of Section 7 of the Superannuation Act of 1942 in the manual workers' superannuation scheme, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the provision that only continuous service in the employment of the board ending on the date of retirement from employment on account of age or ill-health shall qualify or be reckonable for superannuation benefits under the scheme,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  the provision that in the reckoning of continuous service in the employment of the board of any manual worker, any period of service of the worker in the employment of the board prior to <Col N="356" /> a break after the passing of the Superannuation Act of 1942 in that service shall be included if, but only if, either the contributions to the fund set up for the purposes of the scheme by the worker in respect of such period of service remain in the said fund or, where a sum in respect of such contributions or such contributions and interest thereon has been repaid to the worker, such sum is refunded to the said fund whether with or without interest,</P>
    <P>(c)  the provision consisting of the overriding limitation that only that service prior to such break which would have been so reckonable if such break had not occurred shall be included.</P>
    <P>This amendment is consequential on the deletion of Section 7.  The section removes the penal clause in respect of the manual workers which was imposed by Section 7 of the Electricity (Supply) (Superannuation) Act, 1942, and it is necessary that an amendment on these lines should be made in order that the general employees as well as manual workers should be covered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 15.  Under Section 45 of the Act of 1927, the board is given power compulsorily to acquire land or rights over land, to impound water and otherwise to interfere with private property.  But the Act of 1927 required the board before making such order for the compulsory acquisition of land or for any other purpose under this section to give certain public notice, to deposit and keep open for inspection plans and specifications and other documents which would show clearly the land to be acquired or the right to be interfered with.  It was obliged to give notice to persons likely to be affected of its intention to make the order and, if expedient, it was authorised to hold a public inquiry before making the order. The proposal in the Bill is that the board will be released of its obligation to deposit plans, to notify the public and to hold if necessary a public inquiry if it certifies that the making of the order is a matter of urgency. I recognise fully that the procedure laid down in Section 45 of the 1927 Act is a slow procedure and that if we are to speed up the work of the board. particularly in regard to the rural electrification scheme, it is necessary to have some other procedure.  I am not objecting to the proposal here to shorten that procedure where circumstances justify it but I think that the decision as to whether there exist considerations of urgency which should exempt the board from the obligation to comply with sub-section (45) of the Act of 1927 should rest on the Minister and not on the board.  I think it is giving the board far too much power to say that the board's certificate will settle the matter and that nobody can <Col N="358" /> question its certificate.  Therefore, my suggestion is that instead of the board deciding and stating in the order that the making of the order is a matter of urgency, the Minister should certify that in his opinion it is a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>I am quite agreeable to bringing the Minister into the function of the board in this particular case because there is quite clearly a question of public interest involved.  The board has power to interfere with private individuals and their property.  That power is surrounded by certain safeguards at the present time and we should not lightly remove those safeguards in a manner which would not merely preclude the Minister from having any say in the matter but would make it impossible for the Dáil to question the Minister. If we require the Minister to certify that there are considerations of urgency which justify the new procedure, then the matter could be raised here if necessary and there is, at any rate, brought to bear on the problem not merely the minds of officials who are anxious to get on with the job and to cut the red tape, but also the mind of a public man who will have consideration for the public interest.  The whole object of my amendment is to transfer from the board to the Minister the obligation of deciding when urgency exists and that would short-circuit the procedure laid down in the 1927 Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinOSullivan" hpid="Mr. M. O'Sullivan Mr. M. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of the Port and Docks Board, may I say that the board is deeply concerned with the rather drastic form in which this section is drawn?  Ordinarily, the term &ldquo;port&rdquo; is interpreted in its very narrow meaning.  A port is usually regarded as the immediate quay or waterfront and the sheds and equipment on the lands abutting but the Port of Dublin, like every other port, must be taken in rather wider terms. In the case of Dublin regard must be had to the use to which the port district is being put.  There is the use of the port district by importers, exporters, warehouse men, manufacturers and so on.  Under this section, if it remains in its present form, it will <Col N="359" /> be open to the supply board compulsorily to acquire any land without question within the vicinity of the port without any reference back to the port authority.  The board regard that as something new, something almost without precedent and something that might act detrimentally to the interests of the port.  Deputy Lemass suggests that, while he recognises that the supply board must act with speed on certain occasions, if the Minister is brought into the problem there is a safeguard&mdash;so far as the port authorities are concerned, in any case&mdash;which will ensure that the matter will be taken outside their purview for a while until the Minister will adjudicate upon it.  Having regard to the interests of the port authority in the Port of Dublin, the board feels that it might have, generally speaking, an oversight on the development of the port generally.  This matter was raised with the Minister's Department.  I understand they are relying on the fact that there is protection in Section 130 of the Transport Act of 1944.  But that protection is of a restrictive character. It is confined to the board's own property.</P>
      <P>Now the board takes the view that, immediately outside the confines of its own property, developments could take place along the lines I have indicated detrimental to the port.  They seek to bring the Minister into it in such a way that the interests of the port would be protected.  There is no suggestion that the board would go in immediately but there is always the possibility.  I would suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that the form in which that particular section is drawn at the moment is drastic.  Whether it is necessary is a matter for argument.  As a member of the Dublin Port and Docks Board I have been asked to speak on behalf of the board and to say that they view with a certain amount of concern the form in which that particular section is drawn.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Lemass and Deputy M. O'Sullivan I would urge on the Parliamentary Secretary that he would consider, if not the actual <Col N="360" /> amendment as drafted by Deputy Lemass, amending this section himself on the Report Stage to give the Minister the ultimate decision as to what he would deem a matter of urgency as far as the board is concerned.  I think that a great deal of disquiet has arisen over the particularly bald nature of this section.  I am talking now, representing as I do an area that is shortly to come under the rural electrification scheme and a flooding scheme on the Lee.  It is just the reaction of the ordinary persons themselves that they feel that, if this section is going to go through as it is&mdash;no matter what considerations may arise that should normally cause the board to defer for a period the doing of anything&mdash;there will be no machinery under this section by which the reason for such a delay could be brought to bear on the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Parliamentary Secretary should consider that it would be serious&mdash;and very serious, I think, from an ordinary public interest view-point&mdash;to allow this section stand where we are in an arbitrary fashion throwing away what check I feel, anyway, as a public representative, a Minister responsible to this House should have on this body.  I am thoroughly in agreement with the view Deputy Lemass propounded.  While it is recognised by everybody that there are difficulties that may be raised by way of obstruction and so forth against the board's activity&mdash;and in those circumstances they want powers and support to cut through certain objections so they can get on with their work&mdash;I feel that the ultimate analysis of what is urgent and what requires that particular type of remedy should rest in the hands of the Minister responsible to this House in so far as he is responsible for the activity of the board.  In that way it ultimately comes back to the responsibility of the collective Dáil, as representatives of the people, to see that whatever powers and functions are delegated by this House to the board are exercised in accordance with the public interest.  I can visualise, as Deputy M. O'Sullivan visualised in the case of the Port and Docks Board, that it could happen&mdash;I <Col N="361" /> do not say that it would happen, but the possibility exists&mdash;that you would have a semi-State board armed with this arbitrary power doing things which would conflict with other interests and at the same time with the general interest and the public interest. I feel that the Parliamentary Secretary should consider interposing and imposing the Minister at a stage of this section on the board so that he himself, as custodian of the public interest, may be the final judge on the question of whether or not urgency exists.</P>

      <P>I have not very strong feelings about Deputy Lemass's amendment in the form in which he moved it, but Deputy Collins has raised some queries in my mind.  If I thought the effect of Deputy Lemass's amendment would mean that we would have not alone a check but a brake on the carrying out of the board's work&mdash; I am thinking particularly in terms of their projected schemes of rural electrification&mdash;I would certainly ask the Parliamentary Secretary to reject the amendment.</P>

I know that human nature being what it is, the natural desire was not for effective checks but to see that this hydro-electrification scheme did not go through because they felt that certain local interests would be affected by it. On this the Parliamentary Secretary should bear in mind&mdash;when he is deciding whether he is going to accept or reject this amendment&mdash;whether the speedy carrying out of the board's work will be best achieved by allowing the section to remain as it stands or by accepting the amendment; in other <Col N="362" /> words, not whether it will be in the interests of private individuals but in the general interest of the public as a whole.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a most interesting section.  We have on the one hand Deputy Lemass, who apparently had some interest in the drafting of the Bill at one stage and who is accepting the section with some minor alterations, and on the other hand we have the Minister who is responsible for the Bill.  Nobody seems to be concerned with the actual effect of the section.  I have no objection to the section, but I would be very interested if we could apply the same powers to the housing problem.  So far as the section is concerned, the board can make an order and 30 days after the order they can enter the land; 90 days after the order they can occupy premises. We spent hours and weeks and months dealing with the much greater problem of electrification in regard to the housing question.  Every local authority knows that one of the most heartbreaking factors they have to deal with is the impossibility of getting in on land.  Here, we are quite gladly giving to a semi-State board powers we have denied not only to local authorities but even to the Minister in charge of local government.  I have no objection to that, but if we accept what is proposed in Deputy Lemass's amendment we should realise that we are creating a precedent.  I suggest that some of us are not likely to forget the precedent when we come to deal with other matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that the amendment of Deputy Lemass should be accepted as we have had one or two instances so far as the Electricity Supply Board is concerned where they put up a pole in a front garden.  I think there should be some responsible person to look at the matter from a technical aspect.  I think the Minister should be attached to the powers which are being given under the section to ensure that, while delay is not to be caused to the board, the board will be required to have some ordinary common-sense approach to the rights of a private individual, even if he is an ordinary householder <Col N="363" /> apart from a businessman.  I think it could be done through the form indicated by Deputy Lemass.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary, on behalf of the Government, does not overlook the precedent he has created which we shall quote at a later date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that the universal feeling in the House at the moment is a feeling that the section as it stands is dangerous.  On principle, I think it is.  We are in the peculiar position that, apparently, the Minister insists&mdash;reverting back, if I may for a moment, to the first amendment debated last night&mdash;on actively interfering largely in the internal matters of the board.  There are some of us who would take a more conservative attitude on that.  Incidentally, I should like to explain my use of the word &ldquo;nationalisation&rdquo; last night.  I used it as a term of moderation, knowing that in one sense the board is a nationalised board.  I used it in the sense of making the board a complete Government Department.  If we are going to have the Minister interfering actively in the internal affairs of the board to the extent that was contended last night, logically it seems to me that the responsibility of the Minister in matters affecting co-ordination between the board and the outside interests should become a necessity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No matter what view you take on the first issue, this is clearly a point where you are not dealing merely with the affairs of the board itself.  You are dealing with the affairs of other people.  In other words, the board in relation to the problems here visual sed is exactly in the same position as any company, body, local authority or anybody else that is empowered by statute to interfere with the property or rights of other persons who are not associated with it.  In other words, the question here involved is simply this: that the board is a statutory body&mdash;a kind of a juristic entity before the law &mdash;with absolutely no ordinary rights to interfere either with the occupier of land that Deputy Collins mentioned or a similar board or body or local authority, such as Deputy O'Sullivan mentioned, or the private individual <Col N="364" /> whom Deputy Larkin mentioned.  That is the ordinary state of the law.  The board cannot interfere with their property or rights unless and only in so far as a statute expressly confers upon them the power to do that.  The conferring of power upon the board so to interfere actively with the rights of other bodies or persons is a matter for this House.  In practical effect, it is a matter that is almost universally initiated by the Government and put through this House first and then the Upper Chamber.  To that extent, the responsibility for initiating it must be the Minister's or the Government's. That is where the real responsibility ultimately lies for the conferring of such power, in practice at any rate, if not in theory.</P>
    <P>If the ultimate responsibility lies there, why then should not the executive faculty of exercising that responsibility, so to speak, lie where the responsibility lies?  In other words, on that argument it seems clear that it must be the Minister who should decide whether interference is warranted, whether the board is right, whether the claims and the equities and the rights of the other body, the body interfered with, are paramount. In strict legal theory I suppose you would say it is the Oireachtas should decide.  But the plain fact of the matter is that you could not come back here as used to be done in the older days when Parliamentary life was not so burdened with business, when it was customary to deal with all matters of that kind either by private or semi-public Acts of Parliament. In strict theory, the whole matter should come back here.  But, under modern conditions, the Minister must exercise the responsibility and the right.</P>
    <P>I think there is no case for delegating that responsibility and that right beyond the Minister, that the merits of the case and the interests of all parties are adequately safeguarded if the Minister himself exercises this jurisdiction, so to speak, and balances the rights of the parties involved.  He has the machinery available to him to control it; he has the information <Col N="365" /> readily available to him.  He is in fact the body, at least through the Government, that will be in direct contact with all the other interests that are involved.  The Government, anyway, and in some cases the Minister, will be the body best fitted to come to an impartial and balanced judgment in regard to the question of the rights involved here.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is putting me back on to something.  So far as the internal working of the board itself is concerned, he is not.  But this is not a matter of the internal administration or the exercise of the ordinary powers of the board.  It is a question of the relation of the Electricity Supply Board with other bodies and individuals and that is clearly a matter that is his responsibility and ultimately ours.  He is the person best fitted to deal with it.  Just to meet the Deputy's argument, suppose you leave the section as it stands, you have an utterly contradictory situation where the Minister will have, theoretically anyway, the power under the section that we debated last night to deal with matters that would, normally anyway, be considered the private matters of the board, such as its economic charges and matters like that.  He would have the right to interfere very actively there and, when he is surrendering completely, through the medium of this House, the right to deal with the question of the relation of the board with other bodies and individuals&mdash;I accept the decision of the House as it appeared to be last night&mdash;I cannot see any case for giving this arbitrary power to the board to come along and to exercise summary jurisdiction like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Larkin and myself have been at cross-purposes on the question of the technical board.  I do not want to go into that.  I agree with him that the board, being a board set up for a particular circumstance and for a particular purpose, will naturally look at it from its own point of view.  No matter what fairly-minded people are <Col N="366" /> engaged executively in such a project, they are naturally biassed in favour of what they want in the interests of efficiency.  It is asking too much of human nature to ask them adequately to balance the interests of the people on whose rights they are going to encroach. The temptation to certify is urgent; it is really almost too strong for human nature.  However, a conception of urgency may appear to one person from one point of view and to another person from another point of view.  On the other hand, the Minister will naturally feel the pressure of other bodies such as the Port and Docks Board.  He will be subject to a near equalised pressure anyway and, therefore, would naturally be inclined to come to a more general decision in the matter.  Whether the actual wording of Deputy Lemass's amendment is acceptable or not the principle is clearly one to which we must subscribe.</P>
    <P>There are other matters which perhaps I might mention.  I was rather keen on the point when I was on the other side of the House.  In legislating here we should try to avoid a certain temptation that has been evident in some of our legislation to throw responsibilities on to such bodies in such a way that it has the effect that the Minister has no direct responsibility and consequently cannot be held amenable in this House.  If it is left to the board completely the board certifies as urgent, short circuits all the formalities in this matter and proceeds. They have got full statutory authority to do so and the Minister cannot, so to speak, interfere actively in their responsibilities in that regard, except in so much as some other section, which I have not examined in detail, allows him to do so.  Granted that for the moment there is no getting at the Minister in that way, then we are left with no remedy but to bring in positive motions to deal with these matters and that is unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter arising under the section, as Deputy Larkin pointed out, the question of the need for expedition in these matters.  There again we have to balance urgency and the unnecessary infringement of the rights of other people.  It is probably better, from a practical point of view, <Col N="367" /> not to prescribe the statutory formalities such as they were and such as are wiped out by this section, because experience seems to show that the statutory formalities leading to inquiries and literal interpretation of the statute simply make, so to speak, a field day for some lawyers here and those who will exercise their ingenuity to bring about delay and negotiate for compensation in consideration of delay and so forth, although from another point of view it is objectionable.  Probably the best thing is to give the Minister a simple power of signifying urgency or not.  If he does we can then hold him answerable for his decision.  For all these reasons I think the principle embodied in Deputy Lemass's amendment is desirable and certainly not contradictory to any previous stand in regard to internal relations of the board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">

      <P>I think there is a good deal in what Deputies on both sides of the House have said so far as the rather wide powers which this section contains are concerned.  I think it is desirable that wherever a board of this nature is dealing with the acquisition of private property, adequate safeguards should be provided for the people whose property is to be acquired and for that reason I will have the section reconsidered.  However, Deputy Lemass's amendment, I think, goes rather further than anything that has previously been the policy in so far as the Electricity Supply Board is concerned. This amendment is drawing the line of demarcation rather heavily in comparison with the circumstances we were discussing last night.  At any time acquisition of private property is an important step but it is inconceivable that the board would acquire private property merely as an ordinary administrative function of the board and while, in practice, it is only acquired by compulsion in cases where they are extending some existing schemes or where a new scheme is being started it has not been used for the acquisition of showrooms or anything of that nature.  Deputy Lemass's amendment would require the Minister to give a certificate and the certificate <Col N="368" /> would have to be laid on the Table of the House.  I think that proviso would be a considerable infringement on the day to day activities of the board.  In certain circumstances it might be desirable where a matter of policy was concerned but merely where land is being acquired for the purpose of a routine extension of the board's activities there is no reason why a certificate should be made available to Deputies.</P>
      <P>On the general question of the adequate notice and time which should elapse I will have that examined between now and the Report Stage. I will undertake to get a suitable amendment drafted which will cover the points raised by Deputy O'Sullivan. As the Deputy is no doubt aware, Section 45 of the 1927 Act gives the board wide powers for the acquisition of land.  It is true that they must have previous consultation with the Minister but it is phrased rather loosely.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned that the 1927 Act gives the board this power of compulsory acquisition but surrounds that power with certain obligations which were intended to be safeguards for the public.  Now we are proposing to modify or remove the public safeguards. I have no objection.  I agree that the 1927 Act proved, in operation, to be cumbersome and slow and I should like the procedure speeded up. In doing so we should consider whether the circumstances justify other procedure. If you leave it entirely to the board, the board will certify in every case.  That is obvious.  There is nobody to question their decision and it saves a terrible lot of delay and trouble.  If the objection is to the laying upon the Table of the House information in the certificate concerned, I would not press that.  I think it is quite enough to establish that the consideration of the justice of urgency should be taken, not by the board, but by somebody else, and the obvious person to do it is the Minister who is the custodian of public property in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to reconsider the third amendment which relates to this.  It was designed to ensure that the short <Col N="369" /> circuit procedure for compulsory acquisition should be used only in connection with the construction of generating stations and it should not be used for the purpose of buying a shop, or an office, or property that should ordinarily be acquired without compulsory powers.</P>

      <P>Deputy Larkin mentioned a matter of some significance. There is no doubt that, as the section stands at the moment, it could be quoted as a precedent in the future. There is a difference, however, I think between the powers which a local authority has and what we are dealing with here.  Deputies are aware that the procedure under which local authorities act is slow and cumbersome. Great delay occurs in acquiring sites for houses.  In fact, the delay there is often far greater than the delay that occurs in the construction of the houses.  Under the local authority procedure, where a person's property is being acquired, he has the right of appeal to the Minister for Local Government in the event of disagreement. In this case, if a proviso of that kind were included, it would, I think, make the procedure rather cumbersome. There are a large number of local authorities in the country, and there is plenty of machinery for dealing with the problems that arise in their case. In this case, if a proviso of that kind were included, it would cause delay generally and would interfere with the normal progress of electrical development.</P>

      <P>After paragraph (b) to insert a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section shall not apply to any lands or premises <Col N="370" /> situate within the administrative area of a borough or urban authority.</P>
    <P>This section deals with the matter to which Deputy Larkin reterred, namely, with the power of the board to put a pylon or a pole in somebody's front garden.  Most Deputies know that in years past there was no subject which aroused more acrimonious discussions here than the exercise by the Electricity Supply Board of its right to way leave.  The Act of 1927 gives it this right to way leave across land.  The section seems to me a rather peculiarly drawn one.  As it stands, the board must give 14 days' notice to the occupier of land of its proposal to put fixtures on his property.  If, within 14 days, the occupier consents, or consents with conditions acceptable to the board, the board can proceed to erect its fixtures on his land.  If, however, within 14 days the occupier refuses his consent, the board can still proceed to put its fixtures on his land.  Where it is a case of technical requirements such as overhead line construction or convenience for the board's engineers, it has often been argued, and sometimes it has been proved, that the board has acted with insufficient consideration for the rights and interests of individual persons.</P>
    <P>There is a proposal in this Bill, however, which is designed to modify still further the restrictions upon the board's powers in this regard.  I know that is likely to cause a great deal of discussion in the future because the number of poles to be erected by the board will be very much greater than in the past consequent on the extension of the rural electrification scheme. Because of the rural electrification scheme and because of the necessity for getting ahead quickly with it, it is probably desirable to release the board from the obligation to deposit plans or to draw a diagram for the information of the person concerned.  It is sufficient to require it to tell in a general sense the land occupier what is intended.</P>
    <P>I think, however, it should be made-clear in the Bill, and that is the purpose of the first amendment in my name, that the additional facility which is <Col N="371" /> being given to the board is to be used only in connection with the rural electrification scheme, and that, therefore, we are excluding from it the board's power to way leave within a borough area or an urban authority area.  I know that many borough and urban authorities are often incensed with the board because of the way in which it constructs over-head lines and, generally, with its distribution arrangements by reason of its complete disregard not only for the plans of local authorities but sometimes because of the manner in which it disrupts the plans of the local authorities.  No case has been made for altering the powers of the board by way of easement in regard to a borough or urban authority area.  Therefore, I think we should not do it.  I think there is a case for examining the desirability of restricting the powers of the board in the matter of way leave in borough areas.</P>
    <P>That is the purpose of the first amendment.  It proposes to confine the additional powers of the board to the rural electrification scheme.  The second amendment in the name of Deputy Allen is much wider because it proposes to place on the board the obligation to have regard to the reasonable objections raised by the owners of land. There may be a difficulty in making that a legally binding obligation, but it does raise the whole issue of the use of way leave by the board.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether the amendment is necessary because the position is that the board generally informs the people concerned in advance.  It is true that, under the extension of the rural electrification scheme, the number of persons concerned is being greatly increased.  A difficulty would arise in giving a full description particularly where you have an extension of the scheme with an increased number of poles and so on. Very often the board is obliged to send a representative to the spot.</P>

The powers of the board in this matter are governed by Section 53 of the 1927 Act. The board is also under certain obligations under the Town Planning Acts.

      <P>So far as the City of Dublin is concerned, this amendment is of great importance.  If it is accepted it will help to relieve a problem that is constantly cropping up not only so far as individuals are concerned but local bodies as well.  The Parliamentary Secretary has referred to the Town Planning Act.  We have a town planning scheme under the Dublin Corporation, but it has no statutory existence.  Anybody who is familiar with the position in Cabra, <Col N="373" /> Drimnagh and Crumlin will see what has occurred so far as the actual placing of poles by the Electricity Supply Board is concerned.  In my opinion, the Electricity Supply Board cannot be proud of the erections it has made in these areas.  They are causing a great deal of difficulty in city administration.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary should accept amendment No. 18, which suggests that there should be some understanding reached between the Electricity Supply Board and the Dublin Corporation, for example, in regard to this matter of the erection of poles in borough and urban areas.  I could give the Parliamentary Secretary, as I am sure any other member of the corporation also could, a list of instances where they ride roughshod over the local authority if the local authority do not agree with them, and sometimes there is no attempt by them to compromise.  If the Parliamentary Secretary takes a run in his car through Crumlin and Drimnagh he will see a situation which, I am sure, would annoy him even, in driving his car, because at the crossroads you have to drive around these things which are, in fact, dangerous to the public.  This would never have been permitted by a public authority if the Electricity Supply Board had not the powers which it has.</P>

      <P>I suppose agricultural land is more important than urban land from the point of view of the occupier except that, in the case of a town-dweller's house, whatever small garden a person may have it is more precious in one sense.  On the other hand, it is not a source of livelihood in the same way as is the farmer's property.</P>
      <P>I hardly think this amendment is necessary because, under this section, once the occupier asks for a description of the nature of the interference he is entitled to it, and this merely absolves the board from the necessity of giving every person whose property is about to be entered upon a full description of the nature of the work.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 20b:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 16 to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 8 of the Superannuation Act of 1942 is hereby amended by the deletion in sub-section (3) (c) of the words &ldquo;or by the board to such trustees&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to deal with the situation which has arisen in regard to the superannuation scheme. I do not know what attitude the Parliamentary Secretary will take towards this amendment and, therefore, I will briefly indicate the grounds on which <Col N="375" /> it is being put forward.  The House will have noted that in the Bill the Minister is amending Section 8 of the Superannuation Act of 1942 to the extent of leaving it at the discretion of the board to pay a rate of interest of 4 per cent. on moneys invested with them by trustees of the superannuation fund.</P>
    <P>That amendment has been the outcome of a situation which arose in connection with the scheme.  When the scheme was drafted in 1942, the board were informed by the Department of Finance that they could proceed to draft the scheme on the basis that 4 per cent. could be paid by them in respect of any moneys invested with them by the trustees of the superannuation fund.  On that basis the actuarial aspect of the scheme was worked out and, more important still, when the scheme was put before the employees of the board, it was done through a high pressure selling campaign by the board. The employees were advised&mdash;as a matter of fact, induced&mdash;to become members of that scheme on the understanding that the rates of contribution and benefits indicated in the draft scheme would be enjoyed by them so long as they were members of the scheme.  But the enjoyment of those rates of contribution and benefits was dependent, so far as the actuarial basis of the scheme was concerned, on the continuation of the payment of that rate of interest of 4 per cent.</P>
    <P>In 1943 the view was conveyed to the board that the undertaking to pay the 4 per cent. should be reviewed in view of the fact that there was a fall in the yield of gilt-edged securities.  The matter was considered and in deference to the views of the board and the trustees, as well as the pension committee representing the employees, the board was given permission to continue to pay the 4 per cent.  In 1946, the actuary made a valuation of the fund and he pointed out that it would be impossible to value the fund and advise the board and the members of the scheme as to the actuarial soundness of the fund unless he could have definite knowledge of the rate of interest which would be payable on the moneys invested by the trustees of the fund with <Col N="376" /> the board.  He pointed out that in connection with funds of this character, short-term loans were highly unsuitable and it was essential that there should be something in the way of a guarantee of the rate of interest over a long period.  He also indicated that his original calculation in respect of the fund had been at the rate of 4 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Minister has tried to meet that situation in the Bill by leaving it at the discretion of the board to pay 4 per cent., but the difficulty is that in the 1942 Act there is a clause which makes it impossible for the board to give the type of guarantee indicated by the actuary and which is fundamental to the proper continuance of the fund.  In Section 8 (3) (c), it is laid down:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;such moneys shall be repayable on such notice by such trustees to the board or by the board to such trustees, as shall be prescribed by regulations made by the Minister under this section&rdquo;;</P>
    <P>so that, even though the board might undertake to pay 4 per cent., they can give no guarantee that at any date in the future they will not have recourse to the power given to them in that sub-section and, after giving due notice, repay the moneys to the trustees and require them, if they wish to take them on any further investments, to accept them at a lower rate of interest.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to take away that discretionary power of the board to give notice to the trustees that they desire repayment of the invested moneys.  It has been argued that there is the same power with the trustees, but there is this difference, that the trustees would be anxious to maintain the invested funds at a rate of interest which is continuous and has some form of guarantee behind it.  The only purpose in leaving with the trustees the power to give notice for the repayment of the moneys is that at certain periods during the life of the scheme it will be necessary for the trustees to withdraw certain of their capital in order to pay back and, therefore, they must be left with that power.  That was accepted by the <Col N="377" /> board.  I do not know what the attitude of the Parliamentary Secretary will be to the amendment, but I am speaking, not with authority, but with a certain knowledge, when I say that the board itself has definitely indicated to the Minister its agreement with the principle embodied in the amendment and its willingness to undertake the commitments which, if the amendment is accepted, will be imposed upon it to the extent that any investments of funds that the trustees may make with the board would be on a long-term basis&mdash;a basis of 4 per cent.&mdash;and would be repayable only on notice from the trustees and not from the board.</P>
    <P>The important thing to bear in mind is that we are dealing here with a semi-State body.  Many of these employees are closely associated in their work with the employees of local authorities.  It has been accepted as a principle by employees of local authorities generally throughout the country that employees of this nature have got certain recognised rights in regard to superannuation; and that principle is being more and more widely extended.  In so far as this board is concerned, we have tried to provide a superannuation scheme. Quite frankly, I do not think it is as good as should have been provided, but it is there now.  Even that limited scheme, limited to a payment of 50 per cent. of the retiring salary and on which there is a very heavy payment as regards contribution by certain of the employees, and many other limiting factors&mdash;even that scheme in its present unsatisfactory form will be completely disrupted unless there is some guaranteed basis in respect of the investment of the funds provided for the scheme. If for the sake of argument, the rate of interest were to drop from 4 per cent. to 2½ per cent. it would mean in the case of members of 20 years of age an increase in their contribution by approximately 50 per cent. for superannuation purposes in respect of their future service and an increase of 14 per cent. in respect of the payment of the lump sum under the insurance section of the scheme.  In respect of members of the scheme at 60 years of age there <Col N="378" /> would have to be an increase of 12 per cent. in contributions in respect of their future service.  Quite clearly if that situation arose the scheme would collapse because even the present rate of contributions is beyond the payment of many of the members.  A member of my union is paying £2 4s. 0d. per week towards his pension.  I agree he has only got a year or two to go before he retires.  That situation does arise under the scheme.  Quite clearly, as the board and the trustees have been advised, it is essential to the welfare and continuance of the scheme that the board should be put in the position of continuing to pay 4 per cent.  That has been dealt with by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the board should be put in the position of being able to enter into some form of guarantee over a reasonably long period.  These two conditions are essential to the scheme. I think, then, the responsibility devolves upon the Minister to consider that matter very seriously.  I understand he has been advised that the only practicable way to do that is along the lines of the amendment I have put down&mdash;namely, to take from the board the option of repaying these moneys to the trustees as and when the latter desire to submit a certain notice.  There is no objection on the part of the board to that.  That suggestion has the support of the board, the trustees, the representatives of the employees and the actuaries.  It is merely a question then of convincing the Minister that this is essential to the preservation of the scheme, for which he must now accept responsibility. It would be wrong for a scheme which has been subjected to so much criticism to be placed in jeopardy, and I would be glad if the Parliamentary Secretary would consider this amendment sympathetically.  It is essential from an actuarial point of view apart from any other consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment would enable the trustees to continue to require the board to repay the loan and would place no similar obligation on the trustees.  I do not think it is reasonable to put all the obligation on <Col N="379" /> one side.  The section, as it stands, alters the section of the 1942 Act and it replaces the obligation on the board to pay up to a maximum of 4 per cent. In the 1942 Act the phrase was &ldquo;with the consent of the Minister for Finance.&rdquo;  The consent of the Minister for Finance is no longer essential under this.  But in any superannuation scheme it is generally accepted that the superannuation fund pays into it up to whatever rate it is in a position to pay, and I understand that at the moment the board is repaying the money borrowed at the rate of 4 per cent.  I think the Deputy will agree that is a reasonable rate at the present time.</P>

For that reason I think the provision in this section which puts the ceiling at 4 per cent. is a reasonable one and, in view of the nature of the fund, I think it would be somewhat inequitable to place all the responsibility on one side and all the advantage on the other.  For that reason I am reluctant to accept the amendment.  In this case the board has agreed with the trustees to take 4 per cent.  I suppose the board, any more than anyone else, is not prepared to tie itself for the future.  The fact that it is paying 4 per cent. at the present time is a matter worth consideration and it will be taken into account by the board in the future, or by any other board that may replace the present board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true, as Deputy Larkin says, because of the peculiar circumstances surrounding the establishment of this fund and, in particular, because of the delays in bringing the superannuation scheme into operation, that a number of employees who are now near the end of their period of service with the board are obliged to pay heavily.  On the other hand, employees who are young in years and young in the service of the board have more reasonable <Col N="380" /> contributions.  Despite the problem presented by these circumstances, I think it would be unreasonable to place on the board the obligation to continue to repay at the request of the trustees.</P>

      <P>Only for the purpose of reborrowing at a lower rate of interest. That is all.  As Deputy Larkin has rightly pointed out, this superannuation scheme was sold to the Electricity Supply Board employees on the basis of the benefits which could be secured on the investment of the fund at 4 per cent.  If the scheme had to be prepared on some other basis less than 4 per cent., then the benefits would be correspondingly less or the contributions would be correspondingly higher, and the scheme would be less attractive. I should like to say that the Electricity Supply Board Superannuation Act, 1942, is not one of the achievements of my Ministry of which I am proudest.  The Act has many defects in it.  I should like to say that these defects were due to the influence of the Department of Finance which was dominant at the time.  I do not think that it is desirable that we should hold out at the present time the prospect that the pension scheme provided by the Act could deteriorate from the point of view of the employee. Any alteration in the terms of borrowing which would reduce the interest earned on the fund by the trustees must lead to a deterioration of the scheme.  I think it is unlikely that that is contemplated by the board, the Department of Finance, the trustees or anybody.  The circumstances of the board are such that the moneys borrowed are permanently invested by the board.  There was at one time an idea that the board could repay all the advances made to it and amortise its assets as well.  That is the legal obligation of the board still, but we <Col N="381" /> must recognise that, in practice, it will never happen and that the money invested in the generating stations is permanently invested.  The board is taking this money and they have contracted to pay 4 per cent. on it.  There can be no circumstances in which they will not want to pay that rate, except for one purpose and that is the wrecking of the superannuation scheme.</P>
      <P>It may be undesirable&mdash;and I can see that it would be undesirable&mdash;to change the wording of the 1942 Act, but I think it should be possible to devise some other safeguard which would ensure that the board could not arbitrarily decide to reduce the rate of interest on borrowings from the trustees merely because of, perhaps, some trade dispute.  The only circumstance under which the board would want to do that would be in case of a strike of the employees.  If that possibility is eliminated, if it is clear that the only circumstances under which the question of repayment would arise&mdash;that is, repayment without the consent of the trustees&mdash;would be an unusual situation such as might compel the winding up of the Electricity Supply Board, then it should be possible to devise some safeguard.  It might cause legal embarrassment at some stage and I am quite sure the Parliamentary draftsman would be horrified to have to contemplate a position in which the board would not be in existence, but I think it should be possible to give an assurance, which the actuaries require, in order to calculate the benefits which would accrue in future to the staff who have contributed to the fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>As I see it, there should be a very-simple way of dealing with this.  When Governments and local authorities borrow for specific long-term purposes, they contract to take the loan for a certain period.  I can quite see that if a specific period is not agreed to, you are going to have at some time or other an attempt by the board to change this arrangement. Possibly if money is cheap and is available at 2½ per cent. they might not wish to continue to pay 4 per cent.  I would suggest that in order to meet Deputy Larkin's point of view there <Col N="382" /> ought to be some undertaking that this fund cannot be interfered with from the point of view of a reduction of the interest accruing from the moneys invested. Workers cannot be expected to have first-hand knowledge of financial conditions in the world so as to be able to know whether they will have to pay more for their benefits.</P>
      <P>The board should be obliged to take this money and should not be allowed to reconsider the question of repayment before a certain period of time.  If you specify a certain period, say 15, 20 or 25 years, the matter can be reviewed at the end of that period. At the present time, as I understand it, the superannuation scheme is in its initial stages and is more or less out of plumb due to circumstances referred to by the Parliamentary Secretary but in time, with the growth of employment in the Electricity Supply Board as a result of its expansion and the intake of younger people, the scheme will be put on a more permanent and stable basis.  Until such time as that stage is reached, I think Deputy Larkin would be agreeable if there was an arrangement that for a specific period of years the board should be bound to take all the money offered by the trustees, invest it in the undertaking and pay 4 per cent.  After that period has elapsed, the trustees can again consider the matter.  They may even reach a position at that time when they will be able, out of invested money, to look forward to a greater income than will be necessary to cover the superannuation repayments.  As I see the matter, it cannot be arranged in any way other than by saying that there must be a minimum period for which the board must keep this money at a specific rate of interest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Even that is not sufficient. I think there is some misunderstanding in regard to this matter.  Even if the amendment is accepted, it will be the board which will be the authority to decide the terms on which they will receive the money invested.  The point is that the money should be invested under a guarantee of an irrevocable <Col N="383" /> rate of interest for a definite term but the board has been legally advised that under existing legislation it is within its statutory rights if it decides to repay this money.  The board with its present personnel may be quite willing to continue to guarantee 4 per cent. but what will be the position of their successors in ten or 15 years' time? One thing we lose sight of is that it is a most common feature of superannuation schemes to have agreed rates of contribution and a certain rate of interest is charged.  The most common feature of such schemes, even with private employers, is that the employer guarantees to make up whatever deficiency arises through a deterioration in the rate of interest.  Surely this board has a commitment to its employees equal to that of any private employer?  There are many private employees who are at present guaranteed rates of interest, even up to 10 or 12 per cent. in order to make up deficiencies in the fund.  Here we are not asking them to do anything that they were not a party to doing at the time the scheme was put to the members of the board.  It was laid down that they could calculate on a basis of 4 per cent. and on that basis the employees were assured that if they entered into the scheme they would have to pay certain contributions and would receive certain benefits.  It may be quite true, as Deputy Lemass said, that no occasion is likely to arise when the board would seek to repay these moneys.  The only possibility that might arise is if it desired to find the money at a lower rate of interest or if the board expressed a desire to avoid that charge and substitute a lower rate than 4 per cent., but that is not likely to arise.  The difficulty is again&mdash;it has happened on one occasion&mdash;that the Department of Finance would desire a lower rate of interest and I do not think it is fair to the employees of the board that they should be expected to put greater trust in the future members of the board, of whom they have no knowledge, than in the Department of Finance.  Even the Minister and his predecessor seem to lack faith in the <Col N="384" /> Department of Finance.  The board is anxious to give a guarantee and to proceed and the actuary is pressing for some basis on which to make an actuarial examination of this scheme.  The employees are very concerned and tonight in fact there is a meeting of the members of the scheme to consider the position.  I can see no good reason why this amendment should not be accepted.</P>
      <P>Again on the question of precedent which has been raised a while ago, a precedent in this case is necessary because of the way we dealt with the superannuation scheme in its initial stages.  We could have avoided all this difficulty if, instead of basing the actuarial nature of the scheme on 4 per cent., we had said that the employees should pay a certain contribution and that the board would make the necessary payments to meet whatever was necessary to the fund.  This is the practice in many cases of private employment, and in many schemes which are better than the Electricity Supply Board scheme the employee pays a contribution and the employer pays what is necessary to keep the fund sound.  We did not do that in the case of the Electricity Supply Board but tried to strike a balance on a fifty-fifty basis and strike that balance by the payment of 4 per cent.  If that 4 per cent. is not guaranteed the whole scheme is upset.  We have a definite responsibility, and if the only way we can do it is that the board should say on its own account&mdash;for no compulsion is placed upon it by the amendment&mdash; to the trustees: &ldquo;We are prepared to take the money from you and pay 4 per cent. over a period of 20 years,&rdquo; there is no danger of a precedent, because if it enters that commitment it is doing it voluntarily; it knows what it is doing and it is doing it in pursuance of a pledge given in 1942.  I would urge strongly upon the Parliamentary Secretary to view it in that light, and view it in the light of the fact that this difficulty has been created because instead of deciding on this scheme in 1942 we could have had a scheme which would be much more simple and could have avoided all these difficulties at this stage.</P>

      <P>Arising out of Deputy Larkin's remarks&mdash;I am approaching the question on the basis of what he has said&mdash;I understand that at the beginning there was representation that the rate of interest should be 4 per cent. and that the scheme was based on that.</P>

      <P>Then it seems to me that the difficulty arises from (a) the Parliamentary draftsman's way of framing the Act or (b) repercussions in the Department of Finance.  The Parliamentary draftsman would naturally put in the phrase, &ldquo;Not exceeding 4 per cent.&rdquo;  And, of course, it would not be long before the custodians of the purse would, if necessary, interpret that as meaning literally what it says. If that is the position, why not amend that?  Why not amend the drafting by saying &ldquo;4 per cent.&rdquo;?  There is no greater finality in giving a term of years than in doing that.  You can remedy it by putting in &ldquo;4 per cent&rdquo;&mdash;that is if the case made by Deputy Larkin is to be substantiated and I am accepting that for the purpose of the argument.  If the phrase reads, &ldquo;not exceeding a rate of 4 per cent.&rdquo; you can delete &ldquo;not exceeding&rdquo;.  It is as good a guarantee as you can get. Admittedly it can be changed by this House at any time, but so could the whole scheme.</P>

      <P>It has already been asked for and refused.  A question which arises on that is the difficulty the Department of Finance finds in underwriting the guarantee of 4 per cent. and because of that difficulty and the problem of overcoming it, the representatives of the employees and the board itself have tried to find an easier way round the problem of seeking an amendment which would make it possible for the board itself to give a guarantee, not a statutory guarantee embodied in a Bill, but that the board should be left free to give a guarantee for the period which it desires. Having given it, however, it would not have the right at the end of a period of three months or three years by giving notice to say: &ldquo;We will repay&rdquo;. Deputy Lemass's suggestion guaranteeing the 4 per cent. was the original suggestion, but apparently there were very great objections to it and this is another way of getting round it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true that some private firms are probably paying more than 4 per cent., but I think it is fair to say that they are the exception ; the number of these concerns cannot be very large.  I think the Deputy will agree that if the trustees were now looking for an investment in which to invest the money they would be fortunate if they were able to get anything exceeding 4 per cent.  In fact, I imagine it would be considerably less.  In view of the fact that there has been no suggestion, as far as I am aware, by the Electricity Supply Board to pay less than 4 per cent. or to repay at a lower rate, the amendment is unnecessary.  This amendment has altered the original which contained the phrase that the set interest shall be paid at such a rate with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  The consent of the Minister for Finance is no <Col N="387" /> longer required and a ceiling is put on the rate.  I think that is an indication to the board that 4 per cent. is regarded as a fair rate of interest.  I frankly cannot conceive any set of circumstances in which the board would be likely to want to pay less than 4 per cent. unless there was a very great drop in the value of money.  In view of the fact that they would immediately incur strenuous opposition from the trustees, it is unlikely that the board would attempt to do it.  For that reason, I do not think this amendment is really necessary.  It is a ceiling indication, but nevertheless there is a definite indication there that 4 per cent. is regarded as a fair rate, and I think the difficulty the Deputy foresees is unlikely to occur.  While the scheme was based on payment of 4 per cent., I think there was no great actuarial difficulty.  As long as 4 per cent. is actually paid, there will not be any difficulty and I doubt if there is any likelihood, either now or in the future, of this or a subsequent board attempting to pay less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is that 4 per cent. is a generous rate and if the trustees had to go out to invest money in the open market they would have difficulty in finding an investment to earn 4 per cent.  If there was a life assurance company assuming that it could invest its money to earn 4 per cent., there would be doubt as to its solvency.</P>
      <P>I take it that the difficulty of the trustees is to estimate the future income in relation to the obligations they have undertaken and they are doubtful of the wisdom of continuing to calculate on the fund earning 4 per cent. The actuary of a life assurance company would be wary about advising the board of directors to calculate its solvency on an assumption that 4 per cent. would continue to be earned.</P>
      <P>I am not at all clear why, if this amendment is passed and the Minister for Finance is taken out of the picture, it is not possible for the board to tell the trustees: &ldquo;We have borrowed your money at 4 per cent. and will continue to do so.&rdquo; If this assurance is given to the trustees, I think it will be quite good enough for the trustees' actuary.</P>

      <P>Taking the Minister for Finance out of this section leaves it at the discretion of the board to pay 4 per cent., but it is not merely the actuary and the trustees and the members who are dissatisfied: the board itself is dissatisfied.  Might I quote a letter from the board:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I agree that the amendment to Section 8 (3) (b) of the Act which you enclose will enable the board to pay 4 per cent. on the moneys borrowed by it from the funds, but it does not oblige the board to accept the moneys or to pay this rate.  Under the amendment to which you refer it will be open to the board to decline to agree to an interest rate of 4 per cent.  In the actuarial calculations upon which the funds are founded, the actuary, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, has assumed an interest rate of 4 per cent.  Unless this interest rate is maintained throughout the membership of those persons who have entered the schemes to date these members shall be faced by the possibility that in the future their rates of contribution for membership may be increased, or the benefits to be derived from their contributions may be reduced.  In the board's view this is not a satisfactory position from the points of view of the board, the trustees or the members. The adoption of the proposal to guarantee the interest rate of 4 per cent. will have the effect of giving the schemes that element of stability which the actuary emphasises is so fundamental and which is secured by statute to the officers and servants of local authorities under the Local Government (Superannuation) Act of 1948.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole point that is involved here is that, under local authority superannuation schemes, the actuarial basis is guaranteed.  Under private schemes, the private employer says: &ldquo;If you put into this scheme a certain rate of contribution, I will set up and constitute a trust fund and I will accept the responsibility of guaranteeing these benefits in return for the contributions, and I will make up whatever deficiency there is.&rdquo;  The board has not accepted that responsibility.  It has merely said: &ldquo;Here is a scheme worked out on a <Col N="389" /> basis of certain contributions in return for which you will get certain benefits, if we continue to receive your money as an investment and continue to pay 4 per cent. to you&mdash;but there is no guarantee that we will continue to do that.  While the existing members of the board have every sympathy with this and are desirous of giving you this guarantee, we cannot bind their successors.&rdquo; In their opinion, the scheme as at present constituted cannot be regarded as actuarially sound and is not certified in that form by the actuary.  I do not know what steps the Minister may take to meet that situation.  If he likes to give a statutory guarantee, that is quite satisfactory; if he likes to make it possible for the board to forget about the rate of interest altogether and merely say they will accept money on loan from the trustees when they desire it at such a rate as they may desire to pay and they will make good any deficiencies in the scheme so far as existing benefits and contributions are concerned, that will suffice.  Any of these devices will meet the situation. The only point the members of the scheme are concerned with, the board also and the trustees, is that a superannuation scheme that has got no actuarial soundness is not a superannuation scheme and it is not fair to call it by that name.  That is the actual position so far as the Electricity Supply Board is concerned.</P>
    <P>If the rate of interest is reduced we will have men of 20 years of age being faced with a 50 per cent. increase in their rates of contribution.  This is the scheme that was proposed by the board, with the support of the Government and the responsible Minister, with the assurance that if the employees entered into the scheme they would make these contributions and receive these benefits.  Why should we go back on that now?  I do not want to press the amendment, but I think the Parliamentary Secretary should accept the responsibility of considering this matter between now and the Report Stage to see if he can meet the difficulty.  I do not mind how he does it so long as he gives to the employees of the Electricity Supply Board, <Col N="390" /> members of the scheme, some assurance that they will be given the same rate of pension from this semi-State body, that has the backing of the State and of the responsible Minister, as the employees of an ordinary individual industry would get.  It is not too much to ask&mdash;much less than what their fellow-workers in the Dublin Corporation are receiving to-day.  Remember that these men in the Electricity Supply Board are doing substantially the same work as the employees of local authorities, but the employee of a local authority gets his pension for roughly ½d. in the £ and he can get up to a maximum of two-thirds of his retiring wage.  He gets many other facilities not available to the Electricity Supply Board, whereas the employee of the Electricity Supply Board starts at a contribution of 1/6 at 18 years of age and is limited to 50 per cent. of his salary and if he has to pay for past service, for which they have to try and obtain credit, the payments can go on an average&mdash;as they have, in many cases&mdash;as high as 12/- or 14/- a week.  As against that, we have the very bad position of employees, with considerable service in the board, working on salaries of £400, £500 and £600, and going out on pensions of £100.  I think the less said about this scheme in public the better. If they could only try and give these people the assurance we promised to them in 1942, we would relieve ourselves of a very awkward responsibility.</P>

      <P>I fail to see how the Parliamentary Secretary can reasonably refuse this amendment, or some amendment calculated to achieve almost the same purpose.  While it may be correct that the majority of similar schemes operating in private undertakings are not at as high a rate as 4 per cent., nevertheless it should be our attitude in this House that where a semi-State corporation such as the Electricity Supply Board is concerned, we should not be looking for the minimum standard but rather for the highest standard possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lemass and the Parliamentary Secretary both mentioned the question of assurances and, in fact, <Col N="391" /> told Deputy Larkin: &ldquo;Really, we do not believe you have any need to worry.&rdquo;  That does not achieve any useful purpose unless there is some amendment to this section which will effect the purpose that the present amendment seeks to achieve.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand how the Parliamentary Secretary does not see what can and, I should say, will happen.  First, the section says that the board may pay a rate not exceeding 4 per cent. and obviously if the trustees ever come to negotiate&mdash; because there is a question to negotiate &mdash;the board will say: &ldquo;That is the maximum, but we are not going to give you that,&rdquo; and trouble will arise when the fund assumes larger proportions and when there will be a considerable amount to be invested.  The board will say: &ldquo;There is this very large sum and do you expect us to pay a 100 per cent. greater interest rate than the rate at which we can get money in the market?&rdquo;  That is where the problem will arise.  I agree with the point of view expressed by the mover of the amendment, that this is something in respect of which there must be a settlement, with no further discussion or argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of private employers has been brought in, but, in the case of the private employer who has a pension scheme for his workers, it is very easy because he does it through an insurance company&mdash;it is more or less on the basis of an annuity in many cases&mdash;and secondly, it does not matter to him whether he is generous or not because he can get relief in his company's income-tax payments.  This is something quite different and I take the view that the Electricity Supply Board should be in the very same position as any Department of State and that the workers are entitled to know, from the moment they join the scheme, what their retirement income will be. It is unfair to have them in the position that, ten years or seven years hence, a new set of gentlemen on the board may, in the interest of saving money, start arguing about whether they will pay 4 per cent., 3½ per cent. or 3 per cent., thus putting the whole scheme <Col N="392" /> back and bringing about a position in which there might even be a trade dispute because the workers sought increased wages in order to meet the increased demand on them for the superannuation scheme.</P>
    <P>It is a simple matter for the Parliamentary Secretary to say he will consider the amendment with a view to finding if there is any method by which some stability can be secured.  The rate of 4 per cent. is what the actuary wants guaranteed, the rate on which the scheme was initiated, and the Bill should be amended to make 4 per cent. the rate and have an end to the discussion. We are discussing it here and we are supposed to be reasonably intelligent people representing various views and various sections of the community. If, some time in the future, a dispute arises between the trustees representing the subscribers to the scheme and the board on this matter, there will be a deadlock, and I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to agree to consider it before Report Stage, with a view to finding out if some form of amendment to meet the point of view expressed is possible.</P>

The Parliamentary Secretary is merely asked by Deputy Larkin to look into this alternative between now and the Report Stage.  If he consults his advisers, he will find that this House has, by legislation in the case of at least one public service company, given a guarantee, a guarantee which is given in the form that, if the superannuation fund fails to meet, out of its own resources, the payment of pensions in any one year, the assets of the company can be realised in order to ensure the payment of the pensions.  It is not unreasonable, therefore, to ask him to look into that aspect of the matter.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Larkin that this superannuation scheme is in an entirely different position from that of most other schemes, in view of the circumstances surrounding its establishment and so on, but the comparison made by Deputy Lemass between this scheme and the actuary of a life assurance company who has to assess the future trends of interest rates was not, I believe, valid. Under this scheme the actuary has a reasonable assurance&mdash;it is not a statutory guarantee, but in view of the terms of the section, which impose a ceiling of 4 per cent., it is an indication which amounts to a direction that 4 per cent. be paid.  It is, in fact, a substantial advance on the original section which imposed on the board and the trustees the obligation of getting the consent of the Minister for Finance. That consent is no longer required under Section 15, and, while there is not a statutory guarantee to the trustees that the board will pay 4 per cent., that indication is there.  In view of the fact that there is no indication by the board that they propose to repay the loan or have any desire to pay a lower rate of interest, I doubt if there is any real ground for apprehension <Col N="394" /> in the mind of the actuary. However, if it will satisfy the trustees, I will have the matter examined between now and Report Stage and see if it is possible to meet their fears, but frankly, short of putting a statutory obligation on them to repay at a certain rate of interest which, in view of the whole circumstances of the fund, I do not think would be reasonable, I do not know that there is any way in which the position can be met.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite prepared to leave it to the consideration of the Parliamentary Secretary.  He stressed, however, that, with the Ministerial amendment, it is most unlikely that any change in the rate of interest will take place.  Might I remind him that, in 1942, the board, with the consent and approval of the Department of Finance, fixed 4 per cent. as the rate of interest and that, in 1943, the Department of Finance was looking for 2½ per cent.&mdash; 12 months later?  Is there any reason why the ordinary employee should place greater faith in the board in 15 or 20 years' time than in the Department of Finance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>But they sought it, 12 months after the scheme had been launched on the basis of 4 per cent. Surely it is not beyond the bounds of possibility that, in 15 or 20 years' time, there may be in existence a board which may have an entirely different outlook on this matter.  The Department of Finance changed its mind in 12 months and, as the board itself has pointed out, superannuation schemes must have a basis of security&mdash;otherwise they are of no value to people who join them&mdash;and this security cannot be given in present circumstances.  They also point out that, from the other angle, it is not entirely without advantages. The trustees have indicated their willingness to invest the money at 4 per cent. and to accept that limitation and the board points out that there is a certain value from their point of view in having a steady rate of interest to meet.  What they are concerned with is the fact that the <Col N="395" /> scheme was introduced not merely to meet the rightful claims of employees of the board to a superannuation scheme but in an effort to improve the relations between the board and the employee because it is an essential undertaking.</P>
      <P>Remember that in that essential undertaking, in 1937, we had a general stoppage of work.  For many years there was an unhappy relationship between the board and the employees. The board are anxious to overcome that strained atmosphere.  They tried to do it in one way by trying to convince the employees that they had security of employment.  In return for that, in 1942, they asked the employees to undertake to give up certain of their rights in so far as certain matters might arise.  First of all, even to-day and even under the amending Bill, they are bound to refer all matters in dispute to the tribunal.  They are no longer under the penal clause once this Bill is passed.  All of this was part of an effort to improve relations.  One of the things that the board is concerned with now is that the idea may get abroad that the board as the employer may be guilty of bad faith at any time in the future and that the unstable atmosphere in the relationship with their employees may continue.  It is not too much to say that the board is most anxious to give the superannuation scheme this form of assurance that is looked for because they believe the employees are entitled to it and that they as employers will benefit from the greater stability that may be brought into the relations between the board and their employees.  I would press the Parliamentary Secretary to concentrate on what is being sought rather than on the suggestions that have been made so far to try to solve the problem and, if it is at all possible, to try to meet us on this matter because it is a responsibility that devolves on the Minister and he cannot escape.</P>

      <P>There is no doubt that what Deputy Larkin says has a great deal of weight in it but I think it even reinforces the point I was making that <Col N="396" /> any board in future that would attempt to impose conditions or, in this case, to impose a rate of interest, which would involve serious opposition from the trustees of the fund would not merely jeopardise the scheme but would inevitably cause deterioration in the relations which exist between the board and its employees.  For that reason, I think, more than any other, any board imbued with a sense of responsibility and a desire to continue harmonious relations between itself and the employees concerned would hesitate before it would seek to secure a lower rate of interest or take any step that would result in relations deteriorating. Anything that would in any way jeopardise this scheme would I believe have serious repercussions which the board could not ignore.</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £46,320 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1950, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Justice.</P>
      <P>Following what has become the settled practice on these Estimates.  I propose, if the House agrees, to deal generally with the whole group of Estimates&mdash;Votes 32 to 40 inclusive&mdash; and not to make separate statements on the separate Votes.  When I come to move the Financial Resolutions, Deputies will, of course, be free, with the permission of the Chair, to raise any points that may have been overlooked in the general debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The over-all picture as compared with last year is that there is a decrease of some £33,000 in the aggregate for the nine Votes in question. For purposes of comparison, the exact figures are as follows:&mdash;Last year, £3,448,930 (including Supplementary Estimates); this year, £3,415,860.  The main cause of the decrease is that the Estimate for the Garda Síochána&mdash; Vote 33&mdash;is down by some £54,000. This is due to the fact that we are budgeting this year for a slightly smaller force as appears on the face of the Estimate.  Of course, I do not expect that expenditure on the Garda <Col N="398" /> Síochána this year will be less than it was last year.  On the contrary, I expect it to be more, as there will be increases of pay with retrospective effect to be met, and for that purpose there will have to be a Supplementary Estimate in due course.  Except in the case of the Vote for the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds&mdash;Vote 38&mdash;where the increase is due to a provision for additional staff, the slight increases shown in most of the other votes have been necessitated mainly or wholly by the recent general revision of salaries and wages in the public service.  There is nothing in the detail of these Votes that appears to call for any special comment, so perhaps I may be permitted to draw attention to some matters of more general interest in connection with the work of my Department.</P>
    <P>The crime statistics for 1948 are not yet available in final form, but the provisional figures go to show that there has been a slight decline in serious crime during the past year.  In 1948 the total number of indictable crimes recorded was 14,980, as against 15,329 in 1947 and 17,305 in 1943, which was the peak year.  It is something that the trend is in the right direction, but I am bound to say that the figures I have quoted are not such as to give any cause for complacency.  The amount of serious crime measured by the number of indictable offences recorded is still more than double what it was in 1938, to take a normal pre-war year. Juvenile crime of the more serious kind has followed the general trend and shows a slight decline as compared with the previous year.  But here, too, there is no ground for complacency.</P>
    <P>So far as non-indictable crime is concerned, there has been an increase in the number of prosecutions for summary offences from 151,690 in 1947 to 168,515 in 1948.  A contributory factor has been the increase in the number of prosecutions under the Road Traffic Act.  This reminds me that last year when the Votes for which I am responsible were under discussion, there was reference to a number of matters arising in connection with the Road Traffic Act that it would have been more <Col N="399" /> appropriate to raise on the Vote for the office of the Minister for Local Government.  Accordingly, it is with some hesitation, lest I may be thought to have set a bad example, that I venture to refer to one aspect of the matter that is literally of vital interest to the public, namely, the number of fatal accidents on the roads.  No less than 201 persons were killed in road accidents during 1948.  Of these, 78 were pedestrians, 66 pedal cyclists, 45 drivers or passengers of mechanically propelled vehicles and 12 drivers or passengers of horses or horse-drawn vehicles.  No one can fail to be appalled by the tragic waste of human life which these figures reveal.  However, it would seem that the public conscience has been aroused.  There is an increasing awareness of the need for road safety largely, I believe, in consequence of the energetic measures that have been sponsored by the Minister for Local Government with the co-operation of the police and voluntary organisations.  As a result, the number of persons killed on the roads last year, though shocking to contemplate and a reproach to our civilisation, was less than in any of the years 1936, 1937 and 1938 notwithstanding that the number of mechanically propelled vehicles registered has gone up since that time by something like 75 per cent.  In 1936, for instance, there were no more than 61,000 such vehicles on the register, whereas last year there were 108,000.  Non-fatal accidents are down, too, but it would be a mistake to suppose that a true picture can be got from the figures I have quoted without taking into account various other factors (and, notably, mileage) with respect to which precise information is lacking.  Nevertheless, it is safe to say that there are encouraging signs that the road safety campaign is having an effect.  I trust that I have not been out of order in making these observations or that, if I have, no one will be tempted to follow me, as it is the Minister for Local Government who has the responsibility and is entitled to the credit in this matter.</P>
    <P>Turning now to prison administration, <Col N="400" /> I am glad to be able to report that there have been further improvements in prison conditions since last year.  It has now been decided to allow all prisoners to smoke, including the inmates of St. Patrick's.  Further recreational facilities have been provided by the installation in Mountjoy, Portlaoighise and St. Patrick's of cinema apparatus consisting of 16 millimetre projectors.  Prisoners are to have better clothing in future in consequence of the provision of a better quality of cloth.  These are some of the ways in which we have sought to make the prisoner's lot a less unhappy one while he is within the prison walls. But we have not stopped there.  The Discharged Prisoners' Aid Society will continue to receive support in the form of the increased grant which I announced last year.  It has been decided, moreover, that in future convicts who are released before completing their sentences are to be released unconditionally, in the majority of cases, and the so-called ticket of leave, which required the licensee to report regularly to the police, will now be the exception and not, as formerly, the rule.  The matter of prison buildings continues to call for attention and, during the year, a beginning has been made with the renovations and repairs necessitated by the enforced neglect of the emergency period.  Something has been done this year to improve the quarters of the indoor staffs and in the coming year it is hoped to tackle the prison cottages with a view to effecting such improvements as are practically possible.</P>
    <P>Deputies will remember that the need for additional staff in the central office of the Land Registry was foreshadowed in what I said on this subject last year.  The requisite provision is being made in this year's Estimate (Vote 38).  Because of circumstances outside our control, some of the newly created posts remain to be filled and others have had to be filled by temporary staff, with a consequent loss of efficiency.  Accordingly, it cannot be said that our staff requirements have been fully met.  The time-lag, which is inseparably associated with the provision of additional staff, has had a <Col N="401" /> more adverse effect in this instance because of the fact that we are witnessing an unprecedented expansion in the work of the central office of the Land Registry.  For this reason it has not been found possible, despite the best endeavours of the staff, wholly to avoid delays and to prevent the accumulation of arrears.  However, it is hoped to do better in the coming year. Needless to say I am fully alive to the importance to the rural community of the work of the Land Registry and will spare no effort to restore the position though I am afraid it may be some time before there is an inflow of staff sufficient to keep pace with the rapidly increasing intake of work.</P>
    <P>I have now concluded such observations as occur to me on topics that appear to be of some general interest. At the end of the debate I shall be glad to deal with any points of detail that may be raised in the course of the discussion and to furnish whatever explanations may be needed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. G. Boland Mr. G. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I move to refer this Estimate back.  I do not intend to call for a division unless I am not satisfied with the course of the debate.  The Minister's statement about crime bears out the opinion I expressed during the emergency period.  We generally had long debates on that point and I always contended that the increase was due to scarcities and the emergency conditions generally.  A lot of people who would never dream of stealing things did so when they found they were in short supply.  I must say that I was hopeful that there would have been a greater decrease than there has been. Still, I suppose there is some little cause for congratulation that there has been a slight decrease.  It is too bad that the figure is as high as it is.  However, I suppose that, so long as we have human nature as it is, we must accept the position.  No doubt, 50 per cent. of it could be accounted for in the City of Dublin.  That was the case when I was Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have often had long debates on juvenile crime.  It appeared to be the opinion of those who were then in Opposition that the Minister for Justice was responsible for the position arising out of juvenile delinquency, but I <Col N="402" /> always thought the matter would be more appropriate on the Vote for the Minister for Education.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>When it comes to the stage when the police have to interfere-it has gone very far.  There are several factors to be taken into consideration &mdash;education, school conditions, home conditions, and, I suppose, another factor would be the Church.</P>
      <P>I think the people who should be the last to be blamed were those who had to deal with the matter when it had gone more or less beyond control. There is only a slight reduction in the number.  We were all expecting that there would be a bigger decrease.  A few years ago there was an attempt made to get the St. John Bosco Society to help the probation officers, but it did not work out, I am afraid, as well as we hoped it would.  The intention was to try to get these boys and girls who were on probation to go to night school, and in that way lead them out of criminal ways.  There are a number of boys' and girls' clubs which probably are doing good work, but I do not think the idea came up to the expectation we had at the time.</P>
      <P>It is appalling to know that 201 persons were killed last year as the result of road accidents.  I do not think, however, the facts were as the Minister stated&mdash;that fewer people were killed than in years when there were fewer vehicles licensed.  Nevertheless, there are too many cases of drunken people driving cars.  I do not know what the position is now in regard to that, but I think there is too much of it.  Most Deputies who spoke on this Estimate last year dealt with that matter. Coming up to closing time you see long queues of cars outside some public-houses. Now when there are so many cars on the road the danger is twice as great as it was.  It is not my business to tell the courts how to deal with these people when charged, but I think they should be dealt with more stringently. Being in charge of a car while drunk is a crime which should not be countenanced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was glad to hear about the improved conditions in the prisons.  I did what I could in regard to that matter, <Col N="403" /> in spite of the fact that they were compared with the Belsen Camp by some people.  If we went much further in providing amenities for persons in prison it would be a question whether there would not be queues waiting outside to get in.  The only thing prisoners would be suffering from would be loss of liberty.  There was an opinion in the Department in my time which I was rather inclined to share that if there were fewer lengthy terms of imprisonment given, especially to young people, and more rigorous treatment while they were in prison, they might be more reluctant to go to jail than they are at present.  This is a question which it is hard to deal with.</P>
    <P>We must not lose sight of the fact that when people get certain privileges like being allowed to smoke and being provided with better clothing, which happened in my time in the Department, there is a certain amount of punishment in taking these privileges from them.  That may be more beneficial for them than even harsh treatment. If you give them these extra amenities, the threat to take them from them may be more of a deterrent than harsh treatment all the time or the threat of more severe punishment.  On the whole, I think that giving them an easier time in jail may have a good effect.  Let us hope so at any rate.</P>
    <P>As to the question of ticket-leave, that is a matter as to which the Minister is the best judge.  There are some cases in which I certainly think it would be undesirable not to attach certain conditions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>There were some.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. G. Boland Mr. G. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There should be. Only once when I was Minister for Justice had a person who was out on licence to be brought back to prison. In a certain type of case, the Minister would be badly advised not to keep some control over such people who had committed very serious offences.  I should not like, however, to hinder their future in any way.  I should like to give them every opportunity to rehabilitate themselves.  But if a person does something which entitles the State to take his liberty from him and if the State sees fit to release him <Col N="404" /> on licence, I think the authorities should be satisfied that he will behave himself in future.</P>
      <P>With regard to prison buildings, I suppose the Minister is not being annoyed by the Minister for Agriculture now in regard to them.  When I was Minister for Justice during the war, when you could not get materials to build anything, the present Minister for Agriculture was demanding a new Borstal institution and all the rest. The present Minister for Finance was very flatheamhlach about cash.  At that time he wanted to have running water in the cells in Mountjoy.  He asked whether it was our intention to degrade people in prison, to make them feel as down-and-out as we possibly could. Last year I suggested that the Minister who suggested all these things might now make some move to give effect to some of the proposals which he made when I was in charge of the Department. I suppose that is a matter for the future.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether the site for the Borstal institution which we were thinking of in the Department has been acquired.  I made the suggestion last year&mdash;it was not altogether my suggestion because it was being considered by the Department&mdash;that it might be better to ask the Oblate Fathers to take charge of some of these young fellows who are in the Borstal institution. Some of them are tough lads who have been in jail more than once.  If some new institution were being thought of, perhaps a modern prison could be built and Mountjoy done away with. That could not be done in a day, but at least plans in that direction should be undertaken.  I do not know whether the Minister has considered that, but we were thinking of it when I was in charge of the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has told us that they are planning for a smaller Garda force. I do not think that is a wise policy. Last year he said it was not being done for the purpose of economising, but that it was a deliberate policy.  I do not think it is justified.  However, it is his responsibility.  Nobody can suggest that the City of Dublin is over-policed. So far as the country is concerhed, I pointed out last year that most of the small stations had only <Col N="405" /> three Guards and that they were doing very useful work.  Unless a man is supposed to work for 24 hours per day, it really means that there is only one Guard on duty at a time; that is if they were to have an eight-hour day like other employees.  The Guards are used for all sorts of work and I think that practice should be continued.  A lot of the non-police duties performed by the Guards are performed at least as well as they could be by any other officials.  When I was Minister, the late Deputy Coogan was against giving any duties that were not police duties proper to Guards in country districts. My opinion is that the Government would be well advised to give more of that sort of work to the Guards.  I would be in favour of giving them more pay and giving them more of that inspectorial work.  It could be done cheaper and better by them.  Very probably a Guard in uniform would get more accurate information from people.  The people would be more inclined to tell him the truth than they would to an ordinary inspector.  I think that would be a move in the right direction.</P>
    <P>I mentioned last year the great help we got from the Guards in 1940 during the emergency.  When we found that a parachutist had been likely to be dropped here we were concerned as to what was likely to happen.  Practically overnight the L.D.F. sprang into existence as a result of the action of the Guards all over the country.  The Guards can be very helpful to the people in many ways.  If Guards who are good footballers or hurlers are sent to any area it generally results in that area turning out first-class footballers or hurlers.  That is not a thing to be scoffed at; it is very important.</P>
    <P>I do not know how much further the Minister intends to go with the cessation of recruiting.  The wastage in the force used to be something in the neighbourhood of 200 a year.  There was no recruiting last year and there is to be none this year.  That means that the wastage will amount to about 400.  Unless the Minister has some definite figure in mind which he will be able to do with, I think he is taking a very dangerous line.  There must be <Col N="406" /> a big number of Guards coming near the retiring age.  Those who came in in 1922 should be coming near the retiring age.  If they all go out, unless the training facilities have been greatly improved since I was in charge of the Department, the Commissioner will find it practically impossible to have men properly trained to replace them. I think it is unwise for the Minister to go too far with that stoppage of recruiting.</P>
    <P>Every year that I had charge of the Estimates for the Department practically every speaker in the House demanded that houses should be built for the Guards.  I think Deputy Davin was always very much to the fore in these matters.  I must say I was always very sympathetic to that myself.  It was always pointed out that the Guards were already getting housing allowances which at that time would have covered the cost.  I know it would not do so now because building costs are so much greater.  Certainly something should be done about it.</P>
    <P>One of the last things I was responsible for was a Bill empowering the Committee of Public Works to acquire sites so that they could provide both Garda stations and houses.  I know that the Commissioner was in a very difficult position both from the point of view of the efficiency of the force and the inconvenience of a good number of the members of the force by the lack of accommodation.  Guards he wishes to transfer either for their own betterment or who, for disciplinary reasons, ought to be transferred to some other areas could not be transferred because if they were the house was immediately snapped up by the owner who wanted to sell it at a high price.  Certainly, if they built these houses the Guards could be changed as the Commissioner thought fit and it would be better for the Guards, for the force and for the housing situation because these houses would then be available for the members of the ordinary public.  The Minister should tell us whether he has taken any step in that direction.</P>
    <P>Next I come to the question of Garda pay.  I do not want to make <Col N="407" /> any political capital out of that.  I know the difficulties.  I know that when I was in the Department representative bodies were periodically making demands for increased pay and at no time was I able to meet their full demands.  The present Minister for Finance was able to tell me, when I brought in the last Estimate I was responsible for in which increased pay for the Guards amounted to £365,000, that if that was four times as great it would not be too much.  That is what he said on that occasion.  If I was Minister for Justice with a Minister for Finance like that I would insist on getting the increased pay for the Gardaí dated back to May.  If I could not get them any more than they did get I would at least insist that they get the same treatment as the civil servants.  One of the remarks I heard, and one I believe myself, is that the reason civil servants got their increase back to May was because they had a representative in the Government. That is the feeling abroad through the country and I share it.  There was discrimination there which there ought not to be.</P>

      <P>They had as representative a Minister who was a secretary of a Government trade union.  That is as clear as I can make it.  The Post Office Workers' Union forced the issue. That is the general opinion.  Of all the servants of the State the ones for whom the most effort should be made to keep content is the Guards.  They are not too well paid.  There should be no discrimination against them, anyhow.  Any retrospective payment made should at least go as far back as in the case of civil servants.  Apparently, after a lot of negotiation it was put back from January to November. I am surprised that the Minister did not pull his weight to get it put back to May.  One cause of complaint would then be removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister did not refer to the political situation.  There was not much reason to do so because, luckily, there has been no political violence in <Col N="408" /> his time and there had not been, indeed, for about five years before I left office.  However, I am sorry to say there has been a big change in the Minister's own attitude on this question. Last year during the debate I did not refer to some of the things I had done.  I did not intend to refer to them.  I wished him good luck and hoped he would have a happier time in the Department than I had.  On the second day of the debate, I think, he actually showed his goodwill by dealing with a matter I had not bothered about.  He drew the Chair's attention to the accusation of murder which a member of the House made against the last Government and which I took to mean against myself.  When I got up to speak I expressed my appreciation of his action in doing that.  That was some time towards the end of June last year.  However, about a month after that apparently a campaign initiated by the Taoiseach started off in Skibbereen and continued in three or four other places in which it was actually said that the previous Government had killed people for the difference between the External Relations Act and the Republic of Ireland Act.</P>

      <P>I am going to relate that.  In the first speech the Taoiseach said that they would rule the country without a military tribunal, implying quite clearly that the Fianna Fáil Government was anxious to rule with a military tribunal.  He apparently forgot that the first military tribunal was set up by the Government of which he was the Attorney-General.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy had had armed police in front of his house as I have he might take a more serious view of the matter than he does.  I expressed my appreciation of the Minister's statement last year.  The Chair did not notice it although I heard it quite plainly over here.  The Minister apparently felt so much about it that he thought fit to get up here to ask that the Deputy be given a chance of withdrawing the charge, which he did. Then the Minister said, following the lead of the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste, that we had executed people without evidence.  He said I had left festering sores in the Department when he reached it.</P>

      <P>I beg your pardon but that was what was said.  I did no such thing.  He got an efficient Department; he got a peaceful country.  Not a shot had been fired at a Guard since Gárda Mordaunt was shot in 1942.  There has not been one since and, please God, there will not be.  I deplore the change in the attitude of the Minister.  I can only assume it was brought about by his anxiety to please one of the small Parties which form this Government. It is a disgrace that he should have lent himself to it.  I will not say much more about it.</P>
      <P>A question was asked to-day and so far as I can gather the Minister in his written reply said that the Guards were instructed to pull down a certain poster which was inciting people to violence. He can correct me if I am wrong.  In answer to a Supplementary Question he appeared to reverse what he had said in his written reply.  He was asked, apparently with reference to the same posters which had been put up by a political organisation, whether this had been completely unauthorised and he said: &ldquo;Yes, that is so.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>All right.  I wanted that cleared up, for this reason that we want to know definitely where we stand in this matter.  The Government must <Col N="410" /> have knowledge of these things, and there has been too much of that going on.  We have a Party here now.  I was glad to see them coming in, whether they believe it or not, in the firm hope that they would get all the elements who thought they knew more than the people's representatives and who wanted to take action&mdash;armed action&mdash; here in advance of what the people's representatives in Parliament were inclined to take.  I was hopeful that that particular Party would be able to convince those people that we were the best judges of what was in the national interest in that way, and that if there was any action to be taken it was the people's representatives who would take it after full and mature consideration. I do not want drastic action taken against anyone, but when I see these posters being displayed and the Government allowing public meetings to be held advocating violence I think that is very foolish.</P>
      <P>I will admit that in the first four years of our time in office we allowed a great deal of latitude in that direction and we paid dearly for it.  As Deputy O'Higgins has reminded me, we voted against the setting up of the military tribunal.  We thought that the powers that were being given to it were too drastic, but I was not long in the Government until I found that they were not too drastic and that they were absolutely necessary.  I hope that we shall always have the position in the future when it will never be necessary to use them, but it is not going to help if you allow wild people to go out and make inflammatory speeches calling for recruits for an organisation.  I do not know whether it is legal or not; it was illegal in our time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all, I hope, of the one mind in this matter that we want to see this country united and free.  We have this Parliament here and, at least, for this part of the country the voice of this Parliament ought to be supreme and nothing else should be tolerated.  It is all right when things are quiet to shut our eyes to things.  The present Minister for Defence rather exaggerated when he said during the general election that we had forgotten how we &mdash;that is Fianna Fáil&mdash;had sanctified <Col N="411" /> so-called political crimes by illegally opening the jail gates when we took over the government.  He was wrong in that statement.  We did not do it illegally.  We had authority to do it. If the present Minister for Justice is correctly reported he acted illegally, because he said that he consulted nobody when he let out five prisoners who had been convicted of serious crimes. He said he did that on his own authority. He had no authority whatever to do it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">

      <P>The Minister said it in Cardonagh last November.  I am not objecting to him letting these people out at all.  That is a matter for himself. That was done before this Estimate was taken last year.  I left no festering sores, and anybody who was sentenced by that court was sentenced by a court which was set up by the unanimous consent of both this House and the other House.  There is no question about that, because during the whole time that that court was passing sentences there was no question raised until after the 1943 General Election.  Things were quietening down. I certainly am sorry and I would not have raised this if things had been left as they were.  But the Government thought fit, I suppose, for getting a thoughtless and extreme wing to support them, to do this, and I am not going to allow the Estimate to pass without expressing my opinion of the Minister and of the Government.  I hope that the result will not be disastrous which it could easily be, unless they decide whether they are going to have one army or not in this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>The activities of this Department which is under discussion are so wide and so varied that it would <Col N="412" /> be difficult for any one speaker to cover them all.  I must confess or, let me say rather, I would confess under other circumstances to a feeling of surprise at the method and manner in which consideration of this Estimate was approached by a former occupant of this particular Ministry.  I only propose to refer very briefly to what has been said by Deputy Boland.  Before doing so I think it is only right that I should tell the House quite frankly&mdash; and I say this without bitterness&mdash;that the impression that was made upon me by Deputy Boland's approach to this Estimate was this: that the governing factor in Deputy Boland's mind was one of bitterness, a bitterness and a vindictiveness directed particularly against the members of the Clann na Poblachta Party and, generally, against the Deputies sitting on this side of the House, a bitterness and a vindictiveness which is motivated by the fact that Deputy Boland and his colleagues are no longer in the saddle and that they now sit in the benches opposite. Deputy Boland appears to be disappointed&mdash;I hope I do him an injustice in this; I would be glad to think that I am mistaken&mdash;but certainly the impression that he conveyed to me was that there was a certain sense of disappointment, albeit unexpressed, underlying his remarks, that the present Minister can come to the House with the story of a peaceful and united country, of a country governed without military tribunals and a country without political prisoners rotting in jail.</P>
      <P>I think it is only right that I should say this to the Minister, that, generally speaking, the manner in which his Department has been administered since he took office is one which calls for the approbation of Deputies.  It may not be the most spectacular of Ministries, but in the life of the ordinary people it is probably one of the most important, and the present occupant has shown by his method of administration that he brings to the discharge of his duties a breath of humanity, a common-sense outlook and a desire to serve the people rather than to pose as one of their jack-booted masters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are certain minor matters of policy and administration in respect of <Col N="413" /> which I will disagree with the Minister. One of them already has been mentioned. Reference has been made to the tearing down of a poster, &ldquo;Arm Now to Take the North&rdquo;.  The poster, I understand, was issued by the Aiseirighe organisation, an organisation for whose social and economic policy I have not the slightest use, an organisation which has an attitude towards the organisation of society to which those of us on these benches would be fundamentally opposed but, nevertheless, I think that the members of this organisation were entitled in their poster, as they already had done in their newspaper, to advocate to the Government of this country&mdash;because that is what they did&mdash;that provision should be made for the arming of the Defence Forces.  I am not concerned one way or the other with Aiseirighe as an organisation, but I do know that their attitude in that respect was made perfectly clear in their own weekly organ.  I do not know whether it is still published or not, but I know that is the attitude most of them take.  So much for the poster.</P>
    <P>Now for a minor matter completely unconnected with the train of thought I have been following.  The Minister to-day, in response to a Parliamentary question, indicated that he did not think it possible further to control the issue of hackney licences.  Just as it is fresh in my mind, I would like to point out to the Minister that there is in this city at the moment considerable hardship being inflicted on numbers of hackney owners totally dependent for their living on hackney driving and, in effect, their living is being filched away from them by individuals doing part-time hackney work.  I think the Minister has seen representatives of these men.  I have seen them on two or three occasions and I am quite satisfied from the case they made that they are, by reason of the free issue of these licences, being deprived of an opportunity of earning a living.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a few words to the Minister with reference to the administration of justice in our courts. I think the matter was mentioned last <Col N="414" /> year by some Deputy&mdash;I think by an Opposition Deputy.  I referred to it also and the Minister expressed himself as being in general sympathy.  I refer to provision for the payment of jurors.  I understand that legislation is not necessary in order to effect that. I submit to the Minister that it is undemocratic that there should be a property qualification for service as a juryman.  In actual fact, I think the Minister is aware of this also, that there is difficulty on the part of court officials in getting a sufficiency of jurymen to serve on juries in both civil and criminal cases.  That is due to the fact that we have in this city a property qualification.  That property qualification is not constant throughout the country; it varies from county to county.  I urge on the Minister that any citizen&mdash;any male citizen if he likes to qualify it so far, though I think we could, perhaps, with good result follow the example of other countries in allowing women to serve on juries&mdash;but certainly any male citizen over 30 years and of average intelligence ought in a democratic country be entitled to carry out his duties as a juryman.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to refer the Minister to the necessity for reexamining the position in regard to registration of title both in the Land Registry and in the Registry of Deeds. Members of my own profession in the House will bear me out when I say that it is time there was an examination of the position in both of these offices so that there can be a more speedy registration of title.  I cannot suggest the method to the Minister whereby it would be achieved, but I think it would be in the public interest that there should be a greater encourcaus <Col N="415" /> agement to people to take out, at the appropriate time, immediately after the death, grants of probate and administration and that we would not have a position created wherein it becomes necessary at some stage to take out perhaps three or four grants at a time.</P>
      <P>I think it is time also that the Minister would consider once more the rates of remuneration of many of the more lowly paid officials working in the courts.  It is not a subject upon which I wish to speak at length; I am sure there will be other Deputies speaking after me who will urge consideration for these officials on the Minister, particularly the unestablished officials in the Circuit Courts, but I would not like to be on my feet here without making a plea to the Minister for more consideration of the position.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether the question of juvenile delinquency has been actively engaging the attention of the officials of the Minister's Department. If it has not, I would suggest that it should.  I do not think any useful purpose is served by painting a gloomy picture, but I think in Dublin it definitely is a problem and I am not sure that the solutions that have already been attempted are real solutions; in fact, I am quite sure that they are not. I think the whole position wants examination.  I think we should examine the system whereunder we have a number of men, albeit the number is small, who have a successive history of corrective institution, Borstal, Mountjoy and Maryborough. These are habitual criminals.  Where that type of history recurs in any number of cases, there is a definite pointer to the Minister and his Department indicating that he should examine and see if the initial treatment of the juvenile delinquent is not at fault.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice that as far as the City of Dublin is concerned&mdash;I am not sure whether this is the responsibility of the Minister for Justice or the Minister for Local Government&mdash;provision has been made for parking cars.  I think the problem of parking and the problem of the speed limit require consideration. I do not know whether the <Col N="416" /> Minister has considered the suggestion previously made that the parking of cars should be prohibited completely in the centre of the city.  Every day there are instances in the narrower streets of traffic jams lasting 15 or 20 minutes due to irregular parking. These are due in many cases to the fact that cars are parked in &ldquo;no waiting&rdquo; places.  The only remedy open to the Guards at the moment is to wait until the delinquent returns.  The situation might be rendered much more effective if towing cars were at the disposal of the Guards so that these cars which are parked in the wrong places might be removed by them to some kind of pound.</P>
    <P>The Minister's task may have been relatively easy over the past 12 months, but the Minister should realise that he has in key positions in the Garda Síochána men who are inimical to a policy of peace and unity in the Minister's sphere of jurisdiction.  I would ask the Minister to accept from me that I do not make that statement lightly.  I know what I am talking about.  During his predecessor's régime men were placed in key positions in the police force who, in many instances, regard themselves as the servants of a political Party and not as the servants of either the nation or the State.  The number is small.  I would not like it to be taken that I am making any charge against the Garda as a whole.  The number is small, but the positions which these men occupy are important.  I ask the Minister to bear that fact in mind if any attempt is made to misrepresent to him the internal position; if that attempt has not been made heretofore, it will be made in the future.  It will be made not without the knowledge of the Deputies on the opposite benches.</P>
    <P>Last year, when speaking on this Estimate, I appealed to the Minister to allow the bodies of a number of republicans, who were executed during his predecessor's régime, Christian burial at the hands of their relatives.  I think it would be ungracious of me were I not to take this opportunity of telling the Minister that his action in acceding to that request was one which was deeply appreciated.  It showed a new outlook and a desire to heal, rather <Col N="417" /> than to keep open, the wounds.  So long as the Minister pursues that policy he will do a good job of work.</P>
    <P>I would urge upon the Minister to ensure that the co-operation between the Special Branch, so-called, of the Garda Síochána with M.15 of the British service and with the police force of that part of our territory which is in occupation ceases to exist.  It did exist under his predecessor's régime; if it exists under the Minister's, I believe it does so without his knowledge. I think Deputy Boland was hopeful that he would start a bitter and acrimonious debate.  I shall not pursue the line that Deputy Boland, apparently, intended this debate to take.  Everything I have said, I have said in all sincerity and in the belief that my statements might prove of some assistance or guidance to the Minister.  Deputy Boland and some of his colleagues have filthily, foully and maliciously slandered me. I am not concerned with them.  I am well able to deal with them and well able to reply to them elsewhere, but I would ask the Minister to ensure that no matter what attempt may be made from mean political motives by a small minority, let me say, of the Party opposite, nothing will induce him to depart from the wise policy he is at present pursuing.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether I should take the last speaker seriously or not.  I am rather inclined to think that the general public who, after all, have a considerable amount of common-sense, are not inclined to take him seriously.  What I want to take seriously is the whole line of policy of the Department of Justice.  So far as we are concerned, we are very much interested in helping the Minister for Justice to formulate and to pursue a clear line of policy during a time which is pretty dangerous.  I cannot help commenting on some of the observations of the last speaker in regard to our policy when in office, though nobody can take seriously the remarks of a Deputy who suggests that the jackboot had been used or that we sought to exercise a certain mastership over certain people who differed from us in politics.  The whole existence of the State, and the neutrality policy which <Col N="418" /> was supported by every Party in the House was threatened at that time. That is one of the things that disconcerted me in Irish politics, to find this sordid and cynical alliance between Fine Gael and the people to whom they were so fundamentally opposed during a long period.</P>

      <P>There are certain matters on which we want a clear enunciation of policy from the Department of Justice.  To-day the Minister in answer to a question said that the Garda Síochána have not instructions to tear down posters or literature posted up by any political organisation but that they were instructed recently to remove a poster which read: &ldquo;Arm now to take the North&rdquo;.  He hoped the Deputy would not question the propriety of removing that particular poster.  Deputy Captain Cowan then asked: &ldquo;Do I take it that the action of the Gardaí in tearing down political posters&mdash;posters put up by political organisations&mdash;in those circumstances was completely unauthorised and without <Col N="419" /> authority?&rdquo;  and the Minister said: &ldquo;Yes, that is so&rdquo;.

      <P>You are dealing with the whole of public opinion, not with a few individuals.  Everybody knows that the former Minister, Deputy Boland, was a most generous man in dealing with his opponents, that he is more quick to forgive an opponent than anybody else but when people say that the last Government killed people for the difference between the External Relations Act and the Republic you cannot expect that statement to go without a very strong protest.  Everybody knows the reason why we, as a Government, had to exercise that authority because only a Government can have the power of life and death over citizens and only one authority can have the power of governing any country and of declaring war.  That situation had to be dealt with and it was a very dangerous situation indeed.</P>
      <P>To pass from these things I can assure Deputies that it is not my wish to enter into this kind of controversy. I do hope that the Minister will also take advice from the experience of a former Minister and do his best to increase the number of Guards.  They have been reduced, according to the Estimate, from 7,323 in 1948 to 7,211 this year.</P>

      <P>I strongly support the appeal made by Deputy Boland, but I am sure that it is the hope of Deputies on every side of the House to have an improvement where it is possible in the living conditions of the Guards, whether they live in barracks provided by the State or whether they are married men who have to seek suitable housing accommodation locally.  I know that in pressing the present Minister I am pressing a man who will respond to that appeal as far as the facilities of the State, financial and otherwise, will allow him.  In many areas in my constituency there is a certain amount of jealousy when Guards apply for, or rather secure, possession of houses let by the local authority.  As every Deputy knows, and Deputy Boland in particular, the financial arrangements in connection with houses built by a local authority are such that they are intended for civilians living in insanitary and unsafe houses which have been condemned by the medical officer of health, and when there are a large number of applicants for them and when a Guard gets a house there is jealousy. The Minister knows that the Minister for Local Government recently sent out a special appeal to the manufacturers of this country to use their <Col N="422" /> reserve funds, wherever it was possible for them to do so, to build houses locally and supply the need that arose wherever these manufacturing concerns existed for houses for their own employees.  I suggest that the State should be the first to give a good example in that direction and employ some agency, the Board of Works or some other State Department, to build a limited number of houses convenient to every Garda station, particularly those manned by a large number of Guards, so that there will not be jealousy or a fight for suitable housing accommodation by married Guards.</P>
      <P>Another aspect of this question was brought very forcibly to my notice recently.  In the southern area of Laoighis which I have the honour to represent there is one station which has been noted for a number of years for the number of transfers which have taken place from it.  The suggestion which I am putting to the Minister and which I have heard locally is that any married Guard who displeases the wife of the sergeant is bound to get the run from there to some other place.  It was stated to me in the last few days that the station was run by the wife of the sergeant.  It is true, and you can put your finger on the station if you look up the numbers of transfers.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Without any disciplinary reason transfers of married Guards have taken place.  When that happens, and even when transfers take place for ordinary reasons, some regard should be paid by the people responsible for the transfers so that proper housing accommodation will be provided for the family of the married Guard who is transferred.  I know a married man to whom this happened and Deputy O'Higgins will confirm it I know, only I do not want to name the station.  It can easily be picked out.  I appeal to the Minister to use his good offices with the powers that be to see that when transfers take place some regard will be had to the need of the wife and family of the Guard who is transferred for reasons other than disciplinary reasons; even if the transfer is for disciplinary <Col N="423" /> reasons such matters should be taken into consideration.  Is it fair that a Guard with a wife and four or five young children who have been occupying a house with decent living conditions should be condemned to live in the station to which he is transferred? I know that the Minister does not stand for that kind of treatment, and I would ask him to use his good offices with whatever headquarters officers sanction these transfers.  A number of these transfers have been made from headquarters.  I know what I am talking about and anonymous letters have been sent in against decent Guards who have given long service, and they are transferred because some person has not the courage to put his name to a document which he has sent in for personal or spiteful reasons.</P>
      <P>I join with Deputy Lehane in asking the Minister to deal, in his reply, with an old outstanding claim which has been under consideration for a long period by the Minister for Justice and the Department of Finance in connection with the conditions and position of court officers.  If the Minister has not already conveyed his final decision to the people concerned, I would be glad if he would make a statement on it now.</P>
      <P>There is another matter and I am not unduly excited about it.  Public statements have been made by members of this House, inside and outside the House, allegations and insinuations, against public servants in some cases, as to the extent to which communism exists in this country.  I am surprised that Deputy Boland did not refer to this matter because some of his colleagues on the front bench referred to it during the past week.  I am surprised that Deputy MacEntee, who has said so much on the matter inside and outside the House, has not come forward now that he is free to put forward any evidence he has in order to help the Minister to deal with a situation which, according to him, is going from bad to worse.  I do not think Deputy MacEntee could be muzzled by anybody.</P>

      <P>It is a matter of public concern, a matter on which the public can become excited and a matter on which I believe there has been a good deal of exaggeration.  I listened to a public lecture in the town of Dún Laoghaire, where I reside, by an Englishman, a convert, who is touring the country and dealing with matters of this kind.  I listened to him for two hours and 50 minutes and he was the most eloquent speaker I have listened to for a long time.  The fact that he was not Irish and was a recent convert may have made him talk so eloquently. He talked of his tour of the country. He had been in almost every diocese and county in the country and he spoke in rather an excited way about the extent to which he believes communism exists in the country.  I thought at the end of the lecture that he was unduly excited and did not understand the country.  He spoke of one county and I took the liberty of speaking to a high Church dignitary with regard to this report of the extent to which communism existed in that diocese.  The bishop concerned did not share the view of the lecturer, but I would put it to the Minister that if he thinks the matter worthy of consideration he should deal with it in his reply.  I know that we have some fellow travellers in this country, but it would be queer at this time of our lives if we had not people of that kind.  I would be personally concerned that they should not get any facilities to carry on their operations freely here.  On one occasion, permission was given&mdash;I suppose it had to be given&mdash;to a certain gentleman, a Scotchman, I believe, to land here and subsequently deliver a lecture at a well known hostelry in Baggot Street.</P>

I want to say to the Minister that I do not wish gentlemen of this kind to get permits to come in or facilities to carry on their activities in connection with the spread of communism. I will support the Minister in any reasonable action he may take to deprive such people of those facilities.  We have certain places in this city of Dublin where lectures are delivered by certain gentlemen in connection with communism and communistic activities.  Every Deputy who concerns himself here with the public welfare knows that perfectly well.  I am only urging the Minister to use whatever powers he has, in a common-sense way&mdash;and I know the common-sense way the Minister always acts and will act&mdash;to see that people of that kind, whether Irish citizens or otherwise, do not get any facilities to carry on their operations.</P>

      <P>Then he went on to enlighten me and other Deputies and the Minister for Justice by saying that there were special lectures by people who called themselves communists in this city.  With those few remarks, I will await more enlightenment from the honourable Deputy on this particular point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome Deputy Lehane's conversion to constitutional ideas.  He accused my honourable colleague, Deputy Boland, of being uncharitable. <Col N="426" /> Deputy Boland, as Minister for Justice during a very turbulent period in this country, was very charitable and very lenient and was anxious at all times to avoid anything that would be responsible for causing trouble.  His hand was forced and the hands of the Government were forced to do things that no Government wished to do.  He had been accused by Deputy Lehane of being bitter and disappointed.  His opening speech here after the change of Government was to wish the present Minister for Justice luck in his undertaking in that Department.  If that was bitterness or uncharitableness, he would not have adopted that line.</P>
    <P>We are facing a position in our country where the Department of Justice has taken, and will have to take, an active part in protecting what a number of Irishmen have gone to premature graves to attain, that is, that this State should remain a democratic State and that this Parliament should be always supreme and that no other forces&mdash;misguided forces&mdash;in the country should carry on anything contrary to the wishes of this Parliament. We hope that anybody who has any influence with people of that kind will ask them to adopt the constitutional issue as far as we are concerned here. People who come along and propose from time to time to do certain things in the interest of the Irish nation should by this time have realised that we have a free Parliament and a free country, so far as the Twenty-Six Counties are concerned, and that we should carry out anything that is needed from this Parliament here.</P>
    <P>There was a discussion here on better prison treatment.  As Deputy Boland pointed out, some members of the present Government, when they were in opposition, criticised the Department of Justice for not adopting more reformed ideas and principles with reference to prison life.  As to what could be done with the prisoner&mdash;let him be juvenile delinquent or advanced criminal&mdash;I believe you will get more out of him, from a human point of view, by trying to reform him inside the prison, by giving him better conditions. If you give him harsh treatment, you are going to put him up against <Col N="427" /> society and when he comes out he will take any opportunity he can to have his revenge on society.</P>
    <P>We are dealing here with the ordinary criminal, with the child delinquent.  This is a point to which I have given some study for some years and I definitely say still, as far as the Department of Justice is concerned, that we have not advanced in regard to child delinquency as far as I would like to see us advancing.  We have reached the point where it must be admitted that mental specialists should be put in charge of child delinquents. While we have probation officers there, we have carried on in a reasonable way, but not as far as I would like to see that work done.  By proper treatment of the child delinquent, we may stop a child from a life of crime.  I have listened to many a sad story from a child starting off at 16 or 17 years of age, going along the years and perfecting his criminal education inside the prison walls.  If the child is got in time and handled properly and treated for the disease with which he is affected, he may, instead of being a criminal and being a pest of society, become a decent citizen of the State. I advocate any improvements that would be responsible for changing people who commit crime and continue to commit crime.  Anything that can be done to remould their characters is to be strongly advocated.  Remember that you can always get more out of men or women by leading them in a kind way rather than by driving them.  There is something in human nature that, if you keep driving them and persecuting them you only make them more inhuman than they are.</P>
    <P>With reference to Garda pay, I am very disappointed that the present Minister for Justice is not doing something worth while on that point.  I subscribe to the views of Deputy Boland when he said the Gardaí should be treated the same as civil servants. If the civil servants can get their pay from a particular point or from a particular time retrospectively, I do not see why the Gardaí should not get it also.  I have had information for some time that some of our trained Gardaí, <Col N="428" /> with nine or ten years' service, are resigning and leaving the country.  That is a very bad state of affairs.  I do not see why their conditions should not be made satisfactory, and, if we treat one type of public servant in one way, we should treat other types in the same way.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the housing of Guards, a very contentious matter. I strongly recommend that the Minister should take it into serious consideration and that, especially in rural areas, he should build houses for the Garda adjacent to the barrack or in the district. In present conditions, they are applying for council cottages, which sometimes gives rise to local enmity. By reason of the scarity of houses, they have sometimes to live in hovels under shocking conditions.  Now that things are coming back to normal, I strongly recommend the building of these houses for the Gardaí.  With regard to the bicycle allowance, members of the Garda have complained to me that the allowance is very small, especially for those Gardaí who have to do a lot of bicycle duty.</P>
    <P>I must take serious cognisance of the statement made by Deputy Lehane regarding a political police force.  It is very easy to come in here and point the finger at certain members of the force and allege that they are friends of a political Party&mdash;I use the word allege with emphasis&mdash;but I do not think it is a fair thing for any Deputy to do.  The force, when asked to do their job during the emergency, did it well.  They were responsible for recruiting into the emergency services and in that respect they did much good work.  They preserved the integrity of this State in so far as it was humanly possible for them to do so and it is not fair that any Deputy should take advantage of the privileges of this House to make that allegation against them. If there is any ground for it, the Deputy has another way of drawing attention to it.  No names were mentioned, but I would prefer to hear names mentioned than that it should be done by innuendo, with the implication that they were told to do certain things and that crime was to be manufactured. The allegation was not worthy of the Deputy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="429" /> The Garda have many duties to discharge, apart from their ordinary duties, but notwithstanding that and notwithstanding the unemployment position, I see that the force is to be reduced.  I wonder if the Minister is wise in adopting that policy, in view of traffic conditions in our cities and towns.  He gave us the numbers in the force in 1939 and 1949, and it is a matter he should reconsider because there are a number of fine young fellows going away in the emigrant ship day after day who could possibly be recruited into the Garda.</P>

      <P>The issue of hackney licences is a rather hackneyed question, because it has been raised on several occasions.  It has been represented to me by people who are associated with the hackney business that their livelihoods are being snapped away by part-time hackney people who take on hackney work after their ordinary day's work.  I understand that the Minister had the matter under consideration some time ago and that he received a deputation in connection with it.  I do not think that these part-time people should be allowed to compete with those who are making their livelihood solely from the business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is about time the jury system was extended to people other than property owners.  In rural parishes in my constituency, jurors are summoned for service rather often, and, while they may have a little property, a number of them are struggling people who have to leave their work at great inconvenience. I am not objecting in any way to the jury system, but I suggest that it should be extended to people other than property owners.  It is, I agree, another day's work, but such an extension would mean that the people I refer to would not be called for jury service so often.  Another Deputy referred to the payment of jurors <Col N="430" /> and an extension such as I suggest would mean that jurors would have to be paid because a man cannot be expected to be at the loss of his day's pay by reason of serving on a jury. Finally, there is the question of the lowly paid officials, district court clerks.  I make a passing reference to them because I have received complaints from them from time to time.</P>

      <P>I should like to express agreement with the views put forward by Deputy C. Lehane.  It would be very regrettable if this debate were allowed to travel along the lines which Deputy Boland and Deputy Little endeavoured to turn it. Deputies should appreciate the presentation of his case by the Minister and should heed the appeal made by him that the debate should not be turned on to a wrong track.  I should like also to say to both Deputy Boland and Deputy Little that, in so far as their efforts are deliberately designed to try to stir up any past division or past bitterness which the formation of this Government has healed, and particularly in so far as they endeavoured to do that for purely political purposes, their efforts, so far as Deputies on these benches are concerned, will have no effect whatever.  The sooner they give up the better for themselves and the country as a whole.  I do not want to dwell at any great length on this subject but I do think it is very regrettable that the two speakers who opened the debate for the Opposition should have set out on what appeared to me to be a very deliberate effort to create mischief, obviously for the purpose of gaining some Party political advantage, although I cannot see how they can get that because, if it comes to comparisons, they will not come very well out of it.</P>
      <P>I was glad that the Minister for Justice set another headline in the debate, that was, the example of brevity and I hope Deputies will feel inclined to follow it.  In his short statement the Minister, nevertheless, covered most of the ground which he should cover.  The figures he gave in relation to the decrease in crime are satisfactory but, as he said, there is nothing to be complacent about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="431" /> Most Deputies will welcome what the Minister had to say regarding prison conditions.  Without any question of political controversy, perfectly sincere differences of opinion may exist as to what is the best approach to prison treatment.  I was glad that Deputy Boland at least conceded that the present Minister was, if you like, experimenting to a greater degree than he had experimented and that as a result he may get better results.</P>
    <P>Last year on this Estimate I mentioned only one point which I asked the Minister to consider in the course of the year, that was whether some discretion should be allowed to judges to give costs against the State when criminal proceedings are dismissed.  I did not develop that last year because the time was limited and the Minister wanted to reply.  I would like to say a few words on it now.</P>

At any rate, it has an impact on the administration of the Minister's Department in so far as the District Court is concerned.  There was a Parliamentary Question put down by Deputy Peadar Cowan during the year with regard to the possible use of mechanical aids or mechanical assistance in taking depositions in the District Court.  I do not know whether it is required by legislation that depositions should be taken in longhand and in the method with which every lawyer is familiar but, if the Minister could alter that position without legislation, it would be worth trying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that in the Dublin Metropolitan District most of the time the District Court lists are clogged up and badly in arrears and it is not infrequent that cases where depositions will be taken are mentioned in court once or twice merely for the purpose of getting a date fixed.  Frequently, the date on which the district justice can give his entire day or possibly two or three days to the case may be two or three months after the original charge is made.  Then the accused and his lawyers and the State Solicitor may have to spend anything from a day to a week sitting in the District Court while the very slow process of taking depositions is carried out.  That is because depositions are taken in longhand. Naturally, the evidence must be given slowly and often must be repeated two or three times in order to ensure that it is taken down accurately. My view is that nothing would be lost by allowing shorthand or palantype to be used, by allowing the evidence initially to be taken down by some short and rapid method and then, in the outer office, transcribed into longhand and read over to the witness in the presence of the district justice.  I think the work would be carried out in one-half or one-third of the time that is at present occupied.  That would free the entire lists and there would be consequent <Col N="433" /> saving to the State in the cost of the general administration of the District Court.  That is a matter to which the Minister might give further consideration.  In his reply to Deputy Cowan's question he indicated that he would consider the matter.</P>
    <P>There are two points that I had intended mentioning last year.  They may be minor matters but they affect the ordinary citizen to some extent and very often in a very personal way.  I want to preface my remarks by making it quite clear that I am not in any way referring to the Garda Síochána as a body, nor am I referring to the majority of Guards but I would like to say to the Minister for Justice that one or two ill-tempered or bullying Guards on point duty in the city of Dublin can do far more harm to the reputation of the Garda Síochána as a body than anything else I can think of at the moment.  Every now and again, motorists, pedestrians or cyclists come across examples of what can only be termed very bad manners, to put it mildly, on the part of some members of the force. I appreciate that these Guards have a very difficult time, that with the pressure of traffic in Dublin at the moment their nerves must be fairly well frayed towards the end of their period of duty but, nevertheless, I have frequently received complaints from all types of road-users, motorists, cyclists and pedestrians, that there is an occasional Guard who appears to go out of his way to have a bit of sport when a person breaks a traffic regulation and who will go out of his way to bait the offender. I do not think that is at all widespread. I think it is a very occasional Guard who offends in that way but that occasional Guard damages the reputation of the force as a whole.  I would like the Minister to indicate what type of instructions are given to the Guards prior to their going out on duty of this sort and I would ask him generally to look into the matter.</P>
    <P>The other point I want to make is not in connection with the Guards but in regard to the civic spirit of the citizens.  I think lawyer Deputies will again agree with me that one of the difficulties that litigants&mdash;in road accident cases particularly&mdash;are up against is the very great reluctance of <Col N="434" /> people who witness accidents to give their names to the Gardaí or to the victims of the accident even when they are asked on the spot for their names.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be that there are reasons why they do not want to.  There obviously are.  My complaint is that it shows a very poor civic spirit to adopt that attitude.  Very frequently the outcome of litigation arising out of a road accident may be of very vital importance to the plaintiff or to the defendant, as the case may be.  People who are in a position to give evidence with regard to the facts, and who refuse to come forward or who withhold their names if requested to give them, may be doing a very grave injury which could be undone or which might never happen if they were to come forward, as I believe they should come forward.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether the Minister can really do very much in regard to a plea which I desire to make on the question of District Court prosecutions for traffic offences.  Frequently the period between the occurrence of the offence &mdash; it may be an accident, it may be a breach of some traffic regulation&mdash; and the hearing of the complaint in court is as long as three months.  I believe it is practically impossible for witnesses who do come forward or for the participants in the accident or in the incident to give accurate evidence after a lapse of three or four months. The Minister should, if he possibly can, endeavour to speed up the whole process between the time of the occurrence of the event and the hearing of the complaint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope this Government, in making appointments as State solicitors, county registrars and so forth will not follow the example of their predecessors in office.  It is probably well known to Deputy Lemass and to Deputy de Valera that Fianna Fáil made no secret of the fact that they made those appointments on a political basis.  I am not saying this for the purpose of starting a controversy.  I think that that is admitted and that it was, in fact, proclaimed by Deputy Boland when he was Minister for Justice <Col N="435" /> that Fianna Fáil exercised patronage in these appointments.  I think the way it was presented probably was that if they got a good man who was politically right they would appoint him in preference to another good man who was politically against him.  I would suggest to the present Minister that that system should be departed from and that, in arriving at decisions with regard to appointments to these various posts, he should deal with the question of experience and merit alone and have no regard to a person's political views.  Deputy de Valera appeared to doubt my statement with regard to the policy adopted by his Party in this regard. In order to relieve any doubts he may have I want to say that Deputy Boland, when he was Minister for Justice, was quite honest and open about it.  He made no secret of it and a certain amount of credit must be given to him for that.  Speaking on this Estimate in the year 1945&mdash;I think he was replying to the debate&mdash;Deputy Boland is reported in the Official Report, Volume 96, column 2143, as saying:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Deputy Costello talked about patronage in the appointment of State solicitors, county registrars and others.  I frankly admit that there is patronage in the making of these appointments.  The State solicitor is appointed by the Government, and, generally, if he is a good solicitor and a supporter of the Government, he gets the job.  I do not deny that.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Boland was quite frank about it.  I believe that that is an entirely bad system and that although the boot may now be on the other foot the present Minister should see to it that that system will not be operated by him and that the question of a man's politics will not enter into the making of appointments one way or the other. I sincerely hope that subsequent Fianna Fáil speakers in this debate will not follow the example of either Deputy Boland or Deputy Little.  If they make up their minds to approach this debate constructively a lot of good work can be done.  It may be a pity that we have to discuss Estimates during by-elections&mdash;I hope West Cork will not weigh too heavily on their shoulders.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Davin referred to the question of houses for Gardai. So far as urban areas are concerned I certainly admit that perhaps some ill feeling is aroused occasionally by the allocation of a vacant house to a Garda.  It so happens that when that Garda officer is eventually transferred and succeeded by another the position is not changed; the succeeding officer generally occupies his house.  It has just occurred to me that in the old days &mdash; I am sure the Minister remembers it himself&mdash;the police barracks, rather large buildings, were occupied by two or three police officers and their families on many occasions.  I was wondering if, in order to relieve the housing shortage in a number of towns, the Minister would consider suggesting to his colleague, the Minister for Local Government, the conversion of these large buildings into suitable flats for Garda officers.  I do not think it would detract from the efficiency of these officers in any way and, in fact, I do not think it detracted from the efficiency of the former occupants.  I think it is a matter for consideration.  It appears to me&mdash;going, as I have on occasion to go, into those large buildings and finding only two rooms occupied while other portions of the town are congested&mdash;that a certain amount of congestion could be relieved by the suggestion I have made.</P>
      <P>I want now to refer to the uniform of the Gardaí.  I think the Minister was asked a short time ago in this House about an alteration in the uniform and, as far as I recollect, he declined.  The Minister must be aware that there is a certain amount of dissatisfaction in the force in regard to the uniform.  I have been approached by many Gardaí&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will admit that I think the older chaps are satisfied with what they have got and that they are prepared to put up with them for their time in the force.  However, that should not deter the Minister from placating the younger sections of the force who are undoubtedly dissatisfied with the uniform.  There is one part <Col N="437" /> of the uniform which I consider an atrocity and that is the greatcoat.  It appears to me simply to hang on many of its wearers.  Sartorially, I believe we are inferior to many police forces in the world, particularly to our neighbouring police forces.  I do not say that clothes make the man by any means, but I do think that a smart uniform does tend to increase the efficiency of a force.  I wish the Minister would reconsider his decision in that matter and not only change the style of the uniform, but also the material, which I think is appalling as compared with the material of the uniform of other police forces which I have had occasion to notice.  I certainly cannot pay much tribute to the original designer of it.</P>
      <P>I am glad that the Minister has taken some steps towards increasing the pay of the Garda.  I hope that whatever decision is come to, the figure decided upon will be adequate to ensure that no police officer will feel called upon to indulge in any sideline on an agricultural or commercial basis or any other type of business to augment his income.  There are a number of cases of that kind.  I am sure the Minister knows that that obtains anyhow to a certain extent.  The Gardaí should regard themselves as full-time officers, adequately paid, satisfied, and not called upon to indulge in those pursuits, because I feel that if it were to extend to any great degree it might possibly lead to abuse and certain difficulties.  I do not say for a moment that I would disapprove of their hobbies, even though these hobbies may result in a small return in a monetary way.</P>
      <P>I have spoken here before concerning the question of drivers' licences and I again ask the Minister to take steps to see that the indiscriminate issue of drivers' licences to people ceases and that certain tests, medical and otherwise, are carried out to ensure that the holder of a driver's licence is a proper person to drive a potentially lethal weapon such as a motor car.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also on a former occasion suggested the formation of a mobile police patrol.  I have not seen any of them yet, but perhaps the Minister might <Col N="438" /> think something about the suggestion. I feel that as time goes on and as the number of motor cars increases out of all proportion, as they have done in the last few years, the menace calls for something of the kind and I certainly think it would bear fruit.</P>
    <P>Another matter I want to mention to the Minister concerns my friends the tinkers who overrun the countryside. I want to tell him that they are on the increase even since the last time I mentioned them in this House. I should like to point out to him that not only have they ceased to be controlled by the Garda, but the position is almost reversed.  I have seen them on occasions coming in and taking possession of a fair green and they are almost impossible, when they arrive in herds as they do, of control by the small personnel of the existing force in a town.  They live in a scandalous manner under perfectly insanitary conditions.  The children are brought up totally illiterate and I feel that some steps should be taken to segregate those people and bring them within the control of the Garda. Cruelty to animals which they own is another aspect of the matter.  These unfortunate animals, usually the discards of farmers, are treated in an abominable manner.  It is pathetic to see them at night tied to a gate or a tree.  It certainly is a reflection on the people of the countryside, who stand for this kind of cruelty to these unfortunate animals.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJMaguire" hpid="Dr. Maguire Dr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister also knows that the depredation they commit, breaking down fences and destroying the crops of farmers, is a matter which deserves serious consideration. It is impossible to deal with them.  It is very seldom they are brought to justice.  If there is such a thing as a prosecution against them. they generally fly off to some other territory.  The Minister, I am sure, has noticed the appalling conditions in which these people leave their camping sites, when they do leave them. Despite this and despite the scorched earth policy, shall I say, of these <Col N="439" /> vagrants, there are actually people to be found in this country who regard them as an addition to the picturesque amenities of the countryside and even write about them.  Other countries have dealt with them, perhaps some in a more harsh manner than I would like.  At the same time, I see no reason why we should not attempt to deal with them here and try to confine them to certain areas where control can be exercised over them by the Garda and the local authorities.</P>
      <P>The question of juvenile delinquency has been referred to.  I brought to the attention of the Minister a sentence on a child found guilty of damaging a county lawn tennis club along with two others.  He was sentenced to be punished by the parents in the presence of a Garda.  I do not think that is fair to the Garda, to say nothing about the boy or the parents.  In this particular case, the father submitted a medical certificate stating that, for medical reasons, he was incapable of punishing his boy; whether in the presence of the Garda or not I do not know, I expect it was.  This certificate was ignored by the district justice and the child was sentenced to a month's detention in a reformatory.  A few days previously a dairy proprietor was fined £10 for employing two men who were milking cows after their hands had been soaked in liquid manure.  That is very disproportionate in my opinion with the sentence on this child.</P>

      <P>There is just one other matter I would like to ask the Minister.  When representatives of other countries are in the Republic and crossing the Border these officers in the Border town might be informed of their intended arrival and departure so that perhaps the necessary courtesies might be accorded them as on the occasion of their arrival in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>There are only a few matters I should like to speak on in relation to this Estimate.  First of all, I should like to renew the plea I made last year to the Minister in connection with the pay and conditions at present applicable to unestablished District Court clerks.  I heard Deputy P. J. Burke make a passing reference to them here to-night but I do not know whether any Deputy gathered from what Deputy Burke said the real conditions affecting this particular class of civil servants.  In a lot of cases they have been employed by the State since the establishment of the District Courts.  Some of them played a very important part in the successful working of the District Court system which was an entirely new court in this country established under the Courts of Justice Act, 1924.  There are only a small number in this country who are unestablished now.  They have been fighting and agitating through their recognised association for better recognition of their claims for a number of years back.  I think they had seen some prospect of success in the year prior to the emergency.  During the emergency, at the suggestion of the Government of the day, they agreed to forego their claims until conditions would return to normal.  In the last 12 or 18 months they have repeated their claim for better conditions and for establishment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that the Minister has interested himself in their grievances and I should like to pay this tribute to him. One of his very first steps as a Minister was to receive the accredited representatives of these District Court clerks, to discuss with them their grievances and to consider what they had to say in the way of a solution.  I do ask the Minister to speed up this matter as far as he possibly can.  I appreciate that it is not merely his own Department that is concerned with it but that it is a matter also for the Department of Finance.  These men have given good service to the State. They are small in number.  Their political significance is not very great but they are the backbone of the judicial system, particularly down the country, and they certainly have given excellent service.  Their rates of pay <Col N="441" /> are a scandal.  Their prospects, if the present conditions are to remain, are also scandalous and I hope that the Minister will bring this matter to an end as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I should also like to refer to one other matter of which I have some slight particular knowledge in relation to the Garda force.  Much has been said this evening about the Gardaí and I do not want to go over any of the ground that has been covered here.  I do know that there are certain officers of the Garda force that appear to me to be suffering from some slight injustice. These are officers who were promoted sergeants under the 1924 regulations, roughly within a short while of the commencement of the force.  Some of these sergeants, in order to obtain promotion, had to undergo tests and examinations and eventually qualified to hold what, I understand, is called Class 1 (a) Literary Certificate.  Subsequently, in connection with some of these men demotion took place&mdash;demotion which was necessary from the establishment point of view&mdash;and some of these officers reverted to the rank of Guard. The Class 1 (a) Literary Certificate which these officers held under their original appointment as sergeant is, I understand, the highest certificate which a member of the force may obtain.  At present, for a member of the force to be promoted to the rank of sergeant he must at least have a Class 3 (a) Literary Qualification so that the holders of the other Class 1 (a) Literary Certificate are in possession of qualifications higher than is now required for the rank of sergeant. On the demotion of some of these sergeants to the ranks many of them felt, as the years went by, that they would be entitled to promotion back again to the rank of sergeant with service and under regulations subsequently made. But apparently that has not taken place.  These men are now told that if they are to become eligible again for promotion to the rank of sergeant they would be compelled to undergo a fresh examination, a necessity which is not ordained for holders of lower literary qualifications in the force.  I do not know how many Garda officers may be affected by this, but I know some certainly <Col N="442" /> are and it does appear to me that that is an injustice which is caused by some lack in the regulations governing the force.  I would ask the Minister to have that particular matter sympathetically examined.</P>
    <P>Might I also say this to the Minister, arising out of a number of complaints that have been made to me from my own constituency of Leix.  I am told that from time to time in certain parts of Leix the practice of what is called &ldquo;lamping for rabbits&rdquo; is pursued at night by a number of people throughout the country.  For this particular way of catching rabbits a number of men go out from some village or town into the fields with very powerful battery lamps in their possession.  They suddenly flash on these lamps, dazzle the rabbits and catch them.  This practice has caused, particularly during the spring, considerable damage to sheep and young cattle.  One can well imagine the effect on sheep of a powerful light suddenly flashed out in the middle of a field where they might be grazing.  A considerable loss of stock has been caused, both of sheep and cattle, by this practice.  It is, of course, illegal.  I do suggest that in the interests of the small farmers and, indeed, of the larger farmers, too, that the Guards should be more strict in the supervision that they exercise in relation to this particular matter. Needless to say, the people who go out lamping for rabbits are well-known to everybody. No one is going to blame them very much, but the Guards should try to ensure that, when those people do go out, they will keep away from fields in which there are sheep or cattle grazing.  I hope this matter will have the attention of the Guards during the coming year.</P>
    <P>I should like to associate myself with the remarks made by some Deputies on this side on the question of the taking of depositions in the District Court.  It is a matter that should be examined by the Minister.  We are all aware of the delay which the present practice so often occasions in the despatch of business in the courts, and anything that can be done to enable the machinery of the law to function more quickly should certainly have the <Col N="443" /> attention of the Minister.  The taking of these depositions is a matter which has always been commented upon by people in the courts as a very significant cause of delay.  I trust that the Minister will consider the suggestions that have been made to him in the course of this debate.</P>
    <P>Within the last two weeks or so two new district justices have been appointed.  I should like to congratulate the Minister on both appointments. Naturally, I am not going to discuss the individuals concerned, but I do want to express my satisfaction that the Minister has appointed, as permanent district justices, two men who in the last three years were appointed from time to time for temporary work.  There has always been much criticism of the practice of appointing temporary district justices and for obvious reasons, I think it is one that should be discontinued.  It is not satisfactory to litigants, to practitioners or to the temporary men themselves.  Apart from anything else, it means, should they find it necessary to go back to their profession either as a solicitor or barrister, considerable personal loss to themselves.  It is not satisfactory in any way, and I am glad that when two new permanent justices had to be appointed that the two men who, I think, had the longest temporary service were appointed.  I am also glad that in the appointment of both these men political considerations did not enter into it.  I think I am entitled to say that these two appointments certainly show that both service and merit were the first consideration with the Government in making the appointments.</P>
    <P>I should like now to deal with some rather mundane matters.  Some years ago, an Act was passed by the Dáil dealing with the maintenance and upkeep of courthouses throughout the country.  The need for that legislation was very apparent at the time because up to that period neither the duty nor the right relating to the repair of courthouses was very clear. As a result of the passing of that Act the position in that respect was clearly established.</P>

      <P>Yes.  We have in this country in most cases, I think, the same buildings that were occupied and used by the last judiciary that we had up to 1922.  They are old British prison houses and nothing else.  They are most uncomfortable.  That has been the experience of everyone who has had to use them whether as a justice, a litigant or as a practitioner. They are completely unsuitable for the purpose for which they are required. They must have been designed by a man whose mind was bordering on lunacy.  They are there now, however, and time and again their condition has been referred to by judges, justices, practitioners and litigants.  I do hope that their repair and maintenance in the future will get the urgent attention of the Department.  In some cases, by reason of the good fortune of the burning of courthouses during 1921 and 1922, one finds an occasional court building, provided after the establishment of this State, which is suitable for its purpose.  But we still have the monstrosities which escaped the burnings at that time.  Many of them have been the cause of early deaths amongst members of the legal profession, while those who have survived are continually getting colds from their attendance in them.  I hope this matter will have the attention of the Minister's Department in the coming year.  If some slight work were done on them it would help to bring about a welcome change.  Anyway, the scope for the carrying out of repairs and maintenance and putting these buildings into a better condition, is very wide. <Col N="445" /> I do not think there is anything more I have to say on the Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer first of all to some of the duties of the Garda Síochána.  The question of animals being allowed to wander on the roads is one that the Minister should check up on.  The number of cattle and sheep, especially cattle that are allowed to wander on the roads at the present time is becoming a public menace.  It is evident that the owners desire that their animals should feed on the rich nutritious grass that grows along the roadside.  No one, I suppose, can blame them for that, but these wandering animals are a danger to the public and to fast moving traffic.  I would ask the Minister to direct the attention of the Garda Síochána to that.  Deputy Dr. Maguire spoke about licences for motor drivers.  I think it is a disgrace that some of the people one sees driving cars should be allowed to do so.  A person can be stone-blind and yet secure a motor driver's licence.</P>
      <P>Another point is the inspection of driving licences, road tax and insurance records which takes place in the different areas.  I should like to know if there is any regulation in connection with the carrying out of this duty because the practice seems to vary in different areas.  For instance, in one area when your licence and tax are inspected, you are issued with a type of pass that will enable you to get past the next halt without undue delay.  If you have a journey of 80 or 90 miles and you are pulled up in the beginning you may have a clear passage.  Right alongside that, in another chief super-intendent's area, the position is that you have to pull up at each place, where an inspection is carried on and you must produce all your documents. I remember travelling within an area of 35 miles and I was pulled up six times.  In the next county I was pulled up only once.  There should be some method adopted all over the country that will obviate travellers being pulled up in that way more than is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Maguire mentioned mobile patrols for the purpose of dealing with road hogs.  Accidents due to the <Col N="446" /> negligence of drivers are becoming very frequent and the Guards have to depend on Shanks' mare and on bicycles for their patrol work.  I do not think it is necessary to have those patrols, unless they are based on large towns and they have a distance of 20 or 30 miles to patrol.  At the present time there are State cars attached to various barracks in provincial towns for the use of the special branch. These State cars could be used for patrol work and, if necessary, they should be supplied with several sets of identification plates so that they will not be known to the general public. They can take a different road every day if they wish, pull up the speed merchants, and check up on the dimming of lights among other things.  If that were done it would eliminate a lot of the accidents that take place.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a suggestion with reference to the general organisation of the Garda Síochána.  I believe that within the next few years large numbers of the Gardaí will be due to retire.  I am not speaking now on behalf of our Party; it is a purely personal view.  I imagine the time is ripe for a reorganisation of the force on different lines.  At the present time we have barracks situated all over the country, separated some four or five miles from each other, and in these barracks there are three or four Gardaí and a sergeant.  In some areas they have to look after only one public-house. There is no need for a sergeant and three or four Guards in places like that.</P>
    <P>I suggest the Minister should consider having only one policeman in each village and give him a motor bicycle and a telephone.  Let him live there like an ordinary citizen and put him in telephonic communication with headquarters in the nearest town, perhaps some 12 miles away.  If there is any necessity for reinforcements or anything like that they could be summoned by telephone and mobile units could bring them from the nearest town.  It is absolutely ridiculous to have four Guards and a sergeant in a small barracks with very little to do.  Apart from that, one can put up the argument that the Guard who is living in a particular locality is one of the people.  He <Col N="447" /> mixes with them and if any crime occurs in the area there is no doubt he will be told very quickly about it and who the likely suspect is.  He will often get the information quicker that way than where you have nine or ten Guards stationed.</P>
    <P>I think our country is so crime free that we scarcely want four or five Guards in every small area.  Actually, most of the barracks that we see throughout the country were established for the purpose of protecting fishing rights.  Extra Guards were drafted into these localities largely in order to protect fishing rights for a few big shots who should have been cleared out of the place completely.  I am making that suggestion about reorganisation of the Gardaí in view of the fact that so many of the Guards are about to retire.</P>
    <P>There is one matter in which I am very interested and I would like to have some information from the Minister. I should like him to tell the House why it is that an ex-Minister travels round my constituency in a State car with two or three detectives acting as nurses to him every week-end. I think this is a matter affecting public policy in view of the fact that State money is being expended on this car. No doubt it will be put to me that this man needs protection.  Protection from what?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one matter to which I should like to refer&mdash;it has been referred to already by other Deputies&mdash;and that is the issue of licences to new taxi owners and drivers.  I suggest that there are at the moment sufficient taxis for hire in the City of Dublin without adding to the competition faced by those men who are finding it hard to live.  I think that if the issue of licences was limited for a year or two it would be helpful to those already in the business, who have very keen competition to face.  It would also do something to prevent people who do not depend entirely for their livelihood on taxis from engaging in the taxi business, having it as a side-line and depriving taxi owners in the cities and towns of their means of livelihood.</P>
      <P>I read in the paper some time ago where a person was in a shop and he asked where he could get a taxi.  The owner of that shop provided the taxi. It was one of those private hackney cars, I understand, but it was unfair to the local taxi men that that person, who engaged in other business, should enter into the taxi business and deprive those who were depending entirely on it of a means of livelihood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made to the housing conditions of the Garda Síochána.  I remember Ministers and Deputies from all Parties for many <Col N="449" /> years suggesting that employers and industrialists should be appealed to to house their employees.  To give them credit, a number of industrialists have done so, especially in Dublin, yet the Minister's Department has made no effort to house members of the Garda in the City of Dublin.  If a young man in the country, entitled to promotion, gets that promotion, and Dublin is his aim, he cannot come here because if he seeks a room or two he will have to pay almost half his wages to get that accommodation here.  I say it is up to the Department of Justice to see that houses are provided for the Garda and not have them competing with the 28,000 people who are on the Dublin Corporation housing list.  I put it to the Minister that it would be money well spent on those men in whom he has such a keen interest.  We all know that the present Minister has a very keen interest in the Garda and that he would go out of his way to do the best he could for them.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister will have to increase the number of traffic Gardaí in the city.  More men will have to be put on point duty.  The condition of traffic in Dublin at the moment is appalling. Many important crossings and roadways have not yet been equipped with traffic lights.  In the interval points-duty men will have to be put on them. No matter how expert motorists are they are finding it increasingly difficult to travel through the city.  Now the Minister's Department is represented on the bridges committee.  Those representatives should urge on this committee that the reconstruction of the bridges, particularly the metal bridge, should be commenced without delay. The metal bridge would ease the traffic considerably from both George's Street and Dame Street.  The harbour authorities are responsible for the suggested new transporter bridge at the South and North Walls.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Justice is not responsible for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pointing out that he will have to increase the number of men on point duty in order to regulate the traffic.  I am also pointing out that if work is carried out in connection <Col N="450" /> with these suggested bridges it may not be necessary to increase the number of Garda on point duty because these bridges would help to alleviate the present chaotic traffic condition.  I think the time is opportune to encourage pedestrians into a more disciplined use of footpaths.  I remember 50 or 60 years ago when every lamp-post bore a blue enamel sign asking pedestrians &ldquo;Keep to the left.&rdquo;  I do not know why these were removed.  I think something must be done to eradicate our present rather happy-go-lucky use of the footpaths.  The position could be eased if these pedestrian signs were put up here and there.</P>
      <P>I want to emphasise again that it would be unwise to increase the number of taxis plying for hire.  I would not like to see any limitation put upon those that are already licensed.  But from time to time some will drop out and I suggest that these places should not be filled.  The number left would be quite competent to cater for all the traffic there is.</P>
      <P>I impress upon the Minister the desirability of ensuring that the Guards are properly housed and that they will not be faced with the difficulty of having to pay exorbitant rents for private houses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make a few observations on the traffic position generally and on the standard of driving.  At the moment we seem to be suffering under a very low standard of driving and that places a rather onerous responsibility on the Garda who, to do them justice, are doing their utmost to carry on successfully under somewhat difficult conditions.  I think we require many more mobile police cars.  We want cars that can follow motorists who make mistakes in driving; such a mobile unit could pull these drivers up and, as it were, show them the error of their ways.  There is a widespread lack of knowledge concerning the correct driving signals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anybody who drives in the City or County of Dublin knows that as often as not no signal is given by the car ahead.  Sometimes a signal is given when a car is turning to the right but a very large number of motorists do not <Col N="451" /> seem to realise that it is just as important to signal when they are turning to the left.  Not only have we motorists who drive too fast, but we also suffer from motorists who drive too slowly.  They are a grave danger. In many cases, especially around the city and suburbs, a slow motorist can hold up a long stream of traffic and may quite easily be the cause of an accident somewhere else in the line. That is a type of motorist who could be dealt with adequately by these mobile police cars.  I think if we had more of them they would have a beneficial effect on traffic generally.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which I would like to refer, though I am not quite sure whether it comes within the purview of the Minister for Justice.  I refer to traffic coming out on to main roads.  There seems to be very little margin and very little distinction between secondary roads and main roads.  We do not appear to have notices calling upon motorists to halt &mdash;&ldquo;halt&mdash;major road ahead.&rdquo;  We have had experience of cars dashing out on to main roads.  I think adequate road signs would prevent that.</P>
    <P>Another matter which gives rise to some complaint here in the city is the question of pedestrian crossings.  Anybody going round the city will find that in nine cases out of ten motor cars go half-way across pedestrian crossings &mdash;that is between the studs&mdash;before stopping and one sees unfortunate pedestrians weaving their way in and out through the cars.  That is another matter in regard to which more strict control could be exercised if there were more Gardaí to attend to it. I think we would require to have a Garda actually standing at each pedestrian crossing so as to keep cyclists, motorists and other traffic back from the defined limits of the crossing.</P>
    <P>I should also like to mention a matter which has been brought up in this House on a number of occasions and over a number of years.  That is the question of legal adoption.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Chair rules me out I may not discuss it, but it is a matter in regard to which many people would like to see some action taken.  I should like to urge upon the Minister again the necessity for having more mobile police cars and more trained Gardaí to regulate traffic and to improve driving standards generally.  I think most people will agree that during the emergency when so many cars were laid up and so many people were not driving, the standard seemed to have deteriorated.  One of the best ways to deal with that matter is to place more Gardaí on the roads and so raise the standard of driving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>By a strange coincidence the matter to which I want to refer is that which has been just dealt with by Deputy Dockrell, namely, road safety.  Both Deputy Dr. Magulre, Deputy Dockrell and probably other Deputies referred to the necessity for a mobile police force particularly in the country.  There is at least one patrol car&mdash;there may be more&mdash;in the city and I shall make a few remarks about it in a moment.  Just now I should like to stress the absolute necessity for these police cars in rural areas and I would suggest to the Minister that it would not require any great expenditure to supply them.  You would not need one in every parish.  The fact that it was known that such police patrols were employed and that one never knew where they were likely to turn up would of itself be a sufficient deterent to careless drivers.  I speak with a certain amount of experience because on my way to Dublin every week I pass through a neighbouring State, and I can assure the Minister that the fact that at any corner you may suddenly find yourself confronted with a police car has a very salutary effect on the rate and the mode of driving.  I know I shall not forget in a hurry my first experience; it had a marked effect on the whole conduct of my driving afterwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that if half a dozen cars were scattered over a wide area, without <Col N="453" /> keeping to particular places, on some plan devised by the Commissioner, there would be quite sufficient to deal with breaches of the traffic laws.  Anyone who drives a motor car on main or county roads in rural areas must be aware of the great dangers that at present exist.  The standard of driving is something shocking.  I would say that that is partly due to carelessness and partly to lack of courtesy.  That is especially so in the case of heavy traffic.  Reference has been made in other years to the way in which heavy lorries can amble along the roads, completely ignoring following traffic.  The defence sometimes is that it is difficult for a heavy vehicle to pull in, but the fact that they can do so when faced with oncoming traffic indicates that that is not the full explanation of their unwillingness to facilitate following traffic.  Nothing will really remedy these abuses except a mobile police force.  To expect a few Gardaí down the country travelling around on bicycles to deal with lorry traffic or motor traffic of any kind is obviously ridiculous.</P>
    <P>On the question of signals, I remember that up to a few years ago a very convenient circular was issued by the Commissioner to motorists at the time they paid their tax or got their driving licence.  It is not that the signals in use in this country are in any way elaborate. I should think we have the simplest system in use anywhere.  It could not be reduced to much simpler terms.  There are in fact only three signals that can be given &mdash; turn right, turn left, slow down and stop and overtake.  The signal for slowing down or stopping is similar to that for turning left.  On that point the confusion which is created with following traffic has to be seen to be believed, especially by lorry drivers.  They put out their hand, and to draw attention to it, wave it up and down.  when they really want to turn right.  It can be most confusing both to oncoming traffic and traffic approaching from the rere.  I would suggest to the Minister that it might be worth while issuing that little circular again giving the correct signals. Of course, most modern lorries and cars are provided with mechanical signals but I am afraid some of them are <Col N="454" /> not very efficient.  Some of them are so placed on the vehicles that the driver cannot see them.  The result is that if there is any breakdown in the system, the driver keeps on pressing buttons, fondly imagining that he is giving signals when, in fact, no signal is being given.  I speak from bitter experience in this matter, because of an encounter with a lady motorist whose indicator did not function when she turned right across my bows and she was so placed that she could not possibly see that it was not working. I think the Minister ought to take note of that and see that cars are provided with signals placed in such a way that they can be seen, as that can lead to very serious consequences.  Of course a thing which many motorists seem to forget is that to signal is not sufficient. They should look in their mirrors and see if there is someone behind them in such a position that the signal is useless from the point of view of time.</P>
    <P>I said earlier that I would make another reference to the mobile police in the city.  This may have been an isolated instance, but on one occasion I saw a mobile police car breaking one rule of the road.  It was ambling along at 18 miles an hour and failed to keep sufficiently to the left.  There were about 20 cars behind it blaring their horns but when they saw what it was they did not try to pass and I do not blame them.  The fact was, however, that the police car was breaking one of the principal rules of the road in failing to keep to the left. It was probably just one case, but it does not inspire any great confidence in the police if they are going to break the rules.  This question of not keeping to the left on the part of slow traffic is infuriating in the city.  I have to go to Drumcondra once a week and I saw a lorry ambling in the middle of that wide street, Dorset Street, again at about 15 or 20 miles an hour.  Perhaps traffic ought not go any faster, but if all traffic in the city goes at 15 or 20 miles an hour, the traffic jams will be worse than ever and someone ought to instruct these lorry drivers to keep over to the left and allow traffic to pass them.</P>
    <P>The question of road signs is a bit <Col N="455" /> complicated because the question of just who is the authority to deal with them is complicated.  The Minister for Local Government in 1946 put the onus on the commissioner to instruct local authorities where the signs should go up &mdash; Section 69, sub-section (3), &mdash;but it is the Minister for Local Government who decides on the size and shape of the sign and just who would be responsible for them at the moment I am not quite sure.  I think really that since the commissioner has the power to instruct local authorities where the signs should go, it is a matter for the present Minister.</P>
    <P>One of the most important signs on any road is, of course, the sign to tell the traveller where he is going to go, the signpost, and we are still using a type of signpost invented to suit horse traffic.  They are high up and are very suitably placed for a man riding a horse or in a horse-drawn vehicle, but they are most inconvenient for motorists as they are too small and cannot be seen from a car, especially at night.  Worst of all, they are placed exactly at the crossroad and a motorist approaching cannot see them, particularly at night.  He has quite enough to watch besides watching the signpost.  While I do not say that it should be done for every crossroads in the country, statistics of accidents should give the commissioner some idea of where to make a start and every important crossroad or crossroad that has been the scene of an accident should be signposted before the crossroad is reached.  It would point the direction of the roads and also serve as a warning that there was a crossroads in front.  I would like to see it started and then developed and spread to every crossroads in the country.</P>
    <P>With regard to danger signs, again we seem to have no definite scheme as to what are dangerous roads.  We have main roads but a few roads are listed as arterial roads and in the view of the local authorities they take precedence over ordinary main roads. To motorists driving over them, however, there is nothing to distinguish <Col N="456" /> them and I know of one case where a so-called arterial road does not carry anything like the traffic carried by the main road that crosses it.  There have been quite a number of accidents at this particular crossroads because the man driving on the main road thinks he has precedence over the fellow on the arterial road.</P>
    <P>Another type of road sign is the sign indicating dangerous corners and I think that the Commissioner should order the local authorities to do something about them.  I remember very well my first trip to Dublin by road. We came to a sign indicating an S bend and I sensibly slowed down only to discover that the S bend had been taken away ten years before.  That happened ten miles further on and ten miles further on again.  I know I was wrong, but having had this experience three times, when I came to the fourth, I said: &ldquo;Oh I will not worry&rdquo;, and unfortunately this S bend had not been taken away.  There are S bends that need signs but it is very confusing to motorists to keep signs up where the bend has been taken away. There are S bends where there are no signs and they could well be overlooked. When I asked a question a few years ago, the answer the Minister for Local Government gave at the time was that certain materials could not be got, but that as soon as the emergency was over and materials could be got, the matter would be fixed up.  I think it is time the matter was taken in hands and although it is the Minister for Local Government who carries out the work, it is the commissioner who instructs where to put the signs.  My own local authority did not know that it was the commissioner at all, so it would be well if the commissioner and the local authorities were stirred up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I put questions during Deputy Boland's time as Minister during the emergency regarding the conveying of prisoners by the buses. I think that is altogether wrong.  I have had experience of travelling on buses while young boys were being brought away to industrial schools and prisoners, women prisoners.  On one occasion the bus was stopped to let these people get out and go to a <Col N="457" /> public-house and the bus was held up for a certain time.  I think that procedure is wrong.  I see young boys getting into trouble and after they have been brought before the peace commissioner they are brought down to the bus and sent to the &ldquo;Joy&rdquo;, that is 70 or 80 miles.  They are remanded there until the District Court.  They are brought back by bus again and when they are convicted, they have the experience of mothers and relatives crowding round the bus crying.  That is not right.  The Minister for Justice at the time said it was only during the emergency.  I believe that a State car or taxi should be employed for the conveyance of prisoners.  The county council to which I belong puts in a sum of £200 for the conveyance of prisoners and we find that the prisoners are brought by the cheapest and meanest way, by the Córas Iompair Eireann bus, while State cars are prowling round the City of Dublin with loud speakers.  I think one should be provided for the conveyance of prisoners to the &ldquo;Joy&rdquo; or whatever &ldquo;joys&rdquo; they are going to. The present procedure is all wrong. The Minister's statement is an inducement to young fellows to go into gaol. He said there are going to be pictures and radio, smokes, good clothes and all the rest.  That is an inducement to them to go in, as they will have a good time while they are in there.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to bring in some new system of conveying the prisoners.  On a recent occasion, when I was on a bus, a stranger, an American who was a passenger, was talking to me and said that it was a disgrace to have them brought in that way.  He asked who was in authority and whether there was not someone who would bring it to the notice of the authorities.  I am appealing to the Minister, now that the war is over and that there is plenty of petrol, to make provision during this debate to-night so that we will not see these prisoners, even in murder cases, brought into towns and the whole town out to get a peep at them.  That should not be allowed at all throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been talk here about the hackney cars, but I do not think it is the hackney licences that are the real <Col N="458" /> cause of the grievance of the taxi-men. From what I know, it is the private owners who are interfering in that way and bringing people to race meetings, sports meetings and football matches, under the guise of &ldquo;love and honour&rdquo;. There was a question about that here some time ago and the Minister said he had no recourse through the Gardaí. We know that it is hard to get at these people, as they can say that there is no charge made.  That is the case the hackney-men have made to me&mdash;that it is the private cars that are doing that class of work.</P>
    <P>Deputy Maguire, the Fianna Fáil Deputy from Monaghan, complained of tinkers going to fairs.  I do not think that tinkers are a great menace at all. I see them in my own town on a fair day, spending money, buying horses from small farmers and selling other ones.  They have their own way of living.  Each Minister has said in his time that there was only about 5,000 of these people.  They are not as bad as people say they are and they have to live in their own way.</P>

      <P>During school hours, when youngsters are going to lunch, a Guard should be on duty where they have to cross the road.  That is most important. There should also be some protection at 3 or 4 o'clock in the evening, to keep them from running out on public roads, especially in the towns where motor cars and lorries are flying along. In Cabinteely, I see a notice, &ldquo;Please drive slowly through Village&rdquo;, and I think there should be in every town some sign like that to tell the motorist to drive slowly.  There may be children living in houses in the main streets.  The stranger flying along does not know whether there is a school there or not; the &ldquo;School&rdquo; signs should be more plentiful in country towns and villages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I dealt with the question of houses <Col N="459" /> for the Gardaí before and I was told that other people came first.  I understand that, as time goes on, there will be houses for them.  I think that new Gardaí stations should be built, as I know where big rents are being paid for old houses belonging to landlords and they are not fit for use as Garda barracks.  Some very fine new Garda stations have been built throughout the country already and they look very well.  The Minister should see that in every town and village there is a proper station where young men are going to spend their lives.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davin referred to the communists. I hope the Minister for Justice at present and any other Minister in the future will never again allow the Mansion House in Dublin, or any other house, to be used by the Friends of Russia or the Red Dean.  It all led up to cases of disturbance which had to be heard in the courts.  The Minister should carefully examine that point and see that that trouble does not occur again.</P>
    <P>I wish to point out that the Gardaí are not satisfied with the bonus position. They believe they should have got it as other civil servants got it, on the 29th May, instead of cutting down a few months retrospective pay. The Minister and the Minister for Finance should have granted it to them, the same as every other section of civil servants.  A Garda in a town must be up to a certain standard too. I know there are certain rent allowances granted to them and I know that the people in the city here are under very big rents, more so than men in the rural areas.  There may be some privileges in rural areas for Gardaí, but they are few.  Anyone setting a house says: &ldquo;This fellow is well able to pay and I will get all I can.&rdquo;  That is the general feeling where rent is concerned. The owner is looking for the best tenant who can give him the highest price.</P>
    <P>Other Deputies in the Opposition say that a lot of Guards are leaving.  There are plenty of young fellows who want to join.  Any man who wants to go to America or Australia feels, I am sure, that he is going to better himself. <Col N="460" /> Many young men are asking when there will be recruitment for the Guards, and from all over my constituency I get letters about that.  We cannot stop a young man leaving the Guards and going to Australia, America, Canada or anywhere else. That is his own look out.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davin referred to the question of &ldquo;the woman doing the sergeant&rdquo;.  I cannot say anything about that, but I know of cases of Guards doing their duty and being transferred because they found out certain people in certain hotels and so on. There were no law courts, but the Garda was transferred to the furthest place you could transfer him.  That is a very unfair thing to do to any Guard.  The law should be for the rich as well as for the poor, and should be administered so.</P>

      <P>I would like the Minister for Justice to approach the local authorities with a view to placing the Civic Guards and their families on the same level as the families of civilians when it comes to applying for the tenancy of council houses.  Housing conditions amongst the Gardaí are just as bad as they are amongst civilians in many cases and I feel it is unfair that any regulation or condition should exist whereby the Guards will not get the same treatment as civilian families when the question of tenancy is receiving consideration.  I know that in County Dublin there are several areas where housing accommodation for Guards is not adequate and they are compelled to live in small, overcrowded houses.  I am not saying they have to live in houses where there are several families, but they are living in small houses and there may be a large family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider the possibility of providing a light auto-cycle for each Garda barracks in the rural areas.  This is 1949 and the Guards are using bicycles in these country districts when other persons such as inspectors, who have to travel in the course of their duties, have other means of transport.  I think that at this stage the question of providing light auto-cycles for <Col N="461" /> Guards should be considered.  One machine at each barrack would facilitate them greatly because it is probable that only one Guard at a time is out on his bicycle.</P>
    <P>The question of lighting has been touched on.  Lack of lighting is one of the things which contributes in great measure to accidents &mdash; either defective lights on motor vehicles or no lights or bad lights on bicycles.  With approaching traffic, it is very difficult for a motorist to see a cyclist in front of him and the reflectors provided on these bicycles are very rarely effective. It is difficult for the motorist to see it, although it complies with the law, and it would be desirable to consider the possibility of providing a light, some kind of a red light, on the back of a bicycle.  The actual disc reflector is not effective and is often the cause of accidents, when motorists are overtaking a cyclist or a group of cyclists while an oncoming car is approaching. At this stage, there is no excuse for unlighted cycles.  They are a danger to the cyclist and a danger to pedestrians using the roads.  For that reason, the whole question of lights on vehicles, bicycles and cars, should be seriously considered.</P>
    <P>The dimming apparatus on many types of cars is not really effective and the proof of that is that, when travelling in a car the lights of which you have dimmed, you will see an oncoming driver flashing his bright lights to show that he thinks you have still your strong lights on.  I suggest that the Minister should discuss with the authorities the possibility of adopting some kind of standardised dimming device.  In regard to signals, I am a believer in the hand signal rather than the light signal, because it is more effective and in this connection it is right that the motoring public should be educated in the signals to be given for beckoning cars on and indicating a stop or a turn left. If a car is fitted with mechanical signals, a turn left can be indicated but a motorist may still have to show whether he intends to stop or wants a car to overtake him.</P>
    <P>There are areas in rural Ireland where one-man police stations would <Col N="462" /> be effective.  There are cases of Garda barracks located in a particular district where there are only a small number of people, on the other side of which there are 500 or 1,000 people. The people have to travel a long distance when they have occasion to go to the barracks to apply for a shotgun licence, passports and so on, and it would be a facility which would be greatly appreciated by people in these populous districts if a one-man station could be provided.  There is always the possibility of a serious occurrence in the area and lack of telephone facilities renders the barracks at the other end of the district almost ineffective.  I give as an example the Lusk police area.  Donabate and Portrane areas are seven miles from Lusk barracks and there are more people in these areas than there are in the village or parish of Lusk.  The Guards there have to travel daily to Donabate to carry out their routine duties and the people have to arrange to meet them at certain times.  If they fail to meet them, they have to try to contact the Guards in Lusk seven miles away.</P>
    <P>Another factor which contributes to accidents is the pedestrian traffic, especially in the cities and towns, where it appears to be very haphazard. It is only reasonable that, if the cyclist or motorist must observe certain rules of the road, the pedestrians also should observe a certain set of rules. They should realise that the cyclist or motorist has a perfect right to use the road within the limits of the law, but there is an inclination on the part of pedestrians to say: &ldquo;I have the road and everybody else must get out of my way.&rdquo;  That is most unfair, and for that reason I should like the Minister to take steps to ensure that pedestrian traffic in cities and towns will be regulated. Anybody climbing to the top of Nelson Pillar to-morrow and looking down on O'Connell Street will see the people crossing the street without any kind of order whatever.  They cross at pedestrian crossings and at any other point where they take the notion to leave the footpath and start across the street.  It is even worse where they cross the street near a corner in haphazard fashion.  It would be for the <Col N="463" /> benefit of traffic regulation in the city at present if pedestrian traffic were more severely regulated and if jaywalkers were warned.  I do not suggest that they should be punished but, if they were warned and directed by the Guards, they would cultivate good habits in the proper use of the streets. The result would be advantageous to all road users.  It might be possible for the Minister to advocate school courses to make the children traffic conscious. In many cases children run out on the road and are struck by cars and the driver is exonerated because it is held that the accident was not his fault but was the child's fault.  If the children were made more traffic conscious, tragic accidents of that kind would not occur.</P>
    <P>I notice that the retrospective pay for the Garda is retrospective only to some time before Christmas and not to the 29th May of last year.  However, it is certain that the Garda would not have got an increase in pay or would not have got retrospective pay but for the progressive action of this Government in trying to bring the level of their pay up to the present cost-of-living figure.  Less Guards with more money might be a means of improving the conditions for the Guards, who are engaged on a very important task in the regulation of civilian life.  Some Opposition Deputies complained that Guards were leaving the force to take up other employment.  I would not say to any Guard that he should stay in the force and accept the pay he gets there if he can get better wages in other employment and improve his position.  We have no right to tell the Guards that they should not try to improve their conditions if they can.  The fact that there are so many young men anxious to enter the Garda Síochána proves that that occupation has its attractions and the improved conditions which the Minister has provided in the past 12 or 15 months will encourage men to join that important service.</P>

      <P>I regret very much the note that was introduced into this debate by the former Minister for Justice, Deputy Boland.  For a considerable part of his speech he spoke <Col N="464" /> in a very reasonable way but for some reason or other he was anxious to introduce a note that might very well have been left out of this debate particularly in view of the fact that we can record a year of internal peace.  The very fact that we can record a year of internal peace might have suggested to a Deputy who has had the experience that Deputy Boland has had of bearing responsibility of office over a long period, that any word or action that might ruffle or upset that peace would be dangerous.  Mention was made last year, and there was some reference to it this evening, of unhappy and unfortunate events of the past.  For some reason or other Deputy Boland endeavours to avail of every opportunity to bring forward the events of that unfortunate period.  I do not think it does himself personally any good.  I think it excites certain antagonism.  It may excite irresponsible people and to that extent it is exceptionally dangerous. I think it does no good to his own political Party and certainly the country as a whole does not benefit from speeches such as the latter part of his contribution to this debate.</P>
      <P>Each and every one of us, after our turbulent history in recent years, should be pleased to pay tribute this evening to the success of the Minister in maintaining law and order and peace, not by means of military courts or anything of that nature but by encouraging a spirit of goodwill amongst all citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Justice is an exceptionally important Department.  It deals with many major matters that affect each and every citizen.  It covers the administration of the law, the control and administration of prisons and borstals, the control and administration of the Garda, the rehabilitation of prisoners, and a number of other matters.  It ought to be possible in a discussion on the Estimate to make concrete suggestions to the Minister that will lead to a general improvement.  I propose to deal with a few aspects of the administration of the Department of Justice.  I will deal first with the Garda.  I have heard the Garda criticised this evening.  I have heard the Garda praised this evening, but I think every one of us who has <Col N="465" /> practical experience of the difficulties that confront the Garda, of the many onerous responsibilities that they carry, must realise the great debt that we owe as a community to the Garda force.  It has been my experience over the years that the Garda force as a whole can be considered honest, of the highest integrity, and that they carry out their difficult and onerous responsibilities with due regard for the public interest.  While we have a force such as that, I feel that it is our duty as a Parliament to see that that Garda force is removed from any danger or any possibility of corruption through inadequate pay or allowances or through the enforcement of regulations that militate against the Garda force as a whole.  I think each and every one of us, particularly those of us who live in the city of Dublin, realises that all ranks of the Garda right up to the rank of inspector are inadequately paid.  Although the Minister has made a recent increase in the pay of the Garda, that increase has not been sufficient.  In my view it is entirely inadequate in the case of Gardaí who are stationed in Dublin City and in the case of married Gardaí.</P>
    <P>I have already made a suggestion to the Minister that he should consider a system of allowances whereby a marriage allowance and a children's allowance would be paid to Gardaí and whereby a city allowance would be paid to those Gardaí who have to carry out their duties in our cities.  I think that is a reasonable suggestion. No member of the force living in the City of Dublin with a wife and family to maintain and paying the rent that must be paid in Dublin can do it within the pay and allowances that are paid to him by the State.  The Minister will answer, as he has answered, that there is a lodging allowance paid to married members of the Garda.  That allowance in the City of Dublin would not pay for the meanest room in the meanest street in the meanest part of the city.  It has no relation to present-day cost.  Each and every one of us has the responsibility for maintaining the good name and the honour of the Garda force.  It is, therefore, our duty as a Parliament to ensure that those Gardaí are paid fair wages and that <Col N="466" /> they are paid adequate allowances in the case of married Gardaí and a city allowance in the case of those residing in our cities.</P>
    <P>On last year's Estimate I referred to the regulations that governed the Garda.  I understand that those regulations are being examined for some little time now.  But the regulations that do operate at the moment are entirely out of date and, in their own way, contribute to the discontent of the force.  Some Deputies have referred to the transfer of Gardaí. Transfers take place periodically. There have been quite a number of cases of Gardaí transferred out of the City of Dublin.  The strange thing about it is that there is one section of the Garda stationed in the City of Dublin who cannot be transferred out of it at all.  Those are the Gardaí who were taken over from the old Dublin Metropolitan Police Force.  They have a certain statutory protection.  But the young man who joined the Garda force when it was formed by this State, and was transferred into the Dublin Metropolitan Police section, can be transferred with impunity and, in fact, is transferred from time to time.  I think that there is something unfair in the fact that the Gardaí who were taken over cannot be transferred while the persons who came in or were recruited to the force and as young people were transferred into the Dublin Metropolitan Police section can be transferred &mdash; and the transfer in their case may be a very serious matter.  They may be buying a house under the facilities provided by the corporation under the Small Dwellings. (Acquisition) Act.  They may have their children at schools here in the city.  They are taken, often for a very trivial offence, and sent down to some part of the country.  It would not be too bad if the transfer stopped there but, generally what happens is that they are sent into a division down the country.</P>
    <P>The majority of the Gardaí in that division have been there for 20 or more years.  They are the strangers. They are not as willing as the Gardaí who had been there for 20 years or longer and if a vacancy arises in a worse station miles away these unfortunate <Col N="467" /> Gardaí are the men to be sent there.  I think that if the Minister looks up the records of Gardaí who have been transferred from Dublin to the country he will find that those Gardaí have been transferred a number of times subsequently.  It would be well worth inquiring why those transfers have been carried out.  If a Garda commits some disciplinary offence and if he is punished in accordance with the provisions of the Garda code I see no reason in the world why the additional penalty of transfer should be imposed on him&mdash;a penalty that affects not only himself but his wife and children too.  I would ask the Minister to see that that section of his Department and of Garda Headquarters that are dealing with the revision of those regulations will hurry up with the job so that those new regulations will eliminate all the causes of complaint that have been mentioned not this year or last year but that have been mentioned for many years in the Department of Justice Estimate.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave statistics in regard to crime which show that in the case of indictable offences there had been a decrease of approximately 1,000 during the past year.  I gathered from the Minister however that in regard to summary offences there had been an increase of approximately 17,000 during the year.  Clearly, as we make new laws creating new summary offences, the number of summary offences will tend to rise.  I suppose we cannot complain too much in regard to that.  But it is a good thing to see that the number of indictable crimes is decreasing and we can only hope that that decrease will be maintained, because an increase in crime puts a very serious burden on the community&mdash;the burden of maintaining Gardaí, prisons, prison officers and a lot of the machinery of the Department.</P>
    <P>Complaint was recently made by a district justice as to the action of the Garda in regard to public-houses.  I think the Minister will agree that there is scope for some improvement there. The laws are undoubtedly there in regard to public-houses, but one Garda <Col N="468" /> officer may act differently from another in regard to the enforcement of these laws.  Where we find members of the Garda stationing themselves outside a particular public-house and keeping it under observation for long periods, that is something which I consider objectionable because it can be abused. I came across an instance not so long ago of a particular premises which was under observation by the Garda. Complaints had undoubtedly been made in regard to it.  But at all hours of the night special patrols of Gardaí in cars or otherwise were being sent to watch that public-house.  That may be all right, but I think there ought to be some uniform instruction issued in regard to the attention to be paid to licensed premised by members of the Garda.</P>
    <P>Not so long ago there was a case where a Garda used to visit a public-house which was legally open to serve drink to people who had travelled the required distance.  That Garda went in there night after night, questioned people on the premises as to their names, compelled them to produce documents to identify themselves, although he had been standing outside the door, had seen the people going in and knew of his own personal knowledge that not one of these people was committing an offence.  I am perfectly certain the Minister would not stand over that and that the great majority of the officers of the Garda would not stand over it.  Abuses of that kind can happen and, from what I know of the Minister, I am perfectly certain that he would not wish them to happen and that he will take such steps as may be appropriate to deal with them.</P>
    <P>Part of the duty of our courts is to impose punishment for offences, punishment which may be of various kinds.  There may be sentences of imprisonment, sentences of penal servitude, or Borstal or other forms of detention.  Recently, I asked the Minister as to the number of visits paid to penal servitude and other prisons and places of detention by judges and district justices and I was astonished to find the very small number who bothered within the last ten years to have a look into those places so that they would become familiar with the <Col N="469" /> kind of punishment to which they were sentencing persons brought before them.  The Minister should encourage such visits to these prisons and places of detention so that those persons who have the power to enforce punishment may be aware of what they are sentencing an offender to.</P>
    <P>That brings me to this point.  The Probation of Offenders Act was passed for the purpose of enabling the courts in the case of first offenders to apply the provisions of that Act rather than to impose a sentence of imprisonment. As a general rule, in the case of a first offender whose character has been good up to that stage, the provisions of the Act should be applied.  It is the experience of practitioners, however, that that is not so and that many cases come before the courts where a person of otherwise good character has broken the law once and where the court will not impose any other sentence except the sentence of imprisonment.</P>

      <P>The position, anyway, is there.  I am not criticising the judiciary or anybody else.  I am stating facts now.  That is exactly what does happen.  We have the position here in the City of Dublin where year after year prisoners are coming before the courts charged with housebreaking. Year after year they are being sentenced to a certain term of imprisonment. They come out and they are not very long out before the Guards are apprehending them again.  They are sentenced again to a very short term of imprisonment.  While I agree with whatever machinery is available to the Minister in regard to mitigation of punishment, and particularly the punishment of imprisonment imposed on a first offender, in the case of those habitual criminals who are coming up year after year before the courts charged with the same offences such machinery as is available to the Minister should be used for the purpose of keeping them in prison rather than having them at large to commit further crimes.  I think that is the best I can do within the limitation imposed on me.</P>

      <P>That is as it is. Difficulties are there.  We have tied ourselves up, I suppose, over a period of 25 years in the House with rules which do not enable the thing to be mentioned now.  This whole matter of crime is a serious one when we have several thousand indictable crimes in a year, more than a thousand every month and more than 250 indictable crimes every week.  That has been mentioned by the Minister.  That is the position and apparently I can do nothing more than say that is a serious position.</P>
      <P>The Minister has mentioned some ticket-of-leave improvements.  I am glad of that.  I think it is very wise if a person is going to be released to release him and be done with it.  But putting him on a string and compelling him to report periodically is not going to help him very much.</P>
      <P>Juvenile crime has been mentioned and I can see difficulties in entering into a discussion on that also.  It is regrettable that there is so much juvenile crime in the city of Dublin.  However, I see quite a number of cases brought to court by the Guards that are recorded as juvenile crime when they should not be brought to court at all.  The whole machinery of the Gárda is used in regard to a little lad of seven or eight or nine years of age as if he was a hardened criminal with many convictions behind him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I make this further comment? In every Garda station in Dublin at the moment there is a very important book containing photographs distributed by the Garda headquarters.  In that book are some scores of photographs of individuals living in the City of Dublin who are pointed out there to the Guards as individuals who have been convicted many times of violating young children, not once but on many occasions over a period of years.  It <Col N="472" /> revolts one to think that in every Garda station under the jurisdiction of the Minister in the City of Dublin there is this book containing those scores of photographs of individuals who are at large.  I think that is a shocking state of affairs.  It is a state of affairs that must cause concern to the Minister as it must cause concern to every member of this House.  Unfortunately I cannot suggest a remedy because it would be out of order but I am mentioning the fact so that the members of this House who are not aware of it may be aware of that very serious position which confronts us here in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Last year I drew attention to the conditions under which the warders in the prisons operate.  I was glad to learn this evening that the Minister has indicated that steps have been taken to improve the quarters for those officials, and that steps have been, and are being taken to improve the cottages in which the married warders reside. I am also glad to know that a representative body of those prison officials has been formed and is being recognised by the Minister, and that he has gone a long way to meet the reasonable claims that these warders are making.  It is good to know that when suggestions are made to the Minister in the debate on an Estimate in one year that they are looked into, and that the Minister is able to come back the following year and say that he has taken certain steps to see that the particular matters referred to will be rectified as soon as possible.  That is something that we all like to hear.</P>
    <P>During the past year I put suggestions to the Minister in regard to providing free legal aid for persons who are unable to pay for legal assistance. The Chair may say that this would involve legislation.  I am not putting it that way to the Minister that it does involve legislation, but I do say that the Minister can have the whole matter examined and can tell us what is involved. The Minister, I think, will agree that there are cases in which grave injustice is done to individuals because they are not in a position to be legally represented at their trial.  I have seen that happen myself in court when there as a spectator.  I was so <Col N="473" /> upset by it on one occasion that I intervened in the proceedings.  I just could not restrain myself, and as I say I intervened.  Those of us who practise in the courts see these cases of injustice occur.  I would ask the Minister to examine the whole problem and what it involves.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to set up a committee of experts to examine this problem and let us have its report as early as possible.  With these few remarks I am more than happy to be able to pay a tribute to the work of the Minister during the past year.  He has quite a number of achievements to his credit, and I hope that his future years as Minister will see substantial improvements made in regard to all those other matters which, at the moment, it would be outside the rules of order to discuss in this debate.</P>

      <P>I want to join with Deputy McQuillan and with other Deputies in asking that the Minister should have a complete reconsideration of the whole set up of the Garda force as well as a new allocation of Garda stations.  In my opinion there should be a shorter distance between these stations, particularly in the rural areas, as well as better provision in regard to bicycles and mobile units throughout the country.  A few weeks ago Deputy Flynn, in the course of a question which he addressed to the Tánaiste, elicited the fact that the nearest Garda station to applicants of a certain class was ten or 12 miles.  I want to draw the attention of the Minister to that&mdash;that you have people living in parts of the country and that the nearest Garda station to them is ten or 12 miles away. Even if the average distance is less in some cases, I still would join with Deputy McQuillan in asking that the distance should be cut down further so that when accidents occur, or offences are committed, the Guards will be able to reach the scene more speedily than they are able to do at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent times there has been a great spate of oratory&mdash;very many books have been written on the subject as well&mdash;on the increase that is observable in juvenile delinquency.  When we think of what a huge problem that is, and how much has been said and written on the subject, it is a matter of surprise to me that so little has been <Col N="475" /> said about it in this debate.  I do not think we can be too proud of ourselves on that point.  It is my opinion that it is not the juveniles who are always the delinquents but rather their fathers, and their mothers to a certain extent, who seem to have failed completely in exercising any sort of corrective control over their children. One point that strikes me is that in the case of juvenile delinquents it is the fathers who should appear before the court.  Usually, it is the mothers who appear.  I think the district justice should insist on the fathers appearing before him because I think that would help to instil some sense of responsibility into the fathers as to the control they should exercise over their children. There is a definite lack of parental control at the present time.  With reference to that, I think the Church has failed to some extent.  During my 35 years I have listened to many sermons but I have never heard one sermon dealing with the lack of parental control or the necessity for a greater degree of responsibility on the part of parents in relation to the behaviour of their children.  In conclusion, I appeal to the Minister to consider those young men who entered the Taca Síochána when the call went forth.  They were, as we know, recruited in a temporary capacity.  They did wonderful work and to a certain extent they have been absorbed into the regular police force now.  But I think I am right in saying that their service in the Taca Síochána is not taken into consideration for pension purposes.  I ask the Minister to accord them the same treatment as is given to the members of the regular police force.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the manner in which this Vote has been taken.  The debate travelled over a fairly wide field.  Most of it was directed to matters of detail rather than to any fundamental criticism of me or my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Generally speaking, I think the best answer I can make in reply to most of the points raised is to state that the law will be strictly, rigorously and impartially enforced during the coming <Col N="476" /> year as it has been in the past.  There will be no relaxation.</P>
    <P>Some points were raised as to recruiting, transfers and the housing conditions of the Garda Síochána.  I am very concerned with these problems. The hold-up in recruiting is temporary though, as I have said in reply to the former Minister, Deputy Boland, I assume that we are now approaching normal conditions and the number of Guards sufficient in 1939 should be sufficient now.  Roughly we have 200 more now than we had in 1939.  I hope they will not pass away too quickly, or anything like that.  I wish them all long lives and I hope that we shall have the same number this time next year.  If any crucial situation arises, it will not develop with such rapidity as to prevent us at any time bringing the police force up to whatever strength may be required.</P>
    <P>With regard to hackney-car licences, the law is quite clear.  I would have to amend the law before I could stop the development about which some Deputies have complained.  I have all the sympathy in the world with the people who are being damaged in their livelihood, but until the law is amended, it must be administered as it stands.  The conditions are laid down and any person who is refused a licence can appeal to the court and, if all the conditions are complied with, have that decision reversed.</P>
    <P>The payment of jurors is an important question.  The matter is being actively examined.  Another important point under consideration in this connection is the extension of the jurors, but that is not a very easy matter to undertake right away.</P>
    <P>With regard to registration of title and probate matters generally, I agree that we are slower than we should be. I referred to that in my opening statement. We have not made the headway I would like for the reasons I have stated but, this time next year, I hope the situation will be rectified.</P>
    <P>In answer to a Parliamentary Question, I have already expressed my regret that I have not been able to bring the matter of the District Court clerks to a conclusion before this.  I am moving as rapidly as I can <Col N="477" /> and I hope to have a decision soon.  I cannot say definitely when but, as this matter has gone on for a very long time, another few months will not make any appreciable difference one way or the other.</P>
    <P>The taking of depositions is very important.  It was thought that a shorthand-note could be used in substitution for the present longhand note but, on examination, it was found that the latter did not speed up the taking of the depositions at all. Deputies are aware that the deposition has to be read back to the person who makes it.  A rather important point in connection with the taking of the deposition in longhand is the fact that the interests of the accused person are thereby better protected. We are trying to do something to lessen the need for depositions.  The whole matter is under examination at the moment but it is not one that can be determined very easily.</P>

      <P>I suppose a dictaphone could be used, but suppose anything happened to the dictaphone! I will have the matter examined but I will not undertake to use a dictaphone or anything else until I have a complete report.</P>
      <P>Many diverse points have been raised.  I think the best thing I can do is to have these examined in the Department.  Some comments were made about traffic.  That really belongs to Local Government.  It is not my responsibility.  The Commissioner is an instrument of the Department of Local Government in that respect. Although I am responsible for his Vote, I would like to stress that my control is very slight.  That brings me now to the transfer of Guards and the general control over the Garda Síochána.  Last year I drew the attention of everybody concerned to the fact that the Commissioner has sole responsibility for the administration of the Garda Síochána.  He has that by statute.  He is a statutory authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="478" /> Notwithstanding that, people will persist in addressing the Minister as if he were the Commissioner.  I want to stress that discipline must be maintained. The Commissioner is responsible for discipline, administration, transfers and everything else.  People who interfere, or try to interfere, on behalf of the Gardaí only do harm because the Commissioner must, in the interests of the Guards themselves, take a serious view of any representations made to him.  I trust that will relieve me of the necessity of ever again having to state that I cannot do anything.  I know that some people do not believe me when I tell them that. But they must accept that.  If there was any change made, it would not be to the interests of the Guards or anybody else.</P>
    <P>I agree that housing in relation to the Guards presents a difficulty, but it is one that is not easily solved, because in the past when there were houses for police officers and others, the men were inclined when they resigned to stay in them and so you had to keep building whenever men went out in the past even when there was accommodation. However, I am impressed by the views expressed here that houses should be made available for the Guards, because it would assist the Commissioner.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but not quite as much as I would like.  I find, however, that housing is not the biggest difficulty.  The greatest difficulty arising from the transfer of Guards is schools for the children, and they want to be near the best school in the place. It does not matter how good may be the house to which you are transferring them; if it is not near a good school, it is a hardship.  That is one of the influences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The points raised were many, and I do not think any good purpose would be served by running through them or replying to them here and now.  I assure Deputies that I will examine each and every one of them in detail, and, as far as possible, give effect to the various points raised, where they <Col N="479" /> are for better administration and for the good of the country as a whole.</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £567,100 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1950, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Local Government, including Grants to Local Authorities and other Expenses in connection with Housing and Miscellaneous Grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total of the Estimate for the expenses of the Department for the year is £1,207,100.  It shows an increase of almost £60,000 on the Estimate for the last year.  The gross increase, reduced by savings under other heads, is mainly attributable to the provision for contributions towards loan charges of local authorities under <Col N="482" /> the Housing Acts, which automatically increase with the accumulating indebtedness for housing and which this year involves a State charge of £690,000 as compared with £600,000 last year.</P>
    <P>The sum of £10,000 provided in sub-head I (2) represents the estimated liability for grants payable for houses the erection or reconstruction of which was commenced before the 1st November, 1947.  This is, of course, a diminishing liability, replaced by the provision made in the next sub-head, I (3), for larger grants towards houses to which the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1948, relates.</P>
    <P>The amount provided for grants towards houses being erected by private persons under the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1948, is £300,000. This represents the approximate balance of the total amount for which there is statutory authority up to the present to expend.  This is unlikely to prove sufficient for the whole of the financial year, owing to the greatly accelerated rate at which private grants are now being paid, and legislation to extend the statutory maximum will become necessary during the year.</P>
    <P>The estimate for grants towards the provision of improved accommodation for householders, where a member is suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis, has been reduced.  The number of extra rooms and chalets so far being provided under the enabling Act of 1946 has been much lower than was anticipated. I hope, however, that there will be an extension of this form of building activity from now on.  If this happens, the provision for grants under this head will be correspondingly increased in future years.</P>
    <P>A separate provision of £20,000 is being made under Section 27 of the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1948, to enable grants to be allocated for the provision of houses reserved for occupation by newly-married couples.  This is estimated to be the maximum needed to meet the amount of grants likely to come in course of payment during the year towards completed houses to be allocated for the use of this class.</P>
    <P>There is nothing exceptional in the <Col N="483" /> remainder of the Estimate to which I need refer, in summarising its contents, except the provision of £1,453 which is included to cover the costs of preparation of a textbook on local government.  This work has been in progress for some years and is now nearing completion.  When the book is available it will provide a valuable starting point for the drafting of new measures to modernise and consolidate the local government codes.  One result of the researches undertaken is already apparent in the introduction in the Seanad of the Local Government (Repeal of Enactments) Bill, 1949.</P>
    <P>Of the total Estimate of £1,207,100, the amount required for subsidisation of the various forms of housing operations represents £1,057,975.  In other words, over 88 per cent. of the total Estimate relates to housing.  Therefore, it is right that, as my predecessor did last year, I should devote first place in introducing the Estimates to this essential service.</P>
    <P>The housing needs which the local authorities are required to meet had been estimated before the Government assumed office at about 60,000 houses, of which Dublin City and its environs required about 26,000.  In the course of the intensive examination of housing needs which has since been conducted in every local area, and in the organisation of the new housing drive, it has become apparent that this estimate is conservative, that in many cases more houses than were originally estimated are required for persons living in insanitary or overcrowded dwellings. There is also a constant accretion of new demands by reason of further obsolescence, tenementing and the subdivision of families.</P>
    <P>The late Minister, Mr. T.J. Murphy, referred in his introductory speech on the Estimate for the Department last year to the various difficulties, such as shortage of materials and skilled labour, reluctance of contractors to tender for houses, rising costs, and delay in completion of contracts, which he had experienced in initiating his housing drive.  The Minister and the Department worked throughout the year at continuous high pressure to overcome these difficulties.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="484" /> Better contacts were made with a view to easing the supplies position: the duties on imported tiles and slates were suspended; negotiations were undertaken with trade unions and representatives of the various trades groups and with local authorities in order to increase the supply of craftsmen. For this purpose, also, a more rigorous control of building licences was instituted.  Any type of building which could be described as &ldquo;luxury building&rdquo; ceased to operate except in cases covered by licences already granted.  Local authority and subsidy houses thus attracted a greater measure of building labour.  The number of workers employed on local authority housing schemes increased from 3,079 in March, 1948, to 8,353 in March, 1949.</P>
    <P>Where contractors did not come forward to tender for housing schemes, or where their tenders proved too expensive, or where contract work was found unsatisfactory, local authorities were encouraged to supplement the contract system by instituting direct labour schemes supervised by their own officers.  Detailed instructions were issued as to the organisation and supervision of such schemes.  It was made clear that they were to be operated as a supplement to and in competition with comparable tenders for contracts.</P>
    <P>At the same time, the Minister himself, accompanied by his chief officers, carried out a comprehensive series of visits throughout every county in the State.  He held housing conferences with the public representatives and officers in the local areas and by examination of the position in each area and by his personal exhortations and advice he succeeded in stepping up the rate of progress throughout the country generally.  All the housing conferences were completed within a period of eight or nine months. Representatives of every Party in the House came in contact with the Minister in their own local areas in the course of these visits and I have no doubt but that they were impressed by the sincerity and devotion which the Minister brought personally to bear upon this objective of good housing. It is the general belief, and it is within my own personal knowledge, <Col N="485" /> that the Minister wore himself out in the course of these arduous duties.  He died advocating the advancement of his programme and the best monument to his memory is the success which has already attended his efforts and the clear evidence that the housing programme is now advancing with ever-growing speed.</P>
    <P>The progress now being made must, of course, be not only sustained but also accelerated by every means at our disposal, but the fact that in the past year very real progress has been achieved will be evident from some figures showing the comparative positions as at the 31st March, 1948, and at the 31st March, 1949.</P>
    <P>In the year ended 31st March, 1949, 1,871 houses and flats were completed by local authorities, as compared with 729 in the previous year.  The actual volume of housing activity now in progress is, however, still more encouraging. The number of dwellings in course of construction in March, 1949, was 8,193, as compared with 3,816 in progress at the corresponding date in 1948. It is expected that in the present year this figure will rise to 10,000.</P>
    <P>With regard to the position in Dublin, which presents the most difficult problem of any individual area, the number of dwellings in course of erection in the city in March last was 2,759, as compared with 1,632 a year previously; 775 houses and flats were handed over during the year, the corresponding figure for the previous year being 553.  The number of dwellings completed in the month of March, 1949, was 224, the largest monthly output for a very considerable time.</P>
    <P>I am sure everybody will agree that great credit is due to the Dublin Corporation and its housing staff and to the Dublin Housing Consultative Council for the success which is attending their efforts and that we may confidently look forward to the expansion of housing output in the city at a steadily increasing rate.</P>
    <P>The supply of an adequate number of skilled craftsmen such as carpenters, plasterers and others associated with the finishing of houses, still represents one of the most serious obstacles to a greater rate of production. <Col N="486" /> Nevertheless, considerable progress has been made to swell the ranks of skilled operatives on local authority housing schemes.  The number of skilled tradesmen engaged on these schemes throughout the country as a whole has increased from 1,283 in March, 1948, to 3,664 in March, 1949. The question of further increasing the supply of skilled labour has been the subject of discussions with the trades groups and negotiations still continue. The final attitude of certain trades groups to the importation as an emergency measure of a limited number of prefabricated houses has also to be still defined.</P>
    <P>In this connection and also in relation to the attraction of further supplies of skilled labour from those who emigrated in the past to Britain, the position of housing finance and continuous employment on building works has been explained in public statements and in the course of negotiations with the trades union representatives. It has been publicly announced by the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, the late Minister and other representatives of the Government that financial difficulties will not be allowed to constitute an obstacle to housing.  Local authorities have also been advised to draw up planned programmes, not only for building houses, but for the acquisition and development of land for further housing schemes to meet all their estimated needs, so that on the completion of one scheme employees can be switched at once to the scheme succeeding it, thereby providing continuous employment for the operatives.  To this programme I now give my wholehearted support and I wish to announce publicly that so far as the Government and the local authorities are capable of achieving that objective, the employment to be afforded on housing schemes for a considerable period to come will be of growing dimensions and of a continuous nature.</P>
    <P>With the certainty of continuous employment at wage rates and amenities of life that compare favourably with anything that can be obtained abroad, I would earnestly bespeak a still greater rally of workers to our national housing drive.  I also wish to commend the workers for their co-operation <Col N="487" /> towards securing a better rate of output, and I am sure that they will intensify their efforts in this direction when they realise that the housing programme, coupled with the programme of hospital construction and other large building programmes now being planned by the Government, provide certainty of continuous employment for very many years to come.  The work being performed is for themselves and their brethren and, in the last words of the late Minister, is intended to secure better living conditions for their children.</P>
    <P>The position as regards subsidies on loan charges and special capital grants from the Transition Development Fund, which are the chief means of subsidising local authority housing, remains the same as last year.  Housing costs still prove extremely erratic.  While direct labour schemes have been found to be economical and a valuable corrective to contracts, the costs under the contract system still vary enormously as between one scheme and another.  The variations are most apparent in rural areas where prices for cottages without services range from £700 upwards, reaching £1,000 for larger types.  In certain urban districts, the tender prices for development and building commonly range from £1,300 to £1,500 for houses between 700 and 850 square feet.</P>
    <P>These prices are far too high.  It would, to my mind, be a very imprudent step to follow inflated prices with increased subsidies and I feel that the time is coming when we must fix ceiling figures above which no tenders will be approved.  This has been done in individual cases already.  Inflated costs of building are an absolute deterrent to speedy and effective housing.  They add to the burdens of the State, the local authority and the tenants.  At present the State liability in respect of the capital cost of housing works out at approximately one-half of the cost.  No new system of housing subsidy can be formulated on a permanent basis until a much greater degree of normality is achieved in the matter of building costs and I wish it to be clear that my idea of normality is that which <Col N="488" /> will be attained by an all round reduction of the price of houses.</P>
    <P>As regards private building, the introduction of the new scales of grants for houses erected by private persons and public utility societies under the Housing Act which became law in the beginning of 1948 had to be effected after the Government took office. Various regulations and forms and a large amount of printing had to be undertaken before the scheme could be got going.  Then the technical and clerical staffs of the housing section, depleted during the emergency, had to be reorganised to cope with the access of new work.  The new arrangements were well in operation by the summer of 1948, but by that time the volume of applications before the Department had grown to very considerable dimensions.  The late Minister took a personal interest in having the arrears brought up to date with the minimum delay and the position now is that, for the country as a whole, the housing section is operating on current work, with no appreciable amount of arrears in any area.  The increases in the number of applications dealt with and in the amount of the grants paid at successive periods in the past year are the best illustration of the progress made.</P>
    <P>In April, 1948, 50 applications for grants were dealt with; no payment was made under the heading of grants for new houses; and £20 was paid towards a reconstructed house.</P>
    <P>In July, 169 cases were dealt with; new house grants totalled £2,232 and reconstruction grants £485.</P>
    <P>In October the figures were 1,298 cases; new house grants £19,768 and reconstruction grants £4,115.</P>
    <P>In February, an unsatisfactory period for building and inspections, 1,119 cases were dealt with and the payment figures had mounted to £62,645 for new houses and £7,980 for reconstructed houses.</P>
    <P>It is the Department's aim to stimulate private house-building of the appropriate type in such a way that it will provide the maximum supplement of local authority building.  The controls exercised over all other types of <Col N="489" /> building operations no longer apply to local authority houses or subsidy houses.  The valuation for the purpose of advances under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts was increased from £1,000, first to £1,750 and since to £2,000.  Local authorities have been encouraged to make sites available for persons erecting their own houses. They may, where appropriate, develop the site and transfer it to the prospective householder at cost price. Further legislation is under consideration with a view to facilitating this procedure and expanding its use and with a view to discouraging the unreasonably high prices, fines and ground rents demanded by land speculators for sites being let to private persons.</P>
    <P>The annual grants of £40 a year for ten years made available under the Act of 1948 towards the provision of houses for letting should, I think, be availed of to a greater extent than they have been.  The Department has so far received only 360 applications under this head.  With a wider public knowledge of the facilities available, there should be increased activities in this field, particularly on the part of industrialists and other employers building houses for their own workers. The late Minister wrote personally to all the leading business concerns pointing out the facilities available and the procedure to be followed and asking for their co-operation.  There is already evidence of a sympathetic reaction to this approach and I trust that the interests concerned will, as a whole, display a helpful and progressive attitude in this matter.</P>
    <P>I now pass to the activities of local authorities in the provision of sanitary services.  The expansion of these services is closely allied to the housing programme.  New or augmented water supplies and sewerage systems are often found necessary to cope with increases in the number of dwellings to be served.  Increased housing grants are applicable to houses in which sanitary services are installed. It, therefore, becomes the responsibility of the local authorities to extend existing sanitary systems or install new ones in built-up areas where existing <Col N="490" /> systems are either insufficient or not available.</P>
    <P>Apart from its relation to the new housing, the sanitary services programme has still to be undertaken in many of the smaller towns and villages throughout the country.  It is probably true to say that the remaining portion of the programme is the most difficult portion.  Areas which presented special difficulties as regards the planning of waterworks or sewerage schemes were necessarily left in abeyance until the more straightforward schemes were carried out.  Some counties have an enormous programme of these schemes still to be undertaken.  The procedure adopted for a number of years has been to have the pending works listed in the order of their relative urgency by the local authority on the recommendation of the county medical officer.  This is the procedure which must still be followed to enable works to be undertaken in accordance with a planned programme over successive years.  It is obvious that from the point of view either of the capacity of the local authority to undertake the work or of the arrangements available for financing the schemes, the works will have to be undertaken in successive periods.  These limitations are naturally not appreciated by the representatives of particular areas who press for immediate attention to their own needs.  Notwithstanding these difficulties, I am glad to say that progress was well maintained during the past year on the provision of water and sewerage facilities in towns and villages.  The total number of major schemes initiated during the year was 33, involving an expenditure of nearly £400,000, towards which State grants of £140,000 were allocated.  A still larger programme is planned for the present financial year.</P>
    <P>An unsatisfactory feature in relation to some schemes already carried out was the small number of connections made by householders with the services, when installed.  In October last, a circular letter was issued to all sanitary authorities outlining the statutory provisions which have been made to facilitate householders who might otherwise be deterred by the immediate burden of the cost of connections. Local authorities have been <Col N="491" /> reminded they may themselves make the house connections at a cost agreed with the householder and that, where necessary, the repayment of their expenses by the householder may be spread over a period of years.  It has been suggested that these provisions be brought to the notice of the householders and it has also been pointed out that connections with sanitary services can be made most economically at the time when these services are being installed.</P>
    <P>The number of appeals under the Town and Regional Planning Acts submitted to the Minister in 1948-49 was 288, as compared with 197 in the previous year.  In a large proportion of the cases settlement was achieved between the appellants and planning authorities as a result of the Department's intervention.  A noteworthy feature of many of the cases which came before the Department was their relationship to the extension of sanitary facilities.  Where the erection of dwelling-houses is proposed in situations which are near built-up areas but which are not yet served by sanitary facilities, it has to be determined whether such facilities are likely to be brought to those areas in the near future or whether they are areas that are never likely to be served.  Similar decisions have to be made in the planning of housing schemes.  Where sanitary services are available a high density rate of houses per acre can be approved whereas if such facilities are not to be provided the building must be on the basis of low density.</P>
    <P>My predecessor and his Parliamentary Secretary have endeavoured to make the Planning Acts subserve the realistic needs of current development rather than the problematic needs of unspecified future periods.  I may say my own attitude to the Acts is the same.  I feel that while they may serve a useful and indeed essential purpose in various aspects of interim control, their structure is somewhat rigid in other respects and their contents may need revision.  An important aspect of their application is in relation to the user of land.  I hope to see their provisions more closely co-ordinated with the general provisions governing the <Col N="492" /> acquisition of land by local authorities. A certain co-ordination of the administrative activities of the Department has already been effected for this purpose.</P>
    <P>The Road Fund income in 1948-49 amounted to £2,389,000 as compared with £2,000,000 in 1947-48.  The increase is due partly to the increased number of vehicles using the roads and partly to the increased h.p. rates of duty prescribed in the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1947.  The number of vehicles under current licence in August, 1948, was 108,002 as compared with 90,374 in August, 1947.</P>
    <P>Outstanding liabilities in respect of road maintenance and improvement grants amount to £2,787,280, which, with other charges on the fund, made a total outstanding at the 31st March, 1949, of £2,920,280.  The Road Fund income for the present financial year is estimated at £2,400,000.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that the liabilities outstanding at the beginning of the financial year coupled with a reasonable normal programme for the current year would exhaust the total current income of the fund and the margin of borrowing permitted last year.  That is the simple explanation of the reduction in the grants available for the present financial year.  Deputies have already been made aware of all these considerations and they have been given details of the mode of allocation adopted for the present year.  An attractive feature of the allocations, to my mind, is the additional proportion of the total grant made available for work on county roads.</P>
    <P>At a recent conference of county engineers in Dublin it was ascertained that in practically every county the current road works programme will be in full operation in the present month and that it will provide employment at least comparable to that provided in any previous normal year.</P>
    <P>When the Road Fund grants programme was being debated in the Dáil on 23rd February last, the Minister referred to the proposed Bill which has since been introduced under the title of the Local Authorities (Works) Bill, 1949, under which he anticipated that alternative employment would be <Col N="493" /> afforded to persons displaced as a result of the cessation of the special road works programme undertaken by the aid of borrowing in 1948-49.  The Bill is still before the Oireachtas, but in the meantime the local authorities have been requested to make local surveys and furnish schedules, giving in outline particulars of the schemes which they propose to undertake when the necessary statutory authority is available.  The schedules of schemes submitted indicate that a very extensive series of works, ranging from £50,000 in some counties to over £200,000 in others, are capable of being put in hands without much delay.</P>
    <P>At the conference of county engineers to which I have referred, the general opinion was that the most suitable time of the year for undertaking the majority of works of this kind was the summer and autumn period up to about November.  While, therefore, I am encouraging the local authorities to proceed with their road works at the normal rate, at least, I shall have to consider, when the new Bill becomes law, the question of corelating labour for the road works schemes and the works authorised by the Bill.</P>
    <P>During the year a number of emergency controls over various commodities were removed.  Nevertheless, many kinds of supplies are not yet back to pre-war levels.  It has, however, been possible to appoint official contractors for the current year for many commodities unobtainable during the emergency.  A welcome feature of the tenders in the present year was the marked increase in the number of applications for appointment as official contractors which was received from provincial merchants. Prices as a whole are still very much above the pre-war figures.  I trust that the near future will manifest a fall in these prices which can be passed on to the credit of the local authorities.</P>
    <P>The combined purchasing section of the Department acts also on behalf of health authorities which are otherwise under the supervision of the Minister for Health.  The work of the section in this sphere relates to the supply of furniture, medical equipment, <Col N="494" /> etc., for health authorities and local institutions.  Considerable progress has been made in the standardisation of the furniture and equipment for local authority hospitals.  It is hoped thus to achieve the maximum value for the institutions with the minimum expenditure.</P>
    <P>The supply of building materials to local authorities is becoming of increasing importance, according as direct labour schemes are promoted for the building of houses and also in connection with the maintenance of existing housing estates.  The Department is at present examining the extent to which it can be of advice and assistance to local authorities in this matter, either by an extension of the activities of the combined purchasing section or otherwise.</P>
    <P>The estimates adopted by county councils for the current year show a general rise in rates.  They represent an average poundage of 23/3 as compared with 20/5 last year.  The increase in the poundage represents an estimated increase in revenue of about £800,000 on the revenue of about £9,000,000 in the previous year.</P>
    <P>The largest single increase in the current year's Estimates is for roads and this is due to the general adoption of exceptionally heavy supplementary road estimates by county councils in the latter months of 1948 in order to qualify for further grants offered to them for road works at that time.  Provision for the local authorities' share of this extra road expenditure had to be included in the 1949-50 Estimates. The grants were on a very favourable basis under the emergency arrangements made to finance the road restoration programme, so that the local contributions evoked very good value. Estimates for housing services provide for an increased expenditure of 27 per cent. on last year.  This increase is indicative of greater attention to housing and it is, therefore, one which will be generally approved.  Sanitary services expenditure will increase by 11 per cent. and this, too, is in keeping with the position as explained in my remarks on the general sanitary programme.</P>
    <P>Of the total expenditure of county <Col N="495" /> councils, estimated at £9,843,000 in the present year, over £4,000,000, or 42 per cent., is to be spent on health and assistance services.</P>
    <P>In connection with these figures, I wish to make it clear that the poundages, percentages and actual expenditure figures I have given are gross amounts and do not represent the actual burden on the rural rate-payers. The sum of £9,843,000 is reducible by £3,910,000 in respect of the Agricultural Grant, which is made available in relief of rates on agricultural land.  That leaves a net amount of £5,930,000 to be obtained by county councils.</P>
    <P>The county rate collection for the year was very good and it showed an improvement on the 31st March, 1949, on the corresponding date in 1948.</P>
    <P>The total borrowings for purposes other than housing for the year amounted to £877,926, as compared with £518,783 in the previous year.  The increase was largely accounted for by a stock issue by the Dublin Corporation during the year.  Housing loans sanctioned in 1948-49 amounted to £8,403,758, as compared with £2,320,366 in the previous financial year.</P>
    <P>Local administration generally presented very few major difficulties.  In the course of the Minister's visits to the various local areas, it was found possible to resolve in a speedy and simple manner numerous problems which would otherwise have involved lengthy correspondence.  There was a general appreciation of the Minister's interest in every aspect of local administration and a corresponding willingness on the part of local representatives and local officers to co-operate.  I think I can safely say that the foundations have now been laid for a closer and more realistic understanding between the Local Government Department and local administration.</P>
    <P>I am aware that there is still uncertainty&mdash;and no doubt a good deal of speculation&mdash;as to the system of administration which will be proposed in replacement of the management system.  This is not the occasion on which an announcement on this matter can be made, but I wish to make it <Col N="496" /> clear that the preparation of the legislative proposals on this matter has been pushed forward by the late Minister and his officers as speedily as possible, having regard to the pressure on them occasioned by other work, other programmes and other legislation such as I have outlined to-day.  So far as I am concerned, the introduction of these proposals to this House and their publication for the information of all concerned will not be delayed a single day beyond the time needed for their complete formulation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>While I in no way wish to begrudge to the Minister the congratulations which would customarily be tendered to him on succeeding to Ministerial rank, nevertheless I think that the usual freedom of criticism in relation to the statement which he has made to the House will be somewhat restricted by the tragic circumstances under which he has become responsible for the Department of Local Government. Allowance must be made also for the fact that as he has only lately been called to office we need not, perhaps, have expected from him as fully an exposition of the principles on which that Department has been administered during the past 12 months as we might have required from his predecessor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are one or two matters arising on the main body of the Estimate about which I should like some further information, in relation to which the Minister was certainly not very expansive. I notice that under subhead I (1) the contribution to loan charges under the Housing (Miscellaneous and Financial Provisions) Act, 1942, has been increased from £600,500 in 1948-49 to £690,145 for the current year, representing an increase of £89,645.  No doubt it will be claimed that that is indicative of the vigour with which the housing problem has been attacked by the Minister for Local Government.  If one were to draw that conclusion from that figure, I think he would be grievously misled and, in order that no person may be under any misapprehension as to the significance of these figures, I would like the Minister, when replying, to say when the houses in <Col N="497" /> respect of which this additional £89,645 will be payable during the year were projected and planned by the local authorities concerned, when the schemes which they constituted were approved by the Minister and when operations commenced, and if he would further say, with regard to these houses, when the sites for them were acquired and were developed.  I think it is desirable that we should have that information also in relation to those houses which he claimed were in course of construction in the City of Dublin in this year as compared with last year and the number of houses completed during 1948-49 as compared with 1947-48. It would be very useful indeed to know how many of these dwellings were built on sites acquired, on sites developed and on foundations laid in the years prior to 1948 when building materials were unobtainable.</P>
    <P>I see nothing to congratulate the Minister on in the fact that he has been able considerably to increase the rate at which houses have been constructed. Everything was there to his hand.  Plans had been prepared and sites acquired and, as I have said, developed, and all he had to do was to take full advantage of the considerable increase in the supply of materials which took place during the past year. He has no control over that.  These materials have become available not due to any increase in economic activity in this country but to the general revival&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I do not want to go into the general question of economic production in relation to this country. There are many aspects of that question in respect of which our position compares very unfavourably with that of other countries.  The Government need not pat itself on the back and need not applaud itself for the fact that they are getting now what we could not get when we were in office. They are getting them not because we did not try to get them but because, when the Deputy and some of his colleagues were outside, when some of the colleagues now supporting him were outside, endeavouring to embroil this country in war&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I should like to apologise to the Chair and to say that I feel I did go outside the bounds of the debate.  I am sorry that Deputy Lehane had to leave the House in the circumstances in which he has left. Another matter about which I am perturbed is that no progress seems to have been made in regard to giving effect to the scheme for holding a competition for designs for housing schemes.  I note that the Vote in respect of that has been reduced from £4,000 to £3,900.  I do not know what led to that reduction, nor do I know the reason for it.  It seems to me to be almost a contemptuous reduction, and I do not know whether indeed it is a reduction which was made after due consideration or just a fictitious and unreal effort to show that the Estimates had been prepared with more than usual care.  It would be very interesting to know exactly what calculations were made in order to estimate the expense which would be involved in holding this competition.</P>
