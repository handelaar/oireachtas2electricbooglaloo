      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether he is aware that a number of farmers in South Kerry found that their farm buildings had <Col N="2497" /> fallen into such a bad state of disrepair that they were compelled to proceed immediately with their repair before he announced the operative date of his scheme for the improvement of farm buildings; and if, in view of the honest attempt on the part of these men to keep their buildings in a proper state of repair, he will allow them to make application for and obtain retrospective benefit under the existing scheme sponsored by his Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of the circumstances referred to by the Deputy.  I would like to point out, however, that grants are not paid for repairs under the farm buildings scheme unless the repairs conform to approved specifications drawn up so as to ensure that a good job is carried out in each case.  I cannot see my way, therefore, to alter the condition of the scheme which requires that applicants for grants must obtain written authority before commencing any work for which a grant is sought.  It would be quite impossible to work the scheme otherwise.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that, owing to statements made by the previous Minister and himself in regard to farm buildings schemes, the people were somewhat confused?  As a matter of urgency, in the cases I am referring to the farmers commenced operations on these farm buildings before the appointed day, which I understand was 1st April of this year.  Is he further aware that the farmers concerned carried out improvements in accordance with the plans and specifications of the Department and these farmers are now debarred from availing of this scheme simply because they commenced the work before 1st April?</P>

      <P>I fully sympathise with the people who are so circumstanced <Col N="2498" /> as the Deputy has indicated, but I would like to point out that I tried to make as express a declaration in regard to this matter on the 24th June of last year as I was able to draft. While I know some men may have anticipated and gone ahead, the difficulty is that, were an exception to be made in a single case, thousands of applications of equal merit would at once be presented.  I can assure the Deputy it is not for the want of the will, but for the want of the way that I am unable to meet the case to which he has referred.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must wait until the position is reviewed.  I must not be taken as accepting the implication contained in the question that rents now are too high.  I am not aware that they are too high and I shall not accept any such opinion until the matter is reviewed.  I would like to remind the Deputy that the Act was only passed in 1946 and I am sure the position was very fully examined then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that.  I am sure the Minister is aware of the reason for the passing of that Act.  It was to encourage the building of houses.  It was to ensure that rents would not soar to too high a figure that the Act was limited to 1950. Apparently there are people taking advantage of it now to raise rents as high as possible and a new Act would be required to deal with the situation. I ask the Minister to take precautions when he is introducing such new legislation to ensure that the rents will be in relation to those charged when the properties were first let.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday evening the Minister stated that a speech made by him in Westport referred specifically to rural workers.  I want to ask him what he proposes to do for the urban workers.  Has he any schemes of employment for the thousands of people who are signing on at the labour exchanges in the urban areas?  When Deputy Corry was speaking last week the Minister said he had work for so many thousands; he said yesterday that that referred to the rural workers. What will he do for the people who are idle in the urban areas?  In 1947 the Minister stated on the 17th April at column 847, Volume 105, of Dáil Debates:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I said here 12 months ago, and I want to repeat it now, that without the slightest trouble every able-bodied man and woman in this country could be put into useful work to-morrow morning.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Has the Minister any schemes to provide employment for the 3,400 or 3,500 who are signing on at Cork Labour Exchange?  What will the Minister do to prevent the employees in the woollen mills being laid off?  If they are laid off, that will undoubtedly increase the numbers signing on at the exchange.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have here a letter from the Cork Workers' Council asking me to do what I can to prevent the Minister carrying <Col N="2502" /> out that part of the Milne report which affects the heavy workshops at Rock-savage. The letter says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Should this transfer take place, it will have serious repercussions on the workers in the trade in Cork and will lead to a great deal of unemployment.  My council disagrees entirely with this centralisation of industry.  On the contrary, industry should be more and more decentralised.  In view of the foregoing, I am to ask you for your co-operation in the non-acceptance of the recommendation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am sure the other Cork representatives have also received copies of that letter.  I would ask the Minister when he is replying to allay the anxiety and uneasiness that exists among the workers engaged in these workshops.</P>
    <P>I should also like to draw the Minister's attention to the bus fares charged in Cork, especially for children, and to the short distances which people are allowed to travel for these fares.  For one journey which I know and which is less than a mile, a fare of 3d. is charged.  That is out of all proportion to what I pay here in Dublin. These high fares have a very serious effect on the cost of living of the average family, especially if there are three or four children going to school. Children are now being charged half the adult fares; previously there was only one fare, 1d., for school-going children.  They are now being charged 2d. for very short distances.  I know one case of a family in which four children are going to school.  They pay 2d. each in the morning, a total of 8d., going to school, 8d. coming home to lunch, 8d. going back after lunch and 8d. coming home in the evening.  The Minister can make that up for himself, apart from what the father and mother have to pay when the father is going to and coming home from work and the mother has to go out to do some shopping.  These fares, as I say, have a very serious effect on the cost of living at the present time.</P>
    <P>I should further like to draw the Minister's attention to the hardship caused to some industrialists in the centre of the City of Cork due to the <Col N="2503" /> delay in the change over from D.C. to A.C. current by the Electricity Supply Board.  Employers have told me that they have been warned that if they get in new machinery after a certain date &mdash;that is now a couple of years ago&mdash; they will not be compensated for any new motors or machinery they may get in in this way.  They say that the cost of maintaining the old machinery is very high compared with what would be the cost of maintaining new plant. I think that Cork is being unfairly treated in that respect.</P>
    <P>There is another matter in connection with the Electricity Supply Board concerning which Deputy Lehane asked a question some time ago, namely, the sending of orders for the making of A masts required in County Cork up to Dublin.  These A masts are generally made by shipwrights.  I believe there are about six shipwrights making them in Dublin and when current orders are completed in Dublin, they are allowed to pile up a stock.  In Cork there were a few shipwrights making these masts at Kilbarry.  They would be allowed to make just the number required for a certain area but they would not be allowed to make them for stock, with the result that if certain masts were urgently required in certain areas the order was sent to Dublin.  Masts are sometimes sent from Dublin to districts as far away as Bantry.  I think the Electricity Supply Board should be asked to pile up stocks of A masts in Cork as well as in Dublin because this practice of sending up to Dublin for masts and transporting them to places as far distant as Charleville and Bantry should not be allowed.  It is about time it stopped.</P>
    <P>I should like also to draw the Minister's attention to a question I put down to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs some time ago in regard to the import of poles in a finished condition. The reply which I received from him was that poles used in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs are generally imported in a partially dressed condition and the dressing is completed at Dublin and Cork.  During the past year, however, he added, it was not possible to secure sufficient partially dressed poles to meet the <Col N="2504" /> requirements of the telephone development programme, and two lots of poles, one in a completely dressed condition and the other already creosoted, were purchased.  I think an effort should be made to obviate the necessity of importing dressed poles under any circumstances, so that employment might be provided for people in our own country dressing and creosoting these poles.  I was approached by a number of workers about that matter last April when I put down the question and they told me that about 40 men were employed in Cork at that particular work.</P>
    <P>I should now like to address a few remarks to the Minister about the tourist situation at Cobh.  He is aware that a deputation came up here last December comprising all the T.D.s for the City of Cork and East Cork and they put up a very good case to him in regard to the facilities that should be provided.  They received a reply from him on 7th February to the following effect:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am directed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to refer to your letter of 18th January, 1949, and to inform you that the Minister has now had an opportunity of discussing with the Minister for Finance the matters raised by the deputation from Cobh at the conference in Leinster House on December 2nd last. The Minister for Finance is in full agreement with the view the Minister conveyed to you at the conference that any better facilities considered necessary at Cobh should be provided by private enterprise and not by any Department of State and he has indicated that it would be out of the question for him to undertake any commitments on the Exchequer in regard to the matters discussed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not know how private enterprise could provide the extra customs facilities such as were suggested, the only place available being portion of the Córas Iompair Éireann premises.  I would point out to the Minister, as was pointed out to him on that occasion, that this is not really a question for Cobh or Cork at all.  Most of the tourists coming into Cobh go straight away to different parts of the country. <Col N="2505" /> I had an experience of that on Tuesday when I was travelling up from Cork by train.  Two of the largest transatlantic steamers, the <i>Washington</i> and the <i>Mauretania</i>, arrived off Cobh that morning and at the last moment the train was delayed and hundreds of these tourists boarded it. Many of them got off at Limerick Junction, but the majority came on to Dublin.  Surely the Minister does not expect the people of Cobh or Cork to provide the facilities needed to cater for this business.  I can assure the Minister I listened to a good many complaints coming up on the train about the three-and-a-half hour delay they had at the customs.  Apparently the same thing happened some time before, because in last Sunday's <i>Sunday Chronicle</i> there appears an article with the heading: &ldquo;Port hold up may cost dollars,&rdquo;&ldquo;Americans wait three hours.&rdquo;  It goes on:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;American tourists and other visitors are complaining bitterly about the long delays caused by the customs at some Irish ports.</P>
    <P>Unless there is a speeding-up in the service before the summer traffic begins it is feared the tourist trade may suffer.</P>
    <P>The main cause of the delay is the shortage of officers, I was told yesterday.</P>
    <P>The problem is particularly acute at Cobh.  Some passengers say that they have been held up for hours in draughty sheds while three officers worked their way through thousands of bags and trucks.</P>
    <P>They had the annoying experience, they said, of having one or two of their cases examined within the first hour and then having to wait another hour to have the remainder checked.</P>
    <P>Officials seemed to roam along the checking counters, picking out luggage at random.</P>
    <P>The checking of the luggage of 200 passengers one day last week took more than three hours.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>You can see by the reply the Minister gave us the contempt they have for the provision of any facilities for the tourist traffic at Cobh or Cork.  We <Col N="2506" /> are told that the tourist industry is worth £35,000,000&mdash;some people say more&mdash;to this country, and still, while they do big things for Rineanna, at Cobh, where ten tourists come in for every one who comes to Rineanna, they leave people sitting on the quays or anywhere they like without any accommodation. I would like to contrast that with the way the people across the water, who are supposed to be much wealthier than we, looked after their own tourist industry last December at the time when we approached the Minister.  I have some extracts here from the <i>Daily Express</i> dated 20th December, 1948:&mdash;</P>

    <P>Britain's sea and air ports have been told to plan a brighter and better welcome for visitors.  Cabinet orders are that money will be found for new buildings and more staff if they are needed.</P>
    <P>Sir Stafford Cripps, Chancellor of the Exchequer, has already sent out experts to advise.</P>
    <P>A short-term plan for tourists who will be coming to this country from Easter onwards will go into operation as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>A long-term plan foresees great improvement in ports and railway stations, to be ready by 1951, when hundreds of thousands of tourists are expected for the great London festival and exhibition.</P>
    <P>Sir James R.C. Helmore, second secretary to the Board of Trade, is the chief planner.</P>
    <P>It is expected that within four years the tourist industry in this country will be earning more than £1,000,000 a week&mdash;a total of £65,000,000 by 1952.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We contend that our tourist industry earned £35,000,000 last year, but still we are not prepared to spend anything out of the national Exchequer.  This goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2507" />&ldquo;A Government working party has already visited Dover, Folke-stone and Harwich, the big entry ports for most European countries. Recommendations will be put into effect soon.</P>
    <P>One suggestion was the speeding up in dealing with tourists who bring cars with them.</P>
    <P>Treasury official Mr. L.F. Morrissey&mdash;the Minister's namesake&mdash; heads the working party, which includes officials from the Transport Commission, Ministry of Transport, Docks and Harbour Authorities' Association, Ministry of Health, Board of Trade, Ministry of Food, Ministry of Civil Aviation, Customs and Excise, Immigration, Railway Executives, and Mr. A. McLean, assistant to the Director-General of the Travel Association.</P>
    <P>All these departments have something to do with tourists arriving or leaving.  Among other things, they have been told to simplify formalities for entry and exit.  For instance:&mdash; The customs will consider speedier methods for clearing passengers.</P>
    <P>The Ministry of Health will decide if it is necessary for a visitor to fill in a form stating where he has spent the last 14 nights before arrival.</P>
    <P>The railways have been asked to concentrate on improvements in their services in boat trains, better station refreshment rooms, more and better restaurant and sleeping-cars.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making a comparison between that country which is wealthier than we are and this country.  I think it is no harm to compare our possibilities of earning dollars with those of the country across the water.  The wealthier country is doing these things in the hope of getting £65,000,000 by 1952, while we made £35,000,000 last year:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Treasury will sanction capital investments for this work because of its dollar earning importance.</P>
      <P>It is likely that the new quayside stations at Southampton due to be opened for Atlantic travellers next year will be a model for most of the country.</P>
      <P>The Government expects that the rate of increase in Britain's earnings from tourists is likely to be bigger than any other export.  This year's total receipts were £35,000,000, of which nearly half was dollars.  And indications in America are that travel to Europe in 1949 may reach an all-time record.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I put it to the Minister that the chief port of entry into this country for tourists with dollars is Cobh.  I do not think the Minister will deny that. The Minister and the Minister for Finance have gone out of their way to neglect this industry.  They tell us that it should be met by private enterprise. Why should the people of Cobh or Cork do so much for these people who will go away by train to Dublin or the West of Ireland as soon as the customs are cleared, as that is the only delay they have in Cobh?  This is a great national industry bringing in much-needed dollars and I think it is the duty of the Government to foster it in every way they can.  It is their duty to treat Cobh as a national port and to deal fairly with it and with the Cork Harbour Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Cork Harbour Commissioners went out of their way to facilitate this industry.  They provided a tender when there were no private people to carry on the tender business that <Col N="2509" /> existed before the war.  They spent well over £60,000 to ensure that the liners would be accommodated and the passengers landed.  Surely the Government are as much entitled to help to carry on the industry in Cobh as in Rineanna.  I would appeal to the Minister to change his outlook and look on the question of Cobh as a national one.  I hope that, with the Minister for Finance, he will do his best to finance a scheme that will make it a fitting place to receive the thousands of tourists who come in there with their dollars.</P>

      <P>I will not delay the House very long.  Every subject that could be discussed has been discussed. I wish to join with those members of the House who have extended congratulations to the Minister in his efforts to improve the position here during his term of office.  He has striven hard, and in many cases he has been misrepresented.  I earnestly hope the misrepresentations will not deter him from going ahead with his proposals.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on bringing in the new Industrial Development Authority.  I believe it will do great work.  Deputy Derrig criticised it yesterday and said it would be a delaying committee and would not serve any useful purpose.  I differ entirely with him, as I think it will speed up matters and that the public with money to invest will get advice and encouragement and quick decisions from this authority.  As a result, it will do very valuable work.  Instead of industrialists sending to some anonymous individual in the Department of Finance or some other Department who answers letters but puts them off for some weeks, they will have an opportunity of approaching this authority, which, I earnestly hope, will give them quick decisions, resulting in the provision of new industries with decent employment and good wages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unemployment has been mentioned by every Deputy who has spoken.  I remember, exactly this time ten years, in 1939, Deputy de Valera saying that the most important problem to which the Government must lend its attention <Col N="2510" /> was the ending of unemployment.  That was said from the very seat the Minister is in now and those words were used by Deputy de Valera, who was then Taoiseach.  The problem of unemployment was as great then as it is now.  Since that statement was made by Deputy de Valera, 500,000 of our people have emigrated.  All during the years of the war, for seven years from 1939, tens of thousands of our good Irish men and women left our country, to find employment in other lands. They had not to go to America: they went to England.  The Minister must recognise now that his responsibility to those people is far greater than that of the Minister who preceded him.  The previous Minister could say that if he could give employment at home he would do all he could in that way, but he was very fortunate in his Department&mdash;unfortunately for the country&mdash; that they had England to go to. Emigration was the relief scheme produced in the past for the unemployed &mdash;industrial work in England, suffering hardships and the risks the English took during the bombing period.  Our present Minister will not have England for the Irish people to travel to.  Maybe that is just as well.  I am glad, as I believe that he and his Department and the Dáil will put greater effort into trying to provide work for our men at home.  They know that there is no room in America for our people and no room in England now either, and that a number of them are coming back here, so it will depend on the Minister and his Government to see they get a decent living in their own country.  I hope the Minister will not overlook the fact that these thousands of our unemployed are depending now entirely on employment in Ireland and not on the ship to take them to England.</P>
    <P>The question of emigration is being brought up everywhere we go.  It was very high in 1945 and was much talked of then.  I remember that one of the Fianna Fáil cumainn, in Rathmines&mdash; it had to be Rathmines&mdash;passed a resolution stating that conscription was the alternative.  I hope the present Minister will not allow that to happen. I would rather see a man taking the ship to go out than that he should be told he was going to be conscripted, <Col N="2511" /> as was put forward by the Rathmines Fianna Fáil Club in the year 1945.  Men opposite are thrashing out the problem of emigration now and attacking the present Government because our young men who are unemployed may have to go away.  They forget that in 1945, when things were supposed to be pretty good, one of their own cumainn, to try and stop emigration, said that conscription was the only remedy.  I hope conscription will never come in this country, that it is not to be the outlook for parents of boys who are leaving schools or the universities, that this country will have nothing for them but conscription. Please God, that day will never come.  If they want to join our forces voluntarily, let then do so, but it must be done voluntarily.</P>

      <P>I have finished with that point now, but it is worth while reminding Deputies of the fact.  I ask the Minister to do something in connection with ready, remunerative, worth-while employment for our workers&mdash;these are the words used when circulars come to the corporation and the municipalities asking them to suggest some worth-while schemes. There are many of them, and I could suggest where the Minister could put on a few thousand men in the next couple of weeks&mdash;and, please God, he will make the recommendation.  The building of bridges throughout Ireland is one such thing.  There is a bridge well known to Waterford and Cork Deputies, the bridge at Youghal, which is a danger to the tourist traffic and to anyone who uses it.  It is a long <Col N="2512" /> bridge and a costly job.  You could put 1,000 men on such bridge work, with the aid of the Bill the Minister for Local Government was dealing with yesterday and the discussion of which will be resumed to-day.  Without any Bill, one could put 1,000 men on this type of employment.</P>

      <P>I conclude by saying he would get the thanks of the people of Cork, Youghal and Waterford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Something will have to be done about the excessive dumping of goods into this country.  I realise that the Minister is doing everything possible to keep the cost of living at a reasonable level, and, in that respect, he has a difficult job, but, at the same time, he must not allow excessive dumping of cheap-quality inferior goods, which leads to unemployment in our own industries. Other Deputies have drawn attention to the dumping of certain types of tweeds and cloths which may bring about unemployment here.  It is true that a certain quantity of tweeds and cloths is coming in here, outside the allocation fixed by the Minister's Department, and I have reason to believe that the confectionery industry also is becoming a little alarmed <Col N="2513" /> about the situation.  I suggest that something be done to encourage our confectioners to produce more and there should be a definite limitation on the amount of foreign confectionery allowed in.  These people are paying a tax on it, I agree, but they have machinery which our confectioners have not got and there is an excessive quantity coming in.</P>
    <P>Two Labour Deputies and some others very properly referred to ship building and ship repairing in Dublin and I should like the Minister to take a special interest in this industry.  We hear talk at regular intervals about ship building and ship repairing in Dublin.  Some 30 years ago, when I was a member of the Dublin Port and Docks Board, I heard it talked about, but unfortunately our men drifted to Scotland and other parts of this country where ship building is carried on.  When ships were being built for another board of which I was a member, the Irish Lights Commissioners, we found that the English yards' tenders were slightly lower than the tenders submitted by our yards, and I ask the Minister to see to it that the lowest tender is not necessarily to be accepted, if the difference between it and Irish tenders represents the freight on coal and steel imported into this country.</P>
    <P>In the matter of ship building and ship repairing and manufactured goods generally, our industrialists have to bring in coal and the necessary raw materials, and I suggest that some special privilege be given to the Irish industrialists in this respect, that allowance be made for the cost of bringing in coal, steel and necessary machinery.  Our industrialists sometimes do not get full credit for the fact that they are competing with a country which has coal and steel at its back-door, so to speak, and have to face high freights, with the result that they may lose contracts which could be secured if that concession were granted.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies referred to the tourist traffic and I urge that something be done to encourage tourists and to avoid giving them a bad impression of the country, when either coming or leaving.  The Minister must <Col N="2514" /> know that there is no toilet accommodation, no cloakrooms or waiting rooms at the North Wall, and I have seen a queue of 200 or 300 yards standing on the quays in the rain.  Decent shelters and cloakroom accommodation should be provided, so that these people will not go away with a bad impression.  The same applies to Dún Laoghaire, where I have seen queues a couple of hundred yards long and where there is no toilet or cloakroom accommodation either.</P>
    <P>It is up to the Minister to see that our tourists are treated properly, and, in the matter of people having to stand for hours outside the offices of the various shipping companies awaiting the issue of travel tickets, I suggest that there should be an improved system of issuing these tickets. Finally, I hope the Minister will do something quickly for the unemployed, not alone of the City of Dublin but of the country generally.  He will receive the grateful thanks of all Parties if he does so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesKilroy" hpid="Mr. Kilroy Mr. Kilroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kilroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to impress on the Minister the seriousness of the emigration problem in my part of the country. There is scarcely a man or woman from the age of 16 to 40 years who has not gone away to America or England, and, if this state of affairs continues, I do not know what the situation will be in a few years' time.  I can see no solution of the problem in that area except the setting up of some industries there.  The cessation of turf production some couple of years ago contributed in great measure to that emigration.  It gave considerable employment while it was in existence, but now the people have no option but to clear off to England.  Last year there was only a few weeks' work for about ten men out of every 100, and it is one of the poorest areas in Ireland.  One solution of the problem would be the establishment of turf-generating stations in the area.  That project was in contemplation by the late Government and, as a matter of fact, I put the proposal before them.  Plans were drawn up, and, if these were put into operation in North Mayo, it would be one solution of the emigration problem there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesKilroy" hpid="Mr. Kilroy Mr. Kilroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kilroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the Minister now that such a plant would be of benefit to that part of the country.  The men, who are the best workers in the world, would be available in hundreds if they were sure of constant employment, and there is any amount of material suitable for the generation of electricity there.  It is the best bog-land in Ireland and there are two or three good rivers available.  I can think of no solution of the problem as good as that.  In that area, you have all of Achill, Erris, and Tirawley.  The Electricity Supply Board has not supplied electricity to any part of that area and if this generating station were set up, it would be a great benefit to these backward areas.  If every house in that area were provided with electricity, the generating plant would pay for itself in a few years and there would then be an opportunity, which does not exist now, of setting up industries.  I do not see any hope for the people of that area, except something of that description, and I ask the Minister to consider it.  It would provide a means of solving the unemployment difficulties that exist in the area.  Hand-won turf could also be used, together with machine-won turf, for supplying the generating station, and, in the backward areas far removed from the machines, the turf could be cut and dried by hand, rather than go to the trouble of drafting the people into the machine-won turf area.  There would also be a chance of reclaiming the bog later and a lot of afforestation could be carried out on it.</P>

      <P>That is a matter for a different Minister.  It was discussed on a previous Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesKilroy" hpid="Mr. Kilroy Mr. Kilroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kilroy</NameTxt>
      <P>The pier at Pickle Point, near Belmullet, was dismantled a few years ago and the disappearance of the facilities is a big handicap to the town of Belmullet and the district around <Col N="2516" /> Erris.  I suggest that the Government should arrange for the dredging of the channel from Pickle Point Pier to Belmullet Quay.  It would not cost very much, and, if the channel were dredged, it would not fill up for another 50 years at least.  It is 75 years or so since it was dredged and if it were dredged now it would not fill up for 50 years.  This work would enable boats to come into the pier, which is not possible at the moment.  We live 40 miles from a railway station, and the Minister will understand that it is very difficult to carry merchandise over the roads in that area.  It is a bog area and the roads are bad.  It is very difficult to keep the roads in repair. If the work that I have suggested were carried out, a big area would be served with cheaper transport.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to consider the points that I have put to him. They are things that need to be carried out and I hope the Minister will see to it that they are carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Much of the discussion on this Estimate has centred around the very important questions of increased production and employment. In this country, as in every other country, responsible people have been urging the necessity for increased production to secure the speediest possible recovery to the situation which existed pre-war, when there was, comparatively speaking, an adequate supply of goods available.  I have felt that the approaches to this problem in this country have not altogether been helpful and have not been designed to secure the best results.  I have no doubt that statements made by various leading personalities on this question of production are made in good faith and with the best intentions but, personally, I feel this problem needs much closer examination and greater consideration than it seems to be getting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of turf, for instance, a statement was made by the Department of Industry and Commerce that it is impossible in certain areas to secure sufficient men to operate turf schemes and, on the other hand, we know that <Col N="2517" /> there still exists a very considerable unemployment problem.  Nobody seems to be able to answer the question why, when work is available on bogs, men are not inclined to take it.  This whole problem is bound up with the fundamental question of the system of working of Bord na Móna, particularly the question of wages and working conditions in that organisation.  It is not easy in the best of circumstances to popularise amongst workers the idea of hostel life because everybody knows that it is not the most ideal form of existence but the history of this particular form of organisation of production under Bord na Móna during the years of the previous Administration was a bad history, one which left an impression on the minds of workers who were employed at one time or another with Bord na Móna which remains to a great extent unfavourable. It is true that since the advent of trade union organisation amongst turf workers, conditions in the turf camps and wages have improved.  The basic reason why workers cannot be secured in sufficient number for turf schemes is that neither wages nor conditions have improved sufficiently.  In order to secure production and to obtain the maximum number of men to make turf schemes effective and to develop them to the fullest extent, employment with Bord na Móna must be made an attractive proposition to the ordinary workers.</P>
    <P>The time has passed when men will willingly accept every and any wage or every and any condition purely for the joy of exercising their muscles.  I do not subscribe at all to the idea that there is any appreciable number of people in this country who do not want to work, at least, amongst the working classes.  The average healthy person, especially the average Irishman, wants to work and the average Irishman is renowned throughout the globe for his ability to work and his desire to exceed the ability of men of other nations when it comes to manual labour.</P>
    <P>The suggestion that there is a section of Irishmen, in any appreciable number, who just do not want to work but who want to get money for nothing is, I believe, totally unfounded.  That may <Col N="2518" /> be so in the case of a relatively small fraction of the population&mdash;people who, because of long years of unemployment, have fallen into a rut and these people are to be found more in the large cities and towns than in the rural areas&mdash;but, by and large, I would say that 99 per cent., and more, perhaps, of the working class are willing and anxious to work.  They want to work and to help production provided they get a decent return for the labour they put into that job.  When we are talking about people who have no love for work it should be realised that a far greater number of people who have no love for work are to be found in the ranks of the class outside the working class.  I refer to the people who live by the exploitation of the workers.  They are the real drones.  Those among the working class who find themselves mentally or physically unfitted or unable to work are no more than casualties of the economic struggle.  But the other class to which I refer&mdash;the people who have lived their lives in luxury and idleness &mdash;these are the real drones of society and not the other much-abused and, I believe, unfortunate section of our people for whom so little can be done.</P>
    <P>Then again there are very many thousands who, as has been said, are genuinely unemployed and anxious to work.  In that connection I should like to explain and put forward the point of view of the average worker in regard to certain schemes of employment which are offered.  I have stated that the history of Bord na Móna has not been a happy one.  It is not too long ago at all since thousands of Bord na Móna workers were forced to undergo very severe privations and, in fact, near-starvation in their effort to secure the right to organise and protect themselves in a trade union and to protect their fellow-members from being dismissed unjustly.  That situation is past but even if it has passed the history remains.</P>
    <P>The idea is in the mind of many workers that employment with Bord na Móna at the present time is, as I have said before in this House, the last refuge of the damned.  There is only one way of disabusing their minds <Col N="2519" /> of that impression and that is by creating and establishing for workers employed upon these turf schemes conditions which will be attractive and wages which will be exemplary.  I understand that at the present time relatively large numbers are going into employment in certain sections of the Bord na Móna organisation, but, even so, we do not seem to have in that particular industry adequate organisation to receive them.  I have heard complaints that in some cases as many as 44 men were put into one billet and that men have been handed blankets which were damp.  That sort of thing is bound to create a bad impression on young men coming to work there.  I think that, generally speaking, the whole organisation of Bord na Móna needs to be reviewed.  I believe that turf production is the one great roadway upon which this nation can march to secure to a large degree&mdash;not to a total degree but to a large degree&mdash;a solution of the unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made in this House of the stoppage of hand-won turf production.  Of course, everybody knows now, despite all the shouting and ranting that went on last year about it, that the production of turf by hand on the scale and in the manner in which it was carried out during the years of the war was purely an emergency measure and one which could not be regarded as part and parcel of an up-to-date and modern economy for this country.  The men who were disemployed as a result of the stoppage of that particular form of production would be the first to admit, and were the first to admit, that it was purely something that was brought about by the exigencies of the war situation. But I feel that we are not moving far enough nor fast enough in the direction of absorbing those who were disemployed by the stoppage of that particular form of production.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is sufficient that the White Paper of 1946 should be the bible of Bord na Móna at the present time.  We should go much further than that.  This Government should urge Bord na Móna to plan for the day when <Col N="2520" /> we will have mechanised turf production on a scale sufficient to meet all the needs of the nation.  I think that it can be said that, so far as turf is concerned, and particularly briquettes, there is under-production at the present time.  I am a member of a local authority in this city.  When that authority sought to get sufficient supplies of briquettes from Bord na Móna for the maintenance of a very large institution they found that Bord na Móna could not supply them in the quantity required.  That indicates to me at any rate that there is a great deal of leeway to be made up if we are going to meet even the voluntary demand the home market will provide for that particular type of fuel.</P>
    <P>Added to that, I believe that there is a very good case for some element of restriction in so far as the use of coal is concerned.  I think that in the turf areas, and the turf areas generally have extended considerably since the war, there should be a regulation making it incumbent upon certain sections of the population&mdash;and particularly upon local authorities, or institutions or factories or industries&mdash;to utilise a certain amount of turf.  Whatever the amount might be would be a matter for the Department to decide, but I think it should be a reasonable proportion of their total fuel consumption. Machine-produced turf, as distinct from the hand-won turf we had during the war years, is a very excellent form of fuel.  I believe it can compare favourably, on the economic side, with coal. However, there is in the public mind a predisposition against the use of turf. That predisposition has been brought on by reason of the fact that the public in the large towns and cities were compelled, during the years of shortage, to use for fuel stuff which was not really turf at all.</P>
    <P>I was reading the Dáil Debates the other day and I noticed that, even though Deputy Lemass tried to capitalise on the stoppage of the hand-won turf scheme last year, he indicated that during his journeyings through the country he had interviewed in Edenderry a number of hand-won turf producers who were complaining of their lot.  He had told them that they <Col N="2521" /> themselves were partly to blame, because, in many cases, the turf which came into the city was hosed by people outside for the purpose of increasing the weight.  That was undoubtedly done, as everybody knows, not in every case, but certainly in very many cases. It was a very despicable form of activity for any merchant to engage in. I have no doubt that the Tánaiste, when he made his speech some time ago referring to the profits made by people who should be behind bars, had some of these gentlemen in mind, and even on Deputy Lemass's statement these people would stand convicted,</P>
    <P>There must be an outlay in certain areas of the country for hand-won turf. I understand that before the war there was a very considerable volume of hand-won turf produced and utilised in certain areas.  Surely that market is still there for something like 3,500,000 to 4,000,000 tons.  I think it is incumbent on the Department to promote, as far as they can, a new market for machine-produced turf.  I understand that Bord na Móna are having certain difficulties in the matter of the provision of turf to organisations such as the Electricity Supply Board.  I have been informed that the maximum price for turf paid by the Electricity Supply Board to Bord na Móna is in the neighbourhood of 38/- per ton.  If that is so, in my view, it affords very little opportunity for progress for Bord na Móna.  There should be some consideration, some reciprocity and some realisation of the importance of the interdependence of these industries amongst themselves. There should not be striving for the lowest possible costs, no matter what it may cost the nation, amongst industries such as these, which are, in effect, nationalised.</P>
    <P>I also ask the Minister to give consideration to the very important question which has been mentioned during the debate of workers being given a share in management.  In an address which he delivered at a manufacturer's dinner the Taoiseach said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Management must be induced to attract the interest and attention of trained and educated employees to the problem.  Responsibility for industry <Col N="2522" /> should extend beyond the managerial class to the workers.  It has been found in England and elsewhere throughout the world, where a liberal and progressive view is taken of the rights of workers, that where workers are given a share in the responsibility of management and where that responsibility is added to by their being given a share in the profits which accrue from efficient management, efficiency will follow and greater production will follow.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If the Government are really anxious, as I believe they are, to secure a more enlightened relationship between management and workers, I suggest that they should give a lead in this particular matter.  That can easily be done by providing for worker's representation upon Bord na Móna or the Electricity Supply Board, in the same way as was suggested by Sir James Milne that labour should be represented on the authority which will control the new nationalised transport industry when that is brought about.</P>
    <P>There is an unanswerable case for such a step being taken.  The whole world is moving in that direction with the advancement of progressive and liberal ideas.  Workers are no longer relegated and will no longer allow themselves to be relegated into the position of being merely cogs in a machine, put upon earth, as is suggested in some cases, purely for the purpose of being exploited to build up profits for others.  There is now a general realisation of the right of workers to a share in the wealth they produce.  We in this country, in common with other nations with a forward, progressive outlook, should translate our views into action and one of the first steps in that direction would be to provide for workers' representation on these industries over which we have direct control.</P>
    <P>It is good to see that under the aegis of the Electricity Supply Board rural electrification is being pushed ahead.  In my constituency, which is on the fringe of the City of Dublin, there are very many hundreds of farmers and cottagers who are anxious to avail of this scheme.  I urge the Minister to see that the scheme is <Col N="2523" /> gone on with, in County Dublin at any rate, at even greater speed than has been the case in the past.  There is one aspect of it to which I would ask him to give his attention and that is the cost to the consumer.  It has been found in the rural areas in County Dublin, that when the electricity is installed in farmers' places or cottages the cost per unit is almost 100 per cent. higher than the cost in this city.  That is a very serious matter for the workers of County Dublin.  The workers in the rural areas can be said to be receiving roughly 50 per cent. of the wages paid to workers in this city.  Rural labourers in County Dublin receive a wage of from £3 to £3 10s. per week, while labourers in Dublin City are paid nearly twice that, if you are to take building trade employees as typical labourers.  We have the situation that the rural labourer, if he wants to benefit under the rural electrification scheme, is required to pay twice the amount per unit paid by the labourer in the city.  That is something which will have to be examined, because it shows an unbalanced economy; because it shows that the person who is least able to meet the expenditure is being imposed upon to a greater degree than anybody else.  I would ask the Minister to look into that particular matter with a view to seeing what can be done.</P>
    <P>Much has been said during the debate of the protection of Irish industry.  We have in County Dublin some very excellent native industries.  I would say that in seeking protection&mdash;and I have on occasion supported, when necessary, the requests that were made to the Minister for protection for certain industries&mdash;it should be made a test, a condition and it should be made plain that no industry will be protected by this Government unless it fulfils certain prior conditions.  Those conditions should be, first of all, fair wages and fair treatment for the workers; secondly, under no circumstances should any industry producing any line of goods be allowed to charge a price for such goods which would not be within the scope of the average worker to meet.  Given these two conditions <Col N="2524" /> then the case for protection of Irish industry is an absolute one.  In my constituency it can be said that the industries which are protected and the industries which are keeping protection are examples of their kind in so far as the qualifications I have mentioned are concerned.  Nothing can be said in a derogatory fashion in regard to any of these qualifications so far as they are concerned.  However, I do not think that that can be said of every industry that exists in the country.  I would ask the Minister when such matters come up for his consideration that he should look into and examine these particular aspects that I have mentioned.  I would particularly stress the importance of ensuring that no encouragement will be given to the type of employer or employers who are seeking to enrich themselves at the cost of the ordinary worker without whom no industry could exist.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ben Maguire, in the course of his speech, referred to the drift from the rural areas to the cities and the drift from this country to the big industrial centres across the water. That is, perhaps, one of the greatest problems that would face any Government in this country.  It can be said that the drift from the rural areas is basically an economic problem and it is true, undoubtedly, that if attractive employment is provided in rural areas, workers will not be inclined to leave. That is the fundamental reason why workers go in large masses, but there is something more to it than that.  In this respect I realise that the Minister may not have any particular function. As well as the need of provision for employment in rural areas there is a definite need for making rural life more attractive.  That is a matter I will refer to when the opportunity presents itself in another way.  Until such time as we have industry decentralised and spread as far as possible throughout the country and until such time as small industries are encouraged sufficiently in rural areas and, where necessary, started directly by the Government on a nationalised basis, we cannot hope to beat this problem of the drift from rural areas.</P>
    <P>It is undoubtedly beyond question <Col N="2525" /> that the City of Dublin at the present time is top-heavy with population.  All through the war years we had thousands of our youth, young men and young women, passing through the city on their way to England.  Some of them returned after a period and went no further than the City of Dublin. The housing situation was worsened and the population increased tremendously during those years so that at the present time, for a city of its size, its population is entirely out of proportion. It seems to me that that position is likely to continue unless we can develop, through the Department of Industry and Commerce, a scheme whereby young people living in rural areas will be encouraged to remain at home and educated in the advantages which rural life undoubtedly has over city life.  In many cases that particular knowledge does not come to those people until it is too late, until they find themselves very settled down, in many cases in slum tenements, and unable to rehabilitate themselves in the places of their origin.</P>
    <P>Again I would say that, basically, the question is an economic one, a question purely of wages and of working conditions for the people of rural Ireland.  It may be that Irish agriculture may develop sufficiently to relieve this problem somewhat, but I have the feeling that, with the increase of population, agriculture will not be sufficient to solve the problem in its entirety. We do need the promotion of rural industry and we need it very badly.  I do not think we have yet seen adequate appreciation of that need or adequate attempts by any Government, so far, on a sufficiently large scale to secure a solution of that problem.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister, also, if he can indicate to us when we may expect to have the findings of the Commission on Youth Unemployment, which is likewise a very important and a very serious matter.  The unemployment of youth, which is so widespread to-day and which has almost become a permanent feature, it would seem, of the social set-up in this country, is one of the most serious problems that can be found in the country.  It is the prelude to emigration.  The dissatisfaction <Col N="2526" /> which unemployment brings and the unhealthy mental conditions which it generates bring about a feeling of disregard for this country amongst the youth.  Unemployment amongst youth is bound to create a certain cynicism which eventually finds an outlet in their travelling out of the country altogether and in many cases never returning. It has been said by every Deputy&mdash;it cannot be said too often, because perhaps the oftener it is said the more chance there is of having something done about it&mdash;that it is undoubtedly true that we have to find means to stop the haemorrhage of emigration.</P>
    <P>I believe, and I am convinced, that the members of the Opposition know in their hearts that they should be the last to talk about emigration or to deride the Government or try to impose the responsibility on this Government for emigration.  Emigration has been a feature of Irish life ever since the Famine year.  Year after year it has gone on.  In some periods it has come in cycles and has been heavier than in previous periods, but it has been a permanent feature. We have got to find an answer and a solution to it, and the answer and the solution to emigration is primarily, I believe, the provision of work at attractive wages and under attractive conditions at home.  If we are to do that, and if we are to provide that employment&mdash;and we can do it if there is a determination to do it&mdash;we can only do it in one way, and that is by securing the redistribution of the wealth of the country in a Christian manner so as to ensure that we will not have on the one hand extreme poverty and on the other hand extreme riches.  It may be said that the only answer to that is taxation.  If we can secure that and stop emigration by taxation, then I am all for it.</P>

    <P>Having listened to Deputy Dunne on the question of emigration and also on the question of unemployment, I must come to the conclusion that the ideas of those now sitting on the Government side about these things have changed entirely since they went to that side of the House.  Deputy Dunne has stated that he regards emigration as a normal feature of Irish life, but Deputy Dunne, and the other Deputies who sit beside him, did not so regard it in the last general election, and before that, when they gave us all to understand that they had a ready remedy for the evils of emigration and unemployment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2528" /> It is very gratifying to know from the speech and from the figures given to us by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that industrial production here is in the ascendant.  It is now an established fact that Irish industries can be fostered here, and that goods can be turned out here just as well as they can in any other country in the world.  The position whereby employment is provided for 184,000 people in industries in this country did not come about overnight, nor did it come about in one year.  It has been the direct result of the careful planning and fostering of those industries by the Fianna Fáil Government over a number of years.  There is no doubt about that. It is also very satisfactory to know that many of the people who were inclined to condemn these Irish industries have now come to regard them as a normal growth in this country.  I think that a great deal of credit is due to these people, to those industrialists who put their capital into these industries when there were so many opportunities for the investment of it elsewhere. I would think that those Irish industrialists deserve better of politicians here than to be branded as rogues and profiteers, as they were by the Minister for Social Welfare in the speech that he made at Naas.</P>

The Minister knew that before the inquiry was held; everybody here knew it was a question of finance.  As regards Córas Iompair Éireann, I will say that there is great credit due to those who manage it for the way in which they carried on during the emergency.

      <P>I am quite prepared to do so.  Deputy Dunne referred to turf and it is only natural that I and Deputies like me who live in the turf areas are very interested in this matter.  I am very glad to know that the Government are continuing the development of the machine-won turf industry and that they at least have become turf-minded. While I welcome the idea of developing machine-won turf, I would at the same time advise the Government to investigate further the possibility of developing hand-won turf. One would imagine by the way Deputy Dunne and other Deputies spoke that there is no hope at all for the development of hand-won turf.  I do not subscribe to that at all.  I think a lot can be done to find a market for hand-won turf.  I remember last year the Minister for Local Government intimated that he was giving instructions to local authorities all over the country to see to it that turf should be used in public institutions as much as possible.  I do not know if the local authorities carried out the Minister's recommendation&mdash;I am afraid that in some cases they did not.</P>
      <P>It would be well if this Government would take that matter up again with the local authorities, because I consider it a shame to see coal being burned in public institutions adjacent to bogs where turf could very well be used instead.  The purchase of coal is a great drain on this country.  Any amount of money is going out for the purchase of that expensive fuel.  If we could lessen the consumption of coal here we would be doing a good day's work for the country; we would keep the money at home and we would find a market for those people who would engage actively in the hand-won turf industry if they thought they would find such a market.  I ask the Minister to consider the hand-won turf industry as opposed to machine-won turf, because I think there are possibilities in hand-won turf if they were properly explored.  Every bog in this country is in my opinion a potential industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to refer to the dredging of Dingle Harbour.  Representations <Col N="2533" /> have been made to the Minister and to his Department and also to the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries in connection with the dredging of Dingle Harbour.  The Dingle fishermen find it very hard to take out their boats at times owing to the silting that has taken place in the harbour and I hope the Minister, when he has time, will investigate this matter because it is of vital importance for the Dingle fishermen to have the siltage removed.</P>
    <P>I should also like to mention the drawing of sand from the Ballybunion foreshore.</P>

      <P>There are some comments I would like to make in relation to this Estimate.  As a country Deputy I welcome the Minister's numerous statements evidencing his desire to see industries fostered in rural Ireland.  I was interested in the remarks made by Deputy Dunne with regard to what he described as the &ldquo;top heavy&rdquo; condition of Dublin City <i>vis-a-vis</i> the rest of the country.  We all appreciate the truth of his remarks. Many people in the last 16 or 17 years have been conscious of the fact that with a dwindling population the only part of the country which shows a consistent increase in population has been the City of Dublin, and perhaps one or two other cities as well.  That trend is a very unhealthy one so far as the country is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are various things which might be done to cope with that trend and there are various steps which might be considered but the most practicable <Col N="2534" /> step that can be taken is to make employment available to young people in the country so that they will not seek employment in Dublin or, indeed, cross-Channel.  I welcome the Minister's statement with regard to that matter.  He is a country Deputy and it is a welcome change to find in charge of Industry and Commerce a man representing the rural areas and who was born and bred there.  I think that from the present Minister will come the necessary drive to ensure that good sound industries are fostered in the rural areas.</P>
    <P>In that connection, I welcome the establishment of the Industrial Development Authority.  I think it is important that at the first meeting of that authority the Minister should have stated specifically his view of one of its most important functions; that is, the development of industries in rural Ireland.  The establishment of that authority is a step in the right direction. I do not think Deputy Kissane could have been serious when he stated &mdash;this may presumably be taken as the Fianna Fáil view, though it is difficult to find the Fianna Fáil view in anything&mdash;that this development authority should be scrapped.  I do not think he could have been serious in that, because if that is his considered opinion, I do not believe that he will be very welcome in his own constituency when he sees the results of some of the activities of this authority once it gets under way.  The purpose of this authority is not merely to advise the Minister on industrial development, but to survey the industrial needs of the country and to advise him, so far as lies in his power, to foster industries away from the city. I hope that one of the first matters considered by this authority will be the establishment of a linen industry.  I know that there are considerable difficulties to be surmounted if such an industry is to be established.  I hope, however, that that will be one of the enterprises considered by this authority as one of its principal aims in justification of its existence.  We have talked a good deal about Partition. One very effective way of ending Partition would be the establishment of a linen industry which <Col N="2535" /> would make those supported by such an industry in the North at present anxious to join with us here.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister referred to the establishment of a wool-combing industry in his opening statement.  We have heard many rumours about such an industry.  The need for such an industry is great and the possibility of success is high.  With the assistance of the Minister it should be possible to establish such an industry. Perhaps when he is concluding he will give us some information as to the likelihood of such an industry coming into operation here.  May I express the hope that that industry will be established away from the City of Dublin?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardButler" hpid="Mr. Butler Mr. Butler">

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In that regard I want to advocate the needs of my own constituency.  We have in Tullamore a very important industry&mdash;Salts (Ireland) Limited&mdash;and a wool-combing industry would be an important adjunct to that.  The employment potential would be high and its success would be assured.  It would encourage our people to remain in the country by giving them some assurance of a decent existence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certain Fianna Fáil Deputies, during the course of this debate, blandly stated that they welcomed the conversion of the Minister to industrial development. I do not propose to chase that particular hare, but I would like to remind Fianna Fáil Deputies who hold that particular view that many of those industries which saw us safely through the emergency were commenced long before the country ever heard of Fianna Fáil.  The industry which provides us with light and power was established despite the determined efforts of members of the Fianna Fáil opposition at that time. The sugar industry was commenced despite the propaganda directed at it by both Deputy Lemass and Deputy MacEntee who described it and the Shannon scheme as &ldquo;white elephants.&rdquo; When we hear that type of patronising nonsense coming from Fianna Fáil we <Col N="2536" /> are tempted to rake over the cinders of the past and remind them of what they said on various occasions when they were on the Opposition Benches before.  The Fine Gael attitude in regard to industry has always been a very clear and definite one.  We have always stood for industrial development. We have always believed, as a Party that derived from Sinn Féin, that we must develop our own resources by our own efforts and under the care and protection of a native Government. Believing that, our policy nevertheless rested on three essential conditions which must be observed in relation to any industry fostered or protected in this country.  These conditions, quite incidentally, have been mentioned already in this debate by Deputy Dunne.</P>
    <P>We want to see, in the first place, that any industry established here produces a good article.  That is a very necessary demand and it is not in any way an impossible demand.  We have also stipulated that any industry protected by an Irish Government, in addition to producing a good article, must sell that article at a fair price to the Irish consumer.  I do not think that that is in any way an impossible condition, but it is one that was overlooked from time to time in the early days of Fianna Fáil when, in the interests of giving tariffs to certain sections and certain people here, they left the unfortunate poor people of this country to pay the price.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardButler" hpid="Mr. Butler Mr. Butler">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Employment was of very little good if they had to pay four or five times what they formerly paid for that particular article. That condition is not impossible of attainment in this country.  I know many potential <i>entrepreneurs</i> in this country who could, provided they are given a chance of starting industries here, produce as good an article as any foreign industrialist and sell it at least as cheaply in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardButler" hpid="Mr. Butler Mr. Butler">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>Perfectly true.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>We, in Fine Gael, do lay down that articles produced here under the protection of the Government must be sold at a fair price to the consumer.  We do agree, as I think many Deputies will appreciate, that a fair price for an Irish article need not necessarily be a price lower than or equal to the price of the imported article.  In many cases industries started here will for a period find it necessary to charge a price slightly more than the cost of the imported article but the Government should insist that any industry established here should be able to assure the Government that after the development stage has been passed&mdash;be it a period of three, four or five years or whatever it may be&mdash;it will eventually be able to produce a good article at a fair price to the consumer here.  I think that is a very necessary and fair stipulation to lay down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third condition that we put forward is that the conditions of labour in industries protected should be fair and reasonable.  I do not think that anybody can suggest that that condition is one which should not be insisted upon by the Government or by any responsible political Party because it is important to remember that the mere fact of giving employment it not of itself a justification for the establishment of an industry here.  Any potential industrialist who thinks that merely by giving 60 or 70 jobs under sweated labour conditions he should get a medal from the State and be surrounded by a halo for the rest of his life, has another &ldquo;think&rdquo; coming.  That was a mentality that was very common in England at the beginning of the industrial revolution there.  We do not want that mentality in this country.  Any person who gets protection from the State here towards fostering an industry, while he does himself fulfil a service in playing a part in the industrial development of the country, nevertheless enters on that enterprise because he is going to make money out of it. If he is not going to make money out of it he is not going to put his capital into it and if he expects to get money from the industry by reason of State protection, then the least the State <Col N="2538" /> must demand from him is that the conditions under which he employs labour are at least fair and such as any Christian State would approve of.  These are the conditions our Party have insisted upon in relation to industrial development.  Let no member of the Party opposite be under any misapprehension as to what our policy was and what our policy is.  There was never any question of our Party or any member of it being in any way opposed to the industrial development of the country.</P>

      <P>When I mention our Party, I mean, naturally, the Minister against whom this particular charge has been made.  There again was the charge made by Deputies opposite&mdash;apparently made in the belief that if you repeat a thing often enough somebody will be bound to believe it&mdash;that there was doubt and uncertainty in industrial circles as to the Minister's attitude towards industry.  I think that has already been dealt with. If anything has been made clear in the last 14 or 15 months by the Minister, it is that his aim is to encourage in every way possible the establishment of proper industries here and to encourage Irish industries generally.  I think that I need say no more about that particular aspect of the contributions from the Opposition Benches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kissane and others have dealt with the question of emigration. I should like to say, speaking from my own point of view and I know also from the point of view of many other Deputies supporting the Government, that there is none of us who is in any way complacent about the question of emigration.  No Deputy or no Party supporting the Government in any way forgets the gravity of the problem of emigration and the urgent necessity for dealing with it and, if possible, solving it.  But we resent that from the ranks of the Party opposite, not only here in this House but throughout the country, should come the fable that emigration commenced in February, 1948, in Ireland. That is the fable they are <Col N="2539" /> spinning round the country and endeavouring to make people believe.</P>
    <P>We know, and I think the country appreciates, that emigration was left to the present Government as a direct legacy from Fianna Fáil.  When Fianna Fáil took office there was no emigration in this country, none whatsoever. In the year 1932 more people came into this country than left it, and for the first time in Irish history a native Government&mdash;any Government&mdash;was given, as far as emigration is concerned, a clean bill of health.  It only took Fianna Fáil 16 years to undo that and one of their most notable achievements was to give us emigration.  We believe that we will hear less and less of emigration from members of the Party opposite.  I know that they speak with 67 different voices on every topic nowadays, but emigration is not something that we are going to forget. As I understand the policy of the Minister&mdash;and I know it is the view of Deputies here&mdash;we are committed to solving, or to making progress towards the solution of, the problem of emigration.  Undoubtedly there will be mistakes in the way it will be tackled and perhaps failures, but I think the country generally appreciates the goodwill of the Government towards the solution of that problem and appreciates also that it is not possible in a period of six months to undo the harm of 16 years.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House any longer, but I would like to congratulate the Minister on the progress he has made during the last 12 months.  Industrial production has increased.  I think it is due to the Minister to say that for the first time since 1938 as a result of his efforts a market has been found in England for Irish industrial goods.  As a result of his efforts and the efforts of the Government only 12 months ago, a completely new market has been given to Irish industrialists.  They have been given the opportunity of finding a profitable market for increased and increasing production.  That is something they did not have before the change of Government and that they would not have had if there had not <Col N="2540" /> been a change of Government.  I hope that industrialists and those people who, from time to time on their behalf throw their eyes up to Heaven and talk about doubt and uncertainty, will at least remember that.  I trust also that the Irish industrialist will be able to rise to the occasion and avail of the opportunity the Minister has given him. Progress has been made in increasing industrial production and I know that with the efforts of the Minister it will continue during the coming 12 months. I think the Minister deserves the praise of this House and the country for the considerable good work he has done during the last 12 months.</P>

      <P>Deputy Connolly is reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> of the 1st June as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Deputy Connolly said he noted with regret and dislike adverse references to the unemployed, and it seemed that there was a revival of the mentality which looked upon the unemployed as shirkers and which referred scathingly to their disinclination to work.</P>
      <P>It seemed that that mentality had been revived, whether to escape responsibility or because a solution of the problem could not be achieved by those who indulged in this type of remark, he did not know.  One might take comfort from the slight improvement in industrial output, but there was no room for complacency. There were portents in other parts of the world which showed us that we could not live in a watertight compartment.  The figure of 84,000 unemployed distributed over the area was, in itself, a warning of the gravity of the situation.  If the position worsened and if it led to marches on the Dáil or on Dublin in the coming winter, it would be of great concern to one section of the Government, at least&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that there will be no such thing as a march on Dublin, a march on the Dáil, but it is a very disturbing thing to find a responsible leader of labour envisaging the mere possibility.  We have been assured that the various groups that go to make up the present Government have a plan for the immediate <Col N="2541" /> employment of people in gainful industry but we find nevertheless that we have a register of 84,000 unemployed.</P>

      <P>I was disappointed when, with regard to the possibility of a linen industry, Deputy O'Higgins expressed the hope that that new industry will be located in the country.  I quite agree that the dispersal of industry throughout the country is extremely necessary and is very good policy, but Dublin has increased its population during the last 25 years to such an extent that it is a real tragedy when there is unemployment in this city.  Probably the hardship endured by an unemployed city person is much worse than the hardship endured by an unemployed country person.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardButler" hpid="Mr. Butler Mr. Butler">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but for this particular industry Dublin would be more suited than anywhere else.  Right in the south-west Dublin area there is ready at hand what might be the nucleus of a very fine linen industry. Of all industries I would welcome this one most, as we could reply in a very effective way to an injustice that was done to us all recently, if we had a flourishing linen industry established in this part of the country.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Connolly when he says it is not fair or right that workers should be criticised as slackers or that the unemployed be told, in a word, that they are so because they are unwilling to accept work.  No doubt there is a very small minority who are not willing to work for a fair wage or even for a good wage, but the very great majority are more than willing, they are extremely eager, to obtain work at even moderately fair conditions of payment and of treatment.  That is something I have always found.  The thing the average honest decent worker dreads most in all the world is unemployment. It is hardly fair to speak of these people as trying to avoid work, being unwilling to accept work at fair wages and decent conditions.  I do not really think that anyone ever put it with the intention of conveying that idea, but unfortunately that impression got around and has caused a great deal of resentment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a tendency recently to divert much of the criticism that was poured out for some years past on our industrialists towards the workers.  That is a great pity.  For some years we had the most scathing and unjust criticism poured on our industrialists, to such an extent that I am afraid the very name of Irish goods was damaged considerably. It will take a great deal of propaganda to win back the good name that was lost for Irish products by the extremely unjust propaganda carried on here for some years past.  It is true to say that there is doubt and hesitation in the minds of industrialists about investing capital in Irish industry.  If they are told one day that they are <Col N="2543" /> heartless profiteers, it is very little good if they are paid strong compliments at a social function the next day. When you have alternate praise and blame as a constant feature, it is certain to produce that doubt and hesitancy which is very apparent.  The only result of that kind of criticism is to make both employer and employee dissatisfied.</P>
    <P>It is tremendously necessary that our workers should get a fair wage and good conditions of employment.  I entirely agree with Deputy O'Higgins in that. People talk about the necessity for social services, for provision against old age and against want in old age. These are good provisions, but equally necessary is the provision of security in employment.  I have seen the result of strikes reflected in my own area in the school children.  There is nothing more terrible than widespread unemployment, and that is why I hold it is wrong to say our working-class people, employed or unemployed, are unwilling to accept work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardButler" hpid="Mr. Butler Mr. Butler">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very necessary that their conditions of work and general treatment should be good.  I think there have been great improvements over a number of years, but undoubtedly there have been terrible abuses in the capitalist system.  It is very likely that many of those abuses still hold and, if they persist, they will make our workers discontented, and these abuses will give a foothold to an even worse thing, Communism, in this country.  We must all unite in trying to prevent that. I think the workers should be given some share in the management and the profits of industrial concerns and some voice on the boards of these concerns. That is a personal opinion, and I give it because I am convinced that if they had these privileges, they would be <Col N="2544" /> much more contented and could do a good deal to prevent the unnecessary lock-outs which unfortunately occur in industry from time to time.  I think it should be a satisfactory thing all round.</P>
      <P>Some Deputy suggested that these people should form themselves into companies and establish industries themselves.  That is not a fair thing to ask them to do.  We all know that the raw materials on which practically all our industries depend are controlled outside this country, controlled by foreigners, and, if capitalists were in any way threatened by such a move, they would see to it that any industry or concern set on foot by workers would not have a snowball's chance in hell of survival.  They would see to it that raw materials were not made available to them and that probably even necessary machinery would not be made available to them.  Such an experiment as that could only be successful if it had a central State-controlled purchasing board for the purchase of raw materials and the distribution of raw materials in such a way that if any abuse arose it could be brought up here and dealt with in open Parliament. Then an experiment of that sort might possibly succeed.</P>
      <P>There is one other matter which I should like to clear up, arising out of the references by Deputy Dockrell to the central bus station.  Deputy Dockrell is a Deputy for whom I have very much admiration.  He is a sincere and truthful man, but I think he slipped up a little or his memory played him false with regard to that bus station.  The Deputy is reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> of 1st June as saying:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It should be pointed out that the corporation never approved of the site of the new Córas Iompair Éireann bus station.  A pistol was put at the heads of the Dublin Corporation. The Town Planning Committee of the corporation and the consultant were against it.  A different site had been suggested by the consultant in his report.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that a different site was suggested and even approved by the corporation, <Col N="2545" /> but the corporation members got the views of traffic authorities and other experts which led them to change their mind with regard to the station, its location and structure.  No member of the Dublin Corporation is aware of any pistol ever being put at his head.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I may quote the report that changed the views of many members of the corporation and made them decide on the present site.  It is very long and I do not wish to detain the House, but it is a communication from Patrick Abercrombie, M.A., F.R.I.B.A., P.P.T.P.I., planning consultant, which was submitted to the Dublin Corporation by a Committee of the whole House on 6th May, 1946.  He refers first to the original plans and then goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Since these proposals were made in the competition design, several new factors have come into operation. In the first place, there does not seem to be any prospect of the railway bridge being removed with practical limits of time.  Secondly, it has been decided that, for traffic purposes, it is essential to bring Amiens Street into the crescent on a curve in a contrary direction.  Thirdly, it has been decided that the first important building to be erected as part of this surround should be the bus terminal station,&mdash;a building of totally different function and character to that of offices or even warehouse blocks.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, these three factors change the position completely, and it is necessary to regard this first building for the bus station from a completely new angle.  It is a modern building required principally for traffic use, and also as a large office block to house the staff of the road transport system of Córas Iompair Éireann.  A large building, part of which will have to be 100 feet high, is, therefore, called for.  When I examined the designs in September, that were deposited for town planning permission, I came to the conclusion that the architect, Mr. Michael Scott, had solved this very difficult problem in a bold and satisfactory manner.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2546" /> He concludes as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To sum up, I think that this building, designed in the form of a letter &lsquo;L&rsquo; with the higher portion facing on to the new part of Amiens Street, the lower part towards the Custom House, with a courtyard in between the two wings, is the right solution for the treatment of a building for these purposes on this site. A very rough model has been made by Mr. Scott.  I have examined the effect of the building by means of this model, and, lofty though it will be, I think it will read with the rebuilding that will ultimately take place in the neighbourhood of Amiens Street Station, and will not seriously conflict with the silhouette of the Custom House, as seen from the Liffey.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The matter was considered by the council and the motion was carried at a meeting held on Monday, 7th October, 1946.</P>
    <P>A tremendous amount of hostile criticism has been levelled against this particular building.  I have heard it described as an ibex.</P>

In its present raw state I do not think it is very fair or reasonable to criticise it as it has been criticised.</P>

I think the present Government, if, by any miracle, they survive another year, will find it increasingly necessary to have a second station.  Probably it will be found that the advice to have a station at Wood Quay is very good, sound advice.</P>

      <P>Very true.  I do not <Col N="2548" /> approach this debate in any hostile or carping spirit.  Quite the opposite. I like fair criticism, and we would accomplish much more if criticism were fair and reasonable.  It pains me very much to think of the damage that has been done to our tourist trade by the shockingly unfair and unjust criticism that was carried on here for years.  It pains me to think of the damage done to the good name of Irish-produced articles by the unfair criticism that was carried on.  For that reason I would not dream of indulging in unfair and unjust criticism.  If I may express one hope, it is that when the Minister is replying he will not treat us to a facetious speech or to a species of music-hall entertainment.  I hope he will give a reasoned, fair and just answer to the points of criticism that have come, at least, from this side of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister can hardly complain because, in the main, this debate has been conducted in a fairly reasonable spirit, and Party spirit has not influenced the expression of opinion to any great extent on either side of the House.  Credit for that is due to the Minister in the first place for his introductory statement and to the ex-Minister for Industry and Commerce who opened the debate for the Opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the most satisfactory results of the change of Government is that never again will industrial development in this country be associated with one Party.  It is bad for industry generally that it should be tied up with the fortunes of one Party.  It is bad that the public should believe that industrialists as a class are associated entirely with one Party.  The events of the past year have shown that all Parties in this House are determined that the industrial arm shall be developed to the fullest extent and any force that arises to destroy the industrial arm will have to reckon with the united resistance of all sections of the community.  That is a satisfactory position and it is an advance as far as our national economic position is concerned.  One of the outstanding events of the past year was the institution by the Minister of a <Col N="2549" /> nation-wide drive to popularise Irish industrial products.  Whatever we may say about the advantages of protection by Governmental measures&mdash;by tariffs or by quotas&mdash;the best protection that industry can have is the goodwill and enthusiastic support of the entire population. I have said in this House before, and I think it is a fundamental fact which does not seem to be generally appreciated, that no force in human relationship is as strong as the force of class prejudice.  Industrialists are a small section of the community. I suppose it is natural that other people engaged in other occupations should feel a certain prejudice against them. I have encountered in towns and cities a fairly substantial prejudice against the farming community and, on the other hand, I know that both the farming community and the industrial community have a fairly deep prejudice against the legal profession.  Why that should be so I do not know but it is a fact that has to be faced, and it is a fact that, as far as industrial development is concerned, has got to be overcome.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy Dunne, in the course of a very well-reasoned speech, quite unconsciously, perhaps, acknowledged some of the class prejudice which is probably present in every human mind.  Speaking of the unemployed who are unwilling to accept employment, he said that they are only a very small section of the total number of unemployed and that they are, in the main, victims of circumstances.  He went on to say that the other section of the unemployed, the rich unemployed, who are unwilling to do useful work, are the real drones of society. He might have overcome a little class prejudice by suggesting that, perhaps, they also are the victims of their environment and of their upbringing. We have to realise that in every section of the community there are people who are able and willing to give of their best to the community and that all they want is a lead.  Amongst the vast army of unemployed there are tens of thousands of the best of our people. I think it is right and proper that nothing should be said which would <Col N="2550" /> indicate that the general working community, and that section of the community who are able to support themselves by their own efforts, regard the unemployed as criminals.  During the past few weeks references were made to the unwillingness of certain people who are on the register of unemployed to accept work that is offered to them.  If we are to make progress in this country in the matter of productive development it is essential that any citizen who receives unemployment assistance should be willing to accept work when it is offered to him.  But in that connection the conditions must be reasonably fair.</P>
    <P>If, for example, a man in the extreme south of the country is unemployed it is hardly fair and reasonable to offer him employment for a fortnight or three weeks in the west or in the north.  We must endeavour to look on matters of this kind in an impartial and reasonable way.  Having regard to the fact that in the industry under the Bord na Móna organisation there is a considerable amount of work available, it is essential that human conditions should be carefully considered.  If men employed in that organisation feel they have some grievances, as was suggested by Deputy Dunne, these grievances should be very carefully investigated. Matters apart altogether from wages are very important.  For instance, the type of hostels, the type of sleeping accommodation and the type of food are all matters of supreme importance and they are matters which are very often overlooked when an organisation or a public body is dealing with large numbers of men.</P>
    <P>I think that while much has been stated about the need for co-operation between the workers and the employers, and the sharing of profits, it is even more important that there should be close consultation between those in control of large industries and the workers.  In that way the ordinary little grievances, apart altogether from questions of wages or conditions of employment, would be thoroughly understood by those in control.  I have been speaking to some people who have worked in large industries in Great Britain.  They have told me that they were amazed at the thought and <Col N="2551" /> the consideration that was displayed by the managements of those industries for the welfare of the workers.  I am not trying to claim that everything on the other side is perfect because I do not believe that it is.  However, I would say that we could learn quite a lot from the best-managed industries on the other side.  That is an important consideration, having regard to the development of the turf industry&mdash;and I think that that is one of the industries which has a big future and which is capable of very wide expansion.  When men are herded together in temporary accommodation, such as in hostels, there is always a danger of a certain amount of injustice and there is always a certain tendency to agitate because men away from their homes for the first time are inclined to feel discontented.  Therefore, their ordinary human grievances should be considered.  Further, if we regard the turf industry as a permanent industry there will be need for Bord na Móna, either on its own initiative or in co-operation with the local authorities, to provide housing accommodation adjacent to their work for turf workers and their families.  That ought to be a matter of long-term planning and it should be looked into.</P>
    <P>I have a feeling that there is not a great future for the hand-won turf industry.  I think that, eventually, it must give way to mechanised turf production. The Minister should do everything possible to encourage the mechanisation of smaller bogs if Bord na Móna does not do so.  It may not be the type of work which Bord na Móna would undertake but it could be undertaken by other companies.  Turf production in the smaller bogs should be mechanised.  I think there is a future for that particular branch of enterprise and it ought to be pushed forward with all possible rapidity.  One of the weaknesses in the economy of this country is the fact that our sources of fuel and power are, to a certain extent, limited.  For that reason it is essential first, that we should develop existing resources to the fullest extent and, secondly, we should seek in every possible way to economise fuel.  When <Col N="2552" /> I say economise fuel, I mean that we should seek to ensure that in our industries and in our homes the most economic methods of using fuel are adopted.  I am not satisfied that we have yet discovered the best type of range for the utilisation of turf in the homes.  I believe there is room for further improvement in that direction and that we ought to have intensive research into that matter.  I am satisfied that, given the right type of range, turf properly saved and dried can be made as economic and efficient as any other type of fuel.</P>
    <P>In this connection I should like to remind the Minister that, as a result of the enormous improvement in the type of range provided for the utilisation of anthracite, there is a danger that the use of anthracite may be extended to a degree far beyond the capacity of this country and that imported anthracite may, to a large extent, take the place now filled by home-produced turf.  Therefore, as a matter of urgency, there should be produced a cooking range for the home that will compete with the anthracite range.</P>
    <P>I should also like to express the opinion that some tribute should be paid to a voluntary organisation, the National Agricultural and Industrial Development Association, which staged a competition for Irish inventions recently.  Many of the inventions exhibited in the Mansion House were very useful and they covered a wide variety of items.  This type of competition should be encouraged in every possible way.  In addition to a central body such as the National Agricultural and Industrial Development Association, the local bodies in the various counties could, I believe, contribute very much by encouraging young people to submit ideas for the improvement of various machines and other mechanical items.  It is only in that way that we can overcome the natural disadvantages from which our country suffers by reason of the shortage of many essential raw materials of industry.</P>
    <P>I was rather surprised to hear Deputy Brennan suggest that, in the course of the exploration work at <Col N="2553" /> Avoca, there is a possibility that sinister influences may be at work to prevent the best deposits from being discovered. I do not know that there is any foundation for that suggestion, but it is one of the things which should be carefully guarded against.  If people from outside this country are brought in to investigate our mineral resources and help in the work of exploration of them, there may be a temptation in some cases for them to work against the interests of this country in the interests, perhaps, of the country from which they have come.  I only referred to this matter because it has been mentioned.  It is one of the matters against which the Minister's Department should be on their guard.</P>
    <P>As I said, one of the most worrying features of our economic position is the enormous influx of imports into this country.  I refer particularly to the fact that we had to spend last year £7,000,000 on imported coal.  That is a figure which it should be possible to reduce by the development of our own resources.  Then our imports of textiles and wearing apparel appear to be altogether out of proportion to the needs of this country.  We ought to be able to make some headway in the clothing of our own people.  I understand the import of textiles last year amounted to £15,000,000, and of wearing apparel to over £6,000,000.  That is a very substantial sum to be sending to all parts of the world mainly for clothing.  These two industries will require to be greatly expanded in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear several Deputies refer to the desirability of establishing a linen industry here.  I know it is an extremely difficult matter to tackle.  It is a matter which I believe was considered by the previous Government. The difficulties are enormous.  Nevertheless, with the goodwill of all sections of the community and all Parties, it may be found possible to overcome those difficulties.  It ought to be possible in the next few years to realise the dream of Arthur Griffith, that every country town should have one productive industry of its own; that every little country town should not be merely a distributing centre for foreign goods.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2554" /> We heard in this House by way of question some time ago of the efforts that are being made to establish an industry in West Wicklow.  There was a very substantial textile industry there 100 years ago but, unfortunately, it disappeared.  I believe that some productive industry should be established there.  You have the resources there in the way of transport, good roads and a railway and you have workers who are willing to work.</P>
    <P>Some years ago I had a little skirmish with the Minister for Agriculture on a question which has very frequently arisen.  That is the question of whether the raw materials of agriculture should or should not be taxed.  The Minister for Agriculture was then emphatic that the raw materials of agriculture and the implements used in the industry should be completely exempt from tax. I was always under the impression that a spade is an agricultural implement but only last week I received a complaint that imported spades are subject to a duty of 50 per cent.  I do not know whether the Minister for Agriculture approved of this or not but as far as I am concerned I would be very slow to advocate the abolition of this particular duty.  One thing I would impress upon the Minister is that in the case of any implement the ordinary individual has to use in the course of his ordinary work, whether it is a spade used by a worker on the land or a typewriter used in an office or any other implement or machine, if we protect the home-produced article I think we should be particularly careful to ensure that it is of the best quality.  I am afraid that our Irish produced spades do not compare with those imported.</P>
    <P>In the course of the last couple of years farmers purchasing spades in the hardware shops have been rejecting the Irish article and are prepared to pay twice the price for the English article and that mainly because they realise that it is more efficient and of better quality.  I think the Minister should bring the fullest possible pressure upon those engaged in this particular industry to improve the quality of such implements.  Nothing will tend more to create a public opinion against Irish industry than to put into the hands of <Col N="2555" /> workers tools that are not of the best quality of Irish manufacture.  That is a logical aspect of this question that the Minister ought to consider.  We all know that our manual workers form a large section of the community.  If they are to be compelled or induced to use Irish implements and tools, the fullest measures ought to be adopted to see that they are of the best quality.</P>
    <P>In the course of this debate, Deputy M.J. O'Higgins launched a fairly severe attack upon one particular class of the community.  Again we have this question of class prejudice.  He launched a fairly bitter attack on the victualling trade.  I hold no brief for the butchers either of this city or of the country generally, but I think that every section of the community is entitled to fair play.  I have asked for fair play for the unemployed and for other sections of the community, and I think that when a reasonable case is put up by those engaged in the victualling trade they ought to be given consideration.</P>
    <P>A price has been fixed for meat sold to the public based upon the price paid for cattle.  The price was fixed in 1947 on the basis of the price that was then payable for cattle which was 88/10. Since then the price of cattle has increased by over 15/- a cwt. and there has not been any comparable adjustment in the price of meat.  I think that the reasonable attitude to this question would be that if it is necessary to fix a price for meat and if it is based on the price of cattle there ought to be an adjustment up or down according as the price of cattle rises or falls. Ordinary logical commonsense would dictate that that would be the proper course to adopt.  However, that course has not been adopted and I think those engaged in the meat trade feel that they have been compelled to act to a large extent as public benefactors.  A case arising out of the fixation of the price of meat was taken to the courts recently.  The judge wisely commented that it might be possible that those men were working at a loss.  The suggestion was made that men would not work at a loss because they would <Col N="2556" /> be out of business right away.  However, the judge properly answered that they might as long as they had a hope that their position would be improved in the near future.  I hope that that hope will not be frustrated.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to one last matter and that is the fact that we have so much publicity in this country for employment on the other side of the water.  Is it desirable that every newspaper in this country should carry advertisements offering employment in Great Britain to young people of this country?  Something should be done to counteract that propaganda and publicity.  Something very effective should be done to induce our young people to stay at home and to give them a reasonable prospect of a decent living within this country.</P>
    <P>Deputies have referred at considerable length to the question of transport. I have nothing to say on that matter except to warn the Minister again that if any reorganisation of transport is undertaken private enterprise in the transport of goods ought to be given very favourable consideration. While it is true that a large monopoly can handle passenger transport perhaps as efficiently, if not more efficiently, as private enterprise and while it is true that a central organisation is required to deal with rail traffic, I think that as far as lorry traffic on the roads is concerned small private contractors would give a better and cheaper service to the community. The Minister ought not to allow himself to be induced to betray the interests of that section of the people engaged in the transport industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFlynn" hpid="Mr. J. Flynn Mr. J. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I tabled a question some time ago urging the Minister to consider the provision of a generating plant in a remote area of the County Kerry with a view to using up the huge deposits of turf that we have there.  If that were done it would provide continuous employment for a great number of people.  I understand that, with the best intentions in the world, the Minister was not able to see his way to do what I asked simply because the Electricity Supply Board had advised, apparently, that the proposition was <Col N="2557" /> not an economic one, mainly because, as they said, the area proposed was in the dead end of the country.  I submit that if we feel there is a necessity for the establishment of such a plant there, the fact of it being in the dead end of the country should not matter. I hold that the main purpose of a native Government should be to decentralise industry, if possible, and to cater for the people in Ballinskelligs and Cahirciveen just as for those living adjacent to the capital of the country.  I made the suggestion from a practical point of view.  We have not the Electricity Supply Board system down there.  We have to depend on a local plant in Cahirciveen where electricity is produced at a high cost to the consumer.  My idea was that this generating plant, which I suggested, would supply sufficient electricity for lighting and power purposes and for other development in that area, while at the same time it would be the means of using up millions of tons of turf that could be made available for it from over a very wide area.  Perhaps at some future date the Minister may see his way to review that matter again.  I should be very grateful if he can do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my opinion, no proper methods have been adopted in regard to mineral development in this country.  When Deputy Lemass was Minister for Industry and Commerce I made representations to him on various occasions asking him to carry out experiments in mineral development. I pointed out to him that, in my county, we had well-known deposits of copper, silver and other valuable minerals, but he did not seem to react to the suggestion.  In my opinion, mineral development should be handled in the same way as the Minister for Agriculture is handling his important and huge land reclamation project at the moment.  It should be done in a big way.  If, from our own resources, we are not able to develop and exploit our mineral wealth, then I suggest we should ask for the assistance of foreign investors, American, British, or people from any other country who would be prepared to invest their money in such development on a pro rata basis with our own <Col N="2558" /> nationals.  If that were done it would help us to develop our national wealth and the natural mineral deposits that we have.</P>
    <P>I remember that, when I approached the former Minister for Industry and Commerce for a small grant for the purpose of testing out certain mineral deposits&mdash;the work might involve only an expenditure of £200 or £300 and could be carried out as a minor relief scheme&mdash;he refused me.  He did not believe in it, and he quoted from an old geological survey, one 100 years old, trying to prove that this mineral deposit in which I was interested was only what he called a shell deposit&mdash; just a mere speck in the ocean, as it were.  He did not consider my idea with any real earnestness.  I think that even if a little money were wasted on the scheme it should have been tried out.</P>
    <P>The last Government did not go in for modern methods for detecting minerals.  I suggest that the present Government should do so, and introduce the new system they have in America, the system that is known as electrical divining.  If that were done it would assist us in knowing where we stand in regard to mineral development. There is evidence that I could point to in various areas of the County Kerry of mineral deposits.  There is evidence of oil in Glenbeigh.  These mineral deposits were brought to the notice of the Department of Industry and Commerce years ago.  Whenever I did so I was referred to this old geological survey.  These surveys were carried out by a Government that was not helpful or favourable to this country, because if our mineral deposits were developed they would be in competition with their own.  We have evidence with regard to that.  We had silver and lead mining at one time in Castlemaine.  Strange to say, it was a landlord there who took the initiative in starting it.  The ore was sent to Liverpool for the smeltingdown process.  When the company was formed to develop the mineral, the British Government closed it down because they saw at the time that it would be in competition with others of its kind in their own country.  That <Col N="2559" /> is why I say that this geological survey, on which the Minister's experts pin all their faith, is questionable from that point of view.</P>
    <P>I now come to boots.  We have a very up-to-date and successful boot factory in Killarney.  Complaints have been coming through in recent months that the men are working on short time and, without casting aspersions on anybody, I would like to draw attention to the position there.  As far as I can ascertain, we have reached the peak point in boot production in this country.  I suggest to the Minister that, if it were at all possible we would be well advised to seek an export trade in boots in some of the European countries.  I have discussed this matter with a well-known boot manufacturer. He informs me that we have too many boot factories in this country.  I am not in a position to say whether that is correct or not.  This man certainly knows the position and, in my opinion, is very well qualified to speak for that industry.  The modern system calls for a high-class article.  I think that we have now reached the stage when we can produce an article that can compete with that produced in any other country.  I believe we would be well advised, if it were possible to do it, to have reciprocal arrangements with some other country in regard to an export trade.  There are, perhaps, other countries that would buy our products and we could make a trade pact with them in relation to whatever goods we might purchase from them.</P>
    <P>As regards the turf industry, I wonder would it be possible to regard the machine-won turf as the staple industry and utilise the hand-won turf in conjunction with it?  There is one suggestion that I think would be practicable and that is that Bord na Móna would lease machines to men engaged in the hand-won turf industry, lease them to individuals in districts adjoining the areas where they are operating. In that way we could develop large areas and have the turf produced as machine-won turf.  In my opinion in the course of time we could replace our entire coal imports.  According to our experts, at the present rate of consumption <Col N="2560" /> we have sufficient turf deposits to last us for 100 years.  If the machine-won turf is developed in the way I suggest, we could soon establish a series of these turf-cutting machines and enable the men now producing hand-won turf to utilise them.</P>
    <P>So far as I can see there is no encouragement for hand-won turf.  We have done our utmost in Country Kerry; the county council have endeavoured to make it compulsory on local institutions to use hand-won turf.  They are doing that, but we would like something mandatory from the Minister, something indicating what his Department might do for the industry as a whole.  If something is not done soon, the hand-won turf industry, as we know it, will disappear.  I admit there is a lot of propaganda about it, but the men engaged in it believe that there is no great future for that type of fuel.</P>
    <P>There is one thing I would be very insistent upon and I urge the Minister to do it.  He should prohibit coal imports into turf areas.  He should ask the co-operation of the people in this regard.  I do not know if it could be done by a Government Order, but an effort should be made to see that no coal is sold or utilised in the turf areas of County Kerry, with certain exceptions, and these would be the creameries or the railways.  There should be some restriction put on the use of coal in local institutions.  If that were done it would assist considerably.</P>
    <P>On the question of employment, I find that most of our people are anxious to work and it is difficult to reconcile the Minister's recent statement with the position as I see it in County Kerry.  The men were offered certain work but, as other speakers have said, they would have to go into another area and some of them refused because family circumstances militated against their leaving the locality.  At the same time I appreciate the Minister's frank statement.  I know that as far as he is concerned he is doing his utmost to help us and we in turn will do our utmost.  At the same time we will point out the difficulties.</P>
    <P>Coming back to the position of the Electricity Supply Board, I can never understand why that case should be <Col N="2561" /> made.  Bord na Móna made the same pont about turf development.  I tabled a question recently suggesting to the Minister that extra turf cutting machines should be allocated to those districts.  The point was that the haulage from Ballinskelligs to Cork would cost too much.</P>
    <P>The said bogs were excellent and the unemployed were there, but it would not pay them to operate their machines there because the haulage costs would be too great.  Is that a businesslike way of looking at a scheme?  Is it right to condemn a scheme like that and decide not to develop a particular district?  Did the Minister for Agriculture adopt that attitude in launching his land reclamation scheme?  Had he excluded certain counties because they were a dead-end the people would have resented it very much.  He did not do that.  He said the scheme would embrace the whole country.  Why should Bord na Móna come along then and reject one area on the plea that haulage costs would be too great?  I think that is bad business.  I appreciate what the Minister has done in the past 12 months and I appreciate what he is trying to do now in difficult circumstances. As far as I am concerned, I shall be helpful.  I shall criticise constructively when necessary, but I shall at all times do my utmost for the Government and for the people who sent me here.</P>

      <P>There are one or two matters to which I would like to refer on this Estimate.  There is a small provision in the Estimate for life saving.  I suggest that there should be a better organisation in this particular respect.  The loss of life around our coasts is a serious problem.  Every year takes its toll, particularly on the east coast.  I think the local authorities have some kind of responsibility but it is not very clearly defined. Where there are life-boats or a lifesaving apparatus, the Minister makes a grant of £3 10s to 700 people.  I do not know exactly who the 700 people are, but I assume they are the people who man the life-boats or operate the lifesaving apparatus.  Something must be done in the very near future with regard <Col N="2562" /> to life saving.  I think we should have a system something like the old coastguard system.  Whether that is desirable or not I do not know, but there is no doubt that many lives are lost every year.  About two years ago on the Wexford coast a boat in distress sent up flares all night long, but nobody understood what they were. The result was that a number of lives were lost on that occasion.  Certainly the provision made in this Estimate for this purpose is not very great.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the improvement of harbours, the Minister has provided more money for this purpose.  I hope that some of the harbours in County Wexford will benefit by these grants. Some years ago the previous Government approved of a grant for the building of a jetty at New Ross.  I wonder what has become of that.  Actually the harbour authorities were notified. Surely it is time some steps were taken in the matter.  The local authority agreed to pay its share and we can see no reason for the delay.  Wexford Harbour presents a big problem.  I understand it is the Minister's responsibility. The harbour commissioners have made representations on numerous occasions but so far nothing has been done.  I appeal to the Minister to take a personal interest in the matter and find some solution in the immediate future.  The authorities in Wexford have no funds at all.  Shipping would avail of this harbour if money were spent on dredging the channel.  Unless the Minister comes to their assistance the channel cannot be dredged.  I know there is a much bigger scheme for Wexford Harbour, but that scheme has been in abeyance for a long time now. Wexford County Council was the only body courageous enough to provide money for this.  The Departments of State concerned seem to have put it on the long finger.  Apart from the bigger scheme, there is no reason why a grant should not be made available to dredge the channel so that shipping could use the harbour.  Shipping always came into Wexford before the war.  The harbour was closed during the emergency.  Shipping would avail of it again now but the channel has silted up and ships cannot come in.  It <Col N="2563" /> is one harbour with a large trade in the past which is still out of operation through lack of funds.  I ask the Minister to give that matter his early attention.</P>
    <P>With regard to the fees to vocational committees under the Apprenticeship Act, a very small amount is provided. No doubt the amount is small because there is no demand for apprentices or no encouragement is being given to them.  It seems a pity that something more is not done in that respect.  As far as the rural areas are concerned, I think the Apprenticeship Act is out of date.  The Minister has power under the Act to make direct grants to persons who wish to apprentice themselves to trades in rural areas.  There are several trades that are absolutely essential to the existence of the agricultural industry.  Some of them are dying out at the present time because the young men no longer wish to learn them.  One important trade is that of farrier, or blacksmith.  Rural tailors are necessary; so are rural shoemakers and harnessmakers and so on.  These are all essential to the agricultural industry.  The men in the trades at present will tell you that they cannot get apprentices to serve their time.  I suggest the Minister should make substantial grants available both to the tradesman himself and to the young lad who is prepared to learn.  The same principle could apply in the building industry in the rural areas.  Plasterers, carpenters, plumbers, bricklayers and so on find it impossible to get apprentices in the country.  This would help in some measure to solve the problem of juvenile unemployment.  A man is assured of a livelihood if he has a trade.  It would be a pity if these trades were allowed to die out amongst the rural community.  Things were never so serious in that particular respect as they are at the moment. Blacksmiths, for instance, find it impossible to get anyone to help them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday the Parliamentary Secretary stated that there were £2,000,000 worth of schemes which would be carried out under this Bill when it becomes an Act. We could not discover from him if any great care had been taken to find out how much benefit would be done by these schemes and how much damage.  We have not yet succeeded in getting any indication from him that the State is prepared to foot the bill for the damage, although in certain instances the Minister may, through his nominee, carry out works which will result in a large bill for compensation being presented to the local authority.  When the Bill was first introduced here the then Minister stated, as reported in column 2144, Volume 114:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The finance necessary to operate the Bill is being made available by the Government.  The grants to local authorities will be 100 per cent. and local authorities need have no reservations whatever on that point.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The interpretation that was placed on that by most people in the country was that it was a 100 per cent. Government grant and a number of members of local authorities gaily started out to collect works on the assumption that 100 per cent. of all costs in connection with the carrying out of these works would be borne by the State.  They thought this scheme was a compensation for the loss of £2,000,000 in road grants and that, as the Government were anxious to do something to balance the cutting down of these grants, the cutting down of road work, and the unemployment caused thereby, they could assume that there would be no cost at all on the local authorities.  I wish the Parliamentary Secretary would give an indication, even if the Government are not prepared to bear 100 per cent. of the damage in all cases, that at least <Col N="2565" /> wherever the work is carried out by the Minister's nominee in spite of the local council, the State would bear the bill for compensation for any damage caused by the Minister's nominee in carrying out the work.</P>
    <P>We have to realise that works under this Bill will be decided upon, as the Parliamentary Secretary stated, by the county manager or by the nominee of the Minister.  I think it is only fair, particularly in a case where the work is carried out by the Minister's nominee, if instead of doing something to benefit the local authority, he imposes a great charge upon them, that the Government should be responsible for the bill.  The Parliamentary Secretary quite glibly assumes that there will be no damage whatsoever under this Bill.  I stated in my speech on Second Reading&mdash;I do not want to go into the details again&mdash;that I knew of one case where a few thousand pounds were spent on cleaning up a stream, and that work caused many thousands of pounds' damage downstream. There was great local agitation as a result and it was only after a number of years that a settlement was made whereby the Government gave the county council a grant and they in turn relieved the farmers whose lands were flooded.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance is engaged in pushing forward drainage in that area, and one of the reasons why the area was selected for the second of the great arterial drainage schemes was to undo some of the damage that has been done by the spending of that money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>That was one of the reasons and the Parliamentary Secretary, in that case, as in many others, has adopted the policy of his predecessors. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance is here and he can bear me out in the assertion that, in some cases, grave damage will be done.  I do not mind a county situated in such a way that all the watershed is within its own territory.  Take <Col N="2566" /> County Kerry and, to some extent, County Wexford.  Kerry is protected from incoming floods from other counties and the county manager can see exactly what damage might be created. If he creates some damage in his own county with the approval of his council it is their fault.  Some seaboard counties, however, are subject to floods from inland counties and would be subject to grave damage if waters were released suddenly, so some protection should be given.  We will come to other types of protection in other amendments, but with regard to this amendment I think that where work is carried on by the Minister's nominee, and causes damage in the area concerned or in adjoining areas, the State should bear the burden.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Monaghan-Louth case.  If the Deputy wants to see the details he can look up my Second Reading speech.  Once upon a time, not so long ago, the Parliamentary Secretary refused to carry out a scheme of drainage and I quoted the letter which he sent to the local authority concerned.  The letter, if Deputy Davin wants to look at it, is on column 2396, Volume 114, of the 6th May.  The Parliamentary Secretary sensibly took up the stand that he could not release the waters from a tributary into a main basin before that main basin was prepared to receive the extra waters.  He pointed out that it was attempted to do this thing under the minor relief works, and he pointed out that they had no means of reconciling the interests of landowners whose lands adjoined a main drainage channel with those whose lands were bordering on tributaries.  He pointed out that such problems occur in many parts of the country and that they could only be dealt with by means of the machinery of the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945.  If we had the machinery of the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, with all the care that is taken before a job <Col N="2567" /> is started there would be no talk here at all about compensation.  If the local authority had to go through the same procedure as under the 1945 Act, if they made a mistake clearly it would be their own fault.  However, they have not got it.  They have only got the machinery we are supplying in this Bill and very limited precautions will be taken even if the amendments suggested by the Opposition are accepted. I would be glad if the Parliamentary Secretary would consider the matter between now and the Report Stage. If he is not prepared to accept all the amendments <i>in toto</i> so as to relieve the local authorities of any liability for damage, he should at least consider relieving them of liability for damage caused by the Minister's nominee. Later, perhaps, we might get him to accept other amendments which, with that particular amendment, would leave the Bill less dangerous and confine it to doing good.</P>

      <P>I would be grateful to the Parliamentary Secretary if he would let me know whether, if a county council carries out any of these works under this section, it will be allowed for maintenance.  In Kerry we had a meeting with our county engineer and, supposing we made a drain in a man's land, he was not at all sure whether we would have to maintain that drain or anything else under this section.  If so, it will be a serious charge on the local authority when we have the liability for damage as well.</P>

In fact, due to statements that appeared in the Press as a result of speeches in this House that all the money would be provided <Col N="2568" /> by the State for these works, a number of works were submitted to our county surveyor.  Some of us got replies from the county surveyor intimating that the only works contemplated, so far as he was aware, were works in connection with property of the county council under Section 1 of this Bill and that the question of general drainage was not going to be contemplated at all and that the works submitted to him were ordinary minor drainage works which normally would be done by the Board of Works.  One of the things about which I am still confused, particularly in view of the Parliamentary Secretary's statement last night, is what the Government's intention is with regard to the works which are to be undertaken under this Bill.  The Parliamentary Secretary read a list here last night intimating for the first time what was going to be done.</P>

      <P>I do not want to misrepresent the position in any way, but the list he read out certainly did not mention the question of what I would call public drainage except in so far as county council property was affected. I was listening to him and the list was entirely in connection with works contemplated in the first part of this measure.  The first part of this measure is quite clear to everybody and reasonable.  It is the part of the measure which deals with the general drainage which is to be undertaken for the first time by local authorities.  The fact that the works all came under the first part is what gives rise to doubts as to the implications, particularly in regard to the liabilities of local authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>If we are to accept the statements made, this Bill will provide for the carrying out by local authorities <Col N="2570" /> of very substantial drainage works and one of the big questions will be maintenance.  There is not one word dealing with maintenance in this Bill. It is clear that, if a farmer's cow falls into a drain, or there is some other injury through a drain not being fenced, and if this happens in a couple of years' time, it is what the lawyers call a misfeasance and the local authority will be responsible.  By the Parliamentary Secretary and the Government keeping silent on this Bill, the local authority will come in for any damage caused.  In addition to that, by their silence they are shoving over on the local authority the liability for maintenance in law of these drainage or other works.</P>
      <P>It is most desirable, when the money is being provided for the main expenditure, that the Minister should not stop local authorities from making use of this Bill.  If he does not give the guarantees asked for under these amendments, the Bill will be illusory. With a very high level of rates at present, the local authorities will not be prepared to face the further increase in rates envisaged as a result of these works.  It will be pointed out to them by the officials that the works may cause damage as a result of flooding, that a number of officials will have to be appointed and salaries provided for them, and when they do the works they will be responsible for the maintenance. When they are warned that they will have to foot the bill, the Parliamentary Secretary will find that the local authorities will be curtailing the work and not making use of the drainage sections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot understand why, having said he would provide the money for the execution of the works, the Parliamentary Secretary is not prepared to go the rest of the way to ensure that local authorities will go full steam ahead. Let no one mistake this proposition, that a vote against these amendments, if they are put to a vote, is a vote for the increasing of the rates throughout the country.  If the Parliamentary Secretary is wise, he will not spoil the ship for a ha'porth of tar but will provide for these officials, for any damage that may result, and for maintenance <Col N="2571" /> also.  If he does that, he will find the Bill will work; if he does not, he will find the Bill will not work.  I ask him to reconsider the position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this will be my last contribution on the amendments, as I can see clearly that the attitude taken up is one of obstruction. I understood from the ex-Minister that local authorities over a number of years were clamouring for power to do the works envisaged in this Bill and as they could not get that power they dare not do the works necessary to protect the property of local authorities. Deputy Corry, who is a very sound representative of local authorities and knows what is in their interests, admitted on the Second Reading that local authorities were pressing for this and, in fact, that he was pressing for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary say they are not only going to give local authorities that power to do the things they want to do to protect their own property but they are going to pay 100 per cent. of the cost of doing the work.  Can anyone say that is not a generous contribution by a central authority?  Not only are they getting the power they want but this Parliament is paying 100 per cent. of the cost of the work.  If the Minister had said he would give them the power and authority, that would have been welcomed by the majority of Deputies as it is something local authorities were crying out for for many years.  If some Deputy said it would be a strain on local authorities and asked for 50, 70 or 90 per cent. grants, and the Minister acceded, it would have been considered a generous action on the part of the central authority.  But the Minister comes in and says: &ldquo;Not only will I give you the power but also every ½d. it costs to carry out the work.&rdquo;  Then Deputy Moran says: &ldquo;That is not enough; there may be claims for compensation&mdash;will you also take on the responsibility for that?&rdquo; Deputy Allen said last night&mdash;and I accept Deputy Allen on this as a representative of the local authority&mdash;that in actual fact the claims that may be made for compensation, if this measure is put properly into operation after due <Col N="2572" /> consideration by the local authority will be very small.</P>

I can say that a member of any other local authority is as justified in saying that his local authority will not act the fool.  Not only are we to give them the 100 per cent. grant and the power they want, but, Deputy Moran says: &ldquo;Pay all these possible claims in the meantime.&rdquo; I ask Deputy Moran what does he visualise these works to be and he gives me the smart answer that I have not read the Bill.  He knows I have read the Bill and that I have read every amendment, and he knows that not only have I read them, but that I understand what is in the Bill and in the amendments.  I do not want to say anything more than that, but it was a reasonable question to put to him&mdash;what did he visualise as being included in the works for the maintenance of which local authorities would have to be responsible?  This Bill is a measure which authorises local authorities to do certain works for the particular principles, points and reasons set out in the Bill, and, whether these works are to be done in 1949, 1950, 1951 or 1952, the principle is the same.  Any works which are lawful under the Bill and which can be done under the Bill can be done under the guarantee of the Minister that there will be a 100 per cent. grant from the central authority for doing them.  Where is the point then in regard to maintenance?  I suggest to Deputy Moran that he stop this playacting and let us get on with the work of the House.</P>

My attitude to the Bill is this: I want to save the local authorities <Col N="2573" /> from being saddled with expenditure with which I do not think they should be saddled.  Every Drainage Bill ever introduced recognised, as does every Party, that drainage should be a national charge.</P>

      <P>It strikes me as very peculiar that the Deputies who represent country constituencies and who are members of local bodies are very silent on these clauses and that it is left to Deputy Cowan, who is mainly concerned with a city constituency, to be vocal with regard to them.  If the Minister wants this Bill to be a success, I appeal to him to accept these amendments.  I know the attitude of local authorities and I know that they are not prepared, with the present level of rates, to accept any further responsibility.  Drainage should be a national charge and I appeal to him, for that reason, to accept the amendment and not saddle local authorities with this heavy burden.</P>

I ask Deputy Moran if he thinks it wise to waste any more time discussing the merits of these amendments and I should like him to say whether he knows of any measure passed by this House since the House was established which provided that maintenance should be borne by the Central Fund in respect of any works carried out at the expense of the Central Fund.  Money is provided for farm improvement schemes, for reconstruction of farmers' dwellings and of other houses, and for road construction.  Is there any measure of any kind introduced since the State was established which provides that maintenance work should be carried out after grants had been made <Col N="2575" /> available, with the exception of the Barrow Drainage Act?  In that case, portion of the maintenance charges has still to be borne by the ratepayers.  The discussion on these amendments is merely a waste of time, and I say it deliberately, in order to delay the coming into operation of a valuable measure which is bound to provide useful work for the unemployed in rural areas.</P>

      <P>It could not be amended if attention were not drawn to the part of the section which needs amendment. I suggest to the Minister that under sub-section (3) of Section 2 works of far-reaching importance will fall to be executed&mdash;whether they are done this year or next year.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance is <Col N="2577" /> aware of that.  Very large sub-major drainage areas will need to be drained under sub-section (3) of Section 2, if the Bill is to operate.  There is no doubt about that.  It is not denied that large catchment areas will fall to be drained under this sub-section.  As I said last night, this is the portion of the section that local authorities dread and will fear in future.  It is the portion of the section, as has been said a moment ago, in respect of which their advisers will so advise councils that I am afraid little or no work will be done under it. For that reason, I would ask the Minister to give an undertaking to reconsider this matter between now and the Report Stage, to reconsider the whole question as to whether the State will reimburse local authorities for the legal charges that may fall on them arising out of sub-section (3). They are not claiming anything for ordinary maintenance. There should be some provision in this Bill for the maintenance of certain types of work.  There is no such provision in the Bill.  There should be a provision whereby the local authorities, from their own funds or otherwise, would maintain works but that is beside the point.  Some further consideration should be given to that aspect of the matter.  I say that with a full sense of responsibility.</P>

      <P>They have not had experience of what happened in days gone by in connection with maintenance costs of other drainage schemes that were carried out prior to the passing of the 1945 Drainage Act.  Enormous burdens were placed on the ratepayers and the ratepayers have to bear that responsibility yet.  If we are trying in this particular Bill to avoid placing similar burdens on local authorities in future, it is absolutely wrong and unfair for Deputy Davin or Deputy Cowan or anybody else to say that because our efforts are focussed in that direction it is obstructive tactics.  Every Deputy must be well aware that the responsibility for collecting rates is a heavy responsibility and must recognise that the rates are already a very heavy burden on the unfortunate ratepayers.  If we are trying to avoid further burdens on the ratepayers, we are doing a very useful work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no use in saying that we are obstructing this Bill.  We all welcome the Bill and we are trying to get the Parliamentary Secretary to see things in the light in which we as members of local authorities see them.  Deputy Moran has been criticised by everybody. He was criticised particularly by Deputy Davin, very wrongfully, in so far as he asked what happened in Mayo County Council, having had Deputy Moran's word that this matter never came before the Mayo County Council.  Neither did it come up before my county council.  We are trying to get the Parliamentary Secretary to see the difficulties that will be facing local authorities in putting into operation any particular scheme under this Bill and we are endeavouring to relieve the local authorities of heavy responsibility that may be placed upon them through expense incurred in carrying out any particular scheme and in maintaining it.  I do not know, of course, if there will be any maintenance but if we were to have drainage without maintenance it would be better not to have it at all.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for <Col N="2579" /> Finance will clearly understand that if you are not going to have maintenance afterwards, it is quite useless.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaSnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government to consider carefully the amendments that have been suggested from this side of the House and to take them in the spirit in which they are presented, that is, of trying to make the Bill workable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I represent a county council that has always been most helpful in putting into operation any schemes that were ever submitted by a Government to them.  When this Bill is through and when we are called upon to do certain works, I want local authorities to be able to go ahead with the work without any interference or stumbling blocks. I do not want to have the impression among local authorities and throughout the country that the Government are bringing in this measure to make it unworkable and to put the local authorities in the position of being able to say to them: &ldquo;Well we have given you an Act and you are doing nothing about it.&rdquo;  If, as was pointed out in this House before, the cost of administration is going to be as light as the Parliamentary Secretary has conveyed to us, then why not stand up to the original words of the Minister who introduced the Bill&mdash;that it is not going to cost the local authorities anything whatsoever, the whole hog or not at all?  All the recommendations made from this side of the House are reasonable and well worthy of consideration. I have yet to see any member of a local authority standing up behind the <Col N="2580" /> Government and saying that the case we are making is not reasonable and right.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not intervened in this debate up to the present but I have listened very attentively to the arguments both for and against the amendments.  I must say that I have not been very much impressed by the arguments from either side of the House either last night or this afternoon. I believe that a very good case could be made for these amendments &mdash;a better case than has been made for them.  On the other hand I believe that a very strong case can be made against them.</P>
      <P>Speaking for the amendments, the case would appear to be that the compensation clause of this Bill would in the first place impose an exceptionally heavy burden upon the local rates and, in the second place, might have the effect of deterring a local body from undertaking work by reason of the risk of having to pay heavy compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Against these two arguments I should like to submit, as a member of a local authority for a great number of years, that I do not believe that the liability incurred by this clause will be heavy.  I think it will be a reasonable contribution, having regard to the amount of money that is being provided. I should like to ask how many times in the past 25 years a local authority has been offered a 100 per cent. grant for any type of work.  The hospitalisation grants were very generous but they were not 100 per cent. The lime subsidy grants were generous but even they were not 100 per cent. I do not think that any of the emergency grants for road reconstruction during the past few years&mdash;and these also were very generous grants&mdash;ever exceeded 90 per cent.  I think that the liability which a county council will undertake by reason of carrying out this work, if they carry it out properly, will be a very modest portion of the total expenditure.  As far as the argument that the compensation clause will deter county councils from undertaking useful work is concerned.  I do not think there is anything to fear in that direction.  The scope of the Bill is very wide.  The number of schemes that a <Col N="2581" /> county council can undertake is very large.  It will be open to a county council to select the very best of these schemes and to eliminate those which have an undue measure of risk.  I believe the number of works that can be carried out under the Bill is so great that it will tax all the resources of the local authority to carry them out.  It will provide employment for all the men that the county council may have available.  The number of works that can be carried out is very large and they can be very widely distributed over each county.  Therefore, I think that in reason and justice the Bill as it stands is quite a reasonable one. Some Deputies suggest that county councils were not aware, when they were submitting their schemes, of the compensation clause.  The county council of which I am a member was aware of the compensation clause from the very outset.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Bill was drafted.  That clause was referred to at the county council meeting.  Some members suggested that it should be deleted and other suggested that it should remain as a kind of a safeguard so that work that would involve claims for compensation would not be undertaken. It would be quite wrong for a county council to undertake work which, while it might be useful, might also do a considerable amount of damage to land, industry or something else. I think that, in the implementation of this Act, the county council should concentrate upon work that is simple and straightforward and that will not hold up or damage existing industries or injure land.  I think that that is quite an understandable proposition and I think that was the aim which the late Minister had in mind when he was introducing the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, I have heard various statements from this side of the House to the effect that this amendment was put down merely for the sake of obstruction.  I would appeal to Deputies not to pursue that line in this House.  The Opposition Party, if it is <Col N="2582" /> to be of any use at all, must approach legislation in a critical fashion.  These amendments deserve reasonable consideration on their merits but I think that, on their merits, the House should reject them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Cogan when he says that a local body should be very careful before undertaking work that might result in doing damage in some other way or in some place outside the immediate district in which the work was situated.  In fact, it is to the damage that could result if the local bodies took advantage of sub-section (3) of Section 2 that Deputy Allen has referred.  I agree also in the main with Deputy Cogan that, in so far as a local body takes advantage of sub-sections (1) and (2) of Section 2 for the carrying out of work for the protection of its own property, an excellent case can be made to show that such a local authority, after getting the 100 per cent.  grant, should be called upon to maintain that work and to keep it in proper condition.  But if Deputies will read sub-section (3) they will see that the local authority, whether or not they exercise the type of discretion that Deputy Cogan has advised they should exercise, are given under that sub-section very wide power indeed.  I am not suggesting that they will just run off and behave in all cases in an extravagant and dangerous fashion.  I have before me the Parliamentary Secretary who is now in charge of the Office of Public Works.  He has some knowledge of the administration of even small drainage schemes out of the Employment Schemes Vote and out of the Rural Improvement Schemes Vote.  I had that responsibility for a number of years.  I can say, as I think I may have stated on a number of occasions in this House, that we found in the execution of even small works costing only a few hundred pounds that damage did arise so far as adjoining districts are concerned. Deputies who are on local authorities seem to think that the problem is similar in every county.  It is not.  Every county presents peculiar problems of its own.  What I am afraid of is that, while local authorities will take the advice and follow the course <Col N="2583" /> perhaps that Deputy Cogan has mentioned, there may be in certain cases pressure brought to bear upon members of a local authority and they may be induced to carry out a scheme of drainage or improvement of some river that might result in continuous damage arising at certain seasons of the year which the local authority would be liable for as long as that state of affairs existed.</P>
      <P>I have not had any consultation with my colleagues on the point of view I am going to express now, but if I were to get an assurance from the Parliamentary Secretary that he would consider introducing an amendment on the Report Stage protecting local authorities in regard to the compensation that might arise under Section 2 (3), I would be reasonably satisfied with a gesture of that sort.  As Deputy Cogan stated, it is nonsense to suggest that this discussion is intended to be obstructive.  It is not.  As the Deputy said, we have a duty to perform here. Quite apart from that, some of us who are not experts have at least some considerable experience from an administrative point of view of the problems which can arise from the carrying out of what might appear at the time a useful work if it is not planned in a very careful way by men who are qualified and who know the dangers, the implications and the harm which could result.  That is our function as an Opposition and that is the purpose of these amendments.  I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary at least to endeavour to meet us by saying that between now and the Report Stage he will consider the question of introducing an amendment on the lines of even the most moderate of these amendments, not in relation to the whole section, but in relation to sub-section (3) which gives to local authorities power to go outside their area and do work which has no connection with any of their own property.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>From the speeches of Deputies opposite one would imagine that the purpose of the Bill was to place a very large burden on the ratepayers of the different counties.  As against that, I would point out that local authorities and Deputies were <Col N="2584" /> well aware of the fact on the Second Stage of the Bill that compensation would not be paid out of State funds. Deputy Killilea and Deputy Aiken tried to tell the House that the late Minister for Local Government gave an indication that all expenditure on schemes under this Bill would be met by a 100 per cent.  grant.  I should like to refer those two Deputies to the late Minister's reply on the Second Stage of the Bill in which he said, as reported in Volume 114, cols.  2461-2 of the Official Reports:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The question of compensation has been raised on this Bill.  I have already indicated that the Government will make available to the local authorities 100 per cent.  of the cost of these schemes.  It is not intended to exceed that amount by any sums to cover the cost of compensation.  I am quite satisfied with regard to the cost of compensation, because I feel and I know that this Bill will be sensibly operated and that the cost of compensation will be very small.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I rather imagine that if the late Minister had announced when introducing the Bill that 75 per cent.  of the cost of the actual execution of the works would be given Deputies opposite would have been rather satisfied and might only have asked that the 75 per cent.  should be increased.  Here there was an announcement that 100 per cent. grant would be given and Deputies opposite are not satisfied and ask that the Minister for Local Government should go further.  If he did go further and say that he would pay the full compensation as well, they would probably ask for a bonus on it.  I do not think it is an unreasonable gesture by the Minister for Local Government to say that, in respect of works to be carried out under this Bill, local authorities will get 100 per cent. grant.</P>
      <P>Some local authorities have considered this Bill and in most counties they have formulated schemes which have been submitted to the Department and there has been no protest from the local authorities against the provisions of the Bill or the announcement that 100 per cent. grant would be given for the actual execution of the works.</P>

      <P>It is no harm to remind the House that I am informed by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance that some months ago a deputation from the General Council of County Councils approached him and asked that local authorities should be given the facilities that they are being given in this Bill to enable them to carry out certain works to prevent flooding and to provide against other things which are mentioned in the Long Title.  They asked that power be given to them and that power is being given in this Bill.  I assume they are representative of the county councils of the Twenty-Six Counties.  They asked merely for an 80 per cent. grant to help them to carry out these works. I am sure the General Council of County Councils and the 27 county councils in the country must consider it extremely generous when they get 100 per cent. grant towards the execution of the works.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mrs. Crowley raised the question of maintenance.  There is no obligation on the local authorities to maintain any work which they have undertaken.  I should like to stress also that under this Bill local authorities are not being in any way saddled with any burden nor are the ratepayers. This is merely an enabling Bill which says that a county council may do certain things such as enter on land to carry out certain works.  The county councils can consider and decide upon schemes.  If they think there may be severe claims for compensation, they are entitled to say, and if, as I believe, they are responsible men, they will say: &ldquo;We will not engage in any such scheme because it will result in too heavy a burden on the ratepayers.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I would refer Deputy Aiken to the Relief Works Act, 1940, by which the Minister is given power to compel a local authority to execute certain works for the relief of unemployment. <Col N="2586" /> There is no question there of compensation.  There is no question of any contribution to the local authority for the cost of the works.  Here there is an announcement that they will get 100 per cent. grant.  In the Relief Works Act of 1940 introduced by a Fianna Fáil Minister there was no such figure, while in connection with this Bill there is the announcement of a grant of 100 per cent. for the actual execution of the work.</P>
      <P>Deputy Moran raised the question of consultation with members of the local authority in connection with these schemes.  I have a letter here from the county engineer of the Mayo County Council and he encloses with the letter a list of schemes which it is proposed to carry out in Mayo.  In his letter he says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;All the works included in this schedule are works which have been considered or mentioned at county council meetings.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy Moran and Deputy Allen said that they had not seen the circular of 10th March.  If these two Deputies have not seen that particular circular of the 10th March they are entitled to ask the county manager why he did not bring it before the meeting.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary last night wanted to convey the impression to the House, I think, that local authorities had been informed that they would get a 100 per cent. grant and that they would be legally responsible for any damage that might arise afterwards.  In any circular issued by the Department to the local authorities was that so stated?</P>

      <P>That is another way of putting it.  That particular circular referred to by the Parliamentary Secretary was read by the secretary of the county council or manager at a county council meeting in Wexford.  I raised the question because no circular was brought to the notice of the county council at Wexford setting out that the local authority would be liable for compensation.  I want to make that clear.  The Parliamentary Secretary has now admitted that no such circular was ever issued from the Department of Local Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I move amendment No. 10, Parts I and II:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add two new sub-sections as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>( ) The powers conferred by sub-sections (2) and (3) of this section shall be exercised directly by the local authority acting by resolution whereof 14 days' notice shall be given.</P>
      <P>( ) The resolution prescribed by the foregoing sub-section shall not take effect unless approved of by a majority of the full membership of the local authority.</P>
      <P>The first part of this amendment is designed to ensure that the members of a local authority will directly exercise control under this Bill and will, by resolution, decide what works shall be undertaken.  The second part of it proposes that a majority of the members of the local authority must pass a particular work before it is carried out.  The reason for that is quite obvious, and I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that he should keep it in mind.  Some of our county council areas are very large, and, naturally, councillors coming from one end of the area would not be familiar with the conditions in another part of the area. Some members might live 60 or 70 miles from one part of the county council area.  Two members of a council might decide to try to get a particular work through for their own area, and in doing so would seek the support of members from other areas on the plea that when the latter wanted to get a work through in their area these two councillors would support them.</P>
      <P>This amendment is designed to meet a situation of that sort, because it provides that a majority of the council must decide the matter before any works are executed.  That means that every work coming before the council will be fully discussed by it, and that before any particular scheme is embarked upon a majority of the members would have to decide that the work is of a beneficial nature, that its execution will not do undue damage, and that in all the circumstances, it is a work that should be undertaken.  That will ensure that a majority of the members will have to be fully satisfied that all due precautions have been taken, that no work will be carried out unless it is one of urgent importance, and that it is a work that had the support of the majority of the council.  It will also ensure that the most urgent work to be done under the Bill will be carried out first by the council.</P>
      <P>The amendment will also put the local authority in a position to decide the priority in which works in a county council area will be undertaken.  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that the members of a county council acting by a majority vote, are the best authority to decide this order of priority.  They, of course, will know from their officials the jobs that are most essential from the urgency point of view.  The local authority under this amendment will have the power to decide that issue.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will see his way to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to accept the amendment.  This particular question was referred to, though not specifically, on other amendments. The effect of this would be to make the powers given by sub-sections (2) and (3) of Section 2 reserved functions.  I am wholly in sympathy with the Deputy when he says that the members of local authorities should be acquainted with the different schemes which it is proposed to engage in, but, as I said last night on another amendment, the County Management Act will be repealed and I do not think it would be wise to amend or change that Act in piecemeal fashion, as would be done if this amendment were accepted.</P>
      <P>The Minister has endeavoured, as far as he can and with the powers he has, to ensure that the members of local authorities will be fully conversant with the schemes proposed to be carried out.  Again I will refer to the circular which he issued to local authorities on the 10th March and the one issued no later than the 31st May. For the benefit of the House, I think it will be no harm for me to read that circular again.  It was addressed in the following terms:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;With reference to previous correspondence, I am directed by the Minister for Local Government to inform you that as soon as the Local Authorities (Works) Bill, 1949, becomes law decisions will be issued on the various schedules of schemes submitted to the Department for the purposes of the Bill.  First preference will be given to simple schemes not requiring elaborate surveys or preparation, which may be undertaken without delay in an appropriate period of the present financial year. It is, therefore, recommended that a selection on these lines be made from the schemes submitted and that particulars thereof be placed before the elected body concerned for their preliminary approval.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that members of different local authorities are taking an active part in the submission and consideration of these schemes.  As a matter of fact, even Deputies of this House are taking an active interest inasmuch as they are sending communications to <Col N="2592" /> local authorities and suggesting certain types of work which may be carried out.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to accept this amendment, because it would mean amending the County Management Act in a piecemeal fashion.  It is hoped in the near future to repeal the Act altogether.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept the Parliamentary Secretary's reasoning on this matter of the County Management Act.  We have had many sermons on that Act from the Parliamentary Secretary and his colleagues, but still there has not been any legislation tabled for the purpose of amending it. If the Act is bad, as the Parliamentary Secretary and his colleagues appear to believe, why not accept an amendment of this kind, which is designed to place the power in the hands of local authorities? We are told the County Management Act will be repealed.  From reading the papers there would appear to be a divergence of view among the Parliamentary Secretary's colleagues. Here he has an opportunity of practising what he preaches; he has an opportunity under this amendment to place the power of deciding questions of priority of works and the types of works to be done in the hands of the local authorities.  That being so.  I cannot understand why the Parliamentary Secretary is so shy in accepting this amendment, which professes to do what he suggests should be done, and that is to give more and more power to local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Outside any question of the manager's functions under the County Management Act, the Parliamentary Secretary is aware that local authorities have various other functions, and one of the matters that could best be carried out by a local authority would be something of this kind, of deciding priority of the works and the type of works which should be done.  I do not know why, in this Bill, schemes submitted by county managers are evidently being accepted, in some cases at all events, by the Parliamentary Secretary, without consultation with the local authority.  It is true that county managers and county surveyors will have knowledge of many schemes, <Col N="2593" /> particularly in the line of drainage, that may have come from time to time under notice by these officials.</P>
    <P>It is, as the Parliamentary Secretary is aware, a regular practice in the country up to this that even where you were submitting a scheme to the Board of Works, which was the authority that used to carry out these drainage schemes, you also endeavoured to enlist the aid of the county surveyor and the county manager&mdash;you submitted the scheme to them to get their approval.  I understand that the Parliamentary Secretary has received a number of schemes from these officials. In one or two cases that we are aware of there was not consultation with the members of the local authority.</P>

It will not blow the bottom out of the County Management Act if you do that.  You still have the Act and can amend it if the House so decides.</P>
      <P>This is a new function for a local authority.  Local authorities heretofore did not have the function of carrying out this system of drainage here, there and everywhere.  It is a new duty that is being put upon the local authorities.  When you are giving them this new job, why not make this particular rule suggested in the amendment for the local authorities to act upon?  There is nothing unreasonable about that.  If the Parliamentary Secretary is sincere in his criticism of the County Management Act, there is no reason why he should not accept the principles contained in these amendments. It will be the most practicable way of dealing with any problems that will arise.  I urge him to reconsider the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Deputy Moran's points.  It is quite clear to those of us who are members of local authorities that in this matter we are dealing with something that county councils heretofore have not had to deal with.  We are on new ground and I am surprised at the Parliamentary Secretary refusing to accept this amendment.  It has been pointed out by Deputy Moran that we have heard a lot of talk about the giving back to members of local authorities of the powers of which they were alleged to be deprived under the County Management Act.  By accepting this amendment we have an opportunity now of giving to local authorities power to carry out certain works under this particular Bill.  I do not see why we should not avail of that.  I do not see why we should not trust the members of local authorities to carry out the schemes envisaged in this Bill. The Parliamentary Secretary has pointed out that since the Second Reading members of local authorities have taken an interest in submitting schemes and some of those schemes <Col N="2595" /> have been submitted to the county engineer.  It is quite safe to assume that at least a percentage of these schemes will not be carried out.  If this amendment is not accepted and if it is left to the judgment of the county manager or the county engineer, despite the representations that may be made by local authorities as to the schemes which they in their wisdom think should be carried out under this Bill, the schemes decided upon may not be the ones they want to have at all.  We are thus depriving the local authorities of their power to carry out the schemes which they consider are in the best interests of their particular county.  I take it no scheme will be carried out without the approval of the county engineer.</P>
      <P>If the members of the local authorities have no power except merely to submit schemes to the county manager and county engineer it is these officials who will have the last word as to what schemes are to be carried out. In that way I think we are merely perpetuating what the Labour Party, of which both the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary are members, decried and criticised in the County Management Act.  This amendment only seeks to make it a reserved function of the local authority to advise the schemes and put them in their proper order when the county engineer has sanctioned them, provided they are schemes that come within the scope of the Bill and can be reasonably carried out to serve the functions which this Bill is intended to serve.  Having fulfilled all those conditions, the members of the local authorities should have the last word as to the schemes that are to be carried out and it should not be left to the county manager.  If the Parliamentary Secretary is sincere in his protestations I cannot see how he, or the Minister, or any member of the Labour Party can resist this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if a complete change of front has taken place, because I have a very distinct recollection of who was supposed to be the best judge of the public interest when the County Management Bill was going through the House.  It certainly was not the elected representatives then. That Act was not passed by anyone who now sits on the Government side of the House.  Now Deputy Brady wants to say that the best judge of the public interest is so-and-so.  The position is that the present Opposition passed the County Management Act. That is an Act with which the members of this Government now and when they were in opposition fundamentally disagree.  We are going to introduce legislation very quickly to amend that Act and we will not be forced by the Opposition under cover of this Bill to do anything else.</P>
      <P>This is a Bill that is much more urgent than is the alteration in the County Management Act.  Earlier on the Opposition wanted to truncate and tie down local authorities and county councils by having them under the control of the engineer.  They did not trust either the county manager or the elected representatives.  They said it must be done under the report of the engineer; otherwise the schemes could not take place at all.  The difficulty is that under existing legislation passed by the Fianna Fáil Government they cannot be trusted until such time as we amend the County Management Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Parliamentary Secretary has said, there are two distinct functions. We want to get on with this Bill and we want to get on with the work.  In due course the functions will revert to the proper authorities and powers will be restored to the elected representatives. That will be done very shortly.  Meantime the Opposition need not fear that anything will go wrong.  We could not accept any piecemeal division of what we propose to do in a general Bill for the amendment of the County Management Act.  I do <Col N="2597" /> not know that the Opposition are quite so worried as they profess to be.  They need not worry because in a very short time the County Management Act will be amended.  Until that time the Opposition should accept the Bill as it is.  There is no danger that the works will not be properly carried out.</P>

      <P>In thinking of terms of this amendment I did not ask myself as to whether or not it would have the effect that I now see it can have; that is, the effect of amending the County Management Act.  My approach to this amendment was that, in considering the proposed scheme under this Bill when it becomes law, I thought the widest possible source of knowledge, after the technical people employed had made their observations, would come from the practical men who were members of the county council.  I did not advert to the fact that it might have the effect of amending the County Management Act.  Since this matter has been raised by both the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary I would like to ask them if, in the course of a month or two, we have an amendment introduced here transferring back to the local authorities powers which are now vested in the county manager why, when we are in possession of that knowledge, should we now proceed to introduce a Bill giving local authorities a power which they never had before. Why should we, in the knowledge that we are going to strip the manager of all powers which he has at present, come along and in this new matter put responsibility upon him?  It is all very well for the Minister to make play with this idea that we are now very keen on giving to local bodies this and that power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must confess, although I was a member of a local body and have some experience of the working of local bodies, that I have no strong views, or never had, one way or other as to the County Management Act.  I certainly even yet can see no very strong objection that can be made to it.  Why should we have this attempt from the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister to play around the powers given under the County Management Act? After all, we were not the architects <Col N="2598" /> of the managerial system.  The managerial system was instituted before our time and there are members over there who were responsible for the Government of the country when the managerial system was first introduced.  I was a member of the Opposition then. I admit that we adopted it and extended it to the country but we were not the only people responsible for it. I am not trying to shed myself of responsibility for the County Management Act but it is only right that the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary should remember, in talking about the County Management Act, that they have in their own ranks the people who are the architects of that whole system.</P>
    <P>I would invite the Minister to be serious on this matter.  I say, as one with a little experience of local bodies, that if there ever was a function that could be suitably carried out by a local body, it is the function that local bodies will be called upon to carry out under this Bill.  There is no other matter on which a local body is so well equipped to express an opinion as on the order of priority or on the question of what works should be carried out.  They have the county surveyor there to advise them as to the utility of the work and as to the damage that might arise. If there is any duty which a local authority is properly designed to perform it is to express an opinion on these matters and this whole bogey of amending the County Management Act does not arise at all.  This is a new power we are giving to local bodies and we should leave the County Management Act out of it.  We are simply suggesting, without reference to the County Management Act, that the majority of the county council will have the right to say which work will be carried out and the order in which works will be carried out.  If there is a really tangible argument to be advanced, apart from this flippant type of stuff to which we have been treated, I invite the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary to come down to earth and to be serious about it.</P>

      <P>The arguments advanced in support of this amendment are more reasonable, or perhaps I should say more plausible, than those <Col N="2599" /> to which we were treated on the previous amendments put forward.  I think the answer to the point made by Deputy Smith is that, as instanced by the Parliamentary Secretary, there will be consultations with the county council.  In the second place, were this amendment to be accepted, it would be possible&mdash;I am not saying it would be done&mdash;to render some of the effects which it is intended to achieve by this Bill completely nugatory.  Generally speaking, in considering any piece of legislation, I think it is wise for a Government not to attempt to deal in a piecemeal fashion with the question but to deal with it in one particular piece of legislation.</P>
      <P>I am glad to hear that the County Management Act will be amended and that in the near future.  One thing that does strike me&mdash;and I wonder it does not strike Deputies opposite&mdash;is the complete incongruity of their position in seeking to give additional powers to the local authority or in having any concern over the withholding of power from the local authority because, when in office, the policy they pursued was completely the reverse.</P>

      <P>Good enough.  The Parliamentary Secretary talked about this amendment amending the County Management Act.  I want to challenge that.  It amends it in no possible way. The Parliamentary Secretary is further aware that in both the County Management Act itself and in subsequent enactments by this House, many reserved functions were mentioned. That occurred even in legislation that became the law of this country years after the passing of the Management Act.  I can see that under this Bill the executive authority will rest with the Department of Local Government, the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary and with nobody else.  They will have the final say as to whether a particular job&mdash;it does not matter whether it is to cost £5 or £5,000&mdash;will be carried out.  The works will have to be sanctioned by the Minister.  The Minister for Local Government will be the executive authority under this Bill and nobody else.  The machinery which the local authorities will operate under this Act is the ordinary machinery they operate in regard to minor relief schemes, rural improvement schemes and a number of other schemes at the present time.  There is no doubt about that.  There has been a lot of hullabaloo beyond about all the powers which are given to local authorities under this Bill and a lot of nonsense because under sub-section (3) new work is to be performed that never was the function of local authorities before.  The passing of this amendment will give local authorities&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It just enables local authorities to put schemes in the order of priority they think right and if their name was not in it the Bill would enable the county manager to put them in the order of priority he thinks right.  Is that not so?  I contend that in accepting this amendment the Government are affecting in no way whatever the County Management Act.  It is there for all the good that is in it and for all the bad that is in it.  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that local authorities are just as quick as county managers to get work done and I would appeal to the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary at least to reconsider this matter&mdash;that is all I am asking them to do&mdash;between this and the Report Stage.  No principle is involved as far as local authorities are concerned. With or without the amendment they will get support and help to get work done.  I want to stress that the authority lies in the Minister for Local Government and that is quite right when, as the Parliamentary Secretary has said, he is providing the money.  I want to kill the contention that I am amending the County Management Act.</P>

      <P>All I want to say is that the County Management Act has nothing whatsoever to do with this amendment. If the Minister is anxious that the works under this Bill will be carried out quickly he should seriously consider this amendment.  Local authorities exercise many useful functions notwithstanding the County Management Act and very many people have not changed their minds in connection with that Act.  This particular function of deciding on these works is a function designed for a local authority. Members of local authorities coming from the areas concerned will be in a much better position to judge whether one work is more important than another than the Minister or some <Col N="2603" /> of his officials in the Department.  They will know which work should get priority.  If it is estimated that some work may cause damage or that it is too large to be undertaken in one year they, knowing local conditions, are in a much better position to decide according to those conditions which work should be undertaken in this year and which should be left over.  We know that all the works which come under this Bill cannot be done in one year, particularly the works under the second part of the Bill which, to my mind, from the local authorities point of view is by far the most important part.  Under the second part local authorities will deal with works on property not their own.  Although the Parliamentary Secretary may, as he says, give the full grant for the actual execution of the works in one particular year, the local authority might not be in a position to carry out all those works.  As far as I can see, local authorities are now going to take over the function of the Board of Works in connection with drainage and that being so, we know that a considerable amount of survey work and spade work will be involved before schemes can be done.</P>
      <P>I want the Parliamentary Secretary to realise that if that work is left to the local authority it will be far better for the Minister and his Department in the long run.  If the local authority in its wisdom decides to go ahead with certain works this year and leave others to next year the door will not be left open to the suggestion regarding the Parliamentary Secretary or the Minister that somebody came to the Department behind the back of the local authority and succeeded in getting a certain work done while another urgent work was left undone.  That will be the position if the amendment is accepted and it has nothing to do with the County Management Act at all.  This Bill gives new functions to local authorities and new work will be done and in handing over these new works I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to authorise the local authorities to say that the most urgent works should be done first.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BryanMylesBrady" hpid="Mr. B. Brady Mr. B. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>A further point that <Col N="2604" /> has not been made yet in support of this amendment is that, even under the County Management Act, with all its defects, the initiation of public works must come from the local authority.  If they decide to carry out a certain scheme, it is obligatory on the county manager to make the necessary arrangements to have the scheme carried out.  Therefore, it is not asking too much that the initiation of schemes under this Bill should be in the hands of the local authority.</P>
      <P>We had a revelation here from Deputy Lehane&mdash;I am sorry he has gone out&mdash;who, so far as I know, has no knowledge of local authorities.  He is not a member of one.  He says that, if the powers we seek in this amendment were given to local authorities, it is possible to render some of the effects of this Bill nugatory.  I would like to have a repudiation from the Minister that he is afraid that if he gave these powers to local authorities they would render the effects of some parts of this Bill nugatory.  I believe that is a reflection on the local authorities. In any legislation passed through this House that affected them&mdash;no matter what Government was in office &mdash;the experience has been that the members of local authorities have cooperated and given all the assistance they could in putting the legislation into effect, whenever they thought it would help some of the ills affecting their district or county.  For a man with no experience of a local authority, not even a member of one, to make that charge against the members of local authorities on the whole, is not a very creditable performance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to be useless to appeal to the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary to reconsider their attitude on this particular matter.  Deputy Allen asked a very important question and the Parliamentary Secretary promised to answer it but, whether he overlooked it or not, he did not answer it when he was replying&mdash;that is, what executive function would the county manager exercise in connection with these schemes.  It is obvious that he has very little power or function so far as this Bill is concerned.  It is a question as to whether the Minister could transfer <Col N="2605" /> some of the powers he has under the County Management Act to him to exercise under this.</P>
    <P>I hope that the reason for not giving the local authorities power to promulgate schemes and have the say in the priority and as to how they are to be carried out, is not the reason given by <Col N="2606" /> Deputy Lehane.  I think the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary are making a mistake in not giving to the members of the local authorities the power that we ask them to give in this particular amendment.</P>

      <P>(1)  Where a local authority proposes to execute works under Section 2 it shall give to the Commissioners of Public Works notice of its intention to do so.  Such notice shall be addressed to the Commissioners so as to be received by them not less than six clear weeks before the date on which it is proposed to execute the works and shall be accompanied by such plans and other documents as will show accurately the nature and extent of the proposed works.</P>

    <P>(2)  On receipt of the notice prescribed by the foregoing sub-section the Commissioners of Public Works shall inform as soon as may be, but in any case not later than ten clear days after receipt of the prescribed notice, every other local authority, <Col N="2608" /> statutory board, authority or undertaking the interests of which in the opinion of the commissioners are likely to be affected by the nature and extent of the proposed works.</P>
    <P>(3)  Within 21 days after the day on which it receives notice from the Commissioners of Public Works in accordance with the foregoing sub-section any authority which is of opinion that its interests are likely to be adversely affected by the execution of the proposed works may lodge notice of objection with the commissioners.  Every notice of objection lodged by a local authority under this sub-section shall state cleraly and precisely the grounds of such objection and shall be accompanied by such data, including maps and documents as are necessary to substantiate it.</P>
    <P>(4)  On receipt of every such notice of objection as aforesaid the Commissioners of Public Works shall refer such notice of objection and the grounds therefor to their officers, who shall report thereon to the commissioners in due course.</P>
    <P>(5)  When the Commissioners of Public Works have received the reports of their officers as aforesaid upon all the objections lodged to the execution of the proposed works, they shall consider all such notices of objection in the light of the prescribed reports and if in their opinion there are reasonable grounds for any or all of such objections they shall convene a conference of the representatives of all the local authorities concerned with the objections and of the local authority proposing to execute the works.  Such conference shall be presided over by a person appointed by the Commissioners of Public Works to take the chair and conduct proceedings at the conference.</P>
    <P>(6)  A local authority which participates in a conference, convened by the Commissioners of Public Works under the foregoing sub-section (5) of this section, shall be represented thereat by two elected members, together with the county manager or manager or some person deputed by him, and the principal engineering <Col N="2609" /> officer or adviser of the local authority or some person deputed by him.</P>
    <P>(7)  When a conference which has been convened by the Commissioners of Public Works under the foregoing sub-section assembles, it shall consider the proposed works and shall endeavour to formulate agreed proposals in regard to them.</P>
    <P>(8)  If and when the chairman appointed under sub-section 5 of this section forms the opinion that it is unlikely that agreed proposals will be formulated by the conference, he shall express such opinion to the conference and shall intimate that if agreement upon proposals be not reached within one hour he proposes to adjourn the conference and to report back to the Commissioners of Public Works.

    <P>(9)  On receipt of the report of a chairman of a conference convened under the foregoing sub-section that the conference concerned has failed to reach agreement the Commissioners of Public Works shall consider the works proposed to be executed and the objections which have been lodged thereto and shall make such proposals for changes in the works proposed as in their judgment are reasonable in the light of the aforesaid objections and shall circulate such proposals to all the authorities represented at the conference for their consideration provided always that if the commissioners decide that the objections lodged to the proposed works are insuperable or that it is not in the public interest that the proposed works should be executea they shall not make proposals for the amendment of the works, but instead shall proceed to act as prescribed in sub-section (10).</P>
    <P>(10)  If the Commissioners of Public Works, having considered the proposed works and the objections lodged thereto in accordance with sub-section (9) of this section, decide <Col N="2610" /> that the objections lodged to the proposed works are insuperable or that it is not in the public interest to execute such works, they shall convey such decision to the local authority proposing to execute the works and thereupon the decision of the local authority to execute the proposed works shall be deemed to be rescinded and such works shall not be proceeded with.</P>
    <P>(11)  If the Commissioners of Public Works acting under sub-section (9) make proposals for changes in the works proposed, the conference prescribed in sub-section (5) shall be reconvened and the proposals of the commissioners shall be submitted for its consideration.  The conference shall thereupon consider the proposals of the commissioners and in relation thereto shall decide</P>
    <P>(a)  to accept the proposals of the commissioners, or</P>
    <P>(b)  to submit amendments to them for the further consideration of the commissioners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>If the members of the Government Parties succeed in strangling No. 11, they may do a great deal of damage in the country.  We hope to get their assistance in preventing this potential damage being done.  The Parliamentary Secretary to-day said that all the works proposed by county managers would be vetted in his Department and I take it his engineering staff or his staff, at any rate, will go through these various proposals and say whether or not they should be carried out.  We had a Drainage Commission which sat for a long time and went very thoroughly into all this question of drainage.  They made certain recommendations.  One of their principal recommendations, which was generally accepted by the Dáil, was that there should be a central authority to co-ordinate and supervise all drainage construction operations and that in the opinion of that commission the central drainage authority should be a separate and self-contained branch of the Office of Public Works.  That is from the Drainage Report, page 37. That Drainage Commission Report and various other authorities who have considered the question of drainage in all its aspects advise due caution and well-prepared plans before drainage is entered upon.  The Department of Local Government is organised to do certain engineering jobs.  Their engineers are very efficient in passing judgment on proposals for new roads, new bridges, housing schemes, because in all these works they have had great experience.  Up to this date they have had practically no experience of drainage and it is the experience of everybody who has had to deal with the question of drainage that the technical people dealing with it should be not only engineers but drainage engineers. This amendment is suggesting that instead of proposals for drainage being submitted to the engineers non-technically expert in drainage matters, instead of being submitted to the Department of Local Government, they should be submitted to the best technical people we have in the country in drainage, and their address is the Office of Public Works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance replied to some <Col N="2613" /> local proposals for drainage in one case that we quoted before&mdash;they have replied, I am sure, in similar terms to other proposals for drainage over a long number of years&mdash;that they would not undertake certain work because they knew the danger involved in it. They made one mistake some years ago, a very big one.  They were pressed to do a drainage work which resulted in grave damage and very little benefit and, for a number of years, to my knowledge, they have steadfastly refused to release water upstream unless they know that they would be able to handle it downstream and convey it to the sea without flooding other land and creating greater damage than the damage they were relieving.</P>
    <P>This amendment suggests, therefore, seeing that drainage works proposed by local authorities have to be referred to Dublin, that instead of referring them to the non-technically expert Department of Local Government, they should be referred to the Office of Public Works which is our main drainage authority, from whom this Dáil has to seek advice on drainage questions through the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance.  It proposes, therefore, that the matter should be referred to the Office of Public Works and that the Office of Public Works upon receipt of a proposal should consult all other authorities that in their opinion might be affected as a result of the execution of the work; that if they thought an adjoining local authority would be affected, they should consult it; if they thought a fishery authority or the Electricity Supply Board or any other authority you like to mention might be affected through the carrying out of the drainage, such authority and all the authorities concerned should be taken into consultation.  It sets out procedure as to how this consultation should take place.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Parliamentary Secretary very strongly to accept this amendment.  If he does not accept it, I think we will find that in certain instances at any rate a great deal of damage will be done by engineers inexperienced in this business for which <Col N="2614" /> the local ratepayers will have to pay according to the Bill as it now stands, and that portion of the Bill which has already been passed by this Dáil.  It is not fair to local ratepayers to burden them with bills for damage without at least having given them the most expert advice that we can give them. The most expert advice this State can give on drainage matters is to be obtained in the Office of Public Works from engineers specially selected for that purpose, engineers who have had long experience not only in the successful execution of works but sometimes in the unsuccessful execution of works.  It is by mistakes sometimes that people become really expert.  Are we to start this year by having to change our drainage authority to the Department of Local Government?  Will the ratepayers of this country have to educate the engineers in that Department and will they be mulcted for large damages and then come to the doorstep of the Custom House and, knocking very loudly, demand from the Minister that as they went ahead with his O.K. he should now come to their assistance and bear the cost of the damage involved.  It is thought by some people who have no knowledge of drainage matters that the only damage you can do by releasing water upstream is to flood somebody downstream.  But other grave damage can be inflicted. You can lower the whole water-table in a certain region so that farmers will have no water for their cattle and that the wells will dry up.  That has been the experience of many authorities that have carried out drainage works.</P>
    <P>It has been the experience not only here but in other countries too.  If inexpert drainage is to take place&mdash;particularly under sub-section (3) of Section 2&mdash;on property not belonging to the local authority, grave damage may be done to the level of the water-table in certain regions and you may have a shortage of water for cattle and for human beings.  To the city person that does not seem very much. They see some swamp drained and they think that some great good has been accomplished.  But to the farmers in a district who are depending for water for the cattle on keeping the watertable <Col N="2615" /> at a certain level&mdash;which will result at certain times of the year in flooding in a certain marsh&mdash;the disappearance of that water might mean that they might have to go four or five miles for water for their cattle and not only for water for their cattle but for water for their household.  There are other amendments here, dealing with the lowering of the water-table to that extent, which we shall come to deal with afterwards.  However, in view of the expertness of the decision that has to be taken before anybody can proceed with the drainage work in the reasonable expectation that less damage will be done than has been cured by it, it is reasonable, I think, to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to accept this amendment of Deputy MacEntee's and I hope he will see his way to do it.  After all, as I said, these schemes have to be submitted to Dublin.  What I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to do is to see that the schemes are submitted to drainage experts rather than to engineers or civil servants who are not expert in drainage problems.</P>

      <P>If I thought that there was the merest possibility of the Parliamentary Secretary entertaining seriously any thought of accepting this amendment I should never find myself able to have the slightest confidence in him again.  It is perfectly clear what is intended by this amendment.  What is intended by it is to strangle this Bill in red tape.  I do not want to weary the House by analysing it, but the whole tenor of it is delay and red tape &mdash;a notice is to be addressed to the commissioners so as to be received by them not less than six clear weeks before the date on which it is proposed to execute the works...; then a further possible delay of a period of ten days; a further possible delay, under sub-section (3) of three weeks, within which period objection may be lodged; then the objections are to be referred to the officers of the Board of Works; the officers are to have them for some unspecified period and they are to report to the commissioners&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in due course. Then, if we are to accept the amendment, there is to be a conference, with an elaborate procedure for convening it.  The findings of that conference can be again referred back to the commissioners and the commissioners can sit on the findings of the conference to decide whether they will amend them or refuse to entertain them altogether. I think it is an insult to this House to seriously put that amendment forward. Deputy Aiken knows perfectly well, with the wide experience he has had of these matters, that this Bill is not a Bill to carry out arterial drainage.  I would refer him to Clause 3 of the explanatory memorandum which reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The works which the local authority may carry out include the making of drains, the clearing of obstructions in and the widening and deepening of watercourses and the making or repairing of walls or embankments.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that what were intended to be dealt with under this Bill were minor watercourses.  This Bill was not intended to be portion of an arterial drainage scheme.  Deputy Aiken's gloomy prophesies&mdash;which would lead one to believe that he had already started to build his Ark in order to prepare for the flooding he said he expected&mdash;would certainly, I suggest, leave most Deputies cold.  If the Dáil were to accept this amendment, I submit in all seriousness that it would take as long as 12 months for the local authority to remove the dead carcass of a dog from a stream.  Deputy Aiken made these gloomy prophesies. He talked about the farmers' knowledge of these problems and of the fact that expert advice should be secured on them.  With that, of course, every Deputy on this side of the House is in complete agreement.  However, <Col N="2617" /> there seems to exist in the minds of the Deputies on the benches opposite the idea that we have no competent engineers in the employ of the local authorities.  I do not believe that that is so.  I may be speaking in abysmal ignorance but I believe there are competent engineers working for the local authorities throughout the country.  I certainly do not conceive for a minute that there is a possibility that the Minister is going to entertain this amendment seriously, but, if he was, I would certainly urge upon him that he should get any idea like that out of his head.  From my week-end contacts with the country and with the farming community&mdash;I will be told they are not as close as those which Deputy Smith and Deputy Aiken have&mdash;I have formed the opinion that the farmers want this Bill and want it in its present form.</P>

      <P>I am somewhat surprised that Deputy Lehane, who is a lawyer, should invite us to take the statements made here on the Second Reading by the Minister who introduced the measure or the Parliamentary Secretary or any other speaker rather than what is provided for in the Bill.  The amendments which we seek to induce the House to accept and which are said to be deliberately obstructive and creating red tape have been placed on the Order Paper because of the confusion which seems to exist as to what this Bill really intends to achieve.  Deputy Lehane has assured us that it is not a drainage Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>He then proceeds to refer to the Long Title, in which mention is made of the fact that streams, rivers and watercourses can be altered and changed.  On the other hand, last night we had from the Parliamentary Secretary an assurance that of the £2,000,000 worth of schemes already submitted some 70 or 80 per cent. dealt largely with protective works designed to raise the level of roads and protect county council property and so on.  I am at a loss to know if I am to have any regard for the statements made as to <Col N="2618" /> what is meant by the Bill.  I do not know where I stand.</P>
      <P>When I turn to sub-section (3) of Section 2 I see there that the local authority is being given power to deal with drainage problems.  Whether they decide to do so or not, the power is being conferred upon them to deal with these problems.  It is all very well for Deputies to say that we are endeavouring to put around this Bill all sorts of red tape in order to cause delay.  I do not say that my knowledge of rural conditions is greater than Deputy Lehane's.  What I am concerned about is some machinery, some safeguards which are necessary because of the provisions of Section 2 (3).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to analyse the amendment to see if it could not be watered down.  As a layman, I know that this amendment aims at placing on the local authority some responsibility to see that people whose lands might be affected adversely as a result of certain works that might be carried out will have some breathing space in which to look around and see what is likely to occur.  Because of the situation of the land I own, I happen to be in a position to demonstrate to Deputies who may be in doubt the ill-effects that certain ill-conceived small works might have upon my own interests.</P>
      <P>It is not correct to say as Deputy Lehane said that the powers which are being given to local authorities only give them the right to deal with small streams.  A stream, no matter how small it is, after passing over three or four or five miles of country must ultimately get to some drainage catchment. Even the simplest sort of drainage work must lead to some little stream.  That stream will lead to a larger river and the larger river will lead to a main artery.  Mr. Holmes in his report some months ago advised the Government that they should be careful to proceed with drainage problems from the right end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not fair for Deputies simply to make the allegation that in drafting an amendment like this the one <Col N="2619" /> thought we had in mind was to fight a sort of delaying action.  I invite the Minister, the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Lehane and others who may address themselves to this matter to read Section 50 of the Drainage Act of 1945.  They will find that section compels local authorities to notify the drainage authority of their intention to build a bridge over a river or to reconstruct a bridge over a river.  It places not only upon local bodies but other authorities the legal obligation of giving notice of their intention to engage in any work in or adjacent to any river or stream in any catchment area.  Speaking as a layman, I think when you read this section you will see that even so far as sub-sections (1) and (2) of Section 2 of this Bill are concerned in which we are giving power to local authorities to carry out protective work on bridges and to prevent flooding on roads we are not relieving them of the obligation to notify the drainage authority which is mentioned in the amendment we are now moving as the authority to which all problems should first of all be submitted before carrying out any work.  Section 50 of the Drainage Act, 1945, is entitled &ldquo;Restrictions on the construction or alteration of bridges&rdquo; and reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1)  No local authority, no railway company, canal company, or other similar body, and no industrial concern shall construct any new bridge or alter, reconstruct, or restore any existing bridge over any watercourse without the consent of the commissioners or otherwise than in accordance with plans previously approved of by the commissioners.</P>
    <P>(2)  If any person shall construct or begin to construct or partially construct a new bridge in contravention of this section, the comissioners may serve by post on such person a notice requiring him&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  if such bridge has not been completely constructed, to desist forthwith from the construction thereof,</P>
    <P>(b)  in any case, to remove, within a time specified in that behalf <Col N="2620" /> in such notice, such bridge or so much thereof as shall have been constructed.</P>
    <P>(3)  If any person shall alter, reconstruct, or restore an existing bridge in contravention of this section or shall begin so to do or shall partially so do, the commissioners may serve by post on such person a notice requiring him&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  if such alteration, reconstruction, or restoration has not been completed, to desist forthwith therefrom, or</P>
    <P>(b)  in any case, to remove, within a time specified in that behalf in such notice, all work done on such bridge, or</P>
    <P>(c)  in any case, within a time specified in that behalf in such notice, to restore such bridge to its original condition.</P>
    <P>(4)  If any person on whom a notice has been served by the commissioners under the foregoing provisions of this section fails to comply with such notice, the following provisions shall apply and have effect, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  such person shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable, on summary conviction thereof, to a fine not exceeding fifty pounds together with a further fine not exceeding five pounds for every day during which such failure is continued;&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The point I want to make is that in so far as sub-section (1) and sub-section (2) of Section 2 of this Bill are concerned, which propose to <Col N="2621" /> give power to local authorities to carry out certain works on property, the maintenance and so on for which they have responsibility, they are obliged by Section 50 of the Arterial Drainage Act to give notice of their intention, to supply the drainage authority with their plans and other documents in connection with these proposals.  That section definitely obliges them to submit that evidence to the drainage authority.  I would like some such safeguard to be inserted in this measure to ensure that, in regard to sub-section (3) of Section 2, local authorities would be obliged to notify the drainage authority of their intention to carry out any work under that sub-section and to have their approval as it will be necessary in other cases to have that approval before the work can proceed.</P>
      <P>There has undoubtedly been an enormous amount of loose talk as to what could be done under this Bill, in the course of the Second Reading.  I actually heard one Deputy on the Government side complimenting those who had framed those proposals on the ground that they created 26, I think, different drainage authorities.  It is all very well to make a boast of that kind, but from the point of view of the practical working of a Bill of this kind when it becomes an Act, that could only result in confusion; that is, if work is to be undertaken under sub-section (3) of Section 2.  Certainly the power is being given under that sub-section to local bodies to engage in it whether they do or not and we must assume that it must be the intention of somebody that they will take advantage of that power.  It is only reasonable that those of us who see in that provision an enormous amount of danger for many landholders in this country should desire that they will be given the same protection other bodies are provided with under the section of the Arterial Drainage Act to which I have just referred.</P>

I have no love of defending protracted procedure so <Col N="2622" /> far as any Minister or Parliamentary Secretary wanting to engage in work, having work done and giving employment and so on, is concerned.  However, there is no use in our proceeding on the basis that just for the sake of speed alone other very important matters will not be considered.  Whatever time is necessary to give normal consideration to the interests I have in mind, then that provision should be made.  I give this assurance.  I do not know whether we could simplify that amendment while at the same time inserting in this measure the idea that I have endeavoured to express here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had at my finger-tips some years ago a clearer knowledge of the dangers that would result from indiscriminate and careless carrying out of work of this fashion.  There is no use in trying to represent me as saying that men are incompetent and so on.  With regard to engineers and people who have spent a life-time in studying these problems, as Deputy Aiken has said, the best of them will make mistakes and many of them will become knowledgeable as a result of having made mistakes in the past.  You can misrepresent my words if you like, but what I am really saying is that in tampering with the course of water you are dealing with something that is far more dangerous and difficult than constructing roads and building houses. I happen to live in a district in which the damage that small drainage schemes can do has been demonstrated to me more than once.  As I have contended and as it can be proved, whether you start at the top or not and no matter how simple the scheme, it must ultimately go into the heart of some catchment area.  If that catchment area is not in a proper condition to receive it those whose lands are situated there will undoubtedly suffer. I have had that demonstrated to me and I am pleading with the Government, the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary to give us some assurance that they will accept this amendment No. 11 or any of the other amendments that are being covered in the course of this discussion.  If they will not do that will they give some assurance that they will afford to those who may be affected the same protection, <Col N="2623" /> consideration and examination that is provided for in the section of the Arterial Drainage Act of 1945 to which I have referred and which, in my view, will compel the local body to whom we are giving these powers in relation to their own property to inform the drainage authority of what they intend to do.  If they are obliged to do that in regard to the property of the county council, the local authority and corporation then I ask to do the same in relation to my property.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lehane went to the trouble of analysing the amendment. I think the most effective reply to the amendment would be to read it in its entirety.  Deputy Smith has made a rather unfortunate selection. He selected the Arterial Drainage Act of 1945.  That Act did not come into operation until 1948.  I should hope that this Bill we are now producing will not have that period of waiting when we go to operate it.</P>
      <P>The scope of the measure has been fairly clearly indicated.  I do not think there is any substance in the fears that have been expressed by Deputy Smith. Like him, I come from a county where we have a considerable number of small rivers and small streams.  I am hoping that there will be some improvement effected in these under the terms of this Bill.  I am perfectly certain that if we were to adopt the amendment, or even the principle of it, we would be spiking the operation of this measure. As Deputy Lehane pointed out, there would have to be long waiting periods and conferences and a going back for the holding of further conferences, so that really nothing could be done. There has been a good deal of talk about the public interest.  We had discussions earlier as to who had the right to determine the public interest.  The acceptance of this amendment would certainly deprive the local authorities, or even the Dáil, of the right to determine that question and would vest it in the Commissioners of Public Works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What amazes me are the protestations that we have been hearing from the benches opposite that they are not obstructing this measure, and that they are perfectly honest in their handling <Col N="2624" /> of it.  How anybody can still protest to be helping in regard to this Bill and at the same time stand over an amendment such as this is quite beyond me. The acceptance of the amendment would completely negative the intention of the Bill.  We would have all the red tape that has been described by Deputy Lehane.  If a local authority wanted to do one of the minor things set out in the Bill, then under this amendment any crank could come along and make an objection and there would follow from that all the rigmarole that is set out in the amendment.  The fact is that the local authority would be prevented from doing the simplest piece of work.</P>
    <P>It is not fair to compare this Bill with the Arterial Drainage Act.  There is another measure that I would like to refer to, because I had experience of it as a member of a local authority. I refer to the Arterial Drainage Minor Schemes Act of 1928 under which work up to the value of £1,000 could be done. It was not a continuing measure. I was assured by county engineers, when I was a member of a local authority, that work of a most beneficial nature in the way of relieving flooding was done under that Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg your pardon. There was work done on the Awbeg and on portion of the Morning Star. I was approached by county surveyors at the time to try and get the Government to sanction schemes up to the value of £2,000 under that Act.  As I have said, under it work up to the value of £1,000 could be done.  It was a most beneficial Act.  There was no question under that Act of reporting back to the Commissioners of Public Works.  The only thing to be regretted about that Act was that it was not continued in operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with this Bill it has to be remembered that if any awkward case arises there will be consultation between my Department and the Commissioners of Public Works.  There is no question of friction or of one working against the other.  This matter <Col N="2625" /> has been discussed with the Commissioners of Public Works.  They are perfectly agreeable to the proposals set down under the Bill.  They know what is contemplated and, as I say, if an awkward case arises there will be consultation between the two bodies. The one object that this amendment could achieve, if it were accepted, would be completely to negative the possibility of any useful work being done.  In fact, if the amendment were accepted, we could drop the Bill.</P>

      <P>I have been prompted to speak by the remarks made by Deputy Aiken.  During the last two days I have been listening to the Jeremiahs opposite weeping over the ratepayers and the public bodies. What was the purpose and tenor of Deputy Aiken's speech on this amendment? It was this, that all such works should be referred to Dublin so that expert advice would be secured in contradiction of the county engineer and the assistant county engineers.  Are those who have been on a public board in a county for 20 or 25 years not supposed to have sufficient experience to enable them to make representations with regard to the carrying out of works under this Bill?  I do not like to talk in a derogatory manner about any Department, but Deputy Aiken appears to make the suggestion seriously that expert advice should first be got from Dublin.  Even though Deputy Smith sheds tears to-night for the ratepayers, his memory cannot be so short as to forget something that was carried out under his administration in my county.  When he was Parliamentary Secretary he thought very little of the ratepayers and of the riparian owners in our county.  He wants to repeat the same thing under this amendment.  Deputy Smith, when he was Parliamentary Secretary of a Department, made a contractual obligation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

That is the advice that is now given to me as a member of a public body, at a time when I have before me the recent history of work that was carried out in my county on the advice of the body referred to by the Deputy.  The ratepayers in my county, because of the inefficient work that was done on the advice of that body, were mulcted to the tune of £40,000.  That happened within my county within a fairly recent period. Now we are being asked to do the very same thing under this amendment. Will that experience of ours impress Deputy Aiken's sense of justice?  I believe that this is an insincere amendment that was spoken to by the Deputy.  When Deputy Smith was Parliamentary Secretary we made a contract with him&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It was accepted in my county with general applause.  Not alone was it received with gratifying feelings, but at our meeting last Saturday it was the unanimous decision of the council to ask the county surveyor and ten of his assistants immediately to make a survey of the east and west of the county so as to have everything in order when this Bill becomes law.  It should have been law for the past month.  Our people down there are anxious that when the Bill becomes law it will come into operation as soon as possible.</P>

In the western portion of my constituency the flooding conditions have developed with a dangerous continuity, if you like, and 1,000 farmers last summer, through <Col N="2627" /> purely voluntary effort, with their own shovels and spades, cleared ten miles of river.  They had the help of some engineers.  Having done that ten miles at a cost of a £5 note&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>A thousand farmers. seeing the destruction that was done over a number of years through the silting up of the river bed, and knowing that the Arterial Drainage Act would not reach them for 20 years, decided to act for themselves.  This inspired the Minister and the Government that something else was needed to treat this situation in a tentative kind of way in order to relieve the obvious obstructions caused by rock and bushes across the river.  These were the things the farmers in this locality had not machinery to remove, but they set about it in their own way.</P>
      <P>The same applies to the Maigue.  The previous Minister went down there and realised that something should be done in the interim before the Act would reach that area.  It was Deputy Moylan who promised them that if his Government were returned to power one of the first things to be done would be to attend to the Maigue area in the interim before the Act would reach that quarter.  If he did not do something there would be no Adare there now&mdash;at least the part contiguous to the river&mdash;and there would be no Croom there either.  The statistical returns submitted by one of the most capable and brilliant engineers in the south showed that 20,000 acres were rendered unproductive.</P>

      <P>According to Deputy Aiken, all these schemes will have to be submitted to Dublin.  I am in total disagreement with that view.  An action started in my county cost the ratepayers £40,000.  The whole thing was brought up in the High Court.  Now we are told by Deputy Aiken that we will <Col N="2629" /> have to go up to Dublin through the same medium asking them to do a similar kind of work and it might inflict on the ratepayers and the riparian owners very serious charges by way of taxation and rates.  I think the Deputy ought to have the decency to withdraw that.</P>
      <P>I do not know of any measure that came before my council for the past 24 years that was received with such welcome. There was not one word of contention. It was accepted unanimously. That is so all over the country, too, and why then should we have the Fianna Fáil Party adopting the attitude of delaying such a great measure instead of helping it so as to bring the farmers some measure of happiness and large areas of land into greater fertility?

      <P>The engineer in Limerick will not be able to take his levels and go ahead with the work and send the bill here.  He will first have to send the scheme here.  My objection is that it will go to a Department that is not expected and that could not be expected to have the same knowledge of solving these problems as the Department that has had all the successes and all the failures&mdash;the Office of Public Works.  The Minister has flatly turned down Deputy MacEntee's amendment. He will not have this procedure.  He is very careful to explain at the same time that this is not an arterial drainage scheme.  He did not give any definition of what an arterial drainage scheme is as opposed to a minor drainage scheme.  But I have a couple of amendments here which are designed to ensure that when anything other than a minor drainage scheme is embarked upon it will be referred to the Office of Public Works which is the <Col N="2630" /> drainage authority set up by this Dáil.</P>
      <P>In amendment No. 12 I propose that no scheme will be undertaken where the cost is more than £500 without submission to the drainage authority of the State&mdash;the Office of Public Works.  In amendment No. 13 I propose that no scheme will go ahead where the damage likely to be sustained in the functional area of the local authority is more than £5,000 or, elsewhere, £2,500.  If the Parliamentary Secretary will not accept Deputy MacEntee's amendment, then those two amendments that I propose give him an opportunity of assuring the ratepayers that they will not be mulcted with heavy costs through ill-judged drainage schemes.  If the Parliamentary Secretary accepts these amendments the ratepayers will have that assurance.  The county council will then notify if there is likely to be more than £5,000 worth of damage done by any particular scheme within their own functional area or £2,500 worth of damage elsewhere.  It is only right that a county council should do less damage in a neighbouring county than it does in its own.  That is the reason why I propose that if a scheme will result in £2,500 worth of damage to a neighbouring county the county council must seek permission for the scheme from the drainage authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent winters we heard much about the damage done by floods.  We all know that Kilkenny was under a couple of feet of water for a few days. We all know that there were letters to the Press and telegrams to Ministers and T.D's.  We know that deputations came up to Dublin.  All that activity arose because of the damage done by a couple of feet of water in County Kilkenny for a couple of days.  No doubt there was a certain amount of damage done, but what will happen if we embark upon schemes, without opening our eyes to the actual position and without opening our ears to the expert advice, under which we may have not a couple of feet of water for a couple of days but ten feet of water for ten weeks.  That could happen.  I propose, therefore, some limitation to the damage that may be done by local engineers with the approval of the Department of Local Government.  I <Col N="2631" /> propose that where they undertake works of £500 that they must be submitted to the proper drainage authority and if there is a possibility of damage of more than £5,000 in their own area, or £2,500 elsewhere, the simpler procedure be followed.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 14 is another amendment which I think the Minister could accept because it gives some little guarantee to the ratepayers in the various districts.  The amendment states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A local authority shall not without the prior sanction of the Commissioners of Public Works execute under this Act a drainage scheme where the cost of such scheme exceeds £250 if the effect of such scheme shall be to increase substantially the flow of water into the functional area of another local authority.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In regard to this matter, I shall deal now with amendment No. 42, which is slightly different from the others.  I shall deal with it now and we will get the whole thing over as soon as we can. The purpose of this amendment is to empower the Commissioners of Public Works, who have knowledge of drainage problems generally, where they are satisfied upon the report of their chief engineering officer that serious flooding is likely to occur if additional waters are drained into a river basin, by order under this section, to schedule such river basin as a prohibitive river basin.  Then there is power to alter that scheduling as conditions change. That is a very necessary authority to give to the Office of Public Works. Take the Owenmore river into which the Board of Works refused to let the Kilshanny river be drained until the Owenmore was first improved.  This amendment would give to the Office of Public Works the right to schedule the Owenmore basin and to say that until such time as that basin is improved they will not permit more waters to flow into it and cause damage, as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance pointed out in the letter we quoted, to be done by such excess waters.  Surely it is not obstructive to ask the Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="2632" /> to give the people who reside in dangerous river basins some assurance that there is not going to be a flood of water pouring in upon them because of several little schemes costing a few hundred or a couple of thousand pounds.  Kilkenny was subjected to a couple of feet of water for a few days. With several little schemes costing a few hundred or a couple of thousand pounds there would be danger of a sudden inrush of water into the Nore thereby increasing the flood level considerably and protracting the duration of such flood over a very much longer period.  There should be some assurance that that will not happen.  It is no use the Parliamentary Secretary telling me that all that will be done in the ordinary way by Departmental consultation.  We want a little better assurance than that.</P>
    <P>If it is going to be done by ordinary inter-Departmental consultation, why not give the people an assurance that it is going to be done?  The Minister's and the Parliamentary Secretary's statement that that will be done gives no assurance to those people who might be adversely affected in the future and it gives them no right to compensation. If we put this amendment into the Bill then the individuals adversely affected will have some right to claim compensation for the damage inflicted upon them.  If the Parliamentary Secretary will not go through the procedure outlined in Deputy MacEntee's amendment No. 11 which is not by any stretch of imagination as frivolous as Deputy Lehane tries to make out&mdash; after all the Government cannot be in such a hurry about this Bill as they pretend; it was the 23rd February when they introduced it and we are not responsible for the fact that the Committee Stage has only been reached in the first week in June&mdash;will the Parliamentary Secretary not undertake to give the smaller assurances to the people that are involved in my amendment? I hope the Government will accept either one or the other.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another angle to this that I should like to suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary particulary in dealing with some of Deputy <Col N="2633" /> Aiken's amendments.  In the main, what is in our minds in connection with these amendments is that the larger type of drainage work is the type that will create the most damage.  Anyone who has any experience of these schemes must realise the dangerous amount of water that is released.  There is no provision in this Bill about notifying fishery authorities, mill-owners, the Electricity Supply Board or other statutory bodies such as there is in the 1945 Drainage Act.  If there is danger of damage to the interests of people such as I have mentioned, there is just as much reason, if not more reason, that the same statutory protection should be enshrined in this Bill as was provided in the 1945 Drainage Act.  The smaller drainage schemes may not give rise to so much damage but it is not a very large scheme that will be carried out for £250.  Where, however, two or three of these schemes enter into the one river it does not take any great stretch of the imagination to visualise the amount of damage that may be done.  Releasing water in an unscientific way is much the same as releasing fire. It is just as liable to do as much damage and the local authority will have the privilege of paying for any damage done under this Bill.</P>
      <P>If parties, such as are described in Deputy MacEntee's amendment, parties with vested interests, like fisheries, millowners, or the Electricity Supply Board, suffer damage as a result of any of these schemes the ratepayers may be liable for very heavy compensation.  The combined effect of four or five of these £250 schemes may be the cause of serious damage to these parties.  We must take into account the fact that this Bill provides for the deepening of drains, the removal of obstructions and even the diversion of watercourses.  If that type of work is going to be done and if there is no consultation with the drainage authority, we can well visualise that the claims which may arise on the ratepayers of various counties may reach a very high figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There also arises the question of drainage as between one county and another.  It may be all right so far as maritime counties are concerned. If they create damage, it will arise <Col N="2634" /> within the limits of their own counties but where you have a river flowing from one county into another, it will be necessary for these counties to observe the greatest scruples in releasing water.  If due precautions are not taken, and due consultations carried out by the experts, you may have the position arising that water may be released into an already flooded river to such an extent that it will create a terrific amount of damage in other counties.  These are matters that it is better to put right when we have an opportunity of doing so rather than wait until we come up against these difficulties in the operation of the Bill. I would suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that the guarantees asked for taking all these amendments, might possibly be secured in another way, possibly we might achieve the same object by a redrafting of the amendments and if the Parliamentary Secretary is prepared to consider this matter before the Report Stage so as to obviate the dangers which we point out, well and good.  I would suggest that there is a duty on the Government to endeavour to foresee the difficulties that may arise under this Bill and I would point out that in every legislation dealing with drainage all these precautions were provided for.</P>
    <P>For instance, in Section 47 of the 1945 Act, which deals with the question of weirs, if there is any interference with a weir by the alteration, removal or enlargement of any watercourse. there is a definite liability for damages and certain precautions have to be taken.  One of the matters causing obstruction in watercourses are some of these very weirs and we take power under this Bill to remove these obstructions. I wonder has the Parliamentary Secretary foreseen what that may give rise to?  Again, by the execution of a very small drainage work, damage may be caused to hatcheries such as you have in some areas.  In particular in one amendment of Deputy Aiken&mdash;what I call the £250 amendment&mdash;I think there is a very reasonable safeguard. I think he is only endeavouring to make the Parliamentary Secretary consider certain matters that may arise as a result of indiscriminate damage in the country if due precautions are not <Col N="2635" /> taken.  If he guaranteed to accept any of these amendments or favourably consider what is in our minds before the Report Stage, he would meet our objects in the matter.  I would impress upon the Parliamentary Secretary that it is only by the experience of carrying <Col N="2636" /> out drainage that he will see the very grave questions of damages and infringements of the rights of private individuals that may arise.</P>

I am glad to see that the Minister has thought fit to mend his hand in that matter and has provided some notice, although it is not as good as we would expect to be provided.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposing this section, which reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where the Minister is satisfied&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  that particular works should be executed pursuant to this Act by a local authority, and</P>
      <P>(b)  that the local authority are unable or unwilling to execute the works,</P>
      <P>the Minister may by Order nominate a person to execute the works and thereupon that person may execute the works in accordance with the directions of the Minister, and in relation to the execution thereof, shall be deemed to be acting on behalf of the local authority and shall have all the powers conferred on them by this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is an extraordinary section for inclusion in this measure by the present Minister or any member of the Labour Party.  We have been hearing for quite <Col N="2638" /> a long time the awful thing the County Management Act was in taking powers away from local authorities.  Here we have a power being enshrined in this Bill, under which the Minister, over the heads of the local authority, can send down his nominee to carry out any particular work and the local authority will have the pleasure of paying for any damages done.  That is an extraordinary power for a Minister to take who professes to be so worried about democratic rights and the rights of local representatives.  It has been held up to the House and to the country that the County Management Act deprived the local authorities of such powers.  Speaking on the County Management Bill on the 14th March, 1940, as given in column 929 of the Official Debates, Volume 79, the recent Minister for Local Government, the late Deputy Murphy, on a section giving power to remove a manager by sealed order, for unfitness, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;My only comment is that this power renders even more farcical the position local representatives would be asked to share when this Bill becomes an Act.  I would go even farther than what has been said already and say that this section tends to make the county manager the creature of the Minister for Local Government, and I am not prepared to vote that that power should be put into the hands of the Minister or of any future Minister for Local Government.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the comment by the recent Minister for Local Government on a section in the Managerial Act simply taking power to remove a manager for unfitness&mdash;it would make the manager the creature of the Minister.  But what does this section do?  It makes every member of every local authority a creature of the Minister, because when a local authority in its wisdom decides that some work would not be in the public interest and should not be done, due to the potential damage that would accrue to the ratepayers, and decide to turn it down, someone can come to the Minister and the Minister can send his nominee and carry out the work in spite of the local authority.  That is going a long way towards restoring power to the local authorities, that <Col N="2639" /> the Minister and some of his colleagues have been so loquacious about.  It seems extraordinary also to be taking power when the local authority will have to pay for the results of the acts of the Minister's nominee.  Someone has said that the man who pays the piper calls the tune, but in this particular section the local authority, the ratepayers, may have to pay the piper &mdash;in paying for the damage that might be done in the maintenance of the work&mdash;and the Minister, notwithstanding the fact that the local authority has turned the work down, can go ahead in the face of the opposition.</P>
    <P>In another way this creates an undesirable position.  While it may not happen with the present Minister, some future Minister may have a friend who is interested in getting some particular work done.  If the local authority turns it down, he can get the Minister to do it, in spite of the opposition.  I would ask the Minister to withdraw this section and avoid such an undesirable position.</P>
    <P>I suggest, particularly in view of the expressed attitude towards the County Management Act, in saying that the local authorities have not sufficient power, that there was not enshrined in any Act a more strongly-worded or dictatorial section than this, as between the Minister and a local authority.  If it is the intention to amend or repeal the County Management Act, why enshrine this section in the Bill and why give power to any future Minister for Local Government to take such action as is provided for in the section?  If it is the intention at an early date to repeal that Act and give more powers to local authorities, why should this principle be enshrined in a Bill introduced by a Labour Minister?</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister should withdraw this section and that it is a section that will be resented by members of local authorities.  As surely as he exercises the power in this section to put through some work in spite of the majority of a local authority, so surely will he be working against the bringing about of good relations between local authorities and the <Col N="2640" /> Department.  The Minister should realise that this section will be repugnant to every local authority.  If he realises that, he will realise that it is an unwise principle to have enshrined in the Bill.  It is a section which will serve no useful purpose and I appeal to him to withdraw it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised at Deputy Moran's attitude and I am more surprised still that Deputy Harris, who is here, did not get up and contradict him, because Deputy Harris knows as well as I do that, in parts of Kildare, there are joint committees looking after the Boyne and the Blackwater, and, but for this section, it would not be possible to include them in this Bill.  This section will enable the Minister to designate one local authority to do the job, where several local authorities are involved. If it were not for that section, obstructions in the Blackwater River could not be removed because more than one local authority is involved. For that reason, if for no other&mdash;and there are others&mdash;I think this is a good section, a section which I would strongly urge the Parliamentary Secretary to retain in the Bill and a section which I know people in parts of North-West Kildare will be glad to see passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHarris" hpid="Mr. Harris Mr. Harris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harris</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a happy thought on Deputy Sweetman's part to bring in this matter of joint drainage boards to cover up the real danger in the section. I suggest that a safer clause could be inserted in the Bill to meet that position.  I believe the section is dangerous, because it gives the Minister a power he should not have, a power by which he could do much that would be detrimental to a local authority.  If a local authority feels that it is wrong to carry out a particular work and if they oppose the carrying out of that work, certain influential sections in the particular county who have access to whatever Minister is in office could go to the Minister and snap their fingers at the local authority.  The section undermines all ideas of democracy.</P>

      <P>I support the representations made for the deletion of the section.  I think it is a very dangerous section.  It is a pity that Deputy Sweetman did not point out to us where provision is made in the section for local authorities to carry out the work at present being carried out by drainage boards.  There is nothing in the section in connection with that.  It merely states that, where a local authority is unable or unwilling to execute a particular work, the Minister may, by Order, nominate a person to execute it.  Some Deputy on the opposite side talked about our being in an anomalous position.  I wonder what position is the Minister for Local Government and the Parliamentary Secretary in to-night?  We had them earlier refusing to trust local bodies in the matter of carrying out these works and now we have the Minister taking the big stick.  If a local authority or county manager refuses to carry out certain works, the Minister will nominate somebody to carry them out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>When Deputy Cowan has finished with his game of matches, he can give us a legal interpretation of it.  I am dealing with the section from the point of view of a member of a local authority.  I believe that, when new works such as have not hitherto been included in their functions are to be carried out by local authorities, the members should have the right to state the priority of the works in consultation with and with the approval of the county engineer and should have the power to carry out these works.  I cannot visualise the circumstances which the Minister appears to visualise which make it necessary to insert this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know any local authority that is going to endeavour to prevent work being carried out under the Bill, but evidently that is the mentality behind the insertion of the section.  I do not think the House should agree to it.  The House could very well leave the carrying out of these works in the hands of local authorities.  I cannot visualise any situation in which local authorities might refuse to carry out <Col N="2642" /> certain works, but if a local authority, with its knowledge of local conditions and circumstances, decided not to carry out particular works, I do not see why the Minister should have power to compel them to carry them out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say what will happen if a local authority wants to do a job one way and the Government Department wants it done another way?  Who will arbitrate?  I have in mind the position with regard to Charleston Road in Dublin, where the corporation wanted to improve and re-asphalt the roadway.  The previous Government had the benefit of an inquiry into the widening of the road and apparently some influential friends waited upon the Minister of the previous Government and stopped the corporation from carrying out the much-needed improvements on that road.  It is now a danger to the public and there is a clashing of interests between the engineer of his Department and the Dublin Corporation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know why it immediately springs to the mind of the Opposition that there is some sinister motive in embodying a section of this kind in the Bill or that a section like this immediately suggests to them that some friend of the Minister might benefit. It is not the intention at all under this Bill to inflict any punishment on a local authority or to get them to do something which is unreasonable.  Before I go any further I should like to ask if any of the members of the Fianna Fáil Party thought there was anything peculiar or anything sinister in the inclusion in the Relief Works Act of 1940 of a section which gives the Minister power to compel a local authority to execute certain works and which also requires that they should bear the full <Col N="2643" /> cost of the works, the full cost of damage and the full cost of compensation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as this particular section is concerned, it is intended for the benefit of local authorities.  If, for instance, an urban council or corporation could not or had not the means to carry out certain works under the provisions of this Bill it would be possible for the Minister for Local Government to nominate, say, the county council to do that work for them.  If, for instance, a river flowing through a county area also passed through an urban area, and the county council were anxious to carry out certain works but if the urban council did not do a certain job within their functional area the county council's work would be ineffective, it would be reasonable then, I think, for the Minister to nominate the county council to carry out the necessary work to make the job effective within the functional area of the local authority. Again I would like to stress that there is no sinister motive in this.  I think Deputy Moran paid the Minister for Local Government a compliment by saying he thought he would not act in a manner as suggested by some of the other Opposition Deputies.  But, if Opposition Deputies think there is any sinister motive in this, if they think it means giving to the Minister a power which he should not have or which in their opinion he might abuse, I think that we might be prepared to reconsider it on the Report Stage.</P>

      <P>Before sub-section (2) to insert the following new sub-sections:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2)  Before entering on land under this section for a purpose other than the execution of urgent works, a local authority or person executing works pursuant to this Act or an Order made thereunder, shall either obtain the consent (in the case of occupied land) of the occupier, or (in the case of unoccupied land) of the owner or shall give not less than 14 days' notice in writing of the intention to make such entry.</P>
      <P>(3)  The notice referred to in sub-section (2) of this section may be given to a person in any of the following ways:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  by delivering it to such person,</P>
      <P>(b)  by leaving it at the address where such person ordinarily resides,</P>
      <P>(c)  by sending it by post in a prepaid registered letter addressed to such person at the address where he ordinarily resides, or</P>
      <P>(d)  by posting it at or near the land concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(4)  In this section the expression &ldquo;urgent works&rdquo; means works the immediate execution of which is, in the opinion of the local authority, necessary to prevent serious injury <Col N="2645" /> to any person, land or permanent construction.</P>
    <P>This amendment provides for 14 days' notice in writing to be given of intention to enter on a man's land.  Notice is not necessary where urgent works have to be done, and I think the House will agree that that is reasonable in view of the fact that there may be immediate flooding due to excessive rain.  If there had to be a delay of 14 days it would be absolutely ridiculous to try to alleviate such a condition. There is also provided in this amendment the method by which this notice should be given and I think that meets some of the subsequent amendments of the Opposition as to the giving of notice and the actual method.</P>

I do agree that in the case, say, of sudden flooding of roads, which would in the main, I think, arise under the first part of the Bill, or a landslide, or a breach in a road it is right that the authority should proceed immediately to do that work but as far as entering on the lands of a private individual for a scheme is concerned, I would again suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary, notwithstanding this amendment of his, that if it is any kind of major scheme, there should be publication of notice.  Publication of notice was provided for under other Statutes and I would suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that when he considers the matter before Report Stage he might think fit to provide for publication of notice outside the notice he proposes to give under this amendment.</P>

If the Parliamentary <Col N="2646" /> Secretary thinks that over he will see my point and I think there should be notice outside the notice in the amendment that you are going to start the work, particularly having regard to any damage that may be done.

But the Parliamentary Secretary may come up against the difficulty that while the Act gives him power to interfere or to enter on land it may not give him power to interfere with certain rights&mdash;as I put it to Deputy Lynch, when he mentioned the definition of &ldquo;land,&rdquo; that &ldquo;land&rdquo; did include the matters which he said were included in &ldquo;land.&rdquo;  I have not been able to look into the matter fully but I do think, in the definitions I have looked up, that the definition of &ldquo;land&rdquo; for the purpose of particular statutes is something that should be set out in the statutes.  I do not want to go further than ask the Parliamentary Secretary that, between this and the Report Stage, he might look into the matter to see if the expression &ldquo;land&rdquo; gives all the rights that the Parliamentary Secretary wants and that we all want to be exercised in <Col N="2648" /> regard to this Bill.  It is a technical matter on which the Parliamentary Secretary may require the advice of the Attorney-General.  I would ask him to look into this matter between now and the Fifth Stage.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 23:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (2) to insert the following new sub-section:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  Every claim for compensation under this section shall be made in writing to the local authority concerned <Col N="2649" /> within 18 months after the commencement of the works which caused the interference to which the claim relates.</P>
    <P>I think that a period of 18 months, within which a person may make a claim, is reasonable.  I do not think any less or any more would be good. It is considered that a period of 18 months is a period which will cover a full year adequately, that is providing for a late or early winter.  I do not think that, as is suggested in some of the other amendments, a period of say, six years, might be given because the local authorities would be, as it were, waiting in suspense to see whether or not a claim for damage was coming forward.  In any case, an unusual happening such as cloudburst or any similar occurrence might induce a person to make a claim for damage which was not done by the execution of works under this particular Bill.</P>
    <P>On the question of damage and compensation, let me say that I do not visualise that there will be many claims for compensation and, in any case, where they are on account of the nature of the schemes, I think that the compensation will be very low.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 23a reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Before sub-section (2) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>( ) Every claim for compensation under this section shall be made in writing to the local authority concerned not later than three months after the damage has been ascertained, but in any case, not later than six years after the completion of the works which it is alleged have occasioned the damage to which the claim relates.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment and amendment No. 36 go together.  I think, in particular, that amendment No. 36 is possibly wider.  It is as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding the provisions of the Public Authorities Protection Act, 1893, or of any other statute of limitation, a claimant may institute proceedings for compensation under <Col N="2650" /> Section 5 of this Act at any time within a period of six years from the date of the conclusion of the work by reason of which the claimant's land has sustained damage.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is a matter for which, when the Bill was previously going through the House, no provision was made.  The Parliamentary Secretary has gone a certain distance with us, under amendment No. 23, when he says that every claim for compensation under this section shall be made in writing to the local authority concerned within 18 months after the commencement of the works which caused the interference to which the claim relates.  I would point out that 18 months after the commencement of the works is much too short a time. The works actually may take 18 months to complete, if it is a substantial work, and, possibly in accordance with the time of year the work is undertaken, the work may have to be suspended on a particular drainage scheme and actually the scheme itself may not be completed within 18 months from the date at which it started.  I would further point out that work undertaken under this Act in one part of a county may not, in itself, cause damage.  The draining done under that particular work&mdash;say, for the sake of argument&mdash; flows into river X.  Another work done in the same catchment area also flows into river X.  It may be the third work under this Act, flowing into river X, that may cause the flooding and damage. You may have the combined effect of two or three works causing the damage under which claims arise under this Act.  I think, in particular, that 18 months from the commencement of the work is much too short a period.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned cloudbursts.  He should know quite well that the question of cloudbursts will not arise because there would be no claim for damage done as a result of any cloudburst.  The cloudburst I am afraid of would be the burst due to the combined results of two or three works&mdash;possibly small in themselves&mdash;under this Act.  I think the position would be most unfair for an unfortunate claimant whose rights may be interfered with and who may have suffered damage.  He did not <Col N="2651" /> know when the first work started.  He would be in the position that he would be out of court when he had not brought his claim within 18 months of its first starting.  I think there should certainly be a longer period.  The Parliamentary Secretary must be of the same mind that these questions of damage under this Act will have to be proved (1) before the District Court, in small cases and (2)&mdash;which we shall come to later&mdash;before an arbitrator or a court under the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919.  The claimants will have to satisfy these courts that they did in fact (1) suffer damage and (2) that it was as a result of works done under this Bill. I do not see why the Parliamentary Secretary would not reconsider this question of limitation of the period. Six years is the usual limitation.  We have a number of statutes limiting the period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will see that it is six months under the Public Authorities (Protection) Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but that is much too short.  That Act is not of such universal application as some people seem to think.  I am suggesting that there is nothing unreasonable in making the limitation period six years, because claimants will have to prove their case in any event.  If you put a limitation of 18 months on a claimant, as suggested in the Parliamentary Secretary's amendment, it means that if some farmer in a backward area is not quick enough to put in a claim in time, you simply put him out of court on what merely amounts to a technicality in a case where genuine damage may have been done.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to bear in mind that when work is done under the Bill there may be an unusually dry winter when you would not have the normal rainfall, whereas in a winter with normal rainfall you may have flooding which would not be apparent the previous winter. It is only after a couple of years that the full results of the work would be seen, taking one winter after another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are matters which would affect the period of time within which a man <Col N="2652" /> might claim, because the damage may not arise during the year the work is carried out and may not arise until the following winter, which may be a more severe winter than usual.  He may find then as a result of the work done that his lands are being flooded and damage done.  On the other hand, the public authority is protected because, let it be one, two or five years after the work is done, a man has to satisfy the court that he has suffered damage as a result of work or combined works done under the Bill.  I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to reconsider his attitude and accept the principle either of the amendment tabled by myself or the one tabled by Deputy MacEntee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not endorse Deputy Moran's plea for the extension of the period to six years, but I do think he made certain criticisms of the Parliamentary Secretary's amendment which should be considered.  To my mind, what goes a long way towards vitiating that amendment as it stands is the period from which the calculation is to be made, &ldquo;after the commencement of the works&rdquo;.  As I said, I would not endorse the plea to extend the period to six years.</P>
      <P>To my mind, what is important is not the period allowed, but the date from which that limitation would commence to run.  The amendment would be completely unobjectionable if it were to read something like this: Every claim for compensation under this section shall be made in writing to the local authority concerned within 18 months after the date upon which the damage or interference caused became apparent.  The important thing is the date from which the period of limitation will commence to run.  I cannot compliment the Parliamentary Secretary on the drafting of the amendment. I appeal to him to consider an alteration in the time from which the period of limitation will run.  After that, if he wants to make the period within which a claim can be brought as short as six months, I would agree.</P>

      <P>I cannot agree with either of my professional brethren.  I think Deputy Moran's plea for six years is altogether out of the question. <Col N="2653" /> I think Deputy Lehane's date for the commencement would be far too indeterminate. It would be quite impossible to prove at what date the damage became apparent.  I urge the Parliamentary Secretary very strongly that, whatever period he inserts, and I do not quarrel with his period of 18 months, it should date from the completion of the work, because until the work is completed it will be impossible to tell for certain whether it will cause damage or not.  I would rather have a much shorter period starting from the completion of the work than a longer period starting from the commencement because, unless one is an engineer, one is not in a position to judge when the work is started what the exact effect will be.  When the work is completed, one is in a better position to judge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In this matter my view lies between what Deputy Sweetman and Deputy Lehane said.  I agree that the period from which the limitation is to run in the proposed amendment is not a satisfactory one, because I can imagine nothing more difficult to ascertain than the commencement of any particular works.  A considerable amount of administrative work must be done before the apparent evidence of the work on any river or road may be seen by people.  The commencement of work under this Bill covers just as much administrative or preparatory work as it does the more obvious kind of work which people might see.  I think the word &ldquo;commencement&rdquo; in the Minister's amendment does not indicate a satisfactory or clear period from which the limitation should run.  Deputy Lehane suggested that the limitation should run from the date on which the damage was caused.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>From the date it became apparent.  Under Section 3 of the Public Authorities (Protection) Act, 1893, which at present protects local authorities, the period of limitation runs from the causing of the damage or injury.  There is at least that precedent for dating the limitation from that period.  It has not been difficult <Col N="2654" /> to ascertain in practice and I do not think it would cause much difficulty if something along these lines was provided for.  I urge on the Parliamentary Secretary, from an ordinary drafting point of view, that something clearer should be decided upon than the word &ldquo;commencement&rdquo; in the amendment.  Perhaps the most satisfactory compromise would be that suggested by Deputy Sweetman, namely, the completion of the work. There again I leave open the question when such work is completed.  I do think that some attention should be paid to this on the Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I would rather have attention given to the wording of the Parliamentary Secretary's amendment which is to the effect that a claim to be made be brought in 18 months after the commencement of the work. As far as I can see, that does not interfere at all with the time that is laid down under the Public Authorities Protection Act.  I should say that as the amendment stands at present it prescribes that if a claim is to be made notice in writing must be served in 18 months.  Having regard to what the various Deputies have put forward in this particular amendment I think it should be reconsidered between now and the Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I want very briefly to add my voice to the pleading with the Parliamentary Secretary to reconsider this matter.  Quite frankly I would like Deputy MacEntee's amendment No. 23 (a) if it were tidied up a bit.  I think the period of six years is far too long.  Something in the neighbourhood of 18 months or two years would improve it.  Secondly, some of the speakers have pointed out the difficulty of ascertaining when the work commences.  I think there would be far more difficulty in ascertaining when the work is completed.  If the Parliamentary Secretary thinks well of the idea of allowing the claims to date from the completion of work it would <Col N="2655" /> be necessary to add some further provision stipulating the definition of when the work is completed.  I suggest we might consider making it a duty of the engineer and county surveyor to certify and, if necessary, certify by public advertisement, the date of the completion of work.  If something of that sort were done, at least it would remove one of the difficulties which might arise in courts on that question. I should like to recommend to the Parliamentary Secretary that he reconsider this amendment with a view to dating the time for the claim from the completion of the work and further define when the work should be deemed to be completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Such a certificate of completion as mentioned by Deputy O'Higgins might be all right except if it were found after the certificate of completion had been issued by the county surveyor or engineer that damages had resulted from the work and that these damages were likely to be recurring.  It might then be necessary for the local authority to undertake further works.  The issue of a certificate of completion is provided for in the Act of 1945 but that would be in a case where the most elaborate survey would have taken place in connection with any drainage work carried out.  I would plead with the Parliamentary Secretary to listen to and take heed of the point made by Deputy Moran when he mentioned the fact that even if you make it 18 months from the date of completion and even if you were able to decide exactly when the work is completed, you would still have the difficulty of a dry winter.  We do not get very many dry winters in this country, we must admit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had cases of dry winters in our time.  I remember inside the last 25 years two dry winters following each other.  If works are carried out in a period like that, it would be impossible for a person whose property might have been injured to come before a court inside the time specified and prove, as it <Col N="2656" /> would be necessary to prove, that damage had resulted to him as a result of carrying out these works.  I think it is not unreasonable to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to insert a period that would at least give the individual who might be affected an opportunity of going to a stronger body and seeking there redress for any damage that might result from the work carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Most Deputies are agreed that the period of 18 months is more reasonable than six years, but some of them seem to differ as to from what particular time that period should date.  I would be more favourable towards relating it to the commencement of the work, because it can readily be seen that in a lot of cases it will be very difficult to determine when work has actually been completed. To all intents and purposes, a particular scheme might be completed, but it might be necessary for an engineer to go back and make adjustments or to effect some minor changes.  From that point of view the actual execution of a small scheme might take a period of, say, six to nine months.  That is to say, the work might be actually completed in three months, but it might be discovered after another three months that some minor repairs or adjustment or minor digging work might have to be carried out.  From that point of view I think it would be very difficult in a lot of cases to prove when the work was actually completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as Deputy Lehane's suggestion is concerned, that is, that it should date from the time when the damage became apparent, it could not be easily determined because any claimant is entitled to protest, and he may very well protest, that he did not know of this damage until such and such a time.  In effect, the damage might have been there for six months but he was too lazy or did not bother his head to make any claim at the time the damage actually occurred.  Therefore, I would be inclined to reconsider this amendment on the Report Stage but I would like to tell the House that I will stick to the dating of the period from the commencement of the <Col N="2657" /> work and consider a smaller extension of the period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Parliamentary Secretary not consider the point that I have made that, for instance, because of a dry winter, or for a similar reason, a man would not realise that he was going to suffer damage, he will not be debarred from making a claim?  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to consider this question of protecting the small man as against the large local authority with all its power behind it. If he is genuinely going to suffer damage I do not think there is any good reason why a technical clause of <Col N="2658" /> this kind should cut him out.  After all we are providing that if damage is done the local authority is going to pay for it.  If there is a genuine case, and even if a man does not bring his claim within, say, 18 months of the commencement of the work, provided he can prove damage, surely he should not be penalised by a section such as this. I would again urge the Parliamentary Secretary to bear this in mind.</P>
