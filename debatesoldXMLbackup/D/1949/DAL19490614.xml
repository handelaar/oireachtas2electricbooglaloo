    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. B. Maguire Mr. B. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if, from the point of view of efficiency, economy and general convenience of the public concerned, he will consider establishing an organisation in each county for controlling the following schemes, namely: rural improvement and minor relief, bog development, farm improvement, farm building, land reclamation and drainage; Land Commission forestry and other operations appurtenant to agricultural development; also schemes carried out under Government grants for the development of urban districts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that what the Deputy suggests is the establishment of a single organisation in each county for controlling all the schemes he enumerates &mdash; and not an organisation in each county for each of the schemes.  But, whichever alternative he has in mind, I am satisfied that his suggestion would not achieve greater efficiency, economy and convenience than obtain at present.</P>
      <P>A single county organisation dealing with multifarious schemes administered by several Departments of State would be subject to the multiple control of those Departments, with all the confusion and complications in staff and other matters that such a system would entail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In actual practice, the aim when determining the basis on which such schemes are organised is to select the type of organisation that best suits the particular circumstances and the particular requirements of each scheme. These circumstances and requirements <Col N="502" /> will vary, to a greater or lesser extent, from scheme to scheme; some schemes are best administered direct by the central authority with staff operating from headquarters; others require local offices serving areas&mdash;not necessarily delimited by county boundaries&mdash;in which activities on the schemes are concentrated; while one of the schemes referred to by the Deputy &mdash;the land rehabilitation project&mdash;will require not one but several offices in each county.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJMaguire" hpid="Dr. Maguire Dr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that there is a danger of overlapping in this plethora of schemes?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether his attention has been drawn to a statement of the Minister for Lands at a public meeting in Ballina on the 23rd April as reported in the Press on 30th April to the effect that there was a scheme for the erection of a short-wave radio station, that everybody knows that the present stations are catering well enough for the people; and that the present Government scrapped that squandering; whether he will state if the Minister for Lands was stating the opinions or decisions of the Government; and, if so, whether there has been any alteration in those decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The particular statements by the Minister for Lands to which the Deputy refers are taken by him out of their context, which was a general statement of the Government's attitude towards the policy of the previous Administration in regard to public expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision not to proceed with the proposed high-power short-wave broadcasting station was taken in the light of a number of considerations including, as was indicated by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in a speech on the 10th May, 1948, the fact that there was no certainty that we would be able to secure an allocation of suitable wavelengths and also the need for economy, which was related to the Government's policy of diverting State expenditure, to the maximum extent, <Col N="503" /> to social schemes and productive purposes. That decision remained unaltered on the date of the speech by the Minister for Lands, namely, the 23rd April last.</P>
    <P>On the 17th of last month, however, the Government decided that short-wave transmissions to America of an experimental programme should be undertaken as soon as possible.  This decision was taken in view of altered circumstances; in the meantime Ireland had obtained a share of short-wave frequencies under the basic plan adopted earlier this year at the short-wave broadcasting conference held at Mexico City, and, secondly, national policy and particularly the more acute need to make the truth about Partition known to the outside world, made the use of short-wave broadcasting more necessary in the public interest than it had been when the original decision was taken in the early part of last year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if, in view of the fact that the Control of Manufactures Act precludes Irish citizens born in the Six Counties occupied by British forces from carrying on manufacturing business in the portion of our territory under the effective control of the Oireachtas, the Government will consider the introduction of proposals for the necessary legislation to remedy this position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the fact that persons born and resident in the Six Counties are precluded by the Control of Manufactures Acts from carrying on manufacturing business in the rest of the country except by licence granted under the Acts.  It has for some time past been the practice, however, to give special and favourable consideration to persons born or resident in the Six Counties in the issue of such licences.  This practice will continue pending the consideration of certain difficulties, including the difficulty to which the Deputy refers, which arise in the administration of the Control of Manufactures Acts.</P>

I was asked at a Press interview whether it was true that there was a strong Communist Party here.  I said there was no Communist Party in this portion of Ireland.  No doubt, as a result of some of the misrepresentations made by some of the Deputy's colleagues, false impressions got abroad in some other countries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of land for afforestation purposes, I take it that it will be a matter of negotiation between the present owners and the Forestry Department.  The usual procedure is that if the owners do not wish to sell, and if they have turbary or other such rights, we do not go in. I am not familiar with whether it is proposed to acquire this area compulsorily. The whole area comprises 5,000 acres at a very low valuation.  I will meet a deputation in this connection.</P>

      <P>The rearrangement and enlargement of the holdings in the Ballinruan district are under consideration and it is proposed to utilise in the rearrangement the surrendered holdings mentioned. The rearrangement scheme is not yet complete but the work is being expedited to the utmost.

      <P>Is the Minister aware that two holdings&mdash;one comprising 120 Irish acres and the other 56 Irish acres &mdash;within a distance of two miles of the district mentioned were offered to the Land Commission and have been refused by it?  I would ask the Minister to look into that matter.  It would help to facilitate the relief of congestion in that densely congested area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Several people in that <Col N="508" /> locality have applied for migration. That means that they have offered their holdings to us, for whatever they are worth to us for the purpose of easing congestion in the locality.  It may well be that in respect of the two holdings in question, though the acreage may be big they may possibly be of low valuation and of poor quality land.  The Land Commission might not consider it a wise scheme to accept the holdings because of the quality of the land.  I am making that statement offhand. My information is that no offer of exchange has been definitely refused. If the Deputy will give me the names and other particulars I shall certainly have the matter looked into.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands whether he is aware that the wages of forestry workers are now less than those of agricultural workers and if he will state why the differential over agricultural wages formerly paid to forestry workers has been withdrawn and if he will restore the differential; further, whether he is prepared to stop the practice of deducting from the wages of forestry workers the time lost while attending Mass on Church holydays; and, finally, whether he is aware that these and other grievances are causing serious discontent among forestry workers which is likely to end in a general stoppage of work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is misinformed in regard to the wages of labourers employed by the Forestry Division.  In fact, forestry labourers are paid higher rates of wages than those fixed for agricultural workers under the Agricultural Wages Act.</P>
      <P>The differential previously paid to forestry labourers was granted in 1947 because they were extensively employed on the production of domestic fuel. When this factor no longer obtained the grounds for payment of the differential disappeared.</P>
      <P>The treatment of forestry labourers in respect of Church holydays is under examination.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister consider that it is a valid reason for the abolition of the differential which formerly obtained to say that since forestry workers are no longer engaged in the production of fuel their wages should, accordingly, be reduced?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>A differential of 2/- a week, which was granted in 1947, existed.  They were requested to provide as much domestic fuel as possible owing to shortages in that period. There have been two increases since to the forestry workers, but the increases did not still leave the differential there as regards agricultural wages.  The position in regard to Church holydays is at present under examination.  As I have told the Deputy before, I would much prefer not to see these men working on Church holydays, if at all possible.  The Deputy may take it that my sympathy is in the direction of not deducting pay for time spent by reason of attendance at church on holydays.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I avail of this opportunity to draw the new Minister's attention to the very serious problem of housing in Dublin.  I do not think that the Minister has any doubts as to the complexity and seriousness of that problem.  It is a problem in which every Dublin Deputy is interested.  On every day of the week each of us has quite a number of people calling and asking what we can do to get them decent housing accommodation.  I raised this matter on a number of occasions with the late Minister and pointed out to him that the 20,000 or 30,000 houses required in Dublin City cannot be provided within a reasonable time unless there is some substantial change in the procedure dealing with the acquisition of sites and the provision of houses.  I do not want to labour the point, nor do I want to worry the House with particulars of conditions under which families have to live.  We are all familiar with the shocking conditions under which thousands of families have to live.  The machinery operated by the Minister is cumbersome. He has, first and foremost, the complexity of his own Department and, on top of that, he has the very cumbersome machinery of the Dublin Corporation.  Something like 600 houses were built in Dublin last year.  That was almost useless from the point of view of solving the problem. The late Minister hoped, and I know it is the intention of the present Minister, that that rate of building would be accelerated and stepped up.  However, the trouble seems to be in regard to the question of sites.  There are a number of sites in hands which will allow a continuation of the present rate of building, but there are not sufficient sites to enable a sufficiently accelerated rate to be achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="517" /> We have facilities at St. Anne's for approximately 5,000 houses, but those 5,000 houses cannot be built because there is no sewerage.  A considerable portion of the work on sewerage should have been done during the emergency. We have been told that it will take five years to install the sewerage that will serve the estate at St. Anne's. In other words, that beautiful site cannot be developed for five years.  I made the suggestion to the Minister's predecessor and I make it to the Minister again, that this sewerage work is important and that there are sufficient workers in the City of Dublin to build that sewerage within a period of a little over a year.  That can be done by employing the available workers for three shifts of eight hours in every day, using artificial light and tackling it as any emergency problem would and should be.  That estate is in my own constituency.  If it is developed the housing problem in North-East Dublin will be solved.  None of us can wait, and none of us will wait, for a period of five years for the installation of a sewerage scheme that can be installed in a little over a year.  If it is tackled in the way it should be tackled, St. Anne's will provide approximately 5,000 houses.</P>
    <P>I want to suggest to the Minister that the machinery in regard to the acquisition of land for building must be examined.  The late Minister indicated that it had been brought home to him that the machinery was cumbersome and slow and that if sites could not be procured more quickly the machinery would have to be changed.  The Minister should examine this problem and he should call on his experts to examine it.  Whatever steps are necessary to speed up the acquisition of land for building purposes should be taken at once.  The excuse given to us has been the difficulty of getting skilled labour.  We know that across in Britain there are thousands of our building operatives.  We know that the rates of wages we pay here are as good as the rates of wages that are being paid to them in Britain.  The difference is that there seems to be more security in the jobs in Britain.  I want to suggest to the Minister that <Col N="518" /> he should recruit a labour force for the purpose of solving this housing problem in Dublin.  He should invite all the skilled operatives that we have across in Britain to join that labour force.  He can ensure getting those workers to come back and work here if he will give them a guarantee of continuous employment and decent wages, whether the weather is wet or fine.  Only in that way can the labour force that is required to solve the housing problem be recruited.</P>
    <P>It has been stated that money is no obstacle and I think we are all agreed on that.  We all know that the provision of money is not an obstacle at all.  The solutions of the housing problem in Dublin are: (1) speedier acquisition of sites; (2) the creation and building up of a labour force adequate to deal with the job, and (3) where problems such as the sewerage problem arise and are in the way of progress they should be tackled as emergency problems.  I understand there is no difficulty in regard to materials and that makes it easier.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to examine this.  Are the cumbersome machinery of his own Department and the complicated machinery of the Dublin Corporation the best that can be used for a task such as this?  Quite a number of people believe, and I am one of them, that this problem of housing in Dublin should be tackled as an emergency one.  It should be done directly under the Minister and the complicated machinery of his Department and of the Dublin Corporation should, in this respect, be brushed aside.  A labour director or a housing director should be appointed by the Minister with full power and authority to solve this problem in the shortest possible space of time.  We are not going to solve this problem by trying to carry on with the machinery which was there pre-war, because it was accentuated during the eight, nine or ten years of the emergency when materials were not available and when building could not be done.</P>
    <P>The problem of 30,000 houses in Dublin is a big one, but it is one that, I believe, can be solved by determination. I am aware that no more <Col N="519" /> sympathetic Minister could be in charge of this problem than the present Minister for Local Government.  I know that he has every sympathy for the unfortunate people who are living under horrible conditions in slums, as well as for the young married people, the boys and the girls who get married and have no place to go to as a couple. At present, the boy has to live with his parents and the girl with her parents.  They see one another when cash is being transferred on one day in the week.  Now, those conditions are not Christian.  They are inhuman and a blot on this city and on this country.  The sooner we get down to the real problem of wiping out those terrible conditions the better it will be for all of us.</P>
    <P>I am concentrating deliberately on housing in Dublin City.  I have seen the statistics and the figures that have been made available in regard to building in the rest of the country, and there is no doubt that the late Minister deserved credit for the efforts that he was making in regard to the building of houses through the rural areas.  I know that the policy of the late Minister in that regard will be continued by the present Minister, but I was not satisfied with the efforts that were being made to deal with this problem in the City of Dublin, and I am not satisfied with them now.  It would be unreasonable for any Deputy, in this debate, to pass any criticism on the Minister for the reason that it is only a short time since he took over a very onerous responsibility, and so he must get time to examine all the implications of this problem and the different suggestions that are being made for its solution.  I would say this to the Minister, that, while other parts of his heavy responsibilities are important, they could all be forgotten for a considerable period until this housing drive in Dublin City is put properly under way.  I can assure him that, in endeavouring to solve this problem within a reasonable time, he will have the full co-operation and assistance of every Deputy representing a Dublin City constituency.</P>
    <P>The Estimate covers quite a number <Col N="520" /> of things, but I have thought it well to concentrate on this problem alone. I wish to assure the Minister that, as far as I, personally, am concerned, any co-operation, assistance or advice that I can give him in regard to finding a solution for this problem within a reasonable time, will be available to him.  I wish the Minister every success in doing the very serious job that lies ahead of him.</P>

      <P>This is a Department that deals very much with the lives of the ordinary people.  While I do not often agree with Deputy Cowan, I do want to say with him that the housing problem is a very serious and urgent one.  As regards my own constituency, any houses that have been built there during the last 18 months have been built as a result of the planning of the previous Minister for Local Government, Deputy MacEntee, although a colleague of mine, Deputy Dunne, who can be very verbose at times, said that it was only on the fringe of things. Before Deputy Dunne came into this House we had the pleasure and the satisfaction of introducing very constructive planning for housing in the County Dublin.  The present Chairman of the Dublin County Council, in a letter to the newspapers recently, referred to the number of men who had been engaged in the building industry and compared it with the number engaged last year.  I have a very keen interest in all these things.  Some four or five years ago I made a survey of the needs of the County Dublin.  I found that the work that was going on in all cases had been planned under the Fianna Fáil régime.  Not one house has been built under the present administration in the County Dublin that was not planned in our time.  The sites had already been acquired and the plans had been made long before the Dublin County Council came back into operation.  I have to say this, in passing, that Mr. T.C. O'Mahoney, the housing director, a man for whom I have the utmost regard as a public officer, got a very ugly job to handle.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dunne is a member of this House.  Deputy Cowan is after making his speech.  I did not say one word when the Deputy was speaking.  I did mention Deputy Dunne's name, and I did so because he has attacked me so often.  However, I would like to see the housing problem expedited a great deal more.  I would like to see, with whatever cooperation the Minister can get from the housing director or the county council, houses built for our people.  It is a national necessity that that should be done.  I did make a passing reference to the misrepresentation that has been carried on by my opponents because this is the only opportunity I have of contradicting it.  In my opinion, what is slowing up the building of houses so completely is the slowness there is in acquiring sites.  I have succeeded on a number of occasions in getting sites from farmers by mutual agreement.  That has expedited the work a good deal.  In cases, however, where land has to be acquired compulsorily, it often happens that the acquisition of sites, in particular areas, takes from two to three years. If the Minister could do anything to expedite the machinery in that direction, without appearing to do anything that would be undemocratic, it would, I believe, be welcomed by everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So much for housing.  The North County Dublin regional water scheme was planned under the previous Administration.  Deputy MacEntee gave a good deal of his time to the initiation of that scheme.  We have had almost two years of an inter-Party Government and we are just as far away from that scheme.  I wonder is it still pigeon-holed.  I was looking forward to this scheme for a number of <Col N="522" /> reasons.  If we are to look after the health of our people properly we should be in a position to give them a supply of fresh water.  I have had several complaints in North County Dublin with reference to bad pumps and bad water supplies.  I was hoping the North County Dublin regional water scheme would be expedited.  I am disappointed to find that it is still under consideration.  I have asked numerous questions about it here.  I know the present Minister has not been very long in office and I will not take advantage of that, but I will ask him to expedite this scheme.  I understand the planning of it was well advanced when we left office.  Why has it been slowed down?  I would like an explanation in that connection.</P>
    <P>I was given to understand, in reply to a question I submitted to the Dáil recently, regarding that scheme, that some of the areas to which that water scheme was to apply are now being put off, namely, Donabate, Lusk and Rush. There is a big problem in these areas. I will not single them out, because one is as bad as the other.  It is a sad thing to reflect that in this year there are important areas such as I have mentioned without any proper water supply.  I look upon it as a most important thing from the point of view of public health.  No words of mine and no representations I could make to this House could express how much I feel in relation to that very necessary thing, water.</P>
    <P>In Rush we have large areas under tomatoes, but the people there have not a suitable water supply.  The water supply system they have is cut off sometimes for a day, sometimes for half a day and again for four or five hours.  People in those areas often have to go to the local pump, or perhaps travel a mile or so to get water. I want to show how urgent this problem is.  We should make every effort to see that those people are given an adequate water supply.  In Lusk there are only a few old pumps and they are more often out of action than they are working.  The same applies to Donabate. Swords has a water supply of a kind, but in Blanchardstown the people are in a bad way for water.  All that area <Col N="523" /> was to be supplied through the North County Dublin regional water scheme. There is a local supply but most of the time during the summer the water is shut off and the people have to go long distances to get supplies.</P>
    <P>There is a sewerage system, but without an adequate water supply Deputies will realise the conditions that exist.  If the Minister can bring any pressure to bear on the people responsible for this water scheme, I ask him to do so.  I am tired listening to complaints in my constituency. Similar conditions exist in Coolock and Santry.  You are anxious to develop North County Dublin and you talk about decentralising industry, but you cannot do it without bringing modern conveniences such as water and sewerage to those areas.  Anybody anxious to build a house in Donabate, Rush or Lusk or other areas, is told by the town planning authorities that there can be no building until there is a satisfactory water supply.  These people are also told that there are septic tanks in the area.  In my own parish there are quite a lot of septic tanks.  There cannot be any satisfactory housing development because of lack of water and sewerage.  I wonder how long we will have to wait until we are able to go ahead with necessary housing schemes.</P>
    <P>For some time past we have been trying to get the Dublin County Council&mdash; and before that the county commissioner &mdash; to improve the roads by taking away dangerous bends.  We have endeavoured to get the narrow roads widened so that bus services could be opened up to many districts.  The representations made to the Dublin County Council have been turned down this year through lack of money.  It is very strange that such important matters could be turned down through lack of money when we have people here who hold themselves up as representatives of the working classes and we have seen them voting against road grants for the County Dublin to the extent of £43,000.  Road workers have been losing their employment.</P>
    <P>I have made representations for a bus service for various parts of County <Col N="524" /> Dublin and I am told that it is not possible to run buses in parts of the county because of the dangerous corners.  I hope the Minister will improve that position.  If one section of our people can have a bus service passing their door, I do not see why another section should have to walk six or seven miles to a bus stop.  That is the position that exists in portions of my constituency.  Sometimes when there is an accident there is a desire to have the roadways improved where the accident occurs and very often these dangerous corners are taken away almost overnight.  Public men have made representations in the interests of the community to have dangerous corners removed so as to save human life as far as possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowan told us a few moments ago that money does not matter, but seemingly it does matter a good deal. If the road grants were left as they were, many of the dangerous bends in County Dublin might by now have been improved.  Those road grants could have been used to improve the roads in many areas, and possibly they would have saved lives, as well as permitting a bus service.  In the Bohernabreena area there are dangerous corners and if these were taken away it would give the bus a chance to go five miles further up the road and that would be of great use bringing the people to Mass on Sunday mornings.  The people around Bohernabreena are as well entitled to a bus service as the people in the city or elsewhere throughout the county. We are trying to improve things and advance, but what can you do when you have people who are supposed to represent the workers voting for the reduction of the road grant and thereby to throw workers out of employment?</P>
    <P>I want to refer to unemployment in South County Dublin as a result of chippings being brought in from another county.  In that area there are two or three quarry owners who have worked for the Dublin County Council for a number of years.  I know two of them have done that work for at least 25 years.  They employed local labour.  They have had to dismiss this labour because of these chippings being <Col N="525" /> brought in form elsewhere.  They have spent thousands of pounds on machinery.  The excuse given by the Dublin County Council is that the particular type of chippings they turn out is not now suitable, although it was suitable for 25 years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>That particular section of the county council is directly under his jurisdiction.  I do not say that the Minister is cognisant of the facts.  I am giving him the information now.  I understand that a number of men in South County Dublin have lost their employment.  I am concerned with those men, just as I am concerned with every section of the people.  One quarry owner is in the position that he will now have to sell out, notwithstanding that he had <i>carte blanche</i> with the Dublin County Council for the past 25 years.  If the Minister requires more details about this I shall give them to him.  He may be able to do something in the matter. It is sad to see these men lose their employment.  One wonders where it will all end.  I feel that some of our workers have been betrayed.  For that reason, no words of mine could be strong enough to emphasise the present position, not only in that sphere but in other spheres as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cottage repairs are another matter requiring urgent attention.  Some of the cottages are in an appalling condition. Some are built along river banks.  Some are built in hollows.  The owners of these houses are entitled to consideration.  It is said that every effort is being made to save the people from disease and to make them healthy.  Surely it is important that housing should have first consideration in that regard?  I am sick talking about this and making representations about it.  Will the Minister see what can be done to expedite these repairs? I have gone into rooms, seen tubercular patients in bed in them, and found the mortar falling off the walls. I was told at one stage that something would be done when the county council came into that area.  That is a year ago now and nothing has been done <Col N="526" /> since.  These are the excuses one always gets.  One is always put off. That is why I am taking the opportunity of raising the matter in the House now.</P>
    <P>I made representations some time ago with regard to Loughshinny and Rush harbours for which the Dublin County Council has responsibility.  I visited the harbours with some of the officials.  Certain plans were submitted to the responsible Minister.  The Department of Agriculture has signified its consent to making a grant available provided the county council will also give a grant for the improvement of these harbours.  One of them is completely silted up and, in the case of the other, the fishermen have had their boats destroyed &mdash; boats which cost £2,000 or £3,000.  Is there any machinery available which would help to bring this matter to a satisfactory conclusion as soon as possible?  I will welcome any help given by any Minister or any Department to solve the existing problem for these people.  The usual procedure is to send an engineer; he makes a report; that report is pigeon-holed and nothing is done.  A few years later the same thing happens all over again.  That has been going on for quite a long time.  The fisherman can whistle jigs to a milestone while his boats are smashed to pieces. I ask the Minister to look into the matter.  He has a primary concern in these harbours.  I am sorry to have to raise these matters now because the Minister has taken up the reins of office very recently.  I would feel happier if he had been there longer because he would know the facts better.</P>
    <P>Two or three days ago, passing through portion of my constituency, I saw written on a wall: &ldquo;The Crumlin Democratic Youth Movement Demands Swimming Pools&rdquo;.  I have been sidetracked here on numerous occasions when I have spoken about swimming pools.  Deputy MacEntee, when he was Minister for Local Government, said that he would ask the local authorities to consider plans for swimming pools in different areas.  I regard these as essentials in a district like Crumlin or Drimnagh, where the people are unable to reach the sea.  Representations have been made on numerous occasions, <Col N="527" /> but nothing has been done so far. These youngsters are just as much entitled to swimming facilities as are those of us who are fortunate enough to live by the sea.  Swimming pools have been developed in other countries. We are told that the only thing which prevents their development here is because housing is so much more important.  I regard that as a red herring drawn across the trail.  Certainly housing must come first, but I see no reason why the pools should be shelved completely.  Concrete is fairly plentiful.  Cement is fairly plentiful and sand is fairly plentiful.  I know of no shortage at the moment.  I hope the Minister will recommend the local authorities to go ahead with the development of these pools.</P>
    <P>Last week I put a question down to the Minister for Industry and Commerce asking if he would consider giving a special bus service on two or three days a week to the people in these areas in order to bring them to the sea.  Poor parents find bus fares very expensive at present when they go with their children to the seaside. In fact, many of them find it impossible to pay these fares.  In other countries there are swimming pools in practically all the built-up areas, but the built-up areas in Dublin City and County lack these facilities which are very necessary for the health of the people.  I think it is merely drawing a red herring into the question to suggest that the provision of these facilities would cost so much.  When we had a motion down some time ago, the Parliamentary Secretary told us that the provision of these facilities would cost something in the neighbourhood of £1,000,000.  I do not know on what basis that estimate was prepared.  I have gone into this matter with engineers.  As an old swimmer myself, I am interested in it. I have made representations in regard to it on many occasions.  I shall continue to make these representations, and on every occasion voice my opinion as to the necessity for the establishment of swimming pools in these areas. I would urge on the Minister to take active steps to see what can be done in this matter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="528" /> I should also like to bring to the Minister's notice the fact that many of the newly built-up areas lack decent parks.  In my constituency, in the Walkinstown area, portion of Crumlin and Inchicore and down into the Bluebell area, there is no decent park where children can amuse themselves. As a result of the lack of these facilities, children who are fond of athletics and of games generally are deprived of the opportunities for recreation.  I find that I have to express some criticism of the town planning authorities because of the very small parks they have provided in some of these housing areas.  I cannot run very far at the moment, although there was a time when I was pretty active in that way, but it would not do me a bit of harm to run several times round these small parks even at present.  I would not feel a bit &ldquo;winded&rdquo;.  The parks that are provided in some of these new housing areas are totally inadequate.  There should be a decent park attached to every housing estate, so that children could be kept off the roads.  Anyone who visits the new Walkinstown estate, where houses are being built at present, will see children playing on the roadside, as the parks provided there are altogether too small.  I should like to see these parks sufficiently large to enable children to play a game of football.  Sufficient space should also be provided to enable mothers to take their children to play.  People living in one portion of the city have, of course, the advantage of being able to go to the Phoenix Park.  With the exception of the small parks which I have mentioned, there are practically no other playing grounds, and people who can afford it, have to travel from one side of the city to the other to enable their children to take sufficient recreation.  So far as the portion of the city in my constituency is concerned, there is an urgent necessity for seeing that proper facilities are provided in the way of recreation grounds for our people.  That is a matter which I should like the Minister to consider at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    <P>I wonder what is the attitude of the Department of Local Government and the respective county councils towards <Col N="529" /> people who have to pay rates for property that is gradually being washed away by the seas?  This is a question that has been put to me in North County Dublin for some time and it is a question with which the Department of Local Government should be concerned since the county council strikes the rates.  I do not think it is a question that was raised here in this House before.  When another Bill, the Local Works Bill was before the House recently, I was hoping that something would have been done under that measure to keep the waters from encroaching on the ratepayers' property and on the roads but I found the very people, mind you, who stated that they were interested in this matter, going into the lobby and voting against it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>And are.  Another &ldquo;headache&rdquo; we have in County Dublin at the moment is the green belt round the city.  The town-planning authorities will allow A, B and C possibly, to build along a stretch of road and then when it comes to D's turn they will tell him that he is within the green belt.  In the Clondalkin area, the Tallaght area and the Firhouse area especially, I have found, if I may say so, many injustices perpetrated in that way. Town planning is a very fine thing in its own way but it is quite a different matter when you come along a stretch of road and see houses built here and there and then all of a sudden certain men are told that they cannot build because the way leads out to a public road.  I am referring specifically now to the Clondalkin area, near Newlands Cross.  At Newlands Cross right along the road there are several houses on both sides of the road.  There are council cottages on the road, but a man who happens to have a few hundred yards of frontage on the road, was stopped from building a house for his son.  I will probably get more detailed information later on and when I do I will give it to you and I would like you to go into the question.</P>

      <P>Another matter I want to refer to is the question of the cemeteries in County Dublin.  Some of them are overcrowded.  Representations have been made about the Balgriffin area, I understand, and for the last five or six years we have been trying to acquire a cemetery there.  I wonder could the Minister have a survey made of such cemeteries to see how they could be improved.  Some of them should be extended.  I do not wish to delay the House by going into the matter in detail, but I could speak for another half-an-hour on this subject alone, pointing out the necessity of having something worth while done about the cemeteries in County Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am going to deal with a point with which I have often dealt before, even before Deputy Dunne came into this <Col N="531" /> House, that is, the question of parish halls.  I am a great believer in living peaceably in rural Ireland and I believe that to do that there must be some little amenities in the villages.  You cannot have local amenities unless there is a centre of attraction where you can go and meet your friends with some cover over your head and not &ldquo;the sky is the limit&rdquo;.  There is an urgent necessity for parish halls in County Dublin and they should be promoted by the Department of Local Government. If the Department of Local Government gave the matter any consideration at all it might be responsible for encouraging the people of rural Ireland to join debating and dramatic societies, to hold debates and even social evenings.  In North-West Dublin, Ballyboughal, Garristown and the Naul, there is no hall to meet in, notwithstanding all the promises about improving and brightening rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be too hard on the Minister on this occasion, but I ask him to ask the Government to consider the idea of parochial halls as they are urgently necessary.  People travel on bicycles five, six or ten miles out of their own areas because there is no amusement there and on a number of occasions they get wet and catch cold. Fathers and mothers would lend a hand provided they got a lead from the Department or the county council.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I want to refer and which comes under the purview of the county council is that of local libraries.  Dublin County Council has not provided local libraries in a great many cases.  There are libraries in some areas, but in others there are none.  Libraries are an amenity of rural life which should be developed, as there is an urgent necessity for brightening it.  They are urgently demanded day after day and no matter where you go people will refer to this matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister should try to do something to re-employ the people in County Dublin who have lost their employment. As a member of the Fianna Fáil Party, I am very concerned about the unemployed although, mind you, <Col N="532" /> Deputy Dunne may not think so.  He misrepresents me sometimes.  I can assure Deputy Dunne that even before he came into this House I was very interested in seeing that everybody had a job, and might I assure the Deputy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I wonder will Deputy Dunne go out and tell the people of County Dublin or of Ireland that he voted for these people being unemployed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of points I would like to raise and the <Col N="533" /> first is the question of the grants for the main roads.  We have heard monotonous repetition from the previous speaker on this question and the fact that it has caused considerable unemployment in his constituency.  I do not know if that is true in his constituency, but such is not the case in the constituency I represent where no men have been disemployed as a result of the reduction in the grants for the main roads.  As a matter of fact, the late Minister pointed out to the county council that they should spend money at the same rate as if the same grant was being made until the Local Authorities (Works) Bill came into operation.  It would have been in operation were it not for the obstruction of the Opposition who tabled, I think, 48 amendments to hold up that very valuable scheme for rural Ireland.  Those Deputies opposite came into the Dáil&mdash; Deputy MacEntee in particular &mdash; and said that the Local Authorities (Works) Bill was a fiasco and would be of no benefit to rural Ireland, that the only jobs which could be done were the removal of old tyres and tin cans from the beds of rivers.  The following week, when the Fianna Fáil Deputies went to their own constituencies and got the feeling of the people, they came back and soon told Deputy MacEntee where he got off.  As a result, this Works Bill came in here and all the amendments were dropped like a hot brick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not see why money should be expended on main roads at the expense of the secondary roads and culs-de-sac. During the war years, there was very little material available for the repair and maintenance of the main roads.  I think it was a crime on the part of Fianna Fáil that they did not spend more money during that period on the repair and maintenance of by-roads, accommodation roads and culs-de-sac. Speaking for my own county, which I know best, the position there is very serious at the moment in regard to the repair of these by-roads. In addition to the county, secondary and main roads that the county council maintain every year, they also expend money every three years on the maintenance of culs-de-sac and accommodation <Col N="534" /> roads.  Last year, 1948, there was a surcharge on the county council of £2,700 for spending money on these roads.  It is a very strange thing that that should happen, when the same amount of money was being expended practically for the last 25 or 26 years. The last surcharge took place in 1929 and there was not another surcharge until 1948.  I know perfectly well that the Minister for Local Government is not responsible for that, but the position down the country is that the propaganda is abroad that the inter-Party Government is responsible for knocking certain culs-de-sac and by-roads off the list for maintenance.  It is peculiar how the accountant or whoever is responsible should take it into his head, in the year 1948-49, to surcharge the county council, when they were not surcharged since 1929.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know I cannot advocate legislation on an Estimate. I am not advocating legislation.  I am merely pointing out that the Minister is responsible for local administration and that county councils in turn are responsible for the repair and maintenance of these roads.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I would like to inquire from the Minister whether he can, by Act or otherwise, give power to the county councils to tackle this problem and give permission to the county councils to do repairs.  It is well known that most county councils are only too willing to spend money on culs-de-sac and by-roads, if they have permission from the Minister to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What it really amounts to is that you have two villages side by side and the road leading into one village can be repaired every three years by the county council for the simple reason that the road has been repaired since the time of the grand jury in 1898. Beside that village, you could have a still bigger village with a road leading into it and the county council cannot repair that road, because it was not done prior to 1898.  That means that the people living in the second village have to bear the greater portion of the expense of road repair.  That is very unfair and I would ask the Minister to look into it.  I know the late Minister was very keen on providing good secondary and accommodation roads in <Col N="536" /> rural Ireland.  After all, the people who should get first preference from this House, and especially from rural Deputies, are those who are living in rural Ireland.  If we have not good roads for them, to bring out farm produce and cattle, to go to Mass and schools, conditions will always be bad in the rural areas, and we cannot feel surprised if the youth do not want to stay at home.  It is very harsh in winter time if &mdash; as has happened in several areas in my constituency&mdash; people have to wear Wellingtons or rubber boots all through the winter season.  They cannot wear shoes or ordinary leather boots because of the condition of these by-roads and accommodation roads that lead into their houses.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer also to the appointment of rate collectors.  I am not a member of a local authority &mdash; and I am glad to say that I am not, seeing the deplorable squabbles that go on at some of the meetings of those bodies or their committees.  Some time ago, it became apparent in my constituency that there would be vacancies for rate collectors.  As a result, there was a scurry to all the local county councillors by people who were interested.  I know perfectly well that meetings were held by members of the Opposition at which they decided to nominate certain individuals for positions as rate collectors. Due to the fact that Fianna Fáil has a majority on the county council, it was an automatic selection and they could steam-roll their particular selection.</P>

If rate collectors are to be appointed, <Col N="537" /> they should be appointed on merit and not on political patronage.  I do not want to see a Clann na Poblachta rate collector, a man selected because he is a supporter of Clann na Poblachta.

It is a matter which I am sure the Minister is giving attention to, and the sooner <Col N="538" /> we get back to decent local administration the better for the country.  Previous speakers have said that the standard of the public representatives on local bodies at present is low and has been low for a number of years. That is definitely so, for the simple reason that the decent men will not go forward for election in particular areas because they would be merely wasting their time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether I will be ruled out of order if I refer to the erection of pumps, in view of the fact that the county council is the responsible body.  In some counties great efforts are made to provide pumps in the different villages, while in other counties, such as my own, very little effort is made by the local authority to sink these pumps.  A lot depends on what recommendation the engineer makes.  Some engineers consider that wells are appropriate, and, as a result, all we get is a wall built around an open well, while in the next area fine pumps will be sunk.  It would be better if we could have some general policy for the whole country in this connection.</P>
      <P>There are a number of areas in my constituency where the people have been applying for years for the erection of pumps and, so far, no attempt has been made by the local authority to provide them.  It has been suggested that lack of suitable boring equipment is responsible, but there is good equipment available at present, and I suggest that these local authorities should be spurred on in this respect. It is a matter which affects the health of our people.  If we are to have open wells which can be used by cattle, sheep, horses and dogs, all the efforts now being made to improve the health of the people will be in vain.  I urge the Minister to devise some overall plan for the entire country and not to let each area make its own arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to housing, the problem is greatest in city areas, and especially in Dublin City, but there is a problem <Col N="539" /> in the rural areas &mdash; I think Deputy Burke referred to it &mdash; in connection with the compulsory powers for the acquisition of sites.  I do not want to give specific instances &mdash; I do not think it should be done &mdash; but at times it is hard to understand why local authorities pick particular sites or decide to take a piece of land from a certain individual.  One is led to believe at times that the reason is somewhat vindictive, but, as in other matters, one needs proof before one should talk about it.  I do not intend to cite any particular instance in my own constituency, but I am having inquiries made with regard to the reason for the county council deciding to acquire certain sites, and, when these have been completed, I will ask the Minister to look into the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MatthewOReilly" hpid="Mr. M. O'Reilly Mr. M. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I should like to wish the new Minister well and I hope that anything I may have to say to him will be as constructive as possible, because I consider that he presides over one of the most important Departments in the State. His Department is equally as important as Agriculture and Industry, mainly because his real duty is the building of houses.  It will be admitted by everybody, I think, that the failure up to the present is lamentable.  The Road Fund was cut because there was too much money for the roads &mdash; I presume that was the reason.  It is admitted on all sides here that there is any amount of money for houses and yet we cannot build a house.  We have built practically no houses since this Government came into power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of us who were here during the years 1929, 1930 and 1931 will remember that the position then was equally lamentable, and I heard Deputies representing the Dún Laoghaire area and other areas describing how people in these areas actually had to exchange at night in order to get a few hours' rest.  One party got up and walked around in order to let another go to bed.  So far as I know, the same position obtains now.  By 1932, however, the people got a remedy and that <Col N="540" /> remedy was to fire Cumann na nGaedheal.  During the course of the election in 1928, there were profuse promises about all the houses that were to be built and, by 1932, they had made no more progress than this Government has made.  The result was that the people took the necessary steps to see that that position was changed.  When Fianna Fáil were returned to power, there was only one Minister controlling all these services.  He did not even have a Parliamentary Secretary.  The times were extremely bad.  I often wonder how he erected so many houses in the City of Dublin and throughout the country.  He had energy.  He was not running around the country paying visits to this county council to-day and to another county council to-morrow. He sat in his office in the Custom House.  He built a new city in the City of Dublin.  One cannot go a mile on any road without seeing the results of his efforts.  What is the reason that the Coalition Government cannot emulate him?  The main reason is that Fine Gael is there with its old tradition.  We have any amount of money to build houses.  We have not the men to build them.  There has been a campaign to burn turf.  We have not the men to cut turf.  I wonder what is wrong.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well, but if he is not able to bring about a change, the people will have to take the necessary steps, because the conditions that prevail are inhuman.  I go along the principal roads from Oldcastle to Trim and from Trim to the borders of Dublin, which is a distance of about 40 miles.  There is only one new labourer's cottage built in that whole district.  There are four half-built houses in the town of Trim, and in most of the districts there are three, four and five families living in one house.  I wonder what is wrong with us that we can neither cut turf nor build houses.  I hope the new Minister will stay in his office and administer the affairs of his Department and not kill himself running about from one county council to another telling them that there is plenty of money but that something else is wrong.</P>
    <P>If it is a question of land acquisition, <Col N="541" /> had not we the same trouble to acquire land or were we, as some of the Opposition Parties said before the elections, dictators?  Were we able to walk in and say to a farmer or landowner to get out and give us the land?  We had the same difficulties to get land and to get title.  In fact, we had more difficulty. Yet housing was carried out.</P>
    <P>I think all Parties will agree here and now that the position is as I describe it, that I am not exaggerating it in any way.  Deputy Peadar Cowan fully bears out what I am saying and I am sure any Deputy from a rural area will do the same.  There is not very much use in the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Health, going around the country telling the people he will build hospitals and sanatoria and end tuberculosis if there are nine, ten or 11 people living in a small labourer's cottage.  Sometimes it is not even a labourer's cottage but a thatched mudwall house, badly ventilated and possibly extremely damp.  There is not very much use in talking about curing the sick and ending tuberculosis if housing is not first provided.  I believe, as I think everybody believes, that good housing is the first essential.  We must try to organise ourselves to provide houses.</P>
    <P>When the road grant was cut &mdash; and it was cut by £77,000 in County Meath&mdash; I asked myself what better work than the maintenance of the roads did the Government intend to carry out.  I believed that houses would be built.  It was only last week that they started to repair most of the roads.  The information I got was that there was no money to do it.  Now the difficulty seems to be that, while there is money to do it, as in the case of housing, the men are not there to carry out the work.  Men cannot remain in the country if there is no employment for them.  They had to go elsewhere and they did go elsewhere. Now the difficulty is to get men.  That situation is due to what I believe is traditional with the present Coalition Government, the confusion that they create.</P>
    <P>I wonder how the present Minister will get on with the Minister for Agriculture. Both of them have Bills going <Col N="542" /> through the Dáil at the same time dealing with drainage.  There is no limit to the amount of drainage that they are to do.  I think the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Board of Works &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well, I shall not proceed on that line.  At any rate, it will be one of the duties of the present Minister in future and I hope the same confusion will not arise in that connection as apparently is arising in the administration of his Department now.  As I said in the beginning, it is not easy for an ordinary person to understand how it is that from 1932 until the outbreak of war Fianna Fáil were able to erect so many houses, under the greatest difficulties.  They erected board of health houses and Land Commission houses.  It would be a good thing if the present Minister could delve into the records of the Department to see how it was done.  It was done by thought and organisation. There is not very much use in saying that building is more difficult now than it was then.  It may be somewhat more costly but that consideration will not enter into the question because it is admitted here that there is plenty of money.</P>
      <P>I have a helpful suggestion to make to the Minister.  I noticed in that journey of 40 miles that I referred to, on which I saw one labourer's cottage built and three in the initial stages of erection, ten or 12 private houses being built and some of them completed. Therefore, I take it that material is available.  It is difficult to understand how private builders can get men to build houses when men cannot be got to build cottages.  Shops are in course of reconstruction throughout the country. What is the explanation for that? The Minister might inquire into that aspect of the matter and he may get a great deal of helpful information.</P>

I do not think that the matters which were annoying him, and which motivated his somewhat bitter speech, were relevant to the debate. Statements were made by him with regard to housing in County Dublin. What is the position?  In the ten years which preceded the change of Government 14 houses were built in County Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not concerned with that.  In 12 months Dublin County Council has set under way 1,000 houses in County Dublin.  Within two or two and a half years we shall have the back of the housing problem broken &mdash;a thing which was not done under the aegis of Fianna Fáil, nor was an attempt ever made to do it.  We have heard loose statements and homilies from Deputy Burke &mdash; obviously for the benefit of some of the henchmen in the gallery who were present at the Árd Fheis.  Certainly they cannot have been made for the benefit of those of us who are on the county council and who know the position.  I am sure that Deputy Burke's own Party colleagues who are members of Dublin County Council would be very quick to take offence at some of the statements which he had the temerity to make here in regard to the housing position.  The people in County Dublin see a much better degree of hope now than ever <Col N="544" /> they have seen in connection with this problem of housing.</P>
      <P>I want to put to the Minister that the housing problem in the constituency I represent is at one and the same time semi-rural and semi-urban.  We get the overflow from the metropolis.  The people who cannot find space in the city spill out into County Dublin.  They come to live in caravans and in bus bodies; they locate themselves in rooms of labourers' cottages or wherever they can.  Therefore, the actual problem itself is accentuated by this overflow. That problem, which is a more acute problem than obtains in any other county in Ireland, is being met by the Dublin County Council and it is being met effectively.  The administrative staff of the Dublin County Council and the members of the Dublin County Council of all Parties are deadly in earnest that they are not going to allow the housing problem to be made a political football but that they are going to work in harness, each and every one of them, to arrive at a solution of the problem.  We have not the honour of Deputy Burke's presence on that council, although I think we are all the better for that.  We can get a lot of constructive work done and we do not have to listen to a lot of rámeis every time he gets on his feet.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to cottage repairs. There are roughly 3,000 to 4,000 labourers' cottages in County Dublin. It is safe to say that 99.9 of them are in need of repairs for the simple reason that up to the time the Dublin County Council was reconstituted, which was about six or seven months ago, the entire repair staff to look after these cottages consisted of 19 individuals, between tradesmen and labourers &mdash; and every cottage needing repair.  I ask the Minister and every Deputy if any progress can be made in a situation where over 3,000 cottages need repairs, while there are only 19 individuals to do the work.  The present position is that that staff has been trebled.  We certainly are not satisfied that the best possible progress is being made.  I believe the staff will have to be doubled again before we can make any impression on this particular problem.  This raises another very important matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="545" /> Houses have been built in County Dublin under the Fianna Fáil régime, some of them as recently as 1938, which are fit now only to be condemned. They should never have been passed as fit for human habitation.  They can be seen by any member of this House who cares to take a 3d. bus ride to Turnapin or Santry, where cottages which were built in 1938 are fit to be condemned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>The present position in regard to cottage repairs seems to me to be a national problem almost as great as that of housing.  I have felt for a very considerable time that while it is possible to make progress, and very considerable progress, in areas where you have an efficient and an active and a well-intentioned local authority in regard to this problem, there are other areas where the reverse applies and where efforts seem to be made by certain elements to sabotage the whole effort to produce houses for the people.  This job is so huge that it is one which should constitute a Department on its own and, in my view, there is no person in this House who would be better equipped to undertake the task of this housing problem than the present Minister.  He is a man who has had a long experience of the work of local authorities and has a very thorough knowledge of the problem as it affects the rural areas and as it affects the urban districts.  Certainly, I am convinced and satisfied and I believe every Deputy in this House, even those in the Opposition Party, knows in his heart that no better Minister could be found to tackle this problem than the present Minister.  It is such a problem, particularly in the City of Dublin, that it needs careful <Col N="546" /> consideration and constructive criticism and it is a problem that should not be used merely as a matter for political Party controversy.</P>
      <P>As I have already indicated, my constituency is affected in some degree by the tremendous problem in the city. There is no question but that there is a definite shortage of skilled labour for building work.  Some Deputies, assuming an innocence which is in no way deceptive, ask why it is not possible to get men to work on building.  The answer is that the men are not there. They went to Britain during the war. Many of them have not returned and it is impossible to induce them to return.  I believe that some further efforts are needed to induce these men to return.  I believe, in common with Deputy Cowan, that guaranteed employment should be offered to them. They should be offered pensionable status and the bugbear of the building trade worker, wet time, should be completely eliminated.  I believe also that no form of building whatsoever should be permitted other than the building of working-class houses until such time as that problem is solved.  It is a fundamental problem.  It is of no earthly use to a man, who is trying to rear a family to have his living conditions improved &mdash; whether by way of wage increases or otherwise, or by improvements in social services &mdash; unless he has, as a foundation, a decent dwelling in which he and his family can live. Unless we can solve this problem, and solve it with rapidity, the basic aspect of life in this country and the basic problem of life will not be touched.  I would urge upon the Minister that there is a definite need for a propaganda drive throughout Britain to attract back the skilled workers, the Irishmen who were forced to leave this country during the war because they could not get work here, those who had to go out, or sign on at the labour exchange.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we hear all this talk now about unemployment from the Deputies of the Opposition, it strikes me as a great deal of hypocritical cant.  They know very well that during the years of the war shiploads of our people went away.  It is our job to try to get <Col N="547" /> them back because we need them.  We can only do that by bringing the message home to them that they are needed here and by making certain conditions of work and wages available to them which will make it attractive to them to come back.  Indeed, in some cases during those years whole families transferred across the water, and it is not an easy thing for a man, when he has built a life for himself in England, to return here on the off-chance that he may get the casual employment which has been a feature of the building trade of this country for some years.  There is only one way to attract a man back and that is to offer him continuity of employment and to guarantee him wages for each week that he works and also guarantee him a decent pension at the end of his life.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the need for housing in that part of my constituency which lies east of the main Swords-Balbriggan road.  There is an urgent need for housing all through that area. We have been told, however, that it will be impossible to solve the problem adequately there until the Howth main drainage scheme is undertaken.  Every Deputy, at one time or another, has been heart-scalded by administrative delay in so far as certain schemes in relation to Government Departments are concerned.  This Howth main drainage scheme has been talked of for a very long time.  Until that scheme is constructed, it appears that we cannot make a great deal of progress in that area.  I therefore urge the Minister to bring as much pressure as possible to bear upon his Department to secure the speedy implementation of that scheme.</P>
    <P>The same thing applies to the North County Dublin water supply scheme. Throughout County Dublin we have many cases of housing schemes carried out in places remote from either water or drainage.  These schemes were carried out, I understand, in pursuance of the policy adopted at one time by the local authority in County Dublin of seizing land from defaulting rate-payers. It did not matter, of course, where that land was or what type of <Col N="548" /> land it was.  In many cases it was the nearest approach to bog land, but it was considered good enough for labourers' cottages and they were built on it miles from water or sewerage. Until the North County Dublin regional water scheme is put into operation there is little hope of providing sanitation for the particular housing schemes I refer to.  I would urge the Minister to inquire into the matter and do all that is possible to speed it up. A similar scheme is said to be planned for South County Dublin and I would make the same request in regard to that.</P>
    <P>In connection with this question of housing there also arises the very important matter of rents.  I notice that Deputy O'Leary had a question on the Order Paper to-day in relation to the rent of houses built by local authorities and the problem of asking a labourer to pay a rent of 10/6, as in the case of Enniscorthy, for a new house built for him.  In County Dublin we have had houses recently built in the Santry area the rent of which will be in the neighbourhood of 15/- per week.  It is said that the economic rent of these houses would be something like 31/- or 32/-but, by means of grants, etc. and a levy upon the rates, the rent has been reduced to 12/6, which, with the rates added, makes 15/-.  I think it is worse than useless for any local authority to consider that they are really solving the housing problem by building houses for which rents will have to be charged at that level.</P>
    <P>I daresay that legislation will be necessary to deal with that question. If there is any method, however, apart from the lengthy process of legislation, whereby the grants per house from the central funds to county councils can be increased so that the rents may be kept at a lower figure, I would urge the Minister to look into it, because while we are solving this problem of housing, I can foresee a still greater problem arising.  It is quite easy to visualise a farm labourer or road worker in my constituency, or, indeed, in any part of Ireland, earning from £3 to £3 10s. 0d. a week, trying to rear a family of four, five or, possibly, six children, going into a labourer's <Col N="549" /> cottage and being asked to pay a rent of from 10/- to 15/- and, with the passage of time, finding himself unable to continue meeting that heavy demand.  We have to look ahead.  If it is possible to secure a reduction in the rents by extending the period of time for repayment of the loans, that is an avenue which might be explored by the Minister.  I would urge it upon him, because it is certainly a very important matter.</P>
    <P>I have had a considerable amount to do latterly with the question of loans under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act.  It would appear that a great deal of confusion and delay arises in connection with the valuation put on small dwellings by the valuer of the local authority as compared with the market value, as it is described, or the price which the building contractor requests the people going into these small dwellings to pay.  The Minister should advise all local authorities that every effort should be made, first of all, to eliminate the great delay that occurs in securing valuations for houses built under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act.  Secondly, I believe that the Minister should see to it that an adequate number of valuers are available to local authorities in each area. It should be a cardinal principle of the Small Dwellings Act that that Act is designed for the small man, the man who has from £50 to £150 to put down. In some cases it is impossible, because of housing costs on the one hand and the low percentage loan&mdash;75 to 80 per cent. &mdash;on the other hand which operate in some areas, for the man who has succeeded in saving, say £100 to being building his own house.  He would need, perhaps, double that or more than double.  I do not believe it is necessary to recast legislation to meet the situation, but I think it is necessary that the Minister should suggest that every effort should be made by local authorities to see that valuations of houses are given and that the percentage of loans should be so raised as to meet the needs of the person with £50 to £150, for whose benefit this Act is designed.  No obstacle should be put in his way to enable him to do <Col N="550" /> what he wants to do, the very laudable thing of building his own house.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of talk in connection with the cutting of the road grants.  We have people crying salt tears over road workers.  I have had a little to do with road workers over the past few years and these people, so far as I know, never even knew of, or cared for, the existence of road workers before, but they are a good hobby horse now for political purposes.  In County Dublin, Deputy Burke talked about unemployment caused by the cutting of the road grants.  I understand the Rules of Order prevent me from describing that statement exactly for what it is.  At any rate, it is not correct.  The cutting of the road grants did not result in the disemployment of one solitary person in County Dublin because the Dublin County Council took steps to see that they would strike their rate at a level which would guarantee continuity of employment for the workers.  If every county council had the same regard for their road workers we would not have the position where men are disemployed.</P>
    <P>I believe &mdash; and never for one moment, either here or outside this House, have I made any statement to the contrary&mdash; that it is the duty of any Government to provide employment at decent wages for every able-bodied man in the country.  If the local authorities throughout the country wished to implement that principle there would not be so much opportunity for Deputies to come in here and try to put on the Minister for Local Government and others responsibility for their own act. At the moment there is a certain amount of unemployment.  In some degree, at least, that is due, in my view, to a little bit of sabotage on the part of sympathisers of the previous Administration who still hold office in local authorities throughout the country.  In other cases it was a result of the reluctance of local authorities to increase the rates, despite the fact that every year that goes by rates have been increased.  Increases in rates have been a progressive feature of the life of local authorities over a long period.  This year, because in some <Col N="551" /> areas there was a need to put 1/- or 2/- extra on the rates, Fianna Fáil Deputies threw up their hands in holy horror and so created a situation whereby men would be unemployed.  I think the Opposition tactics in this matter have been foolish.  They have shown their hand to the rest of the country by their particularly inane performances in relation to the Public Works Bill.  Every person, even supporters of the Opposition, even some of their supporters who are over in the Mansion House to-day, admitted that it was a tactical blunder &mdash; which they now admit themselves &mdash; to show their hand to the extent of trying to hold up and prevent by a disgraceful exhibition in this House the implementation of a very beneficial and useful Bill.</P>

That was in pursuance of the policy of Fianna Fáil.  They were thrown out without any hope of getting compensation of any kind for their long life of service. People who talk about betraying workers should not imagine that their own sins are confined to their own consciences and their own minds.  This particular act was one of the meanest that was ever perpetrated on any body of workers anywhere.  These men now, in the last days of their lives, are left without any hope of even benefiting under the much-aired Local Authorities Superannuation Act.</P>

      <P>Deputy McQuillan made a point about the appointment of rate collectors to which I wish to refer.  If this matter could be rectified without legislation &mdash; I am not clear on the position myself &mdash; I believe, with Deputy McQuillan and with every other Deputy who is a member of a local authority and who has had experience of it, that this power of appointment of rate collectors should be taken from the local authorities.</P>

It is not decent; it is not right, and it is not the type of conduct that should be carried through by public men.  I do not think Deputy Burke was in order in referring to coast erosion.</P>

      <P>I hope that I will be as much in order as he was on the matter.  It was sprung on the House as being something new and as part of Deputy Burke's herculean efforts on behalf of the people of the County Dublin &mdash; that he had been working for years to secure a remedy for coast erosion.  The fact of the matter is that the sea was practically washing away his own back door and had been discussed dozens of times &mdash; it received publication on a national scale &mdash; before Deputy Burke knew anything about it. The Deputy now takes the bow.  I would ask the Minister to look into the question.  It is a very serious one.  It would seem that many Government Departments, when approached to do something about it and engage in this work, have been dodging responsibility in respect of coast erosion.  I would ask the Minister to inquire into it and see if it is possible either for some Department of State or a local authority to take power to remedy this problem, because it is doing a great deal of damage, particularly in Portrane and in other areas along the coast in North County Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was surprised to hear Deputy O'Reilly refer to the lack of houses in the County Meath.  It seems to me, as I said earlier, that the local authority in every area must bear responsibility either for progress or lack of progress in housing.  I do not know if Deputy O'Reilly is a member of the local authority in the County Meath, but, if my memory serves me right, the chairman of that local authority is a member of his Party.  If only one house has been built in the County Meath, that certainly reflects very little credit on the local authority there.  I do not think it is expected that the Minister can go down to the country and build houses himself.  All that he can do is to give the maximum amount of encouragement and money to the local authority, and that has been done and is being done.  That is all that I propose to say on this Estimate.  In conclusion, I want to say that, under the aegis of the present Minister, we are going to make progress of a very definite nature in the Department of Local Government.  I think that he is <Col N="554" /> a very worthy successor to the late Tim Murphy who did such great work during the short time that he was Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;as a result of the cutting down of the road grant.  That is understandable, because we all remember that, when there was a certain motion put down here condemning the Government for having cut down the road grant, Deputy Dunne had to get an undertaking from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government that special treatment would be meted out to the County Dublin and that otherwise there was the danger that he was going to support the Opposition motion.  Therefore, I suppose it comes as no surprise to us to hear from Deputy Dunne that no one was disemployed in County Dublin.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>It fared very badly. Would the Deputy like to know that in Kerry the road grant was cut down by £40,000 and that no Deputy from the County Kerry, whether he was a supporter of the present Government or a supporter of the Opposition, got an undertaking or a promise from the Minister for Local Government or from the Parliamentary Secretary to that Minister that special treatment would be meted out to that county?  Now, Deputy Dunne accuses us on these benches of being hypocrites when we talk about unemployment.  Are we supposed to sit silently here and not make reference to the question of unemployment? I do not know whether it is in order at all to discuss unemployment <Col N="555" /> on this Estimate, but it is very surprising how little concerned the Deputies opposite are now about this question of unemployment when we remember how vocal they were on the same issue before the change of Government.</P>
      <P>I was also very interested to hear the discussion on the appointment of rate collectors.  To judge by the remarks of Deputy McQuillan, and by Deputy Dunne who succeeded him, it appears that if a person is a supporter of Fianna Fáil he cannot even be appointed a rate collector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>Much discussion has taken place on the question of housing. It appears to me that Deputy Dunne is about the only member of the House who is perfectly satisfied with the rate of progress that housing has made since the inter-Party Government came into office.  I do not know what the position is in other constituencies, but, as regards my own constituency of North Kerry, I must say that very little progress has been made with housing.  I do not know what is the cause of it. I know cases where people made application for housing grants more than a year ago and they still have not been paid these grants.  Will the Minister tell us the cause of that delay?  These <Col N="557" /> are private persons who made application in the ordinary way, submitted plans and specifications, and it is only now that some of them are being paid. Other grants still remain to be paid. If that is the rate of progress all over the country, I am afraid the Minister has a lot of leeway to make up.</P>
      <P>Everybody realise the importance of housing.  It should come first and foremost in the programme of the Minister for Local Government.  I imagine the success or failure of that Minister should be judged according to the progress that housing makes under his leadership.  That should be the criterion of the success or failure of the Minister. Deputy Dunne mentioned the number of houses that are being built in County Dublin and he referred to what he alleged was the poor building programme during the previous ten years. It is hardly necessary for me to remind Deputy Dunne and others that there was an emergency for six of these ten years and were it not for that emergency almost all the requirements of the people in the matter of houses would have been met by now.</P>

      <P>We built very few dance halls, and even if we were responsible for the building of a dance hall or two here and there, it would be no bad work, because many people say it is the business of the Government to brighten the lives of the rural community.  If the present Minister makes the same progress for the next six years in the matter of housing that the Fianna Fáil Minister made from 1932 to 1939 he will be doing a good day's work for the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act and its working, and I would appreciate some information from the Minister as to how that Act is applied.  I know of a person who was anxious to build a house.  He is an artisan earning about £7 a week. He has very little capital and he applied to the local authority for a loan under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act but he did not succeed in getting <Col N="558" /> it.  He was told at one time that he would qualify for a loan and then later he was informed that he did not qualify.  I do not know what conditions govern the administration of that Act, and perhaps the Minister will tell us how it works out &mdash; how a person who has little capital and who is anxious to build can avail himself of the provisions of the Act in present circumstances.</P>
    <P>Some 12 months ago I addressed a question to the then Minister for Local Government in connection with the bad state of repair of roads in counties like Kerry, where enormous traffic took place during the emergency years.  I asked the Minister if he would be prepared to consider giving special attention to roads in the West and South of Ireland, where there was turf traffic during the emergency.  The Minister said he would give the matter his attention.  Everybody knows that there was an inordinate amount of lorry traffic over these roads, and the roads fell into an awful state of disrepair as a result.  I think the present Minister should take up the matter and see if it would not be possible to make special provision for these roads.  I may be told by the Minister that if these roads suffered so much as a result of the heavy traffic in connection with the turf industry, the people living in those areas benefited by this traffic, but I do not think that should be used as an argument against what I am advocating.  Deputy Davin questioned me about the amount of the cut in the road grant in County Kerry.  It appears to me that, unless the Minister gives special attention to the points I have raised, and having regard to the amount of money that the local authority will have, nothing will be done to restore the roads to proper condition.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I would like to refer is the burning of turf in public institutions.  More than 12 months ago when we were discussing the closing down of the hand-won turf industry, which, indeed, was a great loss to the people in my constituency as well as to those in other constituencies, the then Minister said that he was requesting local authorities to <Col N="559" /> burn turf instead of coal in public institutions.  Have the local authorities acceded to that request in the turf producing areas?</P>
    <P>Recently a deputy county manager was appointed in County Kerry.  This appointment is unprecedented since the county manager, who was appointed to some other job, appointed a deputy to carry out his duties for a certain period.  An official who had already held a position of trust in the Department of Local Government was appointed.  But the person so appointed is not the person that the local authority wanted to appoint.  By a unanimous decision the members decided that a certain individual was a fit and proper person to carry out the duties of deputy county manager but, despite the fact that this decision was unanimous, another person was appointed over their heads.  Does the Minister consider that a democratic procedure?  The Minister and his colleagues have been very vocal in the past in relation to the County Management Act.  They have described the policy of appointing county managers as dictatorship.  Where can one find a more blatant example of dictatorship than where an appointment is made over the heads of a local authority, especially when the members of that authority are unanimous in their decision? Can the Minister justify that?</P>

      <P>It is taking the Government a long time to make up their minds to abolish it.  They have been condemning it wholesale but so far they have done nothing to abolish it.  They are very slow in repealing it.  I remember on one occasion the present Minister for Defence said that there were <Col N="560" /> good features in the County Management Act.</P>

      <P>Why did the Deputies on the Government Benches condemn this Act holus bolus?  I was referring to what I described as a very undemocratic step or procedure on the part of both a county manager and the Minister for Local Government.  I do not know exactly who is to blame.  The unanimous decision of the local authority was flouted and an appointment made over their heads.</P>
      <P>Deputy McQuillan referred to obstruction by the Opposition to the Local Authorities (Works) Bill.  I deny that there was any such obstruction. The amendments that were put down to that Bill were put down for the purpose of safeguarding the rights of private property.  I think it is wrong for any Deputy to say that because amendments are put down to a certain Bill they are put down for the purpose of obstruction the passage of that Bill. Those who tabled the amendments did so because they considered that what they were doing was both right and proper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently I put down a question to the Minister as to whether plans and specifications had been received in his Department for sewerage and water schemes in County Kerry.  I was told that these had been received but that certain things had to be done before the carrying out of the works would be sanctioned.  Subsequently I saw a list of proposed schemes, but the schemes to which I referred in my question were omitted from that list.  At least one scheme was omitted.  I do not know the reason for the omission.  In certain villages in County Kerry there is grave need for both sewerage and water schemes.  I hope that when the Minister and his Department are considering these <Col N="561" /> schemes they will turn their attention to County Kerry.</P>

      <P>I was really amused when Deputy O'Reilly stated that practically no housing had been carried out since the present Government came into office.  He said that he went for a motor drive of 40 miles in County Meath and he had not seen one new house.</P>

      <P>I should like to bring Deputy O'Reilly down to County Kilkenny. In that county there are not five miles of the road over which he will travel that he will not find a new house in every half-mile.  I should like to bring him into the City of Kilkenny, where a scheme for the erection of 245 houses is being completed.  I think these facts are more truly representative of the progress made since the present Government came to office than the statements made by Deputy O'Reilly.  If the Meath County Council are lax in this matter, it is up to Deputy O'Reilly to draw the Minister's attention to it and to see that they get the same facilities for the erection of houses as other councils have got. Deputy O'Reilly seems to make a skit of the fact that the late Minister visited many parts of the country in his efforts to promote the housing drive.  The Minister certainly did visit many counties and, as a result, a large number of houses have since been built in these counties.  I suggest to the present Minister that he should now pay a visit to Meath County Council and try to stir them up to a sense of duty in this matter.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Leary raised the point in a question to the Minister that the rents of houses in Enniscorthy were too high, and that is a matter with which I intend to deal.  In my opinion the rents of houses in all urban areas are much too high at the present time.  We know that the Government give a subsidy of two-thirds up to £350 and a grant from the Transition Fund of £400 in respect of each house built <Col N="562" /> in an urban area.  In my city, the corporation also give a subsidy of 1/-in the £ but after allowing for all the subsidies and grants the rents still work out at 13/6 a house for a four-roomed house.  I think that rent is much too high for the ordinary working man.  We give a subsidy of 1/- in the £ which is to continue for 50 years. If we enter on another scheme, we shall have to give another 1/- in the £ and the same applies to subsequent schemes.  The rates then will increase beyond all bounds so that nobody will be able to pay them.  At the same time, it is not easy for the ordinary working man to pay 13/6 a week for these houses.  Many of the men who are going to occupy these houses are county council workers with wages of only £3 or £4 a week, and it is not easy for these men to pay a rent of 13/6 a week. It is bad enough when they are working constantly but if they meet with sickness or if there is any hold-up in the family, and their rent gets into arrears for four or five weeks, it is impossible to overcome that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of schemes operated by the county council, there is a subsidy of 4d. in the £ from the county rates, but, whereas 1/- in the £ on the city rates only brings down the rent of 250 houses by 2/- in the week, the 4d. on the county rates brings down the same number of houses by 7/6 a week.  Every urban area is affected in the same way as Kilkenny.  Houses in urban areas cost anything from £300 to £400 more than houses of similar size in the rural areas.  First of all you have development costs, the costs of new roads and sewerage and the cost of land.  In urban areas the land costs usually about £120 to £125 an acre, whereas in the rural areas it costs only about £35 an acre.  As a result we have the position that one local authority sets a house &mdash; which I admit has all modern conveniences, bathroom, hot and cold water, etc. &mdash; at 13/6 per week, while the county council can set the same type of house &mdash; it has not modern conveniences, but, on the other hand, there is an acre of land attached in which the tenant can grow potatoes and other vegetables &mdash; at 4/- plus rates, bringing the total <Col N="563" /> rent per week to 5/3.  We have, as I say, these two local authorities, one setting a house at 13/6 a week and the other at 5/3 a week, and in many instances the people occupying these houses have the same rate of wages.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, there is only one cure for this, and that is to give a greater grant from the Transition Fund to urban areas.  The grant from the Transition Fund should be increased to £600 or £700 in urban areas to cover the increased cost, because otherwise the ratepayers in urban areas who are already overburdened with rates cannot afford to pay the subsidies necessary to enable these houses to be let at economic prices.  In suggesting to the Minister that the subsidy from the Transition Fund should be increased to at least £700 per house in the case of urban areas, I would point to the fact that a precedent has already been established by the Government in another Department, the Department of Education, under which bigger grants are given to urban areas for the building of vocational schools than are given to county areas.  In support of that statement I should like to give a quotation from the reply of the Minister of Education to the debate on the Estimate for that Department. Deputy McCann, during the debate, raised the point that while Dublin received only £2 in Government grants in respect of every £1 provided from the rates, Cork receives £4 from the Government in respect of every £1 provided from the rates.  The Minister, in replying to the debate, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is a fact that pound for pound, while Cork and other urban areas may get £4 of Government grant to £1 that comes from the rates, Dublin and Dún Laoghaire get £2 as against £1 that comes from the rates. No serious damage is done either to the interests or to the rights of Dublin, as far as I can see, in fixing the grants in that way.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I therefore, suggest, that the practice has already been established by another Government Department of giving increased grants to certain urban areas to enable them to carry out these schemes.  I suppose that in this matter <Col N="564" /> I am only preaching to the converted because the Minister has a wide experience of housing matters under local authorities.  He has spent a long time in the corporation of his native city and knows all the difficulties which local councils have to encounter but now that I have pointed out that it is already an established fact that another Government Department is prepared to give greater subsidies where the valuation of an urban area is small and does not realise the same revenue as another area, I hope the Minister will be prepared to give increased grants for housing from the Transition Fund.  I do not suggest that the urban areas should get double the present grants. They are already getting £400 per house from the Transition Fund and two-thirds of the subsidy up to £350. I do not suggest that that should be doubled but I would sincerely suggest that he would at least add £200 or £300 to that and give us a chance to build the houses; we will guarantee that we will build them.  The Minister in opening the Estimate stated that he did not intend to make much change in the grants for housing until times became more normal, but if he waits until times become more normal to give bigger grants, we will have finished building houses in Kilkenny, both in the city and in the county.  At the rate we are going we will have finished in another four or five years.  Over 200 houses built in a small city is quite a number and the Minister should not wait until times become normal but help us now when we want help.  We do not want to increase the rates too much; we do not mind increasing them a bit.  Nobody minds a reasonable increase when the houses are going up.</P>
    <P>There has been a discussion on the Small Dwellings Act.  I do not know whether there is obstruction or otherwise, but I understood that a person building a house was entitled to a grant of 80 per cent. of the valuation.  I do not think it is fair that we should have ordinary citizens coming to Deputies like me to ask me to go to the county council for an increased rate.  Some people are getting 65 per cent., some 70 per cent. and others up to 80 per cent., but I think that if 80 per cent. <Col N="565" /> is the amount to which a person is entitled he should get it when he gets the certificate.  After all, the valuation is not made by the person's own valuer or engineer, but by the county engineer and if he values the house at £1,600 or £1,700 the person should automatically get 80 per cent. of that amount and not have to come to me asking me to go to the county secretary or the county manager in order to get an increased grant to pay the builder.  I think that is not right and it is not putting us in a fair position. I was told lately that some Order was sent out recently to county councils to cut down grants a bit, and close in on them.  I do not know whether it has gone out or not, but I have been told it has, and there must be something in it.  I was told that to-day by two people who are building houses in Kildare.  They have built the houses and apparently they must be going to build garages.  They owe the builder £1,000 and the county secretary has said that they cannot have the full amount until the garages are built, but they do not intend to build them for another year.  A person should get 80 per cent. of the valuation and get it with no trouble.  Everybody would be delighted to build houses on their own, but they see the different snags.  There is a snag about getting the title, for instance.  They are asked to go to the Four Courts and the first time they are in Dublin they go along to the Four Courts to get the title, and then there is something else and they are told to go to the Custom House.  A person I met to-day told me that if he knew all the snags he would not have gone through with it. I ask the Minister now to clear up these snags.  If the person's own engineer valued the house there might be a reason to give only 60 per cent., as he might have valued it a bit high, but as the county council values it there is no reason why the person should not get 80 per cent. straight away instead of being held up for years.  Many of these people who seek the grant are young married people who have to furnish the house.  They have to spend £200 or £300 on furniture, so it is not only a question of the cost of building.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="566" /> There is one more matter with which I would like to deal, the Local Government Superannuation Acts. When we had the discussion on the reduction of the grant to the Road Fund several people in various parts of the House stated that county council workers would not be able to work enough days to qualify them for superannuation.  I think that the superannuation grant is being worked a bit harshly.  I have a particular case before my mind where a man worked 287 days for the county council in 1946, 244 days in 1947 and 293 days in 1948, and because he worked only 244 days in 1947 he is not eligible for superannuation.  This man did not refuse to work for the county council on any day.  He was always available for work and, as a matter of fact, he was on the part-time fire brigade.  In spite of being on the part-time fire brigade as a constant man he was still told that he would not be eligible for superannuation.  County council work must have been very short in 1946 and 1947.  When the question was raised, Mr. Murphy said that if the reduction of the Road Fund grant affected any man during the current year so that he would not have sufficient days to qualify under the Local Government Superannuation Act, 1948, he would put the matter right and I ask this Minister to put the matter right in this case.  There must be hundreds of cases where men had not sufficient work in 1947.  In that case the Minister should reduce the number of days required to get a benefit and give the men what they are entitled to after their year's work with the county council.  Other people get it.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to welcome the Minister into his office.  I know what he was before he became Minister; I know that he had experience on a local authority and I have no doubt that he will bring that experience to bear on his present position and carry on the work of the Department which was so ably carried on by his predecessor.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOGrady" hpid="Mr. O'Grady Mr. O'Grady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>The present Minister, as we are all aware, is not very long in office, but he has a colossal task ahead of him if he is to provide a <Col N="567" /> solution for the housing problem.  He has, however, an advantage over his predecessors of the Fianna Fáil Administration in that he is not burdened with responsibility for public health services as well.  He is, in effect, acting in the capacity of director of housing. Some of the previous speakers suggested that we should have a director of housing, but I think that the Minister is the proper man to be director of housing because he is responsible to this Dáil and must account for his stewardship on all occasions.  I think it would be a fatal mistake to divest him of that responsibility and place it on the shoulders of some subordinate official.  It is his responsibility and I am sure &mdash; there is no doubt about it &mdash; that the Minister is naturally as keen to solve this problem as were any of his predecessors in that office.  He has a long way to go, despite all criticism, before he will reach the peak period of house production attained by Fianna Fáil during their last pre-war year of office when materials were still available.  In that year, 1937-38, the number of houses they built or reconstructed reached the very high total of approximately 18,000.  The Minister will certainly show some progress if he is able to attain to that figure within a reasonable period.</P>
      <P>In doing so, we all wish him well. It will bring pleasure to us on all sides of the House, even if we find later on that, for some reason, he is not able to make the progress he at present anticipates. Every Deputy is sincerely anxious to find a solution for this problem as speedily as possible.  Were it not for the advent of the war in 1939, and had the same rate of progress been continued as obtained prior to that, within a further period of three or four years the housing problem would have been solved and the Minister would not have been faced with the problems confronting him to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Crotty drew attention to new houses in urban areas being offered to ordinary workers at rates far in excess of their capacity to pay.  I had experience of that quite recently, when a deputation from Ennis Urban Council came up to wait on the Minister.  They <Col N="568" /> were seen by the Parliamentary Secretary who, unfortunately, was unable to come to the assistance of the local housing authority.  Whether the Minister or the Government likes it or not &mdash; or any future Government &mdash; they will have to come to the rescue of the local authorities and to the rescue of the working classes for whom the houses are being provided, by way of an additional grant from the Transition Fund or by some other means, to enable the local authority to provide houses at a reasonable rent for local workers on small incomes.  They cannot afford the present rents and, on the other hand, the local authority has no remedy.  The only hope I see, with the present high rates being struck by local authorities all over the country, is through some further assistance from the central funds.</P>
    <P>In Ennis, it is estimated, they require 400 more houses.  There is a strong demand also in Kilrush, though not as big, as the population is not so large.  They have gone a considerable way in the past to solve the problem, but there is still a demand in that town.  In the rural parts of my constituency, the workers generally need more accommodation.  Previous speakers have referred to the conditions under which the workers live there, with two or three families living in one small house.  I think that obtains generally throughout the country.</P>
    <P>We are told from the opposite benches, by speakers on behalf of the Government, that money is no obstacle. I sincerely hope that is true and that the appeal by Deputy Crotty, which I heartily endorse, will bear fruit and that the Government will be able to help local authorities in providing houses at reasonable rents.  Money spent on housing is a better investment than money spent on sanatoria. Prevention is better than cure and one of the methods of preventing disease is proper housing.</P>
    <P>The chief complaint I have to make with regard to housing in my constituency is about the delay in the payment of grants due to people who have erected their own houses or who have houses in process of erection.  From time to time, I am getting letters, and people are approaching me personally, <Col N="569" /> to try to expedite the payment of these grants.  I am glad to notice that quite recently there has been a stepping up in the payments.  I hope the Minister will see that henceforth there will be no delay and that immediately the certificate comes in to the Department the payment will be made in the usual way, that is, half the grant when half the work is certified and the balance on presentation of the certificate of completion.</P>
    <P>We have also some waterworks and sewerage schemes in my area and I would like the Minister to speed up these as far as it lies in his power to do so.  In the village of Newmarket, which is adjacent to Shannon Airport, there has been a growing demand for new houses, and particularly for waterworks and sewerage schemes.  In view of its particular situation, it requires immediate attention.  It is one of the first villages the visitor sees on landing at the airport in Rineanna.  If we are to encourage our tourists we must not create a very bad impression by letting their first impact on reaching Ireland be a village of that kind without either water or sewerage.</P>
    <P>I will briefly refer to the roads question.  My colleague, Deputy Kissane, spoke of the roads over which there was heavy turf traffic during the war period.  Those roads have not yet been brought up to a proper state of repair and the Minister would do well to turn his attention to them.  They were never intended to carry the tremendous amount of traffic they had to bear during the emergency on account of the extra amount of turf which was produced &mdash; and which, please God, I hope to see resumed in the near future.</P>
    <P>In some parts of the county I represent, demands have been made on Córas Iompair Éireann to provide buses where people are far removed from any other means of transport and have many miles to go to get a bus to take them to a market town, to Ennis, Limerick or Kilrush.  Invariably, the excuse made by Córas Iompair Éireann is that they could favourably consider the application only when the condition of the roads is brought up to the standard where it would be safe to run <Col N="570" /> the buses.  Unfortunately, roads in many parts of rural Ireland have deteriorated to such an extent that, in the opinion of the company, it would be unsafe for them to run their buses over those roads.  I am sure the Minister himself, from his local knowledge, is familiar with some of the areas to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>Other Deputies have mentioned coast erosion and I would like to make a passing reference to it.  Everyone knows that in Clare we have two or three towns which are seriously menaced by this problem &mdash; Kilkee, Lahinch, Quilty and Carrigaholt. Lahinch especially has been menaced by this erosion in the past.  I only draw the Minister's attention to it, as even though my predecessors may have made somewhat more lengthy reference to it, I wonder if the Minister has any particular responsibility for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOGrady" hpid="Mr. O'Grady Mr. O'Grady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not delay on it, as it is a baby no one wants and each one wishes to pass it over to a colleague, if he can.  It is a very big problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was rather tickled by Deputy Dunne's reference to the appointment of rate collectors and his desire to have that taken out of the hands of local authorities.  It is rather strange when it comes from that quarter.  I entirely agree with him, but it is strange to hear it from him and from the Party opposite who want a reversal of engines on that part of local administration.  It was undemocratic to take the appointments out of the hands of local authorities, we were told, so it comes like a bolt from the blue to hear it suggested that the last, and probably the only, appointment left to a local authority should be taken out of their hands.  I think it would be a relief to members of local authorities and that an overwhelming majority would feel relieved if there were some other method devised whereby rate collectors would be <Col N="571" /> appointed, without all the usual canvassing, and so on, that occurs.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to direct the Minister's attention to the very serious problem of rates at present, not merely in the urban areas but throughout the country generally.  In the constituency I represent, the rates have gone up to 25/4 in the £ this year.  That is a very serious impost on the ratepaying community and the higher the rates go, the more adverse will be the effect on employment, both in town and country. It is a matter to which all men should direct serious attention, because, in another county in which I live, the rates have doubled in the past three years.  At that rate of progress in an upward direction, we will very soon reach a point at which serious cognisance will have to be taken by all Parties of the position.  It will adversely affect the provision of employment, because, if their rates soar to the extent that they become a serious burden on the employer, he will have to take drastic steps in the matter of reducing the number of his employees.  The Minister, equally with his colleagues, will have to look into that aspect of the situation and switch over from a policy of diverting the costs of certain services on to the shoulders of the local authorities, as has been the tendency in the past.  I am not confining that to the immediate past, but back over the years the tendency has been for the central authority to divest itself of as many burdens as it can and to pass them over to the local authority.  I think that is bad for everybody and I feel that, in a great many of these matters, the Government representing the entire community should shoulder its own burdens and not try to divest itself of what I and many others believe to be its responsibilities.  There is a certain limit to the capacity of the ratepaying community to meet their obligations, and, once you force them beyond that limit, you are going to do them serious damage and their employees even greater damage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. A. Byrne Mr. A. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to make inquiry as to the working of the Small Dwellings Act in <Col N="572" /> the City of Dublin and especially as to the number of people who have been disappointed by reason of their failure to get grants to enable them to build their own homes.  Other Deputies have drawn attention to the fact that there is a very large number of young people anxious to get married who could save £100 but no more.  These young people, after putting down £100 as deposit on a house, must have another £100 or £200 for furniture and so on.  They are enterprising young people, tradesmen and workmen of all types, earning no more than £7 or £8 per week, and they are anxious to avoid having to apply continuously to the corporation to get their names on the housing list and are prepared to take their courage in their hands and to build their own homes.  I suggest to the Minister that if a young man is capable of or wants to put down £100 as deposit, it is a genuine earnest of his anxiety to provide himself with a house.  The fact that he gets ownership makes him rather important, and the fact that the house will be his own eventually induces him to take a special pride in it, with the result that he will put in screws, whereas in the ordinary way he would put in nails.  If we can get these young people to take an interest in their homes and enable them to feel that they own their houses, they will be very contented and useful citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the administration of the Small Dwellings Act in the corporation, there are unfortunately two words in the Act which are upsetting everybody, including members of the corporation. These are the words &ldquo;market value&rdquo;.  The person applying for a grant for the building of a house will get 90 per cent. of the market value of the house and the cost of the house is not taken into consideration at all. The house may be worth £2,000 and the position is that, under the valuation system, the person who values the house for the advance leaves most of these people £80 or £90 short.  Quite recently, a report from the administrators of the Small Dwellings Act in the corporation showed that they had applications from 500 people &mdash; these are rough figures &mdash; and the corporators were <Col N="573" /> very anxious to find out how many of the applications were granted.  We found that 300 out of 500 were granted, 100 being rejected and 100 withdrawn. I want to know why the 100 applications were rejected and what was the cause of the withdrawal of the other 100 applications.  That is a ratio of three to two and there is something wrong somewhere.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the Minister making these 500 applicants contented people, enjoying the right of ownership and accepting the responsibility of paying the full economic rent, in which will be included interest at a small rate&mdash;I think the rate is 3½ or 4 per cent. &mdash; on the grant, for a two-storey, red-brick house, with three bedrooms, front and back parlour, as they are called in Dublin, kitchenette, the usual bathroom and toilet accommodation and a small garden back and front.  That sort of house runs to about 36/- per week and any young man in Dublin with £7 or £8 per week who will accept the payment of 36/- to £2 a week for his house is going to be a very desirable citizen and a citizen of which any State can be proud.  No technicality and no cutting down in order to get too great a security should be allowed to stand in his way and the municipality and the Government are looking for too great security from the persons concerned when the valuer values a £2,000 house at £1,900 or £1,800.</P>
    <P>That is not what the Government intended when it passed the Small Dwellings Act and gave the corporation power to borrow money and to administer the scheme, and I suggest that the Minister should call a conference in his Department with officials of the corporation who administer the scheme and see if they cannot do something to enable these people to get going with their own homes.  Otherwise, we will have a continuation of the position in which 500 people apply for grants and 300 are successful.  The remaining 200 must come on the corporation list and wait, because we have 28,000 on our waiting list at the moment.  There are about 2,500 newlyweds who have received letters over the past five years.  I have seen a letter dated 1944 &mdash; I have it off by <Col N="574" /> heart&mdash;telling the person concerned that, when a decision is reached regarding the position of newlyweds, the corporation will notify him.  I saw the same letter addressed to the same person five years later.  Something must be done.  The people who were described as newlyweds were told a few years ago that something would be done for them.  They now have one, two or three children.  I do not know whether they will be classed as newlyweds now or not.</P>
    <P>The fact remains that the corporation tries to deal with people who have ten, 11 or 12 children.  I know it will not alarm any member of the corporation who is here, or the House, when I say that there are cases of a father, mother and 12 children living in one room.  We have more than six cases where there are a father, mother and ten children living in one room and some hundreds of cases where there are a father, mother and eight children living in one room.  The corporation must devote its energies to dealing with that class, with basement dwellers, tuberculosis cases, people living in condemned houses, people living in houses that have been taken over under the reconditioning scheme.  When these houses start to fall down, we must take them over.  We get a grant from the Government which, I agree, is useful, but it is not enough.  The Government will have to do more for the corporation and increase the grant. We have a waiting list of 28,000 and the city manager, lion-hearted as he is, is beginning to be broken-hearted. He is getting greyer in our service because he sees the hopelessness of the position.  Hopeless as it is, he is still fighting.  In the course of a few weeks he will have to raise very large sums of money.  I do not mean thousands. I mean millions.  Dublin City is accepting the responsibility for that in order to build houses for the increasing population of Dublin, which is now the headquarters of Ireland.  The Government will have to treat Dublin differently from any other place.  They must increase the grant and allow us to go ahead much more rapidly than we are doing at present.  There are 3,000 to 4,000 workmen engaged on our <Col N="575" /> housing scheme and everything possible is being done to speed up the allocation of houses.</P>
    <P>I suggested some time ago, and I did not mean to be hurtful to the Minister, that the housing position is so urgent that it should be declared a national emergency and that there should be a Ministry of Housing that would have nothing else to do but to look after housing.  There should be a Minister for Housing who would be in a position to spend every hour of the day discussing the problem and finding means of remedying it.  There are 28,000 on the waiting list and, at the rate we are going, some of them will not be housed for the next ten years.  That places a heavy burden on these people and we should do all in our power to remove it.</P>
    <P>I shall not delay the House, but I want again to emphasise the points that have been made by other Deputies and to draw the Minister's attention to the facts.  I know they will be put to him by officials of the corporation, if not by officers of the Department of Local Government. The question is raised, how can a man with £7 a week with a wife and one or two children accept responsibility for payment of 36/- a week spread over 40 years?  I put that case to the young man and woman concerned and their answer is: &ldquo;Why do they want to be our protectors to such an extent that they say we cannot pay 36/- when we are paying £2 10s. 0d. for the last two years for two rooms?&rdquo; The people I refer to are charged as much as £2 and £2 10s. 0d. a week for one or two rooms.  We should let them take on the responsibility of paying 36/- a week for corporation houses and not try to nurse them too much and set ourselves up as their protectors and say that we will not give a house to them, that they will not be able to pay the rent and live in comfort.  It is their look out.  They have to be helped by parents and relatives if they are not able to meet their obligations. The Government and the corporation will have done their share in giving them a chance and taking them out of the flat or the two rooms for which they pay £2 a week.  Some <Col N="576" /> of these rooms have barely place for a bed and a perambulator.  I would suggest to the Minister that he should extend the splendid scheme that was administered by his predecessor, the late Mr. Murphy.  I know he had all this in mind.  He told me so.  I discussed the matter with him and he was alarmed about the failure of the Small Dwellings Act and that we were not getting houses in sufficient numbers to rehouse the people who are living in the terrible conditions that have been described.</P>
    <P>I know that when I try to explain the position of these people who are living, eight, ten and 12 in one room, and try to describe the decayed condition of the houses and the plight of the people who have nowhere to go, the comment is: &ldquo;Do not believe that; that is a stunt.&rdquo;  It is not a stunt and I would ask the Minister to investigate the position.  There is another peculiar problem in Dublin City that even the corporation is not dealing with.  The city manager has made a wonderful job of reconditioning tenement houses, preserving the facades of the Georgian houses and converting them into three room flats but in the process a number of elderly people are being disturbed. The corporation is not providing single rooms for these elderly people.  If the Minister is discussing the problem with the city manager, he must have regard to these very old people with very small incomes who are being disturbed because of the corporation clearance scheme.  Where are these people to go?  Take the case of the poor woman who cleaned a shop and got 4/- or 5/-a week to supplement her pension or the watchman who may be allowed to earn 12/- in addition to his old age pension.  I suggest to the Minister that the municipality or somebody else will have to provide rooms for these very old people at rents which they can pay. It is not right or proper to tell these people to go around to the back lane. They say to councillors or aldermen: &ldquo;Do not send us there.  We were never used to that.&rdquo;  I do not know what can be done.  I will leave it to the Minister.</P>

      <P>Like other Deputies, I would like to draw the attention of the <Col N="577" /> Minister for Local Government to the great delay there is on the part of his Department in the payment of the housing grant.  There is grave dissatisfaction, especially in congested areas, at the very long delays &mdash; delays that should not occur at all.  I know places in my own constituency, in Donegal, of people who built houses 12 months ago and who have since taken possession of their new homes and, for no reason at all as far as we can see, the grant is held up and repeated demands are made without success.  If anything will hinder the housing drive, about which the Minister is so anxious and about which Deputies are equally enthusiastic, it is that people will get the idea that grants are unduly held up.  It would be a grave deterrent to the success of the housing grants scheme.  In the congested areas, as the Minister will realise, the building of a home is a very serious matter financially. These people with small means face the building of a home with grave fears.  One of the first question these applicants put to the local Deputies is: &ldquo;Is there any truth in the rumour that it is very difficult to get housing grants from the Department &mdash; that they are held up and not paid when they should be?&rdquo; It would be a great pity if the Minister could not ask his Department to speed up the payment of housing grants in all cases.  If anything will have a bad effect on the housing drive it will be the fact that such grants are being held up by his Department.  The Minister has appealed for a greater drive in housing and he will have the co-operation of all the people and certainly of all the Deputies on this side of the House.  However, I would ask him to point out in his Department the delays that certainly have occurred in the payment of these grants and to speed them up in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to bring the state of the bog roads in County Donegal to the attention of the Minister.  As he is aware, Donegal contributed very, very much to the production of turf during the emergency.  During that period our roads suffered as no roads in any other non-turf area suffered during the five or six years of war.  I would ask the Minister to consider making special <Col N="578" /> provision for these roads in order to bring them back to a decent state of repair.  As he is well aware, these roads were never made for the heavy traffic they had to bear during those years of emergency.  I would ask the Minister to consider the giving of special grants in order to get those bog roads back to some decent state of repair so that the people who are now bringing home their own turf can use them in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the present Government are very fortunate in having as their Minister at the moment a man who has had a life-long experience in the building trade.  Any man with that experience must be competent to look after the principal problem affecting the Department over which he now presides.  I want to say that the housing shortage in the industrial towns in my constituency has reached alarming proportions.  I would say that that applies particularly to industrial towns where there has been an increase in the population in recent years &mdash; towns such as Tullamore, Portarlington and Portlaoighise, where young people have come in from the rural areas to get the employment now provided for them in these towns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the case of Tullamore, where you have a very progressive local authority.  You have at the moment in that particular town an organisation of town-dwellers &mdash;&ldquo;house dwellers&rdquo; they call themselves &mdash; with a membership of 250.  That is a problem which has been created in recent years apart altogether from the ordinary slum problem of providing decent housing accommodation for people who have for many years been living in insanitary and unsafe houses.  In Portarlington, where you have a good deal of industrial activity, mainly brought about as a result of the activities in recent years of Bord na Móna, I am sure &mdash; and I would like the Minister to accept my assurance because I have received reliable information from people on the spot&mdash;that there is more than one family living in almost every house built by the local authority in that town in recent years &mdash; an average of two families living in every one of <Col N="579" /> these houses.  That exposes the extent to which the housing problem has to be faced in a town like that.</P>
    <P>Apart from these problems which are not peculiar to the towns in my constituency, I should like to impress on the Minister &mdash; and I am doing this as a result of several conversations which I have had in recent months with the representatives of members of local authorities &mdash; the necessity and the urgency there is for himself and his colleagues to sit down and decide as soon as they possibly can the financial structure of the national housing policy.  Local authorities should be in a position to know, when they are asked to consider the provision of an increased number of houses, the extent to which the State will in future, over a fixed period of years, provide reasonable financial facilities.  I know that local authorities in my area, although extremely anxious to go ahead &mdash; and they have expressed their willingness and taken decisions to go ahead &mdash; are still in doubt as to whether they will be able to get further financial assistance from the Central Fund. This question comes up immediately the local authority has completed a housing scheme when they are confronted, as they will all be in due course, with fixing the rents of the houses to be let to the new tenants. I shall give an illustration of the rent problem in some of the towns in my constituency.</P>
    <P>I shall quote the case of Portlaoighise as a typical one.  A certain number of houses were built in that town a few years before the first World War and let at the time at a rent of 1/3 per week.  These are lucky tenants. I will admit that there is no sewerage or water connection.  In addition to 1/3 rent, there is, of course, the increase in rates to be paid by the tenants of these local authorities.  In the same town, in the years 1932-33 a further housing scheme was completed, at an average cost of £266 per house. The rent of these houses was fixed and it still stands at the figure of 2/6, plus the local rates &mdash; at present the rate is 2/-, which represents an inclusive <Col N="580" /> figure of 4/6 per week.  In 1937-39, in the same town, a further scheme was completed at an average cost per house of £323.  The rent in that particular scheme was fixed at 4/-, with the rates at the time of 1/7, or an inclusive figure of 5/7.  In the case of that particular scheme the economic rent at the time would have amounted to 6/6.  In other words, if the tenants were charged the economic rent they would have to pay a weekly figure of 6/6 instead of 5/7.  The subsidy there from both rates and Central Fund represents 11d.  Another scheme was begun in the same town about 1943.  It shows that the local authority in this case have been making a decent attempt to do their job.  The scheme was completed at an average cost of £505 per house. The rents again in this case were fixed, as in the 1937-39 scheme, at 4/- per week, with rates 2/6 &mdash; in other words, 6/6 per week, inclusive.  There is a scheme in operation there at the moment costing no less than £1,550.  I think the Government will have to sit down and say to the local authorities whether they are right in going ahead with the scheme &mdash; where the cost of houses is going to amount to the alarming figure of £1,550 in a small town like that and where the economic rent, if it has to be paid, will be something in the region of 25/1.  The Minister knows better than I do &mdash; he has more experience of local authorities than I have &mdash; that the average wage-earner in a town like Portlaoighise cannot afford to pay not merely the economic rent, because he will not be asked to pay it, but the proposed rent of 14/8, plus 2/11 rates, which amounts to 17/7 per week, out of an average town rate of wages of £3 5s. per week.  These houses are proposed to be for the slum dwellers.  In a town like Portlaoighise or in any other such town in my constituency there is a great number of casual workers, and, in any event, even where they have continuous employment such as in the case of road workers, the average town wage does not exceed £3 5s. per week.</P>
    <P>I am assured by people who know more about this position than I do, and I think the Minister is one of them, that in pre-1939 days the prospective <Col N="581" /> tenant of a house built by a local authority was only called upon to pay on an average one-eighth of his average weekly income.  In the case in point he is asked to contribute, even where there is a subsidised rent, between one-third and one-fourth of his low weekly wage.  That position cannot continue. How is the subsidy arrived at in this particular case?  As I say, the cost of building this house is £1,550, which is absolutely excessive in my opinion, and should not be sanctioned.  I am advised that the council propose to charge a rent of 14/8, exclusive of rates, which is equivalent to roughly 17/6 inclusive.  A grant of £400 per house is being allocated from the Transition Fund and the local authority have agreed to pay £15 12s. per house per annum out of the rates.</P>
    <P>With that kind of example before me, I say it is certainly up to the Minister and his colleagues to sit down and consider carefully the question of what the future relationship of the economic rent is to be as between the State, the local authority and the prospective tenant. When you talk of the prospective tenant of a house built by a local authority in future, you should, as a Government, relate that to the capacity of the prospective tenant to pay a reasonable rent.  That state of affairs cannot continue much longer.  It is embarrassing to the most sympathetic member of a local authority.  That is why I think a decision in regard to the financial structure of our national housing policy should be come to and conveyed to the local authorities at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his statement, when dealing with the question of costs and the progress made by different local authorities based on his experience and the experience of his predecessor in this matter, as reported in the Official Report, Volume 116, column 484 of Thursday, 9th June, stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where contractors did not come forward to tender for housing schemes, or where their tenders proved too expensive, or where contract work was found unsatisfactory, local authorities were encouraged <Col N="582" /> to supplement the contract system by instituting direct labour schemes supervised by their own officers. Detailed instructions were issued as to the organisation and supervision of such schemes.  It was made clear that they were to be operated as a supplement to and in competition with comparable tenders for contracts.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I know perfectly well &mdash; nobody knows it better than the Minister &mdash; that if the Minister is to be judged by his success or failure in dealing with this terrible problem of housing, he will have to get the friendly co-operation of the members of local authorities, irrespective of their political complexion, and not alone the friendly co-operation of the members of local authorities, but the friendly and active co-operation of county managers and county engineering officers.  Whenever a direct labour scheme has been suggested in my constituency it has met with hidden if not open hostility from the officers of the local authority. That hostility will have to be beaten down by the Minister and his Departmental officials if direct labour is to be the alternative for the building of houses at reasonable cost in areas where contractors have been submitting tenders at excessive prices.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that it would be very helpful to him and to Deputies who are deeply anxious to assist him if a copy of the detailed instructions to which he referred in his opening statement were given to the members of local authorities by the county managers concerned.  I have been discussing this question with members of local authorities during the past nine or 12 months and I find there is a considerable amount of ignorance on the part of members of local authorities regarding the instructions, detailed or otherwise, which have been sent down to the county managers.  The county managers, apparently, regard these instructions as personal to themselves. In some cases I know that, under pressure, they come before the county council and, when asked, issue these.  But it would be helpful if copies of the instructions sent to county managers and engineers in connection <Col N="583" /> with the working of our national housing policy were supplied to every member of every local authority by the county manager concerned.  The members would then be able to bring a more intelligent point of view to bear on the discussion of these matters rather than have the experience of listening to the county manager or secretary of a county council reading a long document too quickly for them to be able to pick up every point in the document.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am encouraging the Minister to take the members of local authorities into his confidence by giving them every piece of information sent to county managers.  If the members of county councils in future, as I know they will in the very near future under the Minister's jurisdiction, are to be given back most of the powers which they possessed before this dictatorial system was brought into operation, they will be entitled to the information. The county manager, if he wants to co-operate with the Minister in solving the problem, will be only too pleased, especially if he gets instructions, to supply all this information to the members of the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have said that there is hidden, if not open hostility, to the adoption of a direct labour scheme wherever it is suggested, at any rate in certain portions of my constituency.  I will not detain the House unduly, but I can produce evidence to prove it.  In the year 1933-34, 19 houses were erected by direct labour in the town of Rath-downey at the total cost, including fencing, of £6,708, or £353 1s. 0d. per house.  The basic rent charged for the houses is 3/6 and the rates amount to 1/2; in other words, an inclusive rent of 4/8 per week for what, in my opinion, were extremely well built houses under a system of direct labour.  A scheme submitted for approval and sanctioned by the Minister's predecessor came up for consideration at the Leix County Council on the 11th April.  It was then and there unanimously decided to carry <Col N="584" /> out a direct labour scheme in the same town for the erection of 30 houses on a very suitable site in the opinion of the local councillors.</P>
    <P>I understand that information as to that decision did not reach the Minister's Department for some time after the 11th April.  At any rate, that was a decision taken on the 11th April.  But when members of the council came to the May meeting and inquired whether the architect's plans, as promised, were ready in connection with that and other schemes in the same county, they were confronted with the suggestion, after a good deal of lobbying had been carried on amongst members, that it would be a dangerous thing to proceed with the erection of houses by direct labour as had been previously unanimously decided on, and the county manager put up the county engineer to submit a report for the purpose of frightening them and getting them to reverse the decision taken at the April meeting.  Here is an extract from the county engineer's report.  It is not a very lengthy one:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The county engineer, in a report on his investigations into schemes in three other counties&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;he did not name the counties&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;for the erection of cottages by direct labour, gave details of officers employed, viz:&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;I do not know that some of these officers are necessary in the case of a small scheme&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Housing engineer,&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;you require a housing engineer for the purpose of carrying out a direct labour scheme, with a &mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Clerk of works, foreman, costing clerk and tradesmen.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>But whether a housing engineer and a costing clerk are necessary to be employed in connection with the carrying out of a small scheme of that kind. I have very grave doubts.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As to plant materials, etc., he stated that equipment would cost £2,000; materials on the site before commencing work on a group of ten houses&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="585" />&mdash;ten houses, if you please&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;would involve capital expenditure of £4,500.  He gave the approximate cost of cottages (including fencing) in the three counties as follows:&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He does not give the name of the counties.  I am assured by the present and active members of the county council that he did not give the names of the counties to the county council when reading out his report.  He says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Authority A, £916 per house; authority B, £950; further houses&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;I do not know what that means&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;£925.  Authority C, £850.  None of the schemes, he said, had water or sewerage services.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have no prejudice against the individual concerned in that case or anybody associated with it.  I say that report has been deliberately concocted and submitted to the county council for the purpose of driving the members of the county council into what might be involved in carrying out the scheme by direct labour and getting them to refuse the other unanimous decision at the previous meeting.  I think it will be agreed by the Minister and everybody concerned that it merely carries out a policy of delaying action during a period which is the best part of the whole year for the carrying out of building jobs.  If there is deliberate hostility on the part of the county manager and county engineer concerned, and if they have a good case to make to the Minister against the unanimous decision of the county council, let them come forward and put their cards on the table.  Let us see their cards and examine the whole business on its merits.</P>

      <P>Deputy Brennan may know more about the building business than I do, and I am sure he does, but I would ask Deputy Brennan as a public representative to realise that it is in the public interest to get houses built by direct labour and to go into the areas wherever excessive prices are being submitted by building contractors. That is what we are going to smash &mdash; the whole racket of high building prices by organised building contractors.</P>
      <P>Deputy Brennan challenged me some time ago, and I accepted it, regarding the figures I quoted in the House on a previous occasion in a discussion of this kind.  I am now giving figures which cannot be, refuted and I challenge Deputy Brennan to question the accuracy of the figures I have given in the report of the County of Laoighis. I invite him to get the town clerk to admit that it was not a fact that a tender had been submitted for the building of houses in Birr &mdash; well known by the Minister &mdash; at the extraordinarily high figure of £1,760, whereas houses of the same type were built in pre-war days for £289.  Something must be done to stop that kind of activity which, in effect, means robbing the community.  The building of houses at such a figure cannot be justified by the most competent building contractors. Will any building contractor or expert who may be a member of this House stand up and say that he can justify prices for the erection of houses 500 per cent. over pre-war?  If he can I should like to know the basis on which it can be justified.</P>
      <P>The average increase in wages paid to the building-trade worker, whether skilled or unskilled, does not exceed 100 per cent. over pre-war.  Deputy Brennan knows better than I do that the average cost of building materials &mdash;I am quoting this figure from people who are experts and longer at the job than Deputy Brennan&mdash;over pre-war does not exceed 300 per cent.  Why should the local authority accept a tender for the building of the same class of houses now at 500 per cent. over what it was in pre-war days?</P>

When we carry out a scheme by direct labour we are leaving the town where the houses are built all the money that goes into circulation in connection with the building scheme.  I think that is <Col N="588" /> preferable to having a contractor from somewhere else take away a few thousand pounds' profit in his pocket at the expense of the local ratepayers and the taxpayers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely suggest that the direct labour scheme should be experimented with in every town throughout the country for the contractors' prices are regarded by the experts of the Department as excessive.  That is the way to smash the building ring.  Deputy Brennan will not agree with me on that.  I would invite the Minister in his reply to give us the benefit of his own knowledge or the knowledge of the experts in his Department &mdash; and they are experts &mdash; on this matter.  Fortunately for the country, over a long period of years irrespective of what Government was in office or what Minister was in charge of the Department this House has the satisfaction of knowing that the heads of the Department, one after the other, have proved to be experts and sympathetic towards the whole national housing policy of the Government of the day.</P>
      <P>I should like to hear from the Minister when he is replying &mdash; I believe he can give some figures &mdash; what the results have been of carrying out the building of houses by direct labour, and especially in those areas where these schemes have been completed. Deputy Brennan and some other people like him, appear to have some doubts on this matter, but I think that when the facts and figures are made available they should be sufficient to convince them that the building of houses by direct labour can serve a useful public purpose, and that it can stop a lot of the robbery that was going on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want any figures.  If I did not know the costs in regard to house building myself then I would be a fool to be in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another suggestion that I have to make in connection <Col N="589" /> with the housing policy of the Government.  I think that where there is a job for clearing a site previous to a local authority advertising for tenders for the erection of houses on the site, the clearing of the site should be carried out by the local authority itself under a system of direct labour.  There is the case of a building scheme now under way in a town in my constituency.  I have been informed that the cost of developing, or clearing the site amounted to the high figure of £9,000.  The site did not appear to me to look very much and I could not understand how it should take £9,000 to clear it.  The cost of doing so baffled me and baffled the members of the local authority. The job of the building contractor should be to build the houses.  In my opinion, the site should be cleared before the contractor moves in.  If the building contractor gets the job of clearing a site, and does so at a high figure, that is going to provide him with additional profit on the scheme.  I repeat that the clearing of sites for building schemes ought to be done locally under a direct labour system.  The cost, I believe, would be less than it is under the present system.  When the site has been prepared for him the building contractor can then move in.  I hope that suggestion will be carefully considered by the Minister and by his advisers in the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with those Deputies who have been warning the Minister in a friendly way about the rapid rise in the rates in recent times.  Some ceiling will have to be put on the amount of rates that is to be levied through the country. That can be done if the Minister and his colleagues in the Government will make up their minds not to be passing on too much responsibility for the carrying out of schemes of national reconstruction and development to the local authorities, but that the cost of such schemes will be borne wholly out of the Central Fund.  I know of a number of disputes that are going on between local authorities in my area and the Minister for Health, the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Finance in connection with <Col N="590" /> the cost of reconstructing county and district hospitals and of providing additional accommodation for tuberculosis cases.  Every Deputy knows that there ought to be plenty of money available out of the Sweepstakes Fund to meet the full cost of that work, and that the ratepayers, in these days when the rates are rising so rapidly, should not be asked to bear any further portion of the cost of building or reconstructing institutions such as I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>Previous to 1932 and to the economic war, a man's land annuity was about double the amount of his rates. To-day the position is reversed, and his rates are double the amount of his annuity.  Therefore, I suggest that some ceiling must be placed on the amount which the rate-paying community will have to contribute in the future.  I say that because there appears to be a wrong impression in the minds of quite a big number of people as to who pays the most in rates in this country.  Listening to the loud-speakers at local elections or at a general election, one would imagine that, in consequence of this rapid increase in the rates, the people who suffered most were the traders in the towns.  Nothing of course, could be more ridiculous than to think that. Everybody must realise that if there is an increase in the local rates a trader in an area, unless he is a lunatic, will pass on the increase to his customers on everything he sells to them over the counter.  I agree, of course, that while the local trader is not the biggest ratepayer, he is really the biggest unpaid rate collector; but as I say, he is in the happy position that, when the local rates are increased, he can pass on the increase to his customers in the commodities that he sells to them.</P>
    <P>As regards the farmer, he gets a certain amount of relief in the rates he pays out of the agricultural grant. The man, however, who is hit the hardest by reason of this rapid rise in the rates that has occurred in recent years is the town-dweller, the wage-earner, the person with a fixed salary or income and the person living in a house built by the local authority. Therefore, I suggest that it is the <Col N="591" /> poorest section of the community who are called upon to bear this heavily-increased burden.  Some ceiling will have to be imposed.</P>
    <P>The Government will have to consider carefully the adoption of a policy which will mean that the Central Fund will have to take a greater responsibility in the future than it is bearing at present for the cost of schemes of national development and reconstruction.  The Minister for Agriculture went over to Britain last year and made an agreement which most people at the time considered to be a reasonably good one in connection with the prices to be paid by the people at the other side for our live stock and agricultural produce.  The rates in the meantime have gone up in some Midland areas.  In one county in my constituency they went up last year by 4/1 in the £.  Even though the agreement I have mentioned might be considered by the farmer to be a good one &mdash; it meant a better price for live stock and for agricultural produce &mdash; yet the farmer this year will find himself in a worse position than he was in last year by reason of the fact that one of his overhead expenses has been increased by 4/1 in the £.  If that kind of thing goes on for another year the farmer may come to the conclusion that even though that agreement might be regarded as a profitable and valuable one a year ago, it will eventually be of small benefit to him if there is not some ceiling put on this increase in local rates.</P>
    <P>These are some points, I think, that deserve the notice of the new Minister for Local Government.  I am sure they will receive consideration from him and from the efficient officers that he has in his Department.  I hope that if I have erred in any way in my presentation of the cost of building houses my colleagues and Deputy Brennan, who is an expert in the business, will correct me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCann</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the Minister acted rightly in allocating the major portion of his introductory speech to the question of housing. Judging by the Minister's speech and <Col N="592" /> by the speeches that we have heard from all sides of the House in the course of the debate, it would appear that housing is a question of paramount importance on this Estimate. I want to tell the Minister that, so far as the members on this side of the House who are members of the Dublin Corporation are concerned, he will have our wholehearted co-operation in any effort he makes to expedite the housing of the working classes in this city.  I congratulate him, in a personal way, on his elevation to a Ministry, though I am sorry he is, politically, in such bad company. However, in the course of his introductory remarks on the Estimate he made certain statements to which I, as a member on the Dublin Corporation, must take exception.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCann</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of the housing committee of the Dublin Corporation going back as far as 1933, and the meetings of which I have attended regularly.  Deputy Dunne said to-day he was sorry that political football could be made out of this housing situation.  I want to put this question fairly and squarely to everybody. Prior to the passing of the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act of 1932, was there any building in the City of Dublin by the Dublin Corporation worth talking about?  The figures actually show that, prior to 1922, the corporation rented some 3,750 houses; between 1922 and 1932, 5,097 houses were rented. From the passing of the Act in 1932 until 1947, 16,000 additional houses were built, and those houses were built by reason of the substantial financial subsidies which were afforded by the Fianna Fáil Government and by the work of the housing committee of the Dublin Corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to get this position quite clear.  Scarcely a year ago there was a committee called the Consultative Housing Committee set up in this city under the direction of a new housing director.  I have no quarrel with consultative committee as such, but I <Col N="593" /> want to make this point for the Dublin Corporation Housing Committee, every member of it who was working day in and day out as long as I was there, and also the members who were there a great many years before I entered the corporation in 1933.  They are the people to whom the credit belongs for the rate of progress of housing in the City of Dublin.  They are the people who worked earnestly for the housing of the working classes in this city.</P>
    <P>You do not bring a new housing policy into operation with a flourish of trumpets and a number of speeches and the appointment of a so-called consultative council that did nothing, so far as I am aware, in the past year, except go over to England and have a look at prefabricated houses and then come back and tell us that we should buy 500 of them.</P>

      <P>In one year during the war 800 houses were handed over by the corporation, and the Minister informed me quite recently that in 1948 144 houses were contracted for.  That means that only 144 houses have been handed over to the Dublin Corporation which had not been in the process of construction prior to this Government coming into office.  The housing committee <Col N="594" /> of the Dublin Corporation never pursued a policy of <i>laissez faire</i>, as was stated over there and elsewhere when this consultative council was superimposed on the housing committee.  To that committee is due the credit of working year in and year out and to the memory of the late James Larkin there is due inestimable credit.  I have here the last report which the late James Larkin signed as chairman of the housing committee.  In that report 7,502 houses were either in the process of erection or sites had been acquired and developed.  Actually, 1,500 were in process of erection in 1946 and 5,700 sites were being developed.  Everything was ready for these people; all they had to do was to come in and go ahead.  Yet we are told we were the people who were making a political football out of housing.</P>
      <P>I do not care who gets the credit if the houses are built and I am prepared to give credit where credit is due.  But we were subjected to criticism.  We were told we were lying down on housing, that we were responsible for the hovels in the city and did not do anything to house the people.  The fact is that 16,000 houses were erected over a short period of years.  We were accused prior to the last election of not doing our job.  We were accused of not carrying out housing work during the war, when there was not a standard of timber being imported, when the materials necessary to build were not there.  Again I will quote the late James Larkin.  He said at a public inquiry in the City Hall that there was no city he knew of in Europe or elsewhere that in war-time conditions had erected 800 houses in one year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dublin Corporation built those houses, helped by substantial Fianna Fáil Government subsidies.  We were the people who did that job and it is the fruits of our work that can be seen to-day.  The job that is being done and that will continue to be done is not being done by any consultative council but by the housing committee of the Dublin Corporation.  I do not want to say anything against the present housing director; he is a very competent officer, but I think the city manager, Dr. Hernon, never got <Col N="595" /> the credit due to him, and the late Mr. Sherwin and the late Mr. Sims and the officers associated with them in the Dublin Corporation never got the credit to which they were justly entitled. We were told that we were pursuing a <i>laissez faire</i> policy, we, the people who helped to build 16,000 houses in six or seven years.</P>
    <P>Another matter the Minister referred to was this, that we did not build ordinary houses before this Government took over office, but we built a lot of luxury houses.  We were told that in our time there was a lot of luxury building.  On the 20th February, 1948, there was a conference at the City Hall in Dublin in the council chamber. There were representatives present from all branches of the building trade. Building providers were also there, as were certain members of the Dublin Corporation, those who took a constant interest in housing work in the city.  At that conference Mr. Leo Crawford, representing the building unions, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There has been no refusal of licences to build working-class houses throughout the country.  There is considerable agitation in regard to luxury building.  Licences have been issued, based on the supply position, to meet the requirements of the locality, and no licence has been refused to a local authority to build working class houses.  I think it well to dissipate any idea that luxury building is militating against working-class houses.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Later on, Mr. Gamble, representing Dublin Clay Goods Merchants' Association, referred to the same matter and he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Yes, and the Department of Industry and Commerce went to any amount of trouble to get the labour and the materials wanted, and I would endorse what Mr. Crawford has said, that the policy there has been to encourage the housing of the working classes to every extent. Luxury building that is so much talked of is very, very small; indeed, if you actually analyse the figures you will probably find that it bears a very small percentage to the total work.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="596" /> Mr. Crawford: Two per cent.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I hope that that dissipates effectively the suggestion that there was a considerable amount of luxury building&mdash; cinemas and dance halls.  No local authority was refused a licence to build.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCann</NameTxt>
      <P>There were some shell erections, if the Deputy knows what they are but houses could not be built, as we could not get the necessary building materials.  There were no slates, baths, or the various things that go to build a house.  The first bottleneck was materials and when materials became available the second bottleneck was labour.  That is why houses were not built.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCann</NameTxt>
      <P>We are greatly restricted in the corporation now in the matter of allocating houses.  There are two classes of subsidies, one a two-thirds subsidy with reference to slum clearance and a one-third subsidy for other types.  The point is that a person <Col N="597" /> must be actually resident in a single room in an unfit tenement, he must be living in that single room under overcrowded conditions &mdash; his family must be living in that single room &mdash; before he can get a house.  There are other people who are living under similar conditions, but they are not in unfit tenements.  The corporation could, if they so desired, take people from those better class areas and house them, but they lose the difference between the two-thirds and the one-third subsidy. I should like the Minister to go into that aspect and see if he can meet us. I think there is a fair case to be made. Perhaps he could meet us with full subsidies, where we re-house because of over-crowding.</P>
      <P>I had a case recently in a flat scheme which we took over &mdash; a converted military barracks.  There were 11 people living in two rooms and because they were living in that particular flat, for which the corporation had got a subsidy originally, the housing committee felt that they could not house that family in the ordinary way &mdash; could not give them a new house.  That family would have to wait until a house on which a subsidy had been paid previously became vacant.  That is a condition I would like the Minister to investigate and I would like him to see if he can meet us on the question of a full subsidy for all classes of houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a point concerning newly-weds. Some time ago I asked the late Minister for Local Government if he would define newly-weds.  I was not in the least way facetious.  I wanted to know what was a newly-wed&mdash;if the corporation or any other local authority decided to house newly-weds, we wanted to know what was a newlywed. I raised the question with the corporation.  I thought the people who formed the newly-weds' association in 1946 or 1947 were the people who started the agitation for houses for newly-weds.  I was told that organisation was started in 1944 and that they certainly qualified.  The Minister will have to be very explicit when he is issuing regulations governing the housing of newly-weds.  He will have to state exactly who they are and how the houses are to be allocated.  For the <Col N="598" /> life of me, I cannot see how the houses are going to be allocated with the present small output.  I would ask the housing committee to be quite frank with the people.  I do not see how we can allocate any big percentage of houses with the small number of houses we are getting from the contractor at the present moment. We should not fool ourselves as to the position.  The more houses that are built the better it will be.  We all hope for an improvement.  But do not let us fool the people or fool ourselves into believing there will be 1,500 or 2,000 houses built in Dublin next year when we know that that will not happen.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davin spoke about the cost. With my knowledge of costings, I think the builders are giving us the houses at fairly keen prices.  The corporation has not actually decided yet to import prefabs, but there is some question of 500 which may be imported.  Four years ago Dr. Hernon, the city manager, thought of importing prefabricated houses.  Skilled labour refused to handle them.  We may be faced with that difficulty.  The Minister will have to be very explicit about this before any local authority can decide to use these houses.  They cost £1,800 when completed.  They are £1,300 ex-factory. That is a very high figure.  It is nearly £850 over and above the ordinary corporation house.  Before we import, the Minister will have to allow the difference between the normal housing cost and the cost of the prefabricated house.  Otherwise, we would not be able to erect and allocate these houses in the ordinary way.</P>
    <P>There is another matter in connection with housing to which I would like to draw the Minister's attention.  There are clerks earning £6, £7 or £8 a week who are forced to take houses under the Small Dwellings Act.  A number of those clerks are putting millstones round their necks in my opinion.  Those millstones will eventually drag them down because they will never be able to shake them off.  The Minister, therefore, will have to consider a second approach to this problem of housing in the light of those people who are not living in overcrowded tenements but are, nevertheless, living <Col N="599" /> under great difficulties.  Apart from the £275 grant, there will have to be some other approach made to the problem. Something will have to be done to give the ordinary clerical worker a chance to buy a house without having to put down a deposit.  As Deputy Dunne said, many of these people are going to the utility societies and putting down a certain sum of money towards the purchase of a £2,000 house. When that house is completed, will the local authority value that house at £2,000?  If the local authority does not value it at that figure, then the unfortunate occupier may have to find another £200, £300 or £400 and there is the added possibility that the original investment will not be recoverable. I do not know if that will be the position.  I do not say that it will be the position.  But there will have to be a separate approach as far as that class is concerned.  Nobody is doing anything for the so-called white-collar brigade, apart from the subsidy of £275.</P>
    <P>There is one other small matter which I should like to mention.  I should like to see correspondence going from local authorities to the Department dealt with more expeditiously. On the 5th April, 1948 &mdash; that is more than a year ago&mdash;I moved a resolution, which was passed unanimously or almost unanimously, at the Dublin Corporation asking that a free legal aid bureau should be set up by the Dublin Corporation.  We agreed to that with reservations &mdash; I see Deputy O'Higgins looking at me &mdash; and we sent it to the Department of Local Government for observations.  The information supplied to me last week when I inquired at the City Hall was that, beyond the mere acknowledgement of the resolution, no reply has been received to it.  There was a more important matter than that &mdash; I shall give the Minister the details if he wishes to have them &mdash; to which we never got a reply.  It affected certain higher officers of our staff and the finance committee never got a reply to that.</P>
    <P>There is another question which I raised with the Minister recently.  When I raised the question I mentioned the name of an officer of the vocational education committee who died before <Col N="600" /> his superannuation actually came through.  He lived only 11 months after his retirement.  That man never had the benefit of superannuation due to this business of dilly-dallying between Departments.  I think it could be arranged that from the date a man ceases employment his superannuation allowance could be paid the following month or the following fortnight, if he was paid by the fortnight, so that there should be no interruption at all. I know there are certain cases where the question of added years or matters of that kind may arise but the amount of the basic pension could be paid to him without prejudice to what might happen afterwards.  I think the big lag of 11 months in the case I have mentioned was quite unreasonable. The man in this case had died before the pension actually came through.  I would ask the Minister to look into these matters to see if anything could be done to expedite the procedure.</P>
    <P>One other matter in connection with housing that I omitted to mention is the question of direct labour.  We hope that in Dublin the direct labour scheme will be a success.  Any scheme that will help to reduce the cost of housing would be welcome but I want to warn the Minister not to expect too much from it because I never saw &mdash; and I do not think anybody else ever did &mdash; the final figures of the previous direct labour scheme upon which the Dublin Corporation embarked.  Apart from that there is the point about direct labour that at the moment there is only one labour pool to draw from.  Tradesmen are in short supply; you just cannot get them.  There is only one labour pool to draw from and what is the use of talking about direct labour or any other scheme expediting the housing progress if you have only a limited labour pool to draw from?  There is only one way to augment that pool and that is to bring men from England or elsewhere &mdash; and I am informed that there are not so many in England as is commonly supposed &mdash; and to give them some inducement by bonus or otherwise, to get them working on these schemes.</P>
    <P>There is one question which touches me very sorely in connection with housing.  I have opposed consistently <Col N="601" /> this scheme at the housing committee of reconditioning Georgian houses.  It was all right during the war when we were reconditioning houses with secondhand material and when we could not get new material.  For the life of me, I cannot see why this scheme should be continued, if it is not to preserve Georgian houses as such. To me Georgian houses were never very beautiful.  Any quality of beauty which they possessed was not in the exterior of these houses; Georgian beauty was in the interior and not in the exterior.  The point I wish to make at the moment is that this job of reconditioning is dragging on and on.  It may amaze Deputies, who do not know the city proper, to hear that in Upper Sean MacDermott Street there is a reconditioning scheme which started in December, 1944, and up to recently the Dublin Corporation were still reconditioning Georgian houses.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of this matter.  The houses selected for reconditioning were not always houses in the worst condition and when you took them over for reconditioning, you removed families out of them whom you were compelled to house elsewhere. Sometimes you got a couple in a family, sometimes three, four or five, and when these families were taken out of these houses, they had to be put into new houses with the result that the unfortunate man with six, seven, eight or nine children awaiting a house was put further down the queue.  I honestly, in the words of Deputy Dillon, often described this scheme as &ldquo;daft&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter in connection with town planning to which I should like to refer.  Quite recently, last year, we decided that we would go ahead with the extension of Tara Street Baths.  I may observe that there are motions on the Order Paper calling for the provision of swimming facilities by members of the Government Party. We decided that we would go ahead and extend Tara Street Baths.  In the meantime, a private firm came in.  This private firm had got a previous concession in this connection and had lodged plans for the reconstruction of certain premises which we wanted to clear for the extension of our baths. They lodged plans with the city manager <Col N="602" /> and the town planning authority. The city manager turned down these plans and the town planning committee, of which I am a member, said we needed that property for the extension of Tara Street Baths.  Now I think that the city manager and the members of the city council or the town planning authority are competent to know what Dublin needs.  After all, it is ridiculous to have us functioning at all if we are not allowed to decide a simple question like that.  This private firm, within its rights under the Act, appealed to the Minister for Local Government and the Minister upheld their appeal, so that Tara Street Baths remain as they are.  Now I would ask the new Minister, who talks so often about the repeal of the County Management Act, not to be a dictator in his new office.  Only last night at the Dublin Corporation the new Minister was referred to by a Labour member as the new dictator, in what was a very simple matter.</P>

      <P>Deputy Alderman McCann started to deal with what I think is undoubtedly the most important question within the bailiwick of the Minister for Local Government, as far at any rate as public representatives from Dublin are concerned, that is, the question of housing. Deputy Alderman McCann complained that another Deputy had suggested that this question was being used as a political football.  Deputy McCann seemed to resent that very strongly while at the same time he took the biggest kick at the political football that was taken in this House at any rate.  I want to join with Deputy Alderman McCann by saying&mdash;and I think it is right on behalf of the housing committee of Dublin Corporation whether its members be Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour or Independent to say it&mdash;that certainly since I went into Dublin Corporation about four years ago the question of housing has never within the city councils been allowed to be a question of politics. <Col N="604" /> I would very much regret if councillors who are also Deputies and who are able to adopt a calm reasoned approach to the housing problem in the councils of Dublin Corporation should lose that type of approach when they come into this House.  I am afraid that there does seem to be a temptation to do that and that Deputy McCann succumbed to that temptation.  The Minister in his opening statement paid, to my mind, a very handsome tribute to the housing committee of Dublin Corporation and to the Dublin Consultative Council.  I do not think there was any basis at all for the waspish type of attack which Deputy McCann made on the Minister when he said that the credit was not primarily the credit of the Minister but that the credit was due to Dublin Corporation.  The Minister said all that himself.  In column 485 on the 9th June the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I am sure everybody will agree that great credit is due to the Dublin Corporation and its housing staff and to the Dublin Housing Consultative Council for the success which is attending their efforts and that we may confidently look forward to the expansion of housing output in the city at a steadily increasing rate.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not see what members of the Fianna Fáil Party find in that statement to be alarmed about.  I think it is agreed that one of the biggest tasks which faces Dublin Corporation is this question of housing.  I do not claim to be an authority on that subject at all. There are other members of this House who are members both of Dublin Corporation and of the consultative council and they would be able to speak with very much greater authority than I can on the subject, but I would like to impress on the Minister, if he requires to have it further impressed on him, that there is no doubt at all, as far as the ordinary person in Dublin is concerned, that the housing problem is a problem of the very first magnitude.  I find, as one individual, that out of every hundred cases with which I deal as a public representative fully 70 are in connection with the housing problem, mainly applicants for housing accommodation <Col N="605" /> from the corporation.  I think I would be safe in saying that every other Dublin Deputy finds that his work is divided in much the same proportion as that.  The figures given by the Minister do show an improvement and I think if that improvement is maintained in Dublin we will not fall very far short of the target set by the late Minister.  It is encouraging too to note that there has been an increase in the number of employees working on housing schemes.  I cannot understand Deputy McCann's objection to prefabricated houses.  In my opinion the present housing problem will only be overcome&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether it requires an assurance from the Minister or not, I want to stick to the point which is, as far as I can see, that the problem will not be overcome without going in in a fairly big way for prefabricated houses of one type or another. As every Deputy is aware, there are different types of prefabricated houses.  Deputy McCann spoke of houses of aluminium construction. There is also the concrete slab type of construction.  I understand that arrangements have been made for some of the concrete slab type to be erected in the city.  I hope that that is so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister <Col N="606" /> about subsidy houses.  It has been my experience that if there is the slightest error in floor space the person erecting the house is unable to get the subsidy, and I would like the Minister to look into that question with a view to allowing some margin of error.  It is not always possible for builders or their architects to get the exact measurements required to obtain the subsidy, and I suggest that a reasonable margin of error should be allowed.</P>
    <P>I know there are different ways of getting around an error if it has been made and that even the Department officials are in sympathy with builders when an error is made, but as the regulations stand at present they feel they cannot do anything about it.  It is very unfortunate if a bona fide error is made in the erection of a house, if the floor space is ten or 15 cubic feet more than should be and the builders are deprived of any benefit at all by way of subsidy.  I may be going slightly outside the rules of order when I say this, but I have said most of what I have to say&mdash;even if it takes an amendment to the present legislation to effect that relief which I have in mind, I think the Minister should consider the matter.</P>
    <P>With reference to the question of a new housing policy such as Deputy McCann appealed for, I have had this in my mind for some time and I would like to bring it to the attention of the Minister and of the members of the housing consultative council who are here.  In Dublin, we might very well be advised to go in for a policy of building upwards rather than outwards. If we went in, not necessarily for anything in the nature of skyscrapers, but for a policy of putting two or three more storeys on to the present blocks of flats, or in the erection of new flats, it might prove very much more popular than extending the housing drive out towards the city boundary again.  I think there is no doubt that the ordinary working man in Dublin, who earns his living in the centre of the city, would very much prefer to have his accommodation near his work rather than have to pay bus fares in the morning and evening when living out towards the city boundaries. <Col N="607" /> At any rate, I would like to make that suggestion to the Minister and, if the consultative council or the housing director have not already considered it, it might be worth seeing what could be done about it.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCann spoke about the necessity for more swimming baths in Dublin.  No one will argue with him about that necessity.  Ever since I began taking any interest in local affairs, I have heard some kind of plan mooted for the erection of swimming baths in Rathmines.  Over the last ten or 15 years, that has been brought forward every now and again and then, apparently, pushed into the background again.  All the suburban areas, as well as the centre of the city, require modern swimming baths.  Possibly Clontarf and Howth do not feel the necessity as much on account of the natural amenities of the sea front, but as you travel towards the centre of the city and go south into Rathmines and north toward Chapelizod, those places should have baths and in modern conditions it is a matter of necessity.</P>
    <P>On the question of traffic congestion in Dublin, I would like the Minister to put the traffic arrangements in final form during the coming year.  Every year various suggestions are made on that and on the general question of road safety.  During the time that Deputy Childers was Parliamentary Secretary, he carried on a very energetic and vigorous publicity campaign in the interests of road safety.  I would like to see the present Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government keeping up that campaign and extending it, if necessary.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, opening the Estimate for his Department, gave figures in relation to road accidents and while the figures, I think, showed some improvement on the previous year, certainly they are not figures about which people can be complacent.  I would like the Minister to consider, in conjunction with the Dublin City Council, the question of subterranean or overhead pedestrian crossings for some of the main thoroughfares in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I would also like to make one complaint to the Minister about traffic.  I <Col N="608" /> am not quite certain whether the Minister or the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána is responsible &mdash; I rather think it is between them.  I complain about the siting of bus and tram stops on the road from Merrion Square towards Ballsbridge and Black-rock. I do not know who conceived the idea of putting them about 50 yards short of the traffic lights.  I think they should not be anywhere within 100 yards of the traffic lights, so far as the tram stop on the inner side of the lights is concerned.  The only effect of having the stops as they are at the moment is that the tram holds up the traffic while the light changes two or three times and this is most aggravating for motorists who are held up behind the tram.  I understand there may be a natural alteration in that, if the trams go off the route, but they are there at the moment and it would still apply to some extent even to buses. The siting of these particular stops is atrocious, from the traffic point of view.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister also to take up with the Commissioner the question of the erection of major road signs in the city.  I know of only one place in the city where there is a major road sign.  As the Minister probably is aware, the traffic regulations made by the Commissioner of the Garda hinge to some extent on the erection of major road signs and special regulations are made concerning the inflow of traffic to major roads and as to how drivers of vehicles should conduct themselves. At the moment, the major road signs just do not exist.</P>
    <P>It was only with considerable difficulty that I managed to say anything about the managerial system last year and I am afraid I would not have the nerve to try this year, except to suggest to the Minister that the sooner he introduces his plans for the alteration of the system the better.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardButler" hpid="Mr. Butler Mr. Butler">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>The housing problem is such a vital one in Dublin, where the needs of our poor people are so great, that I think it little short of criminal to make it any sort of Party or political question at all.  It is quite true, as Deputy O'Higgins has said, that, so far as the Dublin Corporation is concerned, there is the fullest, the <Col N="609" /> friendhest and the most complete collaboration between all Parties on this question, but it does unfortunately crop up as a political question on platforms, especially during election times, and it was disappointing to hear such statements made here to-day as the statement that Fianna Fáil did nothing for housing in the seven years before they went out of office.  Deputy McCann gave a synopsis of the real state of affairs when he quoted Mr. Leo Crawford's words and also the opinion of the building trade, when the matter came under review under the chairmanship of the late Mr. James Larkin. You got a true picture of the situation which speaks for itself and of which no elaboration should be necessary.</P>
      <P>I have the honour to represent the South Dublin Constituency and Deputy O'Higgins is a fellow representative. He knows as well as I know that tens of thousands of our constituents were housed by the late Government within a very short period of time since 1932. In 1932 and 1933, the Kimmage, Crumlin and Drimnagh areas and out beyond Inchicore were open country. Now these areas are covered with magnificent building schemes carried out by us.  Nobody is better aware of that than Deputy O'Higgins.  There was really no Crumlin there a few years ago&mdash;it is a built-up area&mdash;and no Drimnagh or Kimmage.  Then, on the other side, there are the magnificent schemes at Cabra and Marino, and right over the whole corporation area evidence of tremendous work exists before the eyes of everyone and it is therefore very foolish to make such a statement as the statement that nothing was done by us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy agree that that was the work of the corporation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardButler" hpid="Mr. Butler Mr. Butler">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, with the help of Government subsidies.  I am merely pointing out that the type of criticism which we have heard has been very unfair and that all the talk we had about luxury buildings was practically unfounded.  It is extraordinary to hear a four-bedroomed house described as a luxury building.  My own view is that, in the case of the mixed family, the family of boys and girls, all <Col N="610" /> requiring separate bedroom accommodation, the four-bedroom house should, if possible, be the minimum for the ordinary normal family.  But, lo and behold, such houses as these were described as luxury buildings.  The greatest credit is due to the Dublin Corporation and to all Parties which go to make up the corporation.  We carried out a work during the war period that certainly was not paralleled anywhere in the world.  That is the simple truth.</P>
      <P>We talk about inducements to bring back our workers from Britain.  We went so far as to fix for these people a rate of pay higher than the highest paid to skilled workers in Britain. That was going very far.  However, in the case of a great number of these people who went over to Britain, they decided to settle down and got married, and I think the only real inducement that will bring them all, or nearly all, back to us would be to give them a house.  It is not enough to give them even a higher rate than they are getting in Britain and even to guarantee continuous work over a number of years.  These people know that it is difficult to get living accommodation in Dublin and I do not believe we will tempt them to come home unless we are prepared to guarantee a house in the case of every married man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may at first sight appear very hard on poor families living in one room who have been waiting years for accommodation that these houses should be given to people who have been some time in Britain but we must remember that, if these people come back, they will be responsible for the building of a great number of houses, and I think I would be prepared to go so far as to guarantee a corporation dwelling to every married tradesman who would return from Britain.  I do not think any lesser inducement will bring them back, but the fact of the matter is that we went very far in the matter of giving an inducement.  The London rate, I understand, is the highest rate of pay to skilled workers in Britain and we fixed a rate superior to the London rate and we gave an indication that there would be at least three years' continuous work for these people, but unfortunately <Col N="611" /> these inducements were only partially successful.  I think we should take the further step of offering to house every married man who would return from Britain to carry on this work of housing in the City of Dublin.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Small Dwellings Act, I do not agree with Deputy Byrne when he makes the case that we should give 100 per cent. of the loan.  I think we go far in the Dublin Corporation when we offer 90 per cent.  The need for housing in the case of people who cannot get a place to lay their heads, young people anxious to get married and others who have been living in crowded circumstances, possibly in slums, even though their weekly earnings might be quite good is so acute and the temptation to go beyond what they can actually afford so terrific that, if the 100 per cent. loan were granted, you would have people jumping in and taking upon themselves obligations which they would not have the faintest hope of fulfilling later on.  It would be a false kindness to these people to give them a 100 per cent. loan.</P>
    <P>As a matter of fact, I think we are going far when we put up 90 per cent. I do not think it is a good principle for any head of a household to go beyond a sixth of his earnings for rent.  Unfortunately, the position in Dublin is so bad that people are inclined to give as much as a third and sometimes nearly half of their total earnings for rent.  When these poor people raise a big loan and undertake all the obligations that follow; it is found that their rent will run into over £2 a week.</P>
    <P>We calculate for the ordinary house of this type about 37/- to 40/-.  Eventually it may become very much higher.  Much will depend on the incidence of rates in the city.  In my opinion, it is a false kindness to encourage people to undertake a burden which they will not be able to carry later on.  Then you may have the position arising that when general housing conditions become normal a great many of these houses will be thrown back on the hands of the local authority.  It would not be a fair proposition for the ratepayers, who must foot the bill to a large extent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="612" /> Deputy Alderman Byrne pleaded for the adoption of building cost instead of market value.  There again I cannot agree with him because it is a very human and fallible world and if we allowed the substitution of building cost for market value it would be very difficult to prevent malpractices, collaboration between, possibly, unscrupulous builders and purchasers in order to get a loan over and above the value of the house.  I think the present practice of having the premises valued by a competent valuer is better and safer and more in the interest of the ratepayers.</P>
    <P>I thoroughly agree with Deputy McCann in his remarks about the reconstruction of the Georgian houses. I want to add a further objection to the objections raised by him.  When the people are taken out of these houses and the work of reconstruction is carried out, it is found that you can then house only about one-half of the people that were dehoused.  It is very uneconomic from that point of view. Then in the matter of production, it has proved simply terrible in the case of Dublin.  We are getting very few handed over in any reasonable space of time.</P>
    <P>Some other points were raised to-day in regard to the road grants. Deputy Dunne pointed out that County Dublin fared very well in so far as there was no displacement of labour.  That hardly applies anywhere else that I know of.  But Deputy Dunne said that the position was met by the local authority putting on an additional 2/- rate.  That means a transfer of obligation from the ordinary taxpayer to the ratepayer and I have always contended that it is a greater hardship to increase rates than to increase taxation.  For this reason: if a man cannot afford to smoke, he can do without cigarettes and tobacco and will probably be all the better in health for it; if he cannot afford to spend very much on drink, he will probably be all the better by cutting down his drink but, if a person cannot pay his rates, he must take to the roads; the house is taken from over his head.</P>
    <P>I have seen families turned out on <Col N="613" /> the roadside and having to have recourse to the county home for failure to pay rates.  I do not like any tendency to shift the burden from the taxpayer to the ratepayer.  An increase in rates has a far worse effect and represents a far greater hardship, especially to old people, widows and retired persons living on a small pension.  Rates represent a terrific hardship to them. They can meet increased taxation by making certain cuts in their living expenses but they are helpless and powerless in the matter of rates and must pay.  All our experience is that there is no mercy in the matter of rates.  They simply must be paid.  I know that rates have been working out as a great hardship on the people of this city and I am sure on people throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davin referred to the desirability of communications to county managers&mdash;and I presume he meant to include city managers&mdash;being put before members of the local authority concerned.  I think that all communications that have reference to the work of the local authority, whether it is a reserved function or not, should come before the members of the local body.</P>
    <P>There is only one other matter to which I want to refer very briefly, that is, the restoration of former powers to local bodies.  I hope that that will be done soon.  I always advocated it. When I was on the other side of the House I advocated on every occasion the restoration of these powers.  I hope the powers will be restored and restored very fully too.</P>
    <P>I was a public representative when I was a very young man&mdash;when I was in my twenties.  I have long experience under the new system and under the old system.  When I think of the magnificent officials that we had under the old system and how successfully they worked and how successfully the system worked, I am very doubtful if the new system is any improvement on the older one.  People used to talk about corruption and that sort of thing in the very old days under the local councils, but I should like the members of this House to keep the cardinal point in mind that on a corporation, town council or county council every single member is a watchdog on every other <Col N="614" /> member.  Everything is done in the open and if a councillor is corrupt he will not be long in public life, and every action of any importance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I suppose it is natural that Deputies on all sides of the House should concern themselves with housing practically to the exclusion of all other aspects of local government policy. If Deputies are at fault in that, I am afraid I shall be at fault with them. The main concern of Dublin Deputies in regard to this Estimate must be the examination of Ministerial pronouncements of policy on housing in the hope that some little ray of comfort will be held out for the future to those who are at the moment living under really indescribable conditions.  The debate so far has been conducted in an atmosphere that one would wish to see brought to bear on every Estimate. In what I have got to say to the Minister I do not know that I can bring him any great assistance.  I have not a technical knowledge of building or of building construction, but there are matters affecting the administration of the housing policy of his Department upon which I feel I should comment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies on both sides of the House have been examining this question and I notice in their speeches a certain air of pessimism.  Perhaps it is an expression by Deputies of an honest opinion. I hope that at the conclusion of this debate we shall hear something from the Minister that will dispel that pessimism. At the moment, local authorities, and particularly the Dublin Corporation and the Dublin County Council, are in the position that they are not held up by any shortage of money and they are not now held up by any shortage of materials&mdash;at least, if they are, it is to a very, very limited extent.  They are, however, held up and the development of building programmes is delayed by reason of a shortage of labour and, in Dublin City, a <Col N="615" /> shortage of suitable sites.  I do not know whether I can with difficulty weave a way between what concerns the Minister's Department and what concerns the Department of his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall endeavour to keep as close to the Book as I can but I should like to suggest to the Minister that this whole question of the existing labour shortage should be re-examined. I find myself very nearly in agreement with Deputy Butler in that I would offer as an inducement to skilled tradesmen, who were married and had families, working in England a corporation house.  It might be necessary to go that far if some scheme could be evolved by the Minister or his officials &mdash;something on the lines of that operated by the Ministry of Health in England whereby workers in the building industry, single men at any rate, are guaranteed accommodation and when accommodated cannot, if they continue to pay their rent, be put out of their lodgings.  The rent they pay is fixed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had the experience during the past five weeks of talking to a young Irishman, a carpenter working in London. He came over here as the representative of six or seven other young Irishmen who were working with him as he put it, quite frankly, to see what the lie of the land was like.  They were all anxious to return home.  He got employment but he discovered that he had to pay £2 10s. 0d. per week for accommodation, whereas in England he was paying 33/6.  He also discovered that even though it was unlikely his employer had nevertheless the right to dispense with his services at an hour's notice.  He has reported back to his companions in England that that is the existing position here.  I think it is fairly safe to assume that men in employment where continuity is guaranteed&mdash;such as they have in England&mdash;and where special facilities are accorded them in respect of lodging and accommodation, are most unlikely, <Col N="616" /> except under a deep sense of patriotism, to return home to what they must consider uncertain conditions here.  I am open to correction on this, but I understand that the building trades group made certain suggestions to the Labour Court in this connection. Deputy Larkin might be able to enlighten the House, but I have not available the details of the scheme they put up.  I would, however urge as strongly as I can on the Minister the necessity for guaranteeing continuity of employment to skilled tradesmen in the building industry, because, if he does not do that, he will not get them to come home.</P>
    <P>Another difficulty that is met with, particularly in the Dublin City area, is the difficulty of procuring sites.  It is no part of my function in this debate to apportion blame or responsibility, but I do know, and I am sure there are many Deputies listening to me who know, of sites in Dublin City upon which at the moment are being built garages, and I think in one case a storing shed, which would be eminently suitable for the erection of flats.  I am sure other Deputies could multiply my experience many times over.  But, with the scarcity of suitable sites for flat building in Dublin City, the Minister and his Department should take all steps necessary to ensure that any site suitable for the erection of flats, particularly in the central city area, should not be allowed to be diverted to other purposes.  I mention flats particularly because I agree with Deputy O'Higgins that flats are the more desirable solution of our present housing needs.  Undoubtedly, by the erection of flats alone we cannot solve the problem that confronts us; but I would suggest to the Minister that, side by side with the erection of local authority houses on the outer rim of the city perimeter, there should be the greatest possible attention paid to the erection of flats. For that reason, I would urge upon him the necessity for conserving whatever available sites there are in the central city area.</P>
    <P>It is a popular slogan now to ask for the taking off of controls.  I am not at all satisfied that in all cases <Col N="617" /> it is a wise slogan.  Certainly, so far as the building industry is concerned as related to tackling the present housing shortage, the Minister eventually will probably have to consider the imposition of still further controls.  When one thinks of the conditions under which almost 80,000 people in this city are compelled to live, one would be prepared to endorse any control or direction which would end these conditions. The Minister would be doing a very good day's work if he were to send for the representatives of the master builders, the representatives of the builders' providers and the representatives of the trade unions and say to them: &ldquo;We are prepared to let you carry on as you are doing for one year, two years, three years, five years, but if at the end of that period you are not in a position to deliver the goods to us, then we as a Government will consider it our duty to the people to take the job in hands ourselves and to nationalise the whole building industry.&rdquo; It is too vital a matter for so many of our people to leave the ending of this emergency to an incentive from the purely profit motive.  If the Minister were to show the building industry as a whole that he is determined to get this job done no matter how extreme the methods he adopts to do it, it would have a very salutary effect on a number of people who are sitting back very comfortably and looking at this problem purely from the point of view of figures in a ledger.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which I should like to refer.  From time to time recommendations are made by the town planning committee.  We have heard a lot about town planning in the course of the last ten years.  I suggest to the Minister that something should be done to provide greater playing facilities for children in the central city area.  Not very many yards from where we are sitting, in Merrion Square, there is a big park enclosed by railings.  Unfortunate children from the populous district at the back of Mount Street are forced to get their amusement and play their games on the roads at the risk of life and limb while that square is locked up, practically unused, I know not by whose <Col N="618" /> behest.  That strikes me as a scandalous thing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that project has now been dropped.  That suggestion was made some years ago. I have inquired since and I understand that is not now the case.  I urge on the Minister that he recommend to his officials and to the Dublin Corporation that that square and other similar squares in the city should be thrown open so that the children of the citizens, irrespective of their addresses and of the class or creed from which they come, would be free to go into them.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to take the Minister through the tortuous terms of the 1948 Housing Act, nor do I propose to advocate legislation.  I think, however, the vast majority of the people have now formed the opinion that a much wiser thing would have been done if power had been given to pay the subsidy on the house when built.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made here to the prohibitive cost of the erection of the non-traditional type of house.  Frankly, I think the idea behind the purchase of these non-traditional types of prefabricated houses was that they could be used as a clearing centre so that the time-lag that exists at present could be got over even to that small extent.  However, I should like to direct the Minister's attention to the amount of money that it costs the local authorities to build a traditional type of house by traditional building methods and to suggest to the Minister that too much of that cost is going into the pockets of the builders and the builders' providers.  I understand that we are actually paying a price for materials that we do not need to pay. Timber Importers, Limited, who have the monopoly of the importation of timber into the country, control all timber purchases and are paying, I understand, at the rate of somewhere between £120 and £130 for big standards. Yet, that purchasing combination refuses to allow a private concern to purchase timber which can be purchased <Col N="619" /> and landed on Dublin quays at £96 per big standard, which would mean a difference in the price of any corporation house of between £60 and £70.  I think the profits of the builders and the builders' providers should be subjected to a fairly close scrutiny. Again, I do not know to what extent it is the function of the Minister or the Minister for Industry and Commerce, but in so far as it is related to houses which come within the purview of the Minister's Department I think it is time to review that.</P>
    <P>Pessimism was expressed here with regard to the direct labour schemes. Reference was made to the experience gained in the past.  I do not know whether that pessimism is justified or not but I believe it is not justified.  I believe there is enough intelligence and honesty in our people to enable us to make this direct labour scheme a success. I would suggest to the Minister that he should not be discouraged too easily by any attempts at direct labour schemes but that he should give them the benefit of his patience and encourage the local authorities to do likewise.</P>
    <P>Reference was also made to the activities of the Dublin Consultative Council.  I do not want to introduce any controversy to this debate but Deputy McCann frankly surprised me. One of the most active members of that Dublin Consultative Council with whom I have had the privilege of serving in the past 12 months is the chairman of the Dublin Corporation Housing Committee and a colleague and member of the Deputy's own Party.  I do not know what Deputy McCann's objection to the Dublin Consultative Council can have been.  It was not intended, as I understand it, as a substitute for the Dublin Corporation Housing Committee.  It was intended to co-relate the activities of the Dublin Corporation Housing Committee, the housing authority in the county council and the borough council. I think Deputy McCann's criticisms of the consultative council were, to say the least of it, unfounded.</P>
    <P>In the administration of this particular aspect of his Department, I think <Col N="620" /> the Minister has a fairly tough furrow to plough.  I think he has a certain amount of inspiration to draw from the fact that his predecessor practically expired in giving expression to a determination to see that our people were properly housed.  If the present Minister follows in the footsteps of his predecessor in that determination I think that he will achieve something worth while in his Department.  Let me assure him of one thing.  In so far as the people of Dublin are concerned they expect from the Minister and from the Government some tangible results in ending the awful conditions under which 80,000 people live in Dublin. They are not very concerned with how that is done or who does it but their attitude is, &ldquo;Give us houses.  If you do not, we will give you hell&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>In approaching this estimate I should like to get a few facts.  Opening the Book of Estimates we find that the Estimate for the Minister's Department is up this year on last year.  On the face of the book the nett Estimate is up by £59,800, that is, nearly £60,000.  If you take £7,000 off that it is certainly over £50,000 more than the Government's predecessor's Estimate for the same Department for the year 1948-49. Therefore, we may approach this Estimate on the first showing that there is no economy in this Department, anyway.  As against that, what are the citizens in the main getting as the result of this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>That must be taken under a number of different heads.  The first thing to note is that there is no economy in the Minister's Department.  There is practically a general all round increase in rates in the country.  I have the Dublin Corporation estimates before me.  Not only did the rates go up in 1948-49 as against the year 1947-48&mdash;that is, the rates have increased already during the current period of office of the Government&mdash;but we are now for the financial year 1949-50 to face another increase of rates for the citizens of Dublin.  Purely from a balance-sheet point of view, therefore, local governernment&mdash;bu <Col N="621" /> ment services are becoming more expensive. The Estimate for the Minister's own Department is up&mdash;that is the central government&mdash;and the citizens have also to meet increased expenditure and increased rates in the case of local bodies.  One wonders when these increases are going to flatten out.</P>
      <P>It is apparent, in the first case, that the promised economy drive by the Government, and particularly by the Minister for Finance, can have no relation to local government expenses. Now, on the other hand, it must be admitted that many of these items of increased expenditure are perhaps unavoidable. The only criticism that I would like to offer on that matter is that we are suffering now from some of the things that some of the Government's supporters have advocated.  We would not have half the controversy that we have at the moment about what should be done or what should not be done, the credit for what has been done or for what has not been done about certain things if, when approaching these things, they had been approached objectively with a view to seeing what precisely the problems were rather than distorting them for political propaganda.  However, perhaps it is not too late at this stage to get down and see where, exactly, we are in regard to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Butler has pointed out, an increase in the rates is a serious burden on the citizens because it is, in effect, a form of taxation that is unavoidable. As he said, there are many forms of taxation which are, to some extent, avoidable or adjustable by the person who is paying.  For instance, in the case of tobacco or drink, taxes imposed on such commodities are, to some extent, avoidable and automatically adjustable to the income of the person who has to pay because, without great hardship, it is possible to cut down the consumption of these commodities, and, in any event, there is some elasticity for adjustment.  But, in the case of the rates, which affect a matter so essential as accommodation, no such adjustment is possible. A man either pays the rate struck or the consequences follow.  It is, therefore, <Col N="622" /> a very serious thing for the citizen.</P>
    <P>The second factor in regard to it was, I think, mentioned by Deputy Davin. Deputy Davin, I think, rightly pointed out that, in many cases, the burden of increasing rates falls on the type of person who can least afford to bear an increase in that type of burden.  I am not to be taken as agreeing completely with Deputy Davin's remarks. His theory as to the method by which a trader passes on his rates seemed to me to be overdrawn, to put it mildly, but the fact is that, very often, the incidence of rates falls more heavily upon the private householder than it does upon certain classes of the business community.  That, perhaps, is a matter that might be adjusted on a proper valuation of property.  Probably it could.</P>
    <P>It is probably true to say that valuations, as they stand at the present moment in the City of Dublin, are nominal valuations and that they are largely fictitious and conventional, having regard to the change of values. Having regard to the actual burden, they are nominal valuations and, as I say, are largely fictitious and, for convenience, I will call them conventional valuations.  Now, in the case of private houses the ratio of the conventional valuation to the actual valuation is very often greater&mdash;I think generally you will find it is greater&mdash; than the corresponding ratio for certain premises, and particularly big business premises.  Take the actual valuations&mdash;I mean the actual value they are to the people who own them, that is, the income that can be derived from them.  If we have regard to that fact, it is quite clear that an increase in the rates tends rather to hit the private householder more severely than the business concern, and from that point of view, as I say, I am inclined to agree with Deputy Davin's statement this evening and, by and large, and quite apart from a question of comparison as between the different interests affected, an increase in the rates represents a serious increase in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>In a previous debate here I heard a certain figure mentioned.  I have not had time to check up on it and I am <Col N="623" /> open to correction on it but I heard it stated that the present Dublin rate represents 5/- a week on a house with, I think, a £9 valuation.  I will give another figure to show how the incidence of rates is affecting property. In 1942, the rates on a £40 valuation house were about £41.  Last year, the rates on the same house were over £55, and they will be greater in the coming year.  An increase of £15 on a £40 valuation house in the period from 1942 up to last year is a serious matter. There has been an increase of £7 on a £20 valuation house in the same period. Now, houses with a £40 valuation downwards do not represent a luxury class in this city.  When one has regard to the fact that the rates are a burden which can be passed on to the tenants by landlords it can be seen that it is a burden to be carried by all householders. Of course the people most seriously affected are the so-called white collar workers and those in lower grades of income.</P>
    <P>I think, therefore, I am justified in asking the Minister, in his approach to the Department's problems, to remember that this question of the incidence of rates has now assumed proportions that warrant attention, positive and specific attention, equally with certain other matters in his Department that require attention.  In that connection, I would also ask him whether the financial relations between the local authorities, as they exist, and the central authority could not be adjusted in a manner that might enable the local authorities to reduce their rates.  I cannot see specifically, in the case of Dublin, how that relationship has affected the increase in rates, because in getting the corporation estimates for the year ending 31st March, 1950, and the year ending 31st March, 1949, I find that they are in a completely different format and I find it practically impossible to relate expenditure in the face of these documents. It is very difficult to make the accounts presented in two totally different ways, apparently, tally, or to put them into tabular comparison, but the net effect remains that, according to these estimates, the municipal rate <Col N="624" /> is to be 28/10 for the year ending 31st March, 1950.  It has now got to be a serious problem.  It represents a real increase in the cost of living where there has been no corresponding economy that I can find shown in the finances of the Minister's Department or in the finances of the accounts of the local body in which I am naturally interested as a Dublin Deputy.</P>
    <P>I am not criticising the Minister on this matter of economy or pressing him too severely.  I realise the numerous increases in cost are practically unavoidable and have been practically unavoidable.  I would hardly have mentioned the matter of economy but for the crusade of the Minister for Finance and the facet one side of the Coalition puts on of economy, while the other side is putting up the plea for more expenditure.  Were it not for that Janus-like aspect of the Government, I should not have introduced the matter here, but obviously when these matters are brought in on that side it is important that I should advert to them on this side.</P>
    <P>Passing from the question of Dublin rates to the question of housing, that has been dealt with at some length.  I should like to say, however, and in this I differ somewhat perhaps from my colleague, Deputy McCann, that even though it may be from a technical point of view undesirable, and from a financial point of view expensive, I think that the reconditioning of these Georgian houses in certain parts of the city was the only practical way of tackling the job in these areas, and that the corporation were justified in pursuing the line they have pursued. Dublin Deputies know, and country Deputies can easily find out if they care to walk down into certain parts of the city, that it is just in these areas where these Georgian houses are, the so-called slum areas, the areas which became congested because the fashionable upper classes had moved out, that one will find the most urgent housing problems.</P>
    <P>Take Gardiner Street area, for instance&mdash;conditions are improved there now.  Go up around Temple Street, the lower end of Eccles Street, Dominick Street and Henrietta Street in particular, and it is in these areas you will <Col N="625" /> observe the dilapidated condition of the houses, coupled with the overcrowding. That is superimposed on structures which were essentially unsuitable for housing a multiplicity of families.  There you will find that there is a real urgency in the problem of housing.  If you go a little bit deeper into it you will find that the problem has been aggravated because the houses have fallen even more rapidly still into disrepair during the war years.  Landlords had every excuse. Very, very often they were not in fact able to maintain the houses with any approximation to the standard that was customary, and that was poor enough. During the war years these houses became considerably worse.</P>
    <P>One of the problems involved is that the people living in these houses do not want to be transferred any distance from the locality in which they have been brought up.  Their environment, their employment and other factors make it desirable in their eyes that they should remain in these areas.  In the majority of cases they do not wish to move to the outskirts of the city, if that can be avoided, to new building schemes.  If one examines that further one finds that it does not spring from mere sentimentality on their part.  The movement out to the outskirts of the city increases transport costs.  Very often it increases rents too.  Financially then these people feel they do not benefit, whatever may be said about increased comforts, more sanitary conditions and a healthier environment.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the urgency of their problem, as distinct from other portions of the city, from a sanitary and from a health point of view, and having regard to their legitimate feelings, on the one hand, and to the economics of the situation, on the other hand, I think it is highly desirable that the present structure should be reconditioned or rebuilt as quickly and as expeditiously as possible.  A maximum effort should be made to house these people in the area in which they have lived all their lives.  Viewing the problem in that way, I think there is a good deal of justification for what the Corporation has done in the past in that regard.  Furthermore, having regard to the effects of the war years, <Col N="626" /> even though it is somewhat more expensive, I think it is justifiable.  I take this opportunity again of pleading for these particular people.</P>
    <P>With regard to housing generally I would like to make a suggestion to the Minister.  It arises largely out of those statements made by Deputy Davin and Deputy Con Lehane as to the slowness and the prohibitive cost of building schemes and the controversy about direct labour and so forth.  Frequently statements like these are contradicted by subsequent speakers.  I think the best way to clear the matter up would be by getting the Minister to have this problem examined objectively in his Department.  Certainly I have never been able to get enough positive information to enable me to come to a positive definite conclusion.  Other Deputies seem to have quite a facility in forming an opinion, whatever the grounds.  I personally have never seen a complete set of factual statistics which would enable one to make a balanced judgment.  I would like to see the Minister present us with something in the nature of a White Paper. I would like to see a comparison made between direct labour and contract labour, paying due regard to such matters as Deputy Lehane mentioned, builders' providers and builders' profits, and in regard to prices of materials, availability of materials, segregating them into those which are produced here and those which have to be imported.  That distinction is important because in one case there might be some control as to price while in the other there might be no control. There should, too, be some relationship of profits by means of some uniform standard&mdash;the profits of builders on the average before the war and their profits now.  That was a point suggested by Deputy Davin.  Then the average output must be considered coupled with increases in wages.  Output must be taken in two ways.  There is first the question as to the builder's output.  That is the contractor's end. The matter must be examined from the point of view of holding him responsible but it would also be interesting to know what the availibility of labour is and the output of that labour in comparison <Col N="627" /> with pre-war.  Labour, in turn, might be segregated into trades.  That, of course, would depend on the type of information one could compile.  In that way one would ultimately reach an exhaustive examination of the problem.</P>
    <P>I put the matter in that way because many Deputies come in here and make allegations.  Some facet of the problem attracts them and they emphasise that particular facet and forget that there are others.  Worse still, they seize on some particular person, or group of persons, who may appear to have an insignificant vote in order to make that person or group of persons the scapegoat; or they go out after a group which appears to them to have a big vote in order to attract them.  If the Minister and his Department carries out an exhaustive examination along the lines I have laid down he will be doing a great service.  This is a problem out of which certain people have attempted to make political capital.  It is important that we should be accurately informed on this subject.  Until such time as the Minister can give us the results of that exhaustive analysis I must reserve my judgment because, quite frankly, I would never commit myself to statements such as have been made by some other Deputies.</P>
    <P>Quite obviously there is a difficulty in providing all the houses that are needed.  Output is slow.  That is perfectly obvious.  It is perfectly obvious because the Deputies who support the Government are very critical and are very agitated about the problem, thereby confirming those Deputies who do not support the Government.  Another reason why I ask the Minister to make that examination is because of the probability that the causes do not lie in the places suggested by certain Deputies.  For instance, we have left a war behind us.  Adjustments had to be made after the war.  Difficulty arose in getting skilled men, materials and so forth.  I do not know how far that difficulty extends into the present time but I would be slow enough to criticise the Minister for not reaching the desired output immediately.  I think it would be justifiable for me, however, to criticise the Government of which <Col N="628" /> the Minister is a member for having made so many rash promises without having examined the problem.  But that is beside the point.  Looking at it objectively, there must be difficulties inherent in the situation.  Because of that I think it is very important that the Minister should present us with a balanced statement covering all the matters I have mentioned upon which we could judge the position, intelligently criticise and offer suggestions for the housing programme of the future.  I shall leave it at that.</P>
    <P>I do not think it would be helpful to make any comparison between the pre-war housing output with the output during the war and output at the present time because there are three totally different economic phases involved. There was considerable progress in housing before the war under peaceful conditions.  During the war there was practically a close down. That was under wartime conditions. Shortage of material was the main cause of that.  One might reach a certain stage in the construction of a house and suddenly find that certain essential components were unprocurable. That caused a complete stoppage of work.  That was a particular period in itself.  Therefore, one could not make a fair comparison between the pre-war period and the actual war period.  Post-war one was faced with a period of transition during which time one passed from the difficulties with regard to unavailibility of material and shortage of labour to a normal situation. Again, one cannot compare the latter period with the pre-war or war period.  I do not think we can say that we have yet wholly passed away from the perturbations of war.  For that reason I do not think such comparisons would be helpful.  When certain people, however, seek to distort and misrepresent the situation, as has been done so frequently in the past and continued up to the present moment, then it is legitimate for one to give an answer.</P>
    <P>Having asked the Minister to furnish us with a balanced statement and with some comparison to enable us to form definite opinions in regard to this matter, I would like to add that in such a comparison there would be need for <Col N="629" /> some uniform standards.  I would suggest that when calculating the difficulties of the present time the pre-war standard should be taken objectively as a basis for calculation.  Some particular period must be fixed upon; in other words, if one is going to compare costs at the present moment with pre-war costs, whether on direct labour or contract schemes, one must compare them with some definite pre-war period. One must do likewise in regard to wages, materials, prices, the output given by the workers and the output given by the contractor.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which has been raised by other speakers.  As a city Deputy I am interested in it.  I do not want to go into the detail into which some Deputies have gone but I must confess myself somewhat confused on this question of housing grants.  That confusion arises from the difficulty of getting the actual summarised accounts.  The first difficulty is that adverted to by Deputy McCann and other speakers, the question of valuations of houses for the purposes of loans on the one hand and grants on the other.</P>
    <P>Two particular matters require specific mention in that connection. Firstly, I have come across cases&mdash;I cannot say how representative they are but I have definitely come across a number of cases myself&mdash;where, at a certain period, people contracted in respect of the purchase of a house and paid a deposit on the expectation, at that time&mdash;sometimes more than the expectation, actually as a result of preliminary negotiations and practically on some kind of assurance&mdash;of getting a certain grant, not a State grant, but a loan from some source or other and then because of the restriction in credit, which has been so much talked about, these people were not able to get the same loan that they had anticipated. In fact, in some cases, they have not been able to get a loan at all. Meanwhile they had paid their deposits and there was a question, therefore, of forfeiting the deposit. How far that represents what I may call a public problem, I do not know. They may have been merely individual cases, but difficulties of that nature have arisen.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="630" /> There have been a number of complaints about the difficulty and the slowness of acquiring grants.  Personally, I have found it difficulty sometimes to find how far the difficulty in acquiring a grant resulted from the present form of legislation&mdash;which would put me outside this debate&mdash;or how far it resulted from administrative friction, but people dealing with these matters have found that there have been difficulties arising from the payment of grants of this nature, and if the Minister could give us any information on the matter, I should be grateful.  The Estimates and the Appropriation Accounts are not very enlightening. The Appropriation Accounts for 1946-47 are the latest I could get and, as I say, they are not very enlightening.  In the Estimates, there are provisions for grants and there is an increased provision for expenditure under sub-head I (1)&mdash;Contributions towards Loan Charges under the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1932.  There is an estimated increase, but having regard to the Appropriation Accounts for 1948-49 which we have not got, it would be interesting to know what relation the actual expenditure is likely to bear under that heading to the Estimate.  Similar remarks might be made on the other headings but in any event, I think I can safely say that there have been complaints and difficulties both about the machinery of getting the grants and about a certain slowness in having grants made available. If the Minister is in a position to comment on that, I should be grateful.</P>
    <P>There is a general question which arises that is one of some difficulty&mdash;the relation of the Minister's Department to public authorities generally.  I must confess that I feel personally very like a child groping in the dark in these matters.  I have spoken to various people, amongst them Deputies who are members of local bodies, and while you will get conflicting views, they are all very much of the opinion that it is not only essential to have local authorities but that they should be as autonomous as possible.  On the other side, one feels that the Department had been constrained from time to time to advise the Minister to seek further <Col N="631" /> control during the period of office of the Government's predecessors and that that culminated in the County Management Act which, many say, has worked quite satisfactorily.  Meanwhile the tendency is becoming very noticeable for the Government to take action, place the responsibility on the local authority and while acting in, so to speak, a mandatory fashion towards that authority, whether through legislation or by reserved powers exercised by the Minister, nevertheless, to disclaim all responsibility for the particular actions as actions which do not directly concern the Department.  That situation does suggest that the matter requires examination because one cannot help feeling that having regard to all these things, particularly in regard to legislation going through, that as time goes on, the burden that the citizen has to bear in rates and the burden that he has to bear in taxes, are becoming administratively so associated, that these two categories are merely degenerating into subheads of one general taxation.</P>
    <P>As I say, I feel I am very largely groping in the dark and I should not like to risk any suggestions, but it seems that the other systems as they worked in the past were more favourable financially to the citizen than what we are tending to at the present moment.  At the time when the Dublin Corporation was abolished and was administered by commissioners, I understand that the rates took a very favourable turn from the point of view of the citizen who had to pay them. In the time when the Dublin Corporation was completely autonomous it also seems that the citizens were pretty well served, but it seems that where the impact of legislation which is inter-linking the central Government's function and the public authority's function is becoming more noticeable, and a greater tie-up between the two is becoming more apparent, the burden the citizen has to bear financially is also becoming an increased factor.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister does not take me as offering these remarks in the sense of criticism either of himself or his Department or anything else.  There is <Col N="632" /> a very difficult problem indeed involved in all these matters.  We must realise it and realise also that all that the Minister or any Government can do is to take the best steps they can to deal with such problems.  Nevertheless, I think it is no harm that they should be registered.  I think I heard Deputy Larkin whispering about services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">

      <P>Not whispering.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, shall I say he said it in a low voice?  On the question of services, in one sense Deputy Larkin is perfectly right if his suggestion is that there are greater services.  From the public point of view, there are, in this sense&mdash;there are greater housing services now than there were many years ago.  There are greater health services.  But, the services that the ordinary citizen got have in some respects deteriorated.  I understand&mdash;to take a very common instance&mdash;that the service of the bin men is not what it used to be and, of course, the corporation are quite right to point out that such collections would add more to the rates now as compared with former years.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>There are citizens who think that the services as far as the individual citizen feels them have not improved and that may resolve itself into a question of how far the benefits which one portion of the community got, which were not available at a previous time, and to which they were quite entitled, have been paid for by people in other categories and as to whether people, particularly in the white-collar category, have not now got to the limit of the burden that they can carry in that respect and as to whether you still have persons in what <Col N="633" /> I may call the higher or super-categories in sufficient numbers to give you any serious contribution to the levelling-up process that has been going on.</P>
      <P>Again, I merely mention these matters as problems.  They have got to the extent of being so complex now that no individual Deputy or individual citizen can express an opinion on them unless the facts are marshalled by the Government or such a body as the corporation in a form in which he can assimilate them.  There is no possibility of trying to trace these facts from the various sources.  One would need a whole staff to do it.  Therefore, just as I asked the Minister to consider giving us information about the comparative costs and output of building, it might be interesting if the Minister were to give us the considered opinion of himself and his Department on this question of the rising rates and what can be done about them, if anything.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether revaluation might or might not be any use.  I have heard&mdash;not in Dublin but in the country &mdash;complaints that certain revaluations were being made but, of course, it is the local authority that initiates all revaluations as the law stands and I think they do it quite independently of the Minister, so that probably it is not directly a concern of the Minister. It would be interesting, however, to know in that connection how far these revaluations have contributed to an increase in revenue of any particular local body and, therefore, how far a local authority would have an incentive to undertake revaluations with a view to increasing its revenue.  Then the question would arise as to whether these revaluations are on a uniform scale or whether they are not simply taken haphazardly.  These are all matters which I mention more by way of adverting to the problems that exist and questions that have been asked rather than expressing any opinion upon them, which, frankly, I feel, with the information at my disposal, I am hardly competent to do at the moment.</P>

      <P>I move now to another matter in the Minister's Estimate.  Here I confess I must ask the direction of the Chair I do not want to discuss a proposal for legislation.  At the same time, a proposal for legislation has been introduced explicitly into this debate by the Minister.  It appears to be related to item M&mdash;Text Books of Local Government&mdash;and, of course, in the reconsidering of legislation that is involved considerable ministerial problems arise. I take it that I may discuss the matter, not from the point of view of the content of that legislation but from the point of view of the machanics as to how that legislation should be prepared?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">

      <P>Or the necessity for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Or the necessity for it, if the Chair pleases.  The necessity for it is obvious.  It is obvious from two points of view.  First, it is obvious from the point of view, I should imagine, of any officer of Local Government, whether of a local authority or of the Minister's Department, who would be dealing with it. I know nothing about the Minister's Department internally but if I were to hazard a guess I should say that the Minister probably has to keep near him certain officers who have made a special study of this legislation and who are legal experts on it and who have time to deal with nothing else and that everybody else who has to deal with the complexities of that code has to have frequent recourse to them. I should imagine that the problem of every county manager, local government clerk, and so forth is something similar.  So that, from a Minister's point of view it is more than high time that the job should be tackled.  From the point of view of the public, it is equally important that the law should be put into a form that the ordinary citizen can find out easily where he stands.  These are the two main reasons.  I might add a third&mdash;the convenience of the lawyers, but that is quite an insignificant consideration compared with the others, as the lawyers are there specifically for the purpose of delving into the difficulties and abstrusenesses of the law and unravelling them.  I think Senator Sweetman will agree with me that, if the citizen wants to know quickly where he stands as regards the law affecting him in everyday life, it is essential that the solicitor whom he will consult will be able quickly to get a correct view of the law.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with it from the public point of view which, I take it, is the point of view of paramount importance.  I would also like to deal with it from the point of view of the citizen who tends to be oppressed by the complexity of our existing legislation.  If a citizen does not know where he stands, he very quickly becomes the victim of injustice.  If he is ignorant of rights that he has, he may not be able to enforce them, especially if the code is extremely complex. From that point of view, it should be possible for him to be advised quickly.  From the public point of view, of expeditious and sure administration on the part of public bodies, it is high time that this code were dealt with.</P>
      <P>The difficulty I see in this matter is that, in a consolidation job, especially if it is tackled purely by legal experts and Departmental experts, there will be a tendency to confuse reform with consolidation, to an extent that will magnify the job greatly, introduce another element of uncertainty and, of course, most serious of all, an element of delay.  I think that, in a job of this nature, at the start the Minister and his advisers should face up to the fact that there is no finality in human affairs, that if they chase the will-o'-the-wisp of trying to produce the perfect local government code for all time, they are merely wasting their time, and the public time that should be spent in something more practical.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>This comes to the textbook again.  The writers of a textbook very often tend towards perfection. If the Minister's Department officials are going to sit down and codify the law, any such codification will mean a certain amount of amendments that are necessary in order to make it homogeneous.  Some amendment will be necessary, but the advisers will have to guard against amendments for the sake of perfection or desirability as the code stands or what might be called originating changes in the law.  Amendments to secure consistency are necessary, but if the Minister starts on top of that relating all the cases and trying to get them into a textbook, I am very much afraid that the textbook contemplated by the Minister will suffer the fate that such projected legal textbooks in the past have suffered, of having been published posthumously as far as the authors are concerned.</P>
      <P>Therefore, it seems to me that the Minister might be wiser to drop the textbook idea, and let the case law and all that lie for the moment.  The case book could follow.  The first thing to do is to take the Acts and consolidate them, introducing merely such amendments as are necessary in order to make the code homogeneous as it stands to-day.  Then decide the date up to which you will consolidate and then let your legislation flow on in the ordinary manner.  It means that you have simply one Consolidated Act brought into the picture, instead of producing a local government code to exist for all time, which is a will-o'-the-wisp or, worse still, trying to have a textbook to elaborate it.  I may seem to be wasting time of the House on this, but the urgency of having some consolidation warrants referring to it, and there are also the dangers I have mentioned.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="638" /> Deputy O'Higgins referred to the Seanad Bill.  Yes, I am not going to attempt to go into that particular Bill. It has done one part of the negative job that has to be done, namely it has collected all the dead wood in local government, so that it can be jettisoned. If that Bill and that Bill alone is passed, it will not do anything of very much use.  In fact, if you do not go further, it will complicate things, as heretofore you had only to look at the Acts, but now you would have to look at this new Act to see the repeals and their effects.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I admit that it is, but it is only a stage.  I would suggest to the Minister what the next stage is.  Let us say the Acts are now got together&mdash;preferably a clean copy, if I may speak concretely, of every Act.  The first essential stage having been done, these clean copies are put together.  Then you get your scissors and cut them up, and then string them together and examine them for inconsistencies. At that stage, having regard to decisions, you might make one or two alterations that could be immediately recommended.  Then, at that stage, come out with it.  Do not wait for the case law or the textbook. By all means, let the textbook go on, but the immediate urgency is to produce the Bill.  As Senator Sweetman has said, the beginning has been made and I congratulate the Minister on it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>May I finish with one remark?  The machinery&mdash;and this is administrative again, though it affects us all here in dealing with this &mdash;is important, since the preparation of all these measures is an administrative matter for the Minister and it will be too late, when it comes before this House, to deal with these preparatory matters.  A consolidation Bill of that nature would probably require to be dealt with by a slightly different preliminary machinery here.  All I can say on that point is that a procedure has been worked out in another Parliament for dealing with these matters and the Minister should consider it. With regard to the mechanics of it, there are two elements which enter into it.  I would recommend to the Minister that, having done his Bill in his Department from his Department's point of view, he should get one or two independent technical minds afterwards to vet the Bill and advise him from the legal point of view before presenting it here.  The Chair has been gracious in permitting me to go so far, and I finish with that matter by asking the Minister to let us have it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other matters affecting Dublin from the point of view of local government and I suppose that traffic and similar matters are matters for the Department, as well as the Department of Justice.  In certain regards in Dublin, it probably would help if traffic lights were installed.  I do not know how far the Minister has any function in the matter, but I notice that there is a move in that direction and it probably will help a great deal in controlling the traffic.  In that connection I should say that in certain of the nearer suburbs of the city where cars tend to speed, traffic lights are probably the best control, because, if you have a number of traffic lights at crossings, uniform speeding becomes impossible.  I have in mind certain <Col N="640" /> areas just beyond the far side of the two canals, the near outskirts of the city, where traffic tends to accelerate unduly while in a built-up area and to become very dangerous to children. Traffic lights at crossings on these thoroughfares would do much to control that situation and I suggest that the Minister should consider the suggestion, if he has any function in the matter.</P>

He has a difficult problem to handle, and, if he could encourage a lot of his supporters to examine these problems objectively, with regard to the facts and the figures rather than from the point of view of scoring political points, he would do a real benefit to the community.  Perhaps the best contribution he could make to that would be to give us the facts and figures himself which will enable many of the false suggestions made to be dispelled and those which have any foundation to be substantiated.</P>

      <P>Listening to a number of the speakers, I got the impression that they had the idea that rates are collected for the fun of collecting them and that the burden of rates bears no relation whatever to the actual services for which they are collected.  I do not want to go into that because it seems to me to be quite manifest that, when you have a number of Deputies who are members of local authorities speaking in a manner which gives that impression, it is not due to their lack of knowledge and must be due to something else&mdash;either they are ignoring the actual facts of which they are aware or do not appreciate the kind of general statements they make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy de Valera said he was groping somewhat in regard to many aspects of local government.  I was groping very laboriously after Deputy de Valera at times, but I did hold on fairly grimly to one point he mentioned <Col N="641" /> when he referred to the increase in rates in Dublin and quoted the instance of a house of £40 valuation in respect of which he said that there had been an increase of 50 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Dublin Corporation to-day is paying rates of wages which have increased by 80 per cent. over 1939 rates, and, at the very lowest, the materials they use have increased by 100 per cent. &mdash;that is the figure they accepted themselves after a minute investigation of increases in the building trade a few years ago&mdash;and, in addition, they are providing a number of not very large services but the kind of small services which involve an additional penny or twopence on the rates. These are services that nobody ever thinks of, but every councillor is trying to get them put on.  From that point of view, the only thing that surprises me is that the rates are not very much higher, not only in Dublin but throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a mistake, from that angle, to keep harping on the burden of rates, because, even if rates do represent, as was Deputy de Valera's suggestion, a payment of 5/- per week on a house of £9 valuation, what service are they getting for it?  If they did not pay that 5/- to the local authority, whether the Dublin Corporation or any other council, how much would it cost them to provide the services in some other form, either privately or through private enterprise?  While there is a great deal to criticise, local authorities on the whole do a very good job.  They do the job very cheaply for the citizens and in spite of all the burdens we have to carry, I personally feel&mdash;and I live in probably one of the highest rated towns in the country&mdash;we have no basis on which to make an outcry against the actual rate in the £ itself or the actual amount we are required to pay, subject to the reservation that naturally there are sections of the community that are not able to pay because <Col N="642" /> of their position.  When you hear this continual outcry from ratepayers' associations and when time after time they do not indicate on any one small particular how a penny or two can be saved on the rates and year after year run away from that challenge, I do not think the local authority can be blamed.</P>
    <P>Members of this House have spoken not only on this question but on the question of grants for roads in connection with rates but many of these are members of local authorities also and it is in the councils of the local authorities that the question should be raised of reducing the rates.  Every member of a local authority knows that when this question of reducing the rates comes up there is not very much you can do except to cut down services and if the services are to be cut down take that responsibility, but those who wish to reduce the rates run away from that responsibility.</P>
    <P>There are one or two matters I want to touch on in connection with roads. I personally say that roads generally in the country, as far as surface is concerned, are in a very good condition and I welcome the proposal of the late Minister to attempt now to concentrate attention on secondary roads for a period.  We know that our main roads are suitable for American tourists let alone for ordinary Irishmen and women.  There is one aspect of road construction and repair to which we should give attention and that is to realise that good roads, wide roads, properly surfaced and well cambered roads, do not always mean safety. They can mean a highly increased rate of accidents.  I am thinking of one road in North Dublin which was, I think, regarded as a model road at the time it was constructed ten or 12 years ago but I think that it is one of the most dangerous roads in this country. When we are constructing roads in the future we should pay attention, not so much to a perfect surface, but concentrate attention on corners and hidden bends which are the danger spots along the road and see if we can get speed with safety on the roads and not just speed with an increased accident rate which we seem to have had lately.  We <Col N="643" /> should hear in mind that the faster the traffic moves on the roads the more warning is required with regard to corners, crossroads, the approach to schools and villages and so on.  While I read in an English journal the other day that Irish roads as a whole were better sign-posted than English roads, I think we could improve our standard very much, not so much by indicating the name of the next village along the road but by indicating a corner where somebody might step out in front of the car.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to traffic in Dublin.  I happen to work in a street that has become a traffic nightmare because within the last few months it has become one of the main bus termini in the city.  I do not know whether it is because the buses cater for the public that they have a special privilege, but in a short time, as far as I can see, the Córas Iompair Éireann buses will own the whole city, not the citizens, because whatever they require has to be given to them.  Last year we had two bus stops in that street but now there is a continuous line of bus stops on one side stretching for about 200 yards and on the other for about 300 yards and between the lines of bus stops on both sides of the path there is no access for anybody unless you stand in a bus queue.  That is bad enough but when you have double-decker buses swinging around into the street which is one of the busiest streets in the city we should consider what has happened with regard to the control of traffic in the city.  I believe that we ought to achieve what we have been approaching, that is, through city services of buses without any termini in the city itself.  The stoppage of buses even for a short period in the city creates a block and when there is, as you may see, half a dozen buses waiting until it is time to move out, for two minutes or three minutes or up to ten minutes, you have a terrible situation.  I do not know why we should not get rid of the Nelson Pillar psychology, the idea of having a central place where everything comes to a stop.  The buses should be run right through straight from suburb to suburb.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="644" /> As far as Dublin traffic is concerned, we may as well give up all hope until we face two problems.  One is the problem of Trinity College and the other is that of new bridges across the Liffey.  I cannot see any improvement being achieved as long as a great percentage of Dublin traffic has got to be centred in the bottleneck of College Green and has to pass over the two bridges, O'Connell Bridge and Butt Bridge.  Until we solve those two problems traffic will continue to be a problem in Dublin.  While I have a great regard for old buildings and historical associations, I cannot see any justification in allowing one institution like Trinity College to continue to be an obstruction in the way of development in the city.  I remember some years ago when a small portion was taken from Trinity College between Grafton Street and Nassau Street corner, it took two years before the corporation could get that couple of feet off.  It did not take away from the amenities of the college or interfere with it in any way, but that was their attitude. To try to deal with traffic problems in this city when you have a block in the centre of the city running about three-quarters of a mile in one direction and about a quarter of a mile in the other direction which nothing can pass is impossible. It is an impossible situation for the city planners and for the men who are trying to deal with the problems of city life and the movement of population in the city.  The problem of city bridges is one that has got to be solved some day between the Dublin Port and Docks Board and the corporation because until we have new bridges we will have this problem.</P>
    <P>Another problem which was raised by Deputy de Valera was that of local government generally.  I know that the present Minister has had a lot of experience of local government in the real sense of the word, that is, the governing of a particular locality.  I know what his personal views are with regard to the rights and privileges of a local authority and I am not going to suggest the introduction of legislation or trying to get away with what Deputy de Valera got away with for a while but what I suggest is that if we are going to have a healthy system <Col N="645" /> of local government in this country we must have a certain confidence in the men who constitute the local authority and we must realise that the function of the Local Government Department is not to govern the local authorities but to act as a connecting link between the local authorities and the central Government.  They do require that connecting link and advice and guidance, but they do not require dictatorship. For a number of years there has been a gradual but steady tendency on the part of the Department of Local Government to take more and more into their own hands and to usurp more and more the powers of the local authorities.  That tendency has been reversed now but more can be done because the Minister has under existing law acquired powers which he could quite readily not utilise in actual practice and that would make for a more healthy atmosphere in the local authorities and a speeding up of the work.</P>
    <P>I cannot see why, if a local authority wants to give an increase of 5/- a week to a member of a pensionable staff, a member of the Cabinet and central Government has to give his consent. That seems to me to be bringing guidance and advice to the point of absurdity.  If we are going to have these local authorities dealing with local problems, not merely have we, so to say, to measure out the extent of their authority but we have to welcome their initiative and encourage it and to realise that the basis of any democratic system in this country is the interest taken in the work of the local authority by the local citizens and the readiness of local citizens to serve without reward on local authorities. I cannot see any intelligent man or woman being prepared to serve on a local authority if he feels that the slightest decision he may make or action he may take to use his own initiative and to use the machinery available to him has first to be checked, rechecked and sanctioned by somebody maybe two hundred miles removed from the scene of the action.</P>
    <P>The main question discussed in this debate was housing.  A number of speakers have drawn attention to a <Col N="646" /> kind of air of pessimism that has been manifest in the speeches of some of the contributors to the debate.  I do not know of any reason why we should not be pessimistic.  I approve to the full the work that was started by the late Minister for Local Government when he took over the responsibility of this Department.  I know the interest the present Minister is taking in housing and how anxious he would be not only to carry on the work of his predecessor but to improve upon it.</P>
    <P>I am not concerned with either the late Minister for Local Government, Deputy Murphy, for whom I had a tremendous respect, or the present Minister.  I am concerned with the problem that has existed with us now under different Governments and different Ministers for a long period of years.  It is as near solution to-day as it was the day we started to try and face that problem.  I agree that no useful purpose is served in going back over the past few years&mdash;in denying credit to those who did make a contribution or in trying to claim undue credit for some other political Party. What Deputy McCann said is true. Nobody in this city has spent a greater amount of energy or has gone to greater trouble or was more conscientious in their efforts to deal with the housing problem than the members of the Housing Committee of Dublin Corporation&mdash;members of all Parties.  It is equally true that the credit for what was done in Dublin from 1932 to the outbreak of the war has to be given to that housing committee.  As far as the previous Government was concerned, while they passed the Act which made housing subsidies available, the Act would have been completely useless if it had not been for the work of the men and women of that housing committee.  In the years from 1932 to 1939 much more was accomplished in the way of providing houses than in the previous period but let us face the very simple fact that in not even one of all those years did we ever build the actual number of houses we all agreed was necessary. The best we got was in 1938 when we had an overlap from one year to another.  We are in the same position <Col N="647" /> to-day.  I am satisfied that even though we may succeed in, say, 12 months' time in bringing into realisation the present plans, the actual number of houses that will be handed over year by year to the Dublin Corporation will still be insufficient to meet current needs.  We must not forget the number of houses that, year by year, become unfit for habitation and the number of other types of cases about which we hear very little.  We speak of having some 15,000 or 20,000 applicants who we already passed for houses by the Dublin Corporation; we speak of a certain number of cases of families with tuberculosis; we speak of newly-weds. But we forget that in and about the city there are tens of thousands of families who, from any ordinary decent viewpoint, have not got a decent place to live in, even though they are not listed by the corporation and will not be considered by the corporation. Every one of us will agree that, even though you have got the two-roomed flat and the three-roomed flat&mdash;fairly large rooms&mdash;and you have only got, say, five or seven of a family in those rooms, that is not a proper standard of housing.  Yet we have to be content for our people to remain at that standard because it is so superior to the standard at which many thousands of others have to live.  I do not think that even yet the Dublin Corporation or the Department of Local Government or any of us have actually sat down and tried to gauge the number of houses we would require over a 20 or a 30-year period&mdash;not merely in order to get rid of those housing sores in Dublin but to be able to say that Dublin's citizens live under ordinary decent conditions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that all the members of the housing committee and the officials of the Department of Local Government have a very definite figure as to the number of houses we require this year, in five years' time, in ten years' time and in 20 years' time. But, in and around these definite figures, there is another situation we have never been able to look at because we dare not.  If we were to take the corporation houses already built and saw how many second families are living in these houses either as subtenants or as relatives I suppose we would be appalled at the full number. Those of us who have to deal with these problems know that hardly a day passes when we are not asked to assist some family threatened with eviction or some family which has reached a point where they cannot continue to live in a subtenanted house.  It is because of that situation that I think we are entitled to feel pessimistic.  I am not trying to apportion blame on anybody.  It seems to me that everyone is genuinely anxious to try and find a solution to the problem but I suppose most of us are overcome by the difficulty of arriving at that solution. I am somewhat puzzled at times. I listened to the debate to-night.  I notice that there is an agreement in certain respects&mdash;(1) that there is, generally, a sufficient supply of material, (2) that we have no shortage of money, (3) that while we have some difficulty in regard to sites there are sufficient sites to go on with, and (4) that, we are told, the only reason why we cannot build the houses is because there is not sufficient skilled labour. That last point is simply an incorrect statement.  We have more skilled labour in the City of Dublin to-day in the building trade than we have ever had in the history of this city.  We have more carpenters, more plasterers, more bricklayers, more plumbers and more electricians&mdash;more of every type of skilled labour&mdash;in the City of Dublin than ever before and we have, in addition, an unending flow of unskilled or semi-skilled labour.  If we have labour, materials, money and a <Col N="649" /> certain number of sites on which we can go ahead why is it that we cannot get houses?</P>

      <P>I do not think that is correct.  I cannot accept the statement that men have not the will to build houses when, to my knowledge, men spend at least half of every week sitting down, worrying and studying this problem, trying to find a solution and, I would say, running away from people who are looking for houses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Running away to try and avoid people who have no houses and who are looking for them.  It is not easy to tell a man or a woman, no matter how bad the conditions may be, that there is no house for them at the moment and that they have to put up with it.  I think human nature sooner or later rebels and then the easy way out is taken.  What I consider to be part of the difficulty is the fact that while it is correct that we have got the skilled labour in the city&mdash;remember that in certain cases the number of workers in a particular trade is 100 per cent. more than in 1939&mdash;we do not seem to concern ourselves where that labour has got to in the city.  It is not on corporation schemes because the corporation, I suppose, at the height of its activities never employed more than about 10 per cent. of the total building labour employed in the City of Dublin. Therefore, if we had in 1939 a fairly adequate labour force of which ten or even 15 per cent. was employed by the Dublin Corporation and it is an undisputed fact that we have to-day nearly double that labour force, especially of skilled labour, how is it that the corporation to-day is employing even a smaller percentage than in 1939?  What is the reason for this situation that faces us and which we say is the cause of not being able to get houses?  Why is the ordinary building operative either prepared to go and work for a private employer rather than for the <Col N="650" /> Dublin Corporation or is compelled to work for the private employer?  I have not heard anybody trying to find an answer to that problem.</P>
      <P>We are told that part of the difficulty of getting houses is lack of output. We are told that the Dublin Corporation claim that these men get the trade union conditions and rates of wages, that every effort is being made to attract men back to work here, that we are even prepared to give them a house if they come back from England. I agree with giving a house to tradesmen coming back from England if it is going to get more houses built.  Why is it necessary to bring back a tradesman from London by providing him with a house when he comes back, when we have got more carpenters, bricklayers, electricians and plumbers in the City of Dublin than we could ever employ on corporation schemes for the next 100 years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardButler" hpid="Mr. Butler Mr. Butler">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>We find it very hard to get them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that we have not got them, because the figures are there.  I think we are entitled to look at the matter a little more closely. First of all, let us face the fact quite brutally that the building contractor does not go in for building houses just for pleasure and that the building operative does not go to work just because he likes work.  He goes to work for the Dublin Corporation and he gets the minimum standard trade union rate of wages.  He goes to work for a private contractor who is engaged in the business because of what he gets out of it and he may get twopence or one shilling per hour more.  Do not shake your head, Deputy Brennan. Even building contractors admit that. The members of the builders' federation have an agreement that they will not pay over the minimum rate, but how many are outside the builders' federation?  That is one aspect of the matter&mdash;the rate of wages.  If we feel this housing problem is serious in the terms of the moral and physical health of our people, the safety of children's lives and the ordinary decency of the Christian life; if it is necessary in order to attract skilled labour away from the private contractor on to the <Col N="651" /> corporation schemes which are providing the basic supply of houses for the working classes, I do not see how we can hesitate to approach this problem of the rates of wages.  If it is good business for a speculative builder who is only concerned with the making of profit&mdash;I am not arguing whether it is right or wrong, but that is his urge to be in the building game&mdash;to attract labour on to his contract by paying something above the standard rate, is the Dublin Corporation not entitled to do the same?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Dublin Corporation not entitled to enter into competition for that labour if the getting of that labour means the difference between life and death for children in the city?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is part of the difficulty. Here we are expecting an immense machine like the Dublin Corporation to be able to compete for the available supply of labour with building contractors who are free to make decisions on the spur of the moment, to adjust themselves from hour to hour to changing conditions, to enter into any commitment which will suit their business.  We are trying to get a position where this immense, overweighted machine is going to be able to move as quickly and rapidly as the individual employer.  It just cannot be done.  If we are going to deal with this problem of housing, we have to realise that a great many of the regulations which we impose upon this machine, the conditions which we lay down and which regulate the movement and motion of the machine, have to go by the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In common with other Deputies I received a letter yesterday from the emergency housing association and they want us to declare a national emergency on housing.  I do not know whether it is necessary to go that far, but if we are serious about supplying houses in the numbers needed in Dublin to-day&mdash;the same number that <Col N="652" /> was needed in my own experience over 25 years ago and which it looks to me will be needed in another 25 years&mdash; if we do not regard it as an emergency, we should make up our minds to free the local authority machine which has to supply the houses for the masses of the people from all the possible restrictions we can.</P>
    <P>One of them it seems to me is that the Dublin Corporation as the employing party should be at liberty to offer conditions of employment to the men it seeks which they consider are reasonable and fair and can be justified by the output of houses that will be secured.  I would leave it to the Dublin Corporation, in their good judgment, to fix the rates and conditions. At present they have not got that right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is done all the time. All I am suggesting is that the competition is going on.  If it is possible <Col N="653" /> to attract labour on to Dublin Corporation schemes, not by giving 1/-per hour extra&mdash;I am not suggesting that&mdash;but by giving some of the small things the workers believe they are entitled to and which may make the difference between a good and a bad job, the corporation should be entitled to do that&mdash;whether it is an hour or two of overtime, a break for tea in the morning, things which the private employer gives and by which he holds men on the job.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I often wonder what they do.  No names, no pack drill.  In the case of overtime we have a different situation.  The corporation was prepared to sanction the working of overtime but the employees did not want to work overtime.</P>
      <P>Another point to which reference was made was the old problem of continuity and guarantee of work in the building trade on these county council schemes.  I know that the skilled worker who works for a private contractor has no guarantee of continuity although generally, conditions being as they are to-day, the private contractor is very slow to knock the skilled man off.  He will carry him even if he is short of materials because, if he does not carry him, he will probably lose him.  At the same time, he has not got the guarantee of continuity in the sense that as one contract finishes there would be no break and he would be put on to another.  The same applies to the public contractor.  One of the most important things in the building trade is that, as the men who speak for the skilled operatives&mdash;I can only speak for the unskilled labourer&mdash; state, you can get more skilled operatives on to public schemes by guaranteeing them continuity of work than by guaranteeing increased wages.  We have never been able to do that.  That is something that is outside the Housing Committee of the Dublin Corporation.  That is a job for the technical expert both in the Dublin Corporation and in the Department of Local Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that a great deal of our difficulties and the delays we meet with are <Col N="654" /> in that particular section of our housing activities, in the planning and sanctioning of schemes and the working of one scheme into another so that as one section of tradesmen finishes they can be taken off and passed on to another scheme which has already reached the point where the painter, electrician or plumber can be brought in.  That means more than one direct labour scheme and more than one contract. It means that both contracts and direct labour schemes are so organised that there can be a flow in the continuity of work of the different trades from one to another.  It is very hard to get that through the private contractor who is carrying out the contract for the corporation because he is bound by certain conditions of contract with regard to price of materials, workmanship and the completion of the contract but he is at liberty within those conditions to vary his own output and the employment of labour.  It seems to me that, apart altogether from what Deputy de Valera says, one of the most valuable aspects of direct labour is that the flow of work can be better regulated by the local authority than on a private contract.  It is the flow of labour that will make possible continuity of work in the way of getting skilled labour on the public contracts.</P>
    <P>I had certain expectations of the housing council when it was started. When I studied it a little more closely I became somewhat more doubtful.  So far as housing is concerned, we have had all the consultations and all the advice we need for a number of years to come.  What we require is an executive or administrative body, small in number, not more than five or six, charged to act in the name of the Minister and as the connecting executive authority between the Minister and the local authorities.  Instead of that, it seems to me we have been given a council giving representation to the different interests.  I do not want to cast any doubt on the work they have done but I certainly cannot see that they have assisted materially in speeding up the solution of this problem. It is still possible to deal with it from the point of view that we should have a small executive committee acting, if you like, in the name of the Minister, <Col N="655" /> subject to his direct authority and control.  However, it should represent the different interests in the whole problem, the contractor, labour, the local authority and, say, the Department. They need not necessarily be technical experts but persons with a reasonable amount of knowledge on the practical side and a certain amount of administrative ability and common sense, who will be, if you like, progress chasers to see that work is going on, that bottle-necks are broken down and so forth.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the difficulty that exists between the various bodies involved in the solution of this problem is such that somewhere along the line the plans have fallen down and got lost for a period.  I remember some years ago a plan for housing schemes getting lost for two years in the Department of Local Government.  I do not think it is as bad to-day but I do feel that a good deal of time could be saved.  I feel that even if we had the materials, the labour, the money and sites, we would still be complaining about a good deal of delay with regard to the actual planning and sanctioning of the scheme.</P>
    <P>Another thing that interests me is that while I agree that the important thing is to get numbers of houses up and occupied, I have noticed practically no change in the design of corporation houses for God knows how many years.  I do not see why, when we start the actual business of the scheme, we could not ask some draftsman or architect to try out some new designs keeping the cost within limits. Recently, on a number of occasions I have been in cities across the water and it was quite interesting to see with the same sized house the variety that could be made available.  While our corporation houses are a tremendous improvement on a single room in a tenement, they do become fairly monotonous when you see them stretching for about a mile in a row one after another across the whole scheme.</P>
    <P>A number of new methods have been introduced into the building trade in this country.  Some are already giving trouble to the tribunal.  While the <Col N="656" /> tribunal do not like trouble, I do not see why all these new methods should be started on private contractors' jobs and none under the public contractors.</P>
    <P>One or two other problems were referred to in general and I just want to touch upon them.  Something was said in regard to the reconditioning of the old Georgian houses.  Whatever might have been the excuse it seems to me a somewhat flimsy one for the carrying on of that work during the war and particularly at the cost that was involved.  I cannot see any justification, especially now that reconditioning has become complete reconstruction. No matter how they are reconstructed or reconditioned, so long as they are reconstructed and reconditioned on the original basis, those houses are going to be tenement houses again in a short period of years.  Even the houses that were done four or five years ago are already starting to show what they will be in the short space of a few years.</P>
    <P>The reason is very simple.  People not only require space inside a room to live in but they also require space outside the room.  They have not that outside space in the case of these buildings in Gardiner Street.  The members of the corporation know very well that, when they are considering the erection of a block of flats, one of the things they look for is the amount of space that is going to be set aside not only inside the block for living apartments but around it where children can play.  The houses in Gardiner Street are not suitable from that point of view, and they never can be made suitable.  I think it would be much better if, during the war, the minimum of repairs had been carried out to keep those houses in habitable condition and to accept the position that they should be taken down later.  We want to keep our people in close proximity to their work and so save them heavy transport fares.  If we cannot afford space on the sites to erect the cottage type of house or put up blocks of flats we should at least not try to turn a house, originally intended for a single family, into one in which you put six or seven families.  The Dublin Corporation have spent a great deal of money <Col N="657" /> trying to ease the housing situation in that way, but I think they are just creating another problem for themselves in a few years' time.</P>
    <P>I listened to Deputy McCann asking Deputy Byrne to define what a newly-wed is.  I do not know whether they agreed on a definition or not.  I think that if we were to go back to the original idea we might get some clarity on that point.  As far as I remember, the original suggestion of a house for a newly-wed was that it was not to be the provision of a house for a couple married a year or two but of a house for a boy and a girl who, from the day of their marriage had never become contaminated by having to live in a tenement room.  In other words, that from the first day of their marriage they got a good start under decent housing conditions.  I feel that if the Dublin Corporation were to try and carry out that experiment, no matter how strong the claims of people married, say, four or five years might be, it would be a good thing.  The whole purpose of the allocation of a house to newly-weds should be to give to other families the example of seeing at least one couple start off under decent conditions and the prospect of being able to maintain a decent standard of life.</P>
    <P>The original idea is already destroyed if a house is given to people who have lived for a couple of years in a flat or in a room.  The number of people involved is very small, and so I think we should try to keep to the original idea and not spoil it by any compromise. We are not giving a house on merit to these newly-weds.  If we were, we would give it to the largest family.  We are giving it purely as an experiment and as a gesture.  Therefore, I think the corporation are entitled to lay down conditions.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of the subsidies granted from the Exchequer to local authorities for the building of houses, I agree entirely that the present system should be reconsidered. I think it should be on the basis that the subsidy would be paid to the local authority for the provision of houses and not where the families going into the houses come from.  I think it can <Col N="658" /> be taken for granted that a local authority will deal with the allocation of houses in a responsible manner.  It is not going to give a house to a family that is not entitled to one.  Once a local authority builds houses to meet the real needs of the families within its jurisdiction it should be entitled, in my opinion, to this financial aid from the Central Government, and should not be restrained by the rigid definitions at present laid down, definitions which are creating difficulties for local authorities and real hardship for many families in the sense that if the local authorities help them the subsidy will not be available.</P>
    <P>Finally, may I suggest in regard to the planning of new schemes that we should try and avoid the terrible mistakes that were made during the war in regard, say, to the layout of big schemes such as those at Crumlin and Drimnagh?  It seems to me an outrageous thing to take tens of thousands of families out to those areas and leave them there, isolated and derelict, without either a shop, telephone or any of the amenities that are now regarded as necessary even in the simplest form of civilised life.  In these areas you have large circular patches of ground in the middle of the houses which are an eyesore.  It was understood that this ground was to be laid out as parks or playgrounds but it is still there, many years after the schemes have been completed.  Nobody knows if there is any intention of doing anything about it or not.</P>
    <P>Personally, I think that these schemes should be planned on a smaller basis.  From the very beginning the people should know that if they are going to be moved out from the city that they are not going to be moved out to a desert, with no shops or other amenities available.  I do not know whether there should be &ldquo;pubs&rdquo; or cinemas, but at least there should be the ordinary amenities of civilised life.  There should be telephone facilities and we should not have the experience we had some years ago of families having to travel two or more miles to a telephone to call a doctor. That is something that should not take place.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="659" /> I suggest to the Minister that it would be desirable to plan a smaller scheme, one which would be complete not only so far as local amenities are concerned&mdash;shops, play centres, public libraries and dispensaries&mdash;but one that would be built by direct labour, and one in which there would be some form of organised medical and health care undertaken by some of our experts in child welfare here in the city. Not only should the scheme be planned on lines to enables families to live under decent housing conditions but there should be opportunities available to enable them to live a decent life from the moment they went into the scheme. They should know from that moment that there was to be a completely organised system for the benefit of themselves and their families so far as our present dispensary and child-welfare systems could provide it.</P>
    <P>I am aware that there are a number of public-spirited people in the city who interested themselves in the past in this question of housing development and child-welfare.  They have already indicated that they would like to be associated with an official scheme such as I have suggested.  They would like to be closely associated with those families and their children, to get to know their case histories, their health problems and to be associated with the building up of a real community&mdash; the community to be not only well housed but well fed, so far as we can do that by providing employment, and their children to be looked after by trained experts.  Schools would have to be provided with the other amenities one expects in a well laid out scheme. All that would be carried out on a cooperative basis between the Dublin Corporation, the men actually engaged in building the houses and by men and women of experience in health matters who would, I understand, give their assistance voluntarily and who are interested in the civic welfare of the city.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasBrennan" hpid="Mr. T. Brennan Mr. T. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The housing question has come in for a great deal of discussion on this Estimate.  I have been connected with the building industry for a great number of years, <Col N="660" /> and, having listened to a number of Deputies speak here to-day I feel inclined to say to them: &ldquo;Well, you do not know as much as, possibly, you think you know about this particular industry.&rdquo; One would imagine, listening to some of the speeches made from the Government Benches, that Fianna Fáil had done nothing during their period of office to counteract this festering sore of lack of housing throughout the country.  One speaker stated it as a fact that Fianna Fáil had done nothing.  Others, by innuendo, suggested that they had taken no steps to deal with the problem. We all know that from 1933 until 1939 100,000 houses had been built or reconstructed.  But for the emergency, when essential materials were not available, that rate of progress would have been maintained.  Taking the five or six years pre-1939 and the progress made during that period, one can state without fear of contradiction that, had the emergency not intervened, the housing problem would have been solved by the time Fianna Fáil went out of office.  It would certainly have been solved in the country, whatever about the City of Dublin Even there I think it would have been very near solution.  When the emergency ceased Fianna Fáil got into stride again and urged on the public bodies to continue with the housing schemes that had been held up.  I do not wish for one moment to detract from anything the present Minister is doing or anything that his predecessor, the late Mr. Murphy did; but from the time that this Government took over office they must admit that the housing programme carried out was a programme which had been initiated by Fianna Fáil.  All credit to the present Minister and to the late Minister for the houses that have been erected during the past 16 months.  Yet, we hear quite a number of Deputies complain that progress is too slow.  The reason for the slowness is said to be due to scarcity of skilled labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told that progress in building construction hinges solely on the skilled labour available to carry out the work.  During the emergency, because of the fact that building materials were not available, a good deal of skilled <Col N="661" /> labour crossed to England.  I was under the impression that that skilled labour was still in England until I heard Deputy Larkin state that there was a very big proportion of skilled labour in the building industry.  I was more than surprised to hear him say that more skilled men are employed in building in Dublin at the present time &mdash;I think he went so far as to say 100 per cent. more, though I am not sure of that&mdash;than were employed in 1939. Progress in housing depends on the skilled labour available.  If what Deputy Larkin said is true as to the number of skilled workers in the country at the present time I fail to see where there is cause for worry.  Let me quote again the figures for houses, both new and reconstructed, in the years 1934 to 1939.  So far as the country as a whole is concerned I am not in a position to state the actual number of houses required.  I understand that somewhere in the region of 24,000 houses are needed in Dublin.  In my constituency we are at present engaged on a house-building scheme which entails something up to 450 houses.  We got our responsible officers to compute the number of houses that would be needed in addition to the 450 to house the rural community in Wicklow and, from the claims made by potential occupiers, it was decided that a further 200 houses would be required.</P>
    <P>I will not speak of the urban areas, but I know that this matter has been tackled in the three urban districts. Outside the City of Dublin, where there is an abnormal position so far as housing is concerned, I do not see why there should be any worry about the building of houses within a reasonable time.  As regards the suggestion thrown out by my colleague, Deputy Butler, I think that was made an actual proposition.  I refer to the invitation to the workers who are on the other side of the Channel to come home on the strength of being provided with a house.  I think, looking at the building industry and visualising the situation that is likely to arise in a few years, they are probably wise men.  They realise that they have continuity of employment on the other side and they have no guarantee of continuity of employment if they come here.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="662" /> I do not think there is any need for worry, if we except the position in Dublin City.  I would also except the City of Cork and other large centres of population, but outside these three or four places I think there is nothing to worry about, so far as the number of skilled workers and the housing needs of the people being met within a reasonable period, are concerned.</P>
    <P>The cost of housing was referred to and perhaps I could couple with that the question of direct labour versus contract.  I am a contractor and I would be prepared to pit my brains against the direct labour method of building houses any day.  I would be prepared to compete with it.  I am a member of a public body and last week, as a member of the housing committee of that public body, I sat to consider tenders from contractors for the erection of houses for agricultural workers. I am sorry Deputy Davin is not here. He has a stereotyped statement about one famous contract price.  He talks of the estimate for the building of a number of houses under which the contractor wanted 500 per cent. on 1939 rates.  To my mind that is absurd.  I maintain that these tenders to which I have referred&mdash;and none of them was abnormal&mdash;will compare favourably with the price of any house erected under direct labour method.  There may be a few pounds one way or the other.  Anyhow, that will settle the suggestion that building contractors were making those fabulous profits that we have heard so much about.</P>
    <P>In my county the direct labour method was initiated some years ago and, as a result of the efficient work that was carried out, the late Minister for Local Government decided that he would follow the method adopted by the particular engineer who was responsible for starting direct labour.  We received a memorandum from the Minister paying a great tribute to the people in County Wicklow who were responsible for direct labour.  I understand that the same memorandum was sent to every other county council in the Twenty-Six Counties.  Accompanying the memorandum was a statement showing how the work was carried out, <Col N="663" /> both from the administrative and the practical ends.</P>
    <P>Those people, and I must say the county manager also, became so keen on the direct labour method of housing that they intended and in fact did their best to ensure that every cottage or house to be erected would be erected by the direct labour method.  I must say that in a certain portion of the county, where it did not suit the responsible engineer to carry out the work by direct labour, he was prepared to offer a certain number of cottages for contract but he overlooked the fact that in the memorandum sent out by the late Minister, he suggested, in urging on the public body to carry out the erection of houses by direct labour, that in order to ensure that the work would be carried out as speedily as possible it should be correlated with the contract method.  I might mention that I had to bring to the notice of the late Minister himself the fact that no houses were being offered for contract, that is, that it was arranged that they were all to be carried out by direct labour. I had to bring it to his notice before any steps were taken by those concerned, either the county engineer or the county manager, to offer any of the houses for contract.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer briefly to the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act which seems to be a bugbear to most people here this evening.  Almost every speaker referred to the question of the amount of money that an individual is obliged to put up himself in order to get a grant and other facilities to enable him to proceed with the building of a house.  I presume that most individuals referred to by speakers here were what we term white-collar workers or artisans of some sort but those to whom I wish to refer are small farmers.  The farmer I have in mind need not necessarily be a very small farmer, a farmer in occupation of 30, 40 or 50 acres of land, living in a thatched house which does not provide proper accommodation for a man with a family.  That man has probably five or six in the family.  He has some money sunk in stock and he may have also a <Col N="664" /> little capital to work on.  He is anxious to build a new house but he eventually finds that in order to build that house, he may not alone have to sink a little of his working capital in the project but may also have to sell off some of his stock to provide his share of the money necessary to finance the building of the house.  I take it that the average farmer who would be in need of such a house would require to have £200 or £250 to put down himself in order to ensure that he would have a decent house, apart altogether from the amount of the annuity he would have to pay to meet the sinking fund and interest on the loan he had received.  I think every effort should be made by the Minister to try to meet that section of the community.</P>
    <P>These are people we should like to see housed in decency but a man such as I describe, living on 40, 45 or 50 acres of land, cannot afford to take advantage of the grants and facilities provided because of the fact that he has to sink his working capital and perhaps realise some of his stock in order to find the necessary money. That man may have working for him an agricultural labourer, or he may see an agricultural labourer working on an adjoining farm.  The agricultural labourer is provided with a good house on that man's land or on the adjoining farm and he is enabled to bring up his family in comfort and decency.  The farmer finds that he has to pay a certain amount of money, representing so much in the £ on the rates, to provide the agricultural labourer with a house while he himself has to remain in the old shack, the thatched house.  There is no way out unless he is prepared to sink his capital and dispossess himself of the money necessary to carry on his work as a farmer.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider that case with a view to devising some steps whereby those people would be relieved of that heavy responsibility, so as to ensure that the amount they would have to put up would be lessened to a considerable extent and thus obviate the possibility of their being placed in a bad financial position as a result of having to build houses for themselves.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="665" /> There is just one other matter to which I would like to refer, the question of water supply and sewerage.  I am afraid that there is undue delay in the Department in giving the necessary sanction to carry out these schemes. I have in mind one particular scheme in County Wicklow, the Aughrim Water Scheme.  I think it must be seven or eight months since plans were supplied to the Department and the Department or the Minister did not agree that the plans, which provided for a certain number of residents, were necessary in so far as it was held that the number of people who resided in that small town were far fewer than the number provided for in the plans.  I think that the Department may not have been altogether correct in computing the number of people in the area.  People who ought to know stated that the figures given by the Department were not correct.  I understand quite well that a mistake can be made, but anyway that was six, seven or eight months ago and no matter what change had to be made in the plans, surely it should not take that length of time to receive the sanction of those responsible in the Department.  A sewerage scheme in the same area is also waiting.  There is no use in talking about a sewerage scheme until such time as the water supply is installed.  I hope that those responsible in the Department will give immediate consideration to those plans so that sanction can be given and that this all-important water supply scheme which the people of the district need so badly can be put into operation.</P>
    <P>On the question of sewerage, may I say also that there is a tendency in County Wicklow to introduce the direct labour method into the execution of such works?  I know one such scheme anyway.  While I am not going to enter deeply into the matter here to-night, I hope to have something to say about it in another place.  I presume that the type of materials and sections must have been sent up and sanctioned, but I do not believe that the Department officials or the engineers responsible would be a party to using the grade of materials such as pipes that have <Col N="666" /> been used on that supplementary sewerage job.</P>
    <P>No matter what speakers on the Government Benches may say, there is no doubt that the cutting of the road grant did mean and will mean a certain amount of unemployment.</P>

      <P>There will be unemployment&mdash;and there is&mdash;as a result of the cut.  It is said that the work under the Local Authorities (Works) Bill is an alternative to the cutting of the grants.  Some of the Ministers on the opposite side stated this year that they preferred to use money on cleaning up the rivers, etc., than to use it on roads.  We had Deputy Larkin to-night paying great tribute to the state of the roads at the moment.  I see roads in the southern portion of County Wicklow being repaired at present and, in my opinion, it would be a cheaper job to resurface the whole road than to carry out the type of surfacing that is being done there now on that particular section.</P>

Whether this Works Bill will meet the situation which is bound to obtain after the 1st July is another matter. The grants will have run out then, with the exception of a few that are being kept on.

      <P>I want to join with the previous speakers who wished the new Minister for Local Government every success in his efforts to meet the difficulties confronting his office at the present time.  I think it is fair to say there is no other Department faced with a more difficult task than that facing this Minister with regard to the improvement of the housing situation. We are lucky in having a Minister of his calibre, a man who is familiar with local government for such a long period. I have no doubt that, from his vast reservoir of experience, he will bring fruitful results in the office which he now holds.</P>
      <P>There are difficulties confronting the Department, arising in great measure from certain neglect during the past ten years.  Deputy Brennan, playing the tune we have heard so often, told the Minister the plans were there when this Government came into office and that all they had to do was let the machine run its own way.  So far as County Dublin is concerned, I can say that there was no machine there and no plans there to provide houses for the people in the county.  In fact, the accomplishment of Fianna Fáil for the past eight years was the erection of seven council houses.  Three of those years elapsed since the ending of the war.  It must be realised that many houses described as luxury houses were erected since the war concluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry that the rates in County Dublin rose so sharply, but I am inclined to blame certain neglect on the part of the late Administration for <Col N="669" /> that.  There was a need for houses in County Dublin in 1938 and 1939 beyond what was provided.  Sites could have been acquired then at a very much lower price than now.</P>
