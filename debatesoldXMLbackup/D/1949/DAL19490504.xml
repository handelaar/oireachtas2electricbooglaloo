      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if his statement in closing the debate on the Gaeltacht Services Estimate had reference to the sales of Round Tower hand-woven tweed; and, if not, whether he will make a statement clarifying the position pending the reopening of the homespun market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>On reading over the account of my closing speech on the Estimate for Gaeltacht Services, I find that I may have unwittingly given the impression that the market for Round Tower hand-woven tweed as distinct from homespuns was highly unsatisfactory. That is not the case.  The prospects for the Round Tower hand-woven tweeds are reasonably bright and contacts with foreign markets have already yielded satisfactory initial results. Orders have been received from the United States, Great Britain, Australia, South Africa, the Netherlands, France and Belgium.  As much employment as possible is being provided for weavers in their homes and for workers in the spinning mill in connection with the production of the requirements of the Round Tower hand-woven tweed industry.</P>
      <P>The homespun tweed industry is in a different position but negotiations are in progress to find a market abroad and there has been no relaxing of efforts in the home market.  The Deputy will be glad to know that even in the short period since the debate on the Estimate for Gaeltacht Services the outlook for the homespun industry has considerably brightened.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if, in view of his statement published in the poultry pamphlet <i>P.E.P.</i>, for May, 1948, in which he guaranteed 3/- per dozen for eggs and stated that increased supplies would command higher prices, he will explain how higher production has, in fact, resulted in reduced prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon) James M. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy refers to a message from myself published in the May issue of <i>P.E.P.</i></P>
      <P>If this assumption is correct, the Deputy, on giving the statement closer attention, will observe that it contains no guarantee of 3/- per dozen for eggs, but that it does mention that the price of a hundred of eggs is 2/- higher than the price of a cwt. of Indian meal. That favourable differential still obtains and I hope will continue to obtain.</P>
      <P>In regard to the Deputy's perplexity as to my assurance that increased supplies of eggs would result in the producer getting higher prices than if supplies were dwindling, I assume he is adverting to the following paragraph:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It used to be the rule that when egg supplies increased the price went down.  That is no longer true.  We have made an agreement with the British Ministry of Food that the more eggs we send to the British market the more they will pay for our eggs.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The gratifying realisation of this anticipation has been fully described in a letter addressed by me on the 14th April, 1949, to each county committee of agriculture in Ireland, and I am sending the Deputy a copy of that letter, and, with the Ceann Comhairle's permission, I shall arrange to have it printed in the Official Report as an annexe to this reply.</P>
      <P>Following is the letter:&mdash;</P>
      <P Just="Right">14th April, 1949.</P>
      <P Just="Center">EGG PRICES IN 1949 AND 1950.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dear Sir,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reports reaching my Department indicate that serious and widespread misrepresentations are being made in <Col N="463" /> regard to the effect on egg prices of the agreement concluded this year with the British Ministry of Food.</P>
    <P>The object of these misrepresentations may be to undermine the confidence of poultry-keepers in the future of their industry by instilling into their minds the erroneous notion that the recent agreement is disadvantageous to the producer.  In view of the importance of egg production to the country in general and to small farmers in particular, it is necessary to set the facts before the county committees of agriculture so that egg producers may be in no doubt as to how they stand for the next two years and what the position would have been if the 1947 agreement had not been replaced by the new contract.</P>
    <P>Soon after assuming office as Minister for Agriculture I examined the egg agreement then in operation and found it was a good one as far as 1948 was concerned but not so good for the years 1949 and 1950.  The prices payable by the Ministry of Food for 1949 would have been sufficient to provide for producers 2/10 per dozen <i>for a limited quantity</i> and 2/4 per dozen for any exports in excess of that quantity, while the price for 1950 would have yielded only 1/5 per dozen.  The 1950 price was stated to be a minimum price, which might or might not be increased as a result of negotiations, but there was no reason to assume that an increase would be forthcoming.  In any case, the different prices payable for 1949 and the uncertainty in regard to 1950 would prove so disconcerting to poultry-keepers that production would be bound to suffer.  I, therefore, <Col N="464" /> had the matter reopened with a view to having all uncertainties removed and definite prices settled for 1949 and 1950, <i>without any limitation as to the quantities</i> to which the new price would apply.</P>
    <P>The difference in prices during 1949 (2/10 and 2/4) under the old agreement arose out of the provision by the Ministry of Food of a maximum sum of £1,350,000 to be paid by way of bonus at the rate of 5/- per great hundred on eggs supplied to the Ministry during 1948 and subsequent years.  The bonus would apply to exports up to 5,400,000 great hundreds and would then cease.  Exports in 1948 amounted to 2,200,000 great hundreds, so that the bonus of 5/-would be available for 3,200,000 great hundreds in the following years. Exports from the beginning of 1949 to the 6th April were 76 per cent. higher than in the corresponding period of 1948.  If this big increase in exports were maintained throughout 1949 the bounty payment would be exhausted before the end of June.  Even assuming that the increase after 6th April would not be as high as 76 per cent., but would drop to, say, 50 per cent., the bonus payment would come to an end in July, after which the price payable would be equivalent to 2/4 per dozen to producers.</P>
    <P>As a result of the agreement reached with the Ministry of Food this year, the prices fixed for exports in 1949 and 1950 are such that producers are guaranteed 2/6 per dozen for all the eggs they market in these years, irrespective of quantity.  How this compares with the earlier agreement can be seen from the following table:&mdash;</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="465" /> It will be observed that, apart from the great advantage of having prices guaranteed for two years ahead, the cash value of the difference between the 1947 and 1949 agreements is £1,788,750 in favour of the latter&mdash; that is to say, our producers will receive that amount for their egg exports in 1949 and 1950 over and above what they would have received under the 1947 agreement.  Moreover, since the home price is regulated to a large extent by export price, there will be a corresponding benefit to producers on eggs sold by them for domestic consumption.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I may say that I intend before the expiry of the present year to negotiate with the Ministry of Food the price to be paid for egg exports in 1951 in order that early in 1950 I may again be in a position to inform producers what their price will be for two years ahead of that time.</P>

      <P>I have before me a copy of the message sent by the Minister to this journal <i>P.E.P.</i>, in which the Minister says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We have an agreement with the British Government, that the more eggs we send to the British market, the more they will pay for our eggs.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;As a result of this agreement shippers can afford to pay 3/- per dozen for eggs to producers.&rdquo;  Every poultry producer naturally inferred from that statement that the guaranteed price of 3/- per dozen would continue unless supplies were reduced.  If supplies increased, the natural inference from that statement was that the price would increase.  Therefore, I think that the Minister did mislead producers very gravely in this matter.</P>

      <P>If I am to interpret that as a supplementary statement&mdash;it seems more like an obscurantist comment&mdash;I would direct the Deputy's attention to the fact that he has overlooked the preceding paragraph of that message which emphasised the fact <Col N="466" /> that so long as eggs were fetching a price per long hundred in excess of the price of Indian meal per cwt. the production of eggs was designed to yield a profit.  I have pointed out to the Deputy that although the prices of eggs has been reduced by 5/- per long hundred, the price of Indian meal has been reduced by a rather larger sum per cwt., and the result of this adjustment and of the new agreement that has been made is that whereas under the old agreement which obtained egg shipments for 1949-50 would have yielded producers £7,825,000, under the new agreement the same shipments of eggs will yield the producer £9,612,000. Now if £9,612,000 is not more money than £7,825,000 then the Deputy and I had better go back to school.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the existing accommodation for cancer patients is inadequate. I understand, however, that expert medical opinion inclines to the view that the main deficiency in our cancer services lies in the inadequacy of our diagnostic and treatment facilities rather than in a shortage of beds.  A special council was set up by me last year to examine the cancer problem.  I have been informed that the council is considering in the light of expert advice and experience gained elsewhere the best means of dealing on a national basis with every aspect of the cancer problem in this country and I expect that the question of the provision of a special cancer centre will be dealt with in the report of the council, as well as such questions as the provision of expert personnel and up-to-date equipment to operate whatever type of service may be recommended.  The report of the council, which is expected in a few weeks when received, will be considered by me with the minimum of delay.</P>
      <P>As regards clinics, I think that in view of the specialised nature of cancer treatment, it would not be practicable to have anything more than diagnostic work undertaken in them. In this matter also future policy must depend on the type of organisation which may ultimately be set up to deal with the whole problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year I was confronted with Estimates for Central Fund and Supply Services totalling £77,329,000.  Against this, receipts from tax and non-tax revenue were estimated to amount to £68,598,000, leaving an estimated deficit of £8,731,000.  To avoid recourse to heavy additional taxation to meet this deficit and in accordance with the previously <Col N="469" /> announced Government policy of ensuring retrenchment over as wide a field as possible, I adopted a number of measures with the details of which the House is already familiar.  The Estimates of supply expenditure were reduced by £6,646,000 in respect of economies which were considered to be warranted and of adjustments in food subsidies.  Allowing for a reduction of £800,000 representing the capital element of certain items charged to borrowing and for an addition of £600,000 for the improved social services, which I announced in the Budget, I was still left with an estimated deficit of £1,885,000.</P>
      <P>The shortening of the period allowed for payment of beer duty, the expected revival of the wine trade consequent on the lifting of portion of the duty, and the raising of the duties on petrol and oil together with an appropriation from the Road Fund, were calculated to bring in an additional £1,910,000, producing a modest surplus of £25,000.</P>
      <P>In the event the surplus realised on a comparable basis was £98,000.  Central Fund and Supply Services cost £71,943,431 or £660,431 more than the revised Budget Estimate.  A sum of £9,860,000 was paid out in flour subsidy as against the Budget provision of £7,134,000.  The amount to be deducted for items charged to borrowing was considerably less than anticipated. These variations from the Budget Estimates of Expenditure were, however, more than offset by the fact that revenue payments proved to be higher than anticipated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tax revenue brought in a total of £62,403,000 which was £833,000 more than I budgeted for.  On the customs side the Estimate was exceeded under a number of heads principally tobacco (£1,100,000) and motor cars, parts and accessories (£160,000).  The Estimate figures were not, however, reached in some other groups, mainly wine, which was £330,000 less than expected.  Excise duties, as a whole, showed a net improvement on the Estimate due largely to the buoyancy of the spirits and entertainments duties, the increases over the Estimates being in these two cases £430,000 and £115,000, respectively.  On <Col N="470" /> betting there was an increase of £80,000 over the Estimate and small increases occurred under a number of other heads.  On the other hand beer duty was £400,000 below the Budget Estimate. Inland revenue maintained the upward trend noticeable in previous years, income-tax and surtax together being £1,551,000 over the Budget Estimate.</P>

    <Title>Financial Statement.   Budget, 1949. - Financial Year, 1949-50.</Title>
    <P>Turning to this year, the expenditure on Supply Services is estimated at £65,406,570 or £768,476 more than was actually spent last year.  Central Fund Services are to cost £7,728,430 which is £423,093 more than last year's issues. The two groups of services total £73,135,000.  The estimated receipt from non-tax revenue is £8,560,000 and from tax revenue, on the basis of the rates at present in force, £64,790,000. The receipts from both sources, at £73,350,000 are £215,000 more than the estimated expenditure.  Provision has, however, to be made for additional items of expenditure totalling £676,000. These include increases in Garda pay (£261,000), pension increases for retired teachers, police and civil servants (£208,000) and additional grants under recent legislation for Gaeltacht housing (£15,000).  The effect of these additions is to convert the original surplus of £215,000 into a deficit of £461,000, which will be reduced to £161,000 by a contribution of £300,000&mdash;the same as last year&mdash;from the Road Fund.  In addition, a deduction of £600,000 falls to be made from the Supply Services for items of a capital or abnormal nature. This not only clears the deficit but gives a surplus of £439,000.  This surplus is increased to £769,000 by an adjustment to be made in the provision for flour subsidy.  I have reviewed, in the light of the fall in wheat import prices, the arrangement for averaging the cost of flour subsidy over a five-year period which was explained in the Budget Statement last year.  The result is that the provision appropriate to the current year is £6,451,000, or £330,000 less than the amount provided in the Estimates.</P>
    <P>With the aid of the surplus of £769,000 I propose to make a number of changes in taxation which, on <Col N="471" /> balance, will be of considerable benefit to the taxpayer.</P>
    <P Just="Center">INCOME TAX AND CORPORATION PROFITS TAX.</P>
    <P>I propose to reduce the standard rate of income-tax by 6d, in the £.  The cost of this concession will be £750,000 in the present year and £1,000,000 in a full year.</P>
    <P>I propose to increase the dependent relative allowance under the Income Tax Acts from £25 to £50, at a cost to the Exchequer of £80,000 in 1949-50 and £135,000 a year thereafter.</P>
    <P>I propose also that the housekeeper allowance be increased from £45 to £100, at a cost of £8,000 in 1949-50 and of £13,000 in a full year.</P>
    <P>Under the present income-tax code a child allowance is granted in respect of a year of assessment only if the child is living at the commencement of that year.  Provision will be made for the granting of the allowance if the child is alive at any time during the year of assessment.  The cost of this relief will be £40,000 this year and in a full year £65,000.</P>
    <P>In charging the profits of a trader under Schedule D of the Income Tax Acts an allowance is made for depreciation during the year of any machinery or plant used for the purposes of the trade.  A number of years ago this wear and tear allowance was extended to persons carrying on professions or vocations chargeable under the same Schedule.  I now propose to apply it to persons chargeable under Schedule E.  Commercial travellers and others who use their own motor cars in the exercise of their employment will benefit by this provision which will cost £8,000 this year.</P>
    <P>Where appeals in tax cases reach the courts, it has, over a period of some 20 years, been the practice to have the proceedings held <i>in camera</i> if the taxpayer so desires.  The adequacy of the existing legislative authority for this practice has recently been called in question.  It is my intention, by a section in the Finance Bill, to put beyond doubt the taxpayer's right in this matter.  The section will cover appeals against assessments to income-tax, to surtax and to corporation profits tax.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="472" /> When a company pays corporation profits tax it is entitled to a deduction in respect of that tax in computing its income-tax liability.  The manner in which the provision authorising this deduction was interpreted was unquestioned for almost 30 years but has been upset by a recent court decision.  It is proposed to restore by legislation the established and accepted basis on which the deduction was heretofore granted.</P>
    <P>A Minister for Finance cannot view with detachment the ingenuity which searches for and avails itself of accidental flaws in revenue legislation. Legal evasion shifts inequitably the burden of charge and, if allowed to grow unchecked, might impair to a serious extent the yield of taxation. A way has lately been found through long-established provisions which were designed to prevent tax liability being evaded by means of certain dispositions or settlements.  I intend, in the Finance Bill, to remedy the matter.</P>
    <P>The agreement in respect of double income-tax, concluded between the Irish and the British Governments in 1926 and confirmed by Finance Act in that year, provided broadly that a person resident in the one country, and not resident in the other, would be chargeable to income-tax only in the country of residence.  This agreement &mdash;usually called the &ldquo;residence agreement&rdquo;&mdash;is limited in scope to income-tax and surtax and, accordingly, it does not cover the profits taxes payable by companies, by which I mean corporation profits tax here and the British tax known as profits tax.</P>
    <P>Thus an Irish company having a branch in Great Britain is chargeable to profits tax in Great Britain on profits arising there and at the same time it is chargeable in Ireland to corporation profits tax on all its profits wherever arising.  The company is liable in consequence to pay double taxation on a portion of its profits.</P>
    <P>The revenue authorities of this country have been in touch with the British revenue authorities with a view to arranging for reciprocal relief in respect of corporation profits tax and profits tax.  It is expected that an agreement between the two countries will be signed at an early date.  The <Col N="473" /> proposed agreement will secure broadly that profits tax paid in Great Britain will be allowed as a credit against corporation profits tax and that, in the case of the British company operating here, the Irish tax will be allowed as a credit against the British tax.  It is intended that the agreement will be confirmed by the Finance Bill, which will also contain the provisions necessary to give effect to it so far as this country is concerned.</P>
    <P>Negotiations have for some time past been in progress between Ireland and the United States of America which, it is hoped, will result in conventions for the avoidance, as between the two countries, of double taxation on income and on the estates of deceased persons. It is, however, unlikely that these proposed conventions will be entered into in time to be dealt with in the forthcoming Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 31 of the Finance Act, 1928, provided in effect that, as compared with the rate of corporation profits tax for a company incorporated in Ireland, an additional rate of 2½ per cent. should be chargeable on profits of a foreign company.  The section enacted, however, that the lower rate should be applied to a foreign company if it maintained here a branch register of its shareholders resident in this country. The idea of the legislation was to secure compensation for the loss of death duties which would arise on the death of a person domiciled in Ireland who possessed shares in a foreign company trading here which had not established a branch register.  Of late, other countries have represented in negotiation that this is discriminatory taxation. While I do not necessarily assent to this view, I recognise that the case for the differential tax is not so compelling as it originally was, most of the principal companies involved having by now set up branch registers here. Accordingly, I am proposing that the section be terminated with effect as from the 1st January, 1949, from which date profits of a foreign company will be chargeable to corporation profits tax at the rate applicable to the profits of home companies.</P>
    <P Just="Center">WINE.</P>
    <P>The yield from the duty on wine has <Col N="474" /> fallen short of expectations.  It is now clear that the fourfold increase imposed in 1946 and 1947 has injured the trade to an extent even greater than was represented a year ago, and that the relief afforded in last year's Finance Act, which removed three-fourths of the additional burden deriving from the Supplementary Budget of 1947, has not proved a sufficient remedy.  I am informed that, owing to the decline in consumption, there is a real danger of unemployment and on this ground, as well as in the hope of stimulating the revenue, I propose to remove the remaining fourth of the Supplementary Budget impost except as regards sparkling wines.  This will restore the rates which were operative under the Finance Act, 1946.  It is expected that the additional yield of revenue for the current year will be £30,000.  The change will take effect immediately.</P>
    <P Just="Center">PREFERENTIAL RATE OF DUTY ON UNMANUFACTURED TOBACCO.</P>
    <P>In the interest of European economic co-operation and to save dollar expenditure, I have found it necessary to direct the attention of tobacco manufacturers to the possibility of obtaining part of their supplies of leaf from countries outside the dollar area.  The principal source of such supply would be Rhodesia, but the cost of leaf from that country is about 1/6½ per lb. more than the cost of Virginian leaf.  I, therefore, propose, as an inducement to manufacturers, that this differential in price should be adjusted by granting a preferential rate, 1/6½ per lb. less than the present full rate, to tobacco grown in the British Commonwealth. This will involve a corresponding reduction in the excise duty chargeable on home-grown tobacco.  The necessary provision will be made in the Finance Bill to take effect as from the passing of the Bill.  The cost of the concession is estimated to be £16,000 in the current year and £18,000 in a full year.</P>
    <P Just="Center">POWER METHYLATED SPIRITS.</P>
    <P>Under Section 11 of the Finance Act, 1920, and Section 15 of Finance Act, 1921, an allowance of 5d. per proof gallon is payable to a methylator in <Col N="475" /> respect of home-made spirits used in making power methylated spirits.  This allowance is in part compensation for the extra cost of manufacture due to excise restrictions and in part a preference in favour of home-made spirits. As regards the alcohol factories operated by Ceimicí Teoranta&mdash;a State-owned company&mdash;the method of working has enabled these excise restrictions to be modified to an extreme degree.  Further, these factories are not only the sole producers of power methylated spirits in this country but under the provisions of the Industrial Alcohol Act, 1938, have special powers in relation to the disposal of the product. In these circumstances, there is no good reason for continuing the payment of the allowance of 5d. per proof gallon on spirits used for making power methylated spirits.  I propose that the allowance be withdrawn as from 1st October next.  The saving this year is estimated at £27,000 and in a full year at £55,000.</P>
    <P Just="Center">FIREARMS CERTIFICATES.</P>
    <P>The present rates of duty on firearms certificates were fixed in 1925.  I propose that the rates, some of which are exceedingly low, should be increased with effect as from the commencement of the next licensing year, i.e., 1st August, 1949.  The estimated additional yield of revenue will be about £30,000 per annum.</P>
    <P Just="Center">REPEAL OF DUTY ON HYDROCARBON OIL USED IN ROAD ROLLERS.</P>
    <P>I propose to ask the Dáil to amend a provision in the law by which the Revenue Commissioners are obliged to charge duty on diesel oil used in road rollers&mdash;chiefly by county councils.  The cost of this concession will be about £6,500 in the current year or £8,500 in a full year.</P>
    <P Just="Center">NEWS-REEL FILMS.</P>
    <P>Representations have been made to me that the duty on news-reel films should be abolished.  During the war the operation of censorship presented difficulties in the importation of these films, and importation ultimately ceased.  A shortage of celluloid was <Col N="476" /> also a determining factor.  These difficulties are now removed, but it is claimed that the distribution of news-reels in this country was never a paying proposition and that with increased costs of production it would now be even less so.  I am impressed by the fact that this country is in the unique position that no news-reels are shown here.  Although they contain much of only minor interest, news-reels also deal with events of international and occasionally of national importance. For some years no duty has been received on news-reels and in so far as the import duty may be a bar to their importation I am disposed to ease matters by removing it.</P>
    <P Just="Center">ENTERTAINMENTS DUTY-RURAL AREAS.</P>
    <P>Last year I promised, without making any definite commitment, that I would examine the possibility of affording relief from entertainments duty in respect of entertainments held in purely rural areas.  For all practical purposes the only entertainments held in these areas which are subject to duty are cinema shows and ciné-variety performances. They are operated either by resident exhibitors or by mobile film units, and it has been represented to me that the promoters find it extremely difficult to meet expenses, and that any profits are extremely meagre.  There is no doubt that these entertainments do much to brighten life in rural areas and I propose, therefore, to recommend to the Dáil that duty shall not be charged in respect of any entertainment held in a place which is not situate in, or within three miles of, a county or other borough, an urban district or a town of over 500 population. This will afford total exemption from entertainments duty in most places where the population does not exceed 500.  The concession will take effect as from 1st June next, and will cost about £21,000 this year and £25,000 in a full year.</P>
    <P Just="Center">ENTERTAINMENTS DUTY-DANCES.</P>
    <P>Entertainments duty on dances was abolished by Section 13 of the Finance Act, 1946.  It is doubtful whether any <Col N="477" /> substantial proportion of this relief accrued to the public and I see no reason why this form of entertainment should escape its contribution to the public revenue.  Accordingly, I propose to restore the duty as from 1st July next.  The increased yield of revenue in the present year will be £110,000 and £150,000 in a full year.  As in the case of other entertainments the charge in respect of dances will not apply in most centres with a population of less than 500.</P>
    <P Just="Center">STATUTORY DEFINITIONS OF IRISH WHISKEY.</P>
    <P>I have received representations from the Irish Pot Still Distillers' Association urging that the terms &ldquo;Irish Whiskey&rdquo; and &ldquo;Irish Pot Still Whiskey&rdquo; should be legally defined as the absence of such definitions constitutes a handicap in the export market. They pointed out that Scotch Whisky was defined in the British Finance Act, 1933, and were anxious that similar provisions should be embodied in this year's Finance Bill.  I have agreed to this proposal, and the necessary provision will, accordingly, be made in the Bill.</P>
    <P Just="Center">ESTATE DUTY.</P>
    <P>Estate duty is chargeable on money received under a policy of assurance effected by the deceased in his lifetime where the policy is wholly kept up by him for the benefit of a donee, or part of such money where the policy is partly so kept up by him.  In some cases the person effecting the policy assigns it to trustees for the benefit of a donee and at the same time provides a trust fund out of the income of which the premiums are paid.  It has been the practice to treat the policy moneys in such cases as liable to estate duty. Doubt has been cast on the validity of the practice and I propose to include a section in the Finance Bill to remove that doubt.</P>
    <P>Prior to 1924 <i>inter-vivos</i> gifts made for public or charitable purposes were liable to estate duty only if made within 12 months before the death of the donor.  In 1924 provision was made to keep within charge to estate duty <i>intervivos</i> gifts of foreign property made <Col N="478" /> within three years before the death of the donor but inadvertently the provision was made to apply to gifts for public or charitable purposes as well as to other gifts.  The effect is that <i>inter-vivos</i> gifts of Irish property for public or charitable purposes are liable to estate duty only if made within 12 months before the date of death while similar gifts of foreign property are so liable if made within three years before the date of death.  I propose to bring in a section to remove the comparative hardship which accordingly arises in the case of such <i>inter-vivos</i> gifts of foreign property.</P>
    <P>Up to 1941 estate duty could have been evaded by the disposition of property in favour of a relative in consideration of an annuity for his own life or that of any other person.  As from 1941 exemption from estate duty could not be granted in such cases even though the value of the annuity was equal to or greater than the value of the property.  A case has now arisen where the value of the annuity has actually exceeded the value of the property. I intend to provide that in such cases when charging estate duty on the value of the disposed property a certain deduction shall be made.  The deduction is to be the excess, from the date of the disposition to the date of death, of the annuity payments made by the relative out of his own pocket or out of the corpus of the property over the amount of the income received by him from the property.  A further allowance will be made in respect of simple interest on the excess.</P>
    <P Just="Center">STAMP DUTIES.</P>
    <P>I intend to introduce legislation to ensure that the increased rates of stamp duties payable under the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1947, on the purchase on property will not be avoided because of the method by which a sale may be effected.  In the first place I shall propose that the amount of the fine or premium payable in consideration of a lease or sub-lease will bear duty at the same rates as those which now apply to the amount of the purchase money on a conveyance or transfer on sale as distinct from a lease.  This will remove the anomaly by which the rate <Col N="479" /> of stamp duty could be regulated by the legal procedure under which a sale was carried out.  While there are sound reasons for proposing that the increased rates of duties should have retrospective effect in all cases, it is proposed that they should not apply to certain cases where leases have been first executed before to-day.  The cases are those where leases have yet to be stamped or the £1 per cent. rate has already been paid or where appeals against assessments adjudicated at the increased rates of duty have been lodged with the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>The second matter on which legislation is proposed concerns the evasion of stamp duties by persons who, in the ordinary way, would pay at the rate of £25 per cent.  Because of certain transactions which have in some cases been introduced into the normal procedure of purchasing property, the provisions of the stamp duties applying to foreign purchasers have to an extent been defeated.  As a consequence, such purchasers have paid duty at the rate of £5 per cent. instead of £25 per cent.  Legislation will be submitted to nullify the effects for the purpose of stamp duties of such transactions.</P>
    <P Just="Center">EFFECT OF BUDGET PROPOSALS.</P>
    <P>The net effect of the various adjustments in taxation I have outlined is a net loss in revenue in the current year of £733,500, which reduces the surplus of £769,000 to the more modest figure of £33,500.  This amount, supplemented by a subsidy relief now being formulated and by other savings on the supply services generally, will, I hope, suffice to meet the liability for increased Army pay which will mature for payment during the year.</P>
    <P Just="Center">COSTS OF ADMINISTRATION.</P>
    <P>Personnel charges form a very big part of the total expenditure for which I have to budget.  Excluding superannuation, the all-in cost to the Exchequer of the Civil Service is estimated at £11.5 million; of the Garda Síochána at £2.9 million; of national teachers at £4.7 million; of <Col N="480" /> secondary teachers at £0.5 million, and of the Defence Forces at £2.5 million, making a total of £22.1 million.  Superannuation and pension charges bring this total to £24.5 million, an amount considerably more than twice the total State expenditure for all Ireland in years that many of us can remember. There is here serious cause for anxiety. Economies in costs of administration should be attainable through improvements in organisation and methods of work, and anything that can be done in that way I shall do my utmost to achieve.  It is, however, obvious that no really big saving can be secured unless a limit is set to demands for the expansion of existing and the creation of new services.</P>
    <P Just="Center">TRANSITION DEVELOPMENT FUND.</P>
    <P>By the Finance Act of 1948 the life of the Transition Development Fund was extended to 31st March, 1949.  Of the original £5,000,000 there still remained in the fund at that date approximately £3,562,000, issues during 1948-49 having amounted to £952,000.  It is proposed to prolong the fund's existence rather than wind it up now and bring this large balance into the Exchequer.  By the time the fund comes to be wound up it is hoped that building costs will have settled down sufficiently to obviate the need for such large supplements to the annual voted subventions for housing and public health services.  It is estimated that disbursements from the fund for these services in the current year will amount to £1.33 million and issues will continue to be made from the fund pending the authority of the continuation provision which will be included in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P Just="Center">CAPITAL AND OTHER ISSUES.</P>
    <P>I turn now to expenditure which has not to be covered, as it arises, by taxation but will have to be amortised by charges against revenue over a future period.  The White Paper of Receipts and Expenditure shows, under the heading &ldquo;Capital and Other Issues&rdquo;, an estimated total outlay of £12.6 million in the current year, as against £9.1 million in 1948-49.  The chief items <Col N="481" /> in this greatly expanded programme of capital expenditure are advances for electricity development (£4.75 million), advances to the Local Loans Fund for housing and public health services, etc. (£2.8 million), extension of the telephone system (£1.9 million), advances to the Road Fund for roads expenditure (£1.6 million) and advances for turf development (£1.08 million).  The money required for these purposes will have to be found by borrowing, the charge for interest and redemption being borne annually by the taxpayer, who cannot expect equivalent relief in the form of a return on the investment of the borrowed moneys.  This return is to be sought in the additional employment, improved amenities and increased security which the investment will afford, rather than in a direct money dividend.  Half of the total outlay of £12.6 million can, however, be relied upon to provide from the outset a return sufficient to offset the corresponding debt charges.  Before I mention other important items of State expenditure not currently provided for out of revenue, a few brief comments on the major constituents of this £12.6 million estimate will not be out of place.</P>
    <P Just="Center">ELECTRICITY DEVELOPMENT.</P>
    <P>To speak first of electricity development for which the Exchequer will be called upon to provide £4.75 million this year, gross capital expenditure by the Electricity Supply Board is estimated at £5.65 million, of which £0.9 million will be met for the time being by borrowing from depreciation reserves and superannuation funds, the balance of £4.75 million being required at once from the Exchequer.  About half of the gross expenditure will be devoted to the expansion of generating capacity and will be roughly balanced between steam and water power.  The Erne scheme will call for £1.2 million and it is hoped that by the early summer of 1950 the Cliff Station, with a capacity of 80,000,000 units a year, will be in operation.  Work will begin on the development of the River Lee but this 60,000,000 units project will not be completed until the summer of 1953. The first turf-fired station at Clonsast, <Col N="482" /> with a capacity of 45,000,000 units, will go into production next winter.  Two new stations&mdash;Leixlip and North Wall, with a capacity between them of 50,000,000 units&mdash;are on the point of being put into service.  Over the next few years other stations on which work is in progress, including Allenwood (turf) and Ringsend (coal), will be completed. Although the output of electricity will be doubled over the next six years or so, it will be hard to keep pace with the rapid growth in demand. As Minister for Finance I have no misgivings about the productive character of this form of investment although the capital involved is considerable.</P>
    <P>Substantial progress is being made with rural electrification.  In 1947-48, 2,227 rural subscribers were connected and last year the number added was 9,353.</P>
    <P Just="Center">LOCAL LOANS FUND.</P>
    <P>After electricity development, the largest item of outlay from borrowings is £2.8 million for advances to the Local Loans Fund.  Issues from the fund in 1949-50 are estimated to amount to £3.45 million, of which £2.72 million will be for housing and £0.65 million for public health services, the balance being for vocational schools and other services.  The advances of £2.8 million from the Exchequer will be supplemented by the re-issue of capital repayments of £0.65 million. Issues from the Transition Development Fund for housing and allied services are estimated at £1.33 million. Thus, between the two funds, almost £5,000,000 will be made available this year by way of loans and capital grants for housing and public health services. A further £1,000,000 or so will be provided through the Vote for Local Government in the form of housing grants to private persons and others and contributions to loan charges of local authorities.  In addition, some of the larger local authorities will continue to finance housing schemes by direct borrowings from the public.  The amount borrowed from the public last year was over £3,000,000, of which Dublin Corporation accounted for £2,500,000.</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <Col N="483" /> HOUSING FINANCE.</P>
    <P>The large and growing sums which are being spent on housing reflect the intensity of the effort which is being made to remedy a grave social problem. The facilities and subventions provided by the State for local authorities are roughly equivalent to the giving of completely interest-free loans for housing. In many cases, notably for rural housing, the terms of State aid are even more favourable.  The measure of State aid can also be expressed by saying that, on average, roughly one-half (rather more for rural housing) of the capital cost of local authority housing is, in effect, borne ultimately by the State, the other half being shared by the local authorities and the tenants of the houses in varying proportions. Although the rate of interest on advances from the Local Loans Fund is 3¼ per cent., borrowers for housing are being compensated in respect of the increase from the former 2½ per cent. rate.  The compensation, expressed as a capital sum, is in the neighbourhood of £100 for the average urban house.</P>
    <P Just="Center">TELEPHONE CAPITAL.</P>
    <P>Capital expenditure on the extension of the telephone system is met by borrowing from the Post Office Savings Bank, repayment being provided for by an annuity charged against voted moneys.  The revenue from the service more than offsets this charge.  Expenditure in 1949-50 is estimated at £1,920,000.  The new main cable from Dublin to Cork with branches to Waterford and Athlone will take about £500,000.  The extension of the automatic exchange system in Dublin and Dún Laoghaire, Cork, Waterford and other districts will cost a further £500,000.  The connection of 10,000 new subscribers this year will involve an outlay of £335,000 and the balance of the estimated expenditure will be incurred on various improvements of the system.  This is all productive expenditure in the sense that the revenue from subscribers is expected to be sufficient to defray interest and capital charges.</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <Col N="484" /> ROAD FUND.</P>
    <P>The total expenditure of the Road Fund in the current year is estimated at £4,300,000 of which £2,400,000 will be provided from current revenue, i.e. the proceeds of motor taxation, £300,000 from the balance on hands and £1,600,000 from temporary advances from the Central Fund secured on future revenue of the Road Fund.  The grants to local authorities for road maintenance and improvement for the current year have been settled at £2,400,000, the equivalent of the estimated revenue from motor taxation.</P>
    <P Just="Center">TURF DEVELOPMENT.</P>
    <P>The amount included in the White Paper for advances to Bord na Móna this year is £1,080,000 as against actual advances of £800,000 in 1948-49.  This provision is related to the scheme of development authorised by the 1946 legislation under which Bord na Móna plan to attain an annual output of 1,000,000 tons of machine-won turf. Financial provision will be made in an amending Bill for the inauguration of a second development scheme and for the housing of workers engaged on the schemes.</P>
    <P Just="Center">OTHER ISSUES.</P>
    <P>Little need be said about the other items comprised in the heading &ldquo;Capital and Other Issues&rdquo; beyond an expression of hope that it will not be necessary to make any provision in 1950-51 for advances under the Transport Act, 1944.  The provision of £420,000 made under this head in the current year is for advances from the Central Fund in fulfilment of the guarantee of interest on Córas Iompair Éireann debentures.  It is my hope, and the community is entitled to expect, that the reorganisation of the company's affairs now in hands will enable it to meet such charges in future years out of its own resources.</P>
    <P Just="Center">LAND RECLAMATION.</P>
    <P>The scheme recently announced by the Minister for Agriculture should add considerably to the extent and fertility of agricultural land and so contribute to the recovery in agricultural production <Col N="485" /> and exports on which our future prosperity depends.  It has been estimated that some 4,000,000 acres of farmland, widely and unevenly distributed throughout the country, are of little or no value owing to inadequate drainage.  The productivity of a further 500,000 acres is capable of being improved by the removal of furze, scrub, boulders and unnecessary fences; with State grants and assistance for draining and fertilising it is hoped to bring back this considerable area of agricultural land into full productivity in the next ten years or so. This investment in the improvement of our basic natural resource, the land, is regarded as an appropriate use of some of the proceeds in Irish currency of the dollar borrowings from the Government of the United States under the European Recovery Programme. Accordingly, the capital cost, though provided in the usual way by Vote of the Dáil, will be treated for budgetary purposes as proper to be met by borrowing which, so far as the American Loan Counterpart Fund is made available, will be effected by the issue of securities to that fund.  It will be recollected that the recent Central Fund Act contained a provision authorising the investment of the Counterpart Fund moneys in Government securities.</P>
    <P Just="Center">HEALTH SERVICES.</P>
    <P>Apart from the capital expenditure which is being defrayed from internal and external borrowings, expenditure will also be incurred on the provision and extension of hospitals, involving a draw on the investments (mainly sterling) of the Hospitals Trust Fund, which at present amount to £10,000,000 approximately.  Grants to local authorities for health services, the growing cost of which is at present borne entirely by the Central Government, are included in the Supply Services, the relevant provision in this year's Health Estimate being £2,160,000.  The total net health expenditure by health authorities, inclusive of grants from the Central Fund, is estimated at almost £7,000,000.  The capital expenditure mentioned is distinct from these continuing and growing charges against <Col N="486" /> taxation.  All this expenditure from public funds, together with the contributions from Hospitals Trust receipts, to the running expenses of voluntary hospitals, private subscriptions, the activities of health organisations, etc., represent a considerable effort to combat disease and improve the health of the community.</P>
    <P Just="Center">CENTRAL GOVERNMENT AND LOCAL AUTHORITY DEBT.</P>
    <P>During 1948-49 the total debt of the Central Government, including the capitalised value of housing contributions, rose from £104.9 million to £116.3 million.  This increase is attributable as to £8,000,000 approximately to net issues for capital expenditure, as to £1.4 million to increased housing liability, and as to the balance to dollar borrowing from the Government of the United States, the proceeds of which have been placed to the credit of a special account in the Central Bank in accordance with the Appropriation Act of 1948.  Net issues to the Electricity Supply Board came to £3.4 million, advances to the Local Loans Fund to £2,000,000, advances for telephone capital development to £1.1 million, advances to Bord na Móna to £0.8 million, and advances to the Road Fund to £0.7 million.  These issues were financed temporarily by short-term borrowings which are being repaid out of the proceeds of the recent £12,000,000 issue of 3 per cent.  Exchequer Bonds.  Interest and sinking fund charges in respect of Central Government debt will amount to approximately £5,000,000 in the current year, apart from the contributions of roughly £0.7 million to housing charges of local authorities.</P>
    <P>The gross debt of local authorities was £36,000,000 at the 31st March, 1948, and their net debt £23.6 million. During 1948-49 further net debt of over £2,500,000 was incurred.</P>
    <P Just="Center">DOLLAR BORROWINGS.</P>
    <P>The Central Government debt of £116.3 million at 31st March includes approximately £2,000,000 of borrowings from the Government of the United States under the loan agreement <Col N="487" /> entered into last year.  By this agreement as extended in February last a line of credit of $89,000,000 has been established in favour of the Government of Ireland.  Interest payments in respect of the borrowings are due to commence in 1952 and principal repayments in 1956.  The line of credit is drawn upon only as claims for reimbursement of dollar expenditure are discharged by the Economic Co-operation Administration.  Dollar expenditure is met initially out of our own earnings and purchases of dollars from London.  Total dollar payments in 1948-49 amounted to $70,000,000 of which $30,000,000 was met from our own earnings, $3,000,000 has still to be discharged and the balance of $37,000,000 was drawn temporarily from the Sterling Area Pool.  Dollar payments in 1948-49 were less than the expenditure attributable to the year, some of which, particularly for grain imports, will mature in the first quarter of 1949-50. The drawings from the pool have, of course, to be made good according as reimbursement is secured from the United States Government under the line of credit.  A sum of almost $8,000,000 was so reimbursed by the 31st March last and was returned to the pool, the proceeds of the sale being carried to the credit of the special account in the Central Bank which then stood at £1,961,515.  Although only $8,000,000 approximately was drawn under the line of credit in 1948-49, claims for a further $32,000,000 arise which, when discharged by the Economic Co-operation Administration, will entail a corresponding draw on the line of credit.  The imports of grains, oil, machinery, tobacco and other commodities made possible by dollar borrowings from the Government of the United States have been of immense value to our economy.  The overdraft facilities provided by the Sterling Area Pool have also been invaluable in easing the transition to the new method of dollar financing under Economic Co-operation Administration.  Evidence of the return to more normal trading conditions and of the part Ireland is playing in furthering the objectives of O.E.E.C. and Economic Co-operation Administration and reducing Europe's dollar deficit is <Col N="488" /> provided by the remarkable drop in our dollar outlay since 1947, when it reached the figure of $141,000,000.</P>
    <P Just="Center">USE OF PROCEEDS OF DOLLAR BORROWINGS.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the intention to apply moneys in the American Loan Counterpart Fund towards financing the new scheme of land reclamation. The policy of the Minister for Finance in relation to the investment of the proceeds of dollar borrowings must be guided by two main considerations: The need to avoid inflation or other adverse economic consequences as a result of adding to the volume of money from external sources and the obligation which rests on the Government of repaying the borrowings with interest. To avoid an increase in the taxpayer's burden, the accruing resources of the Counterpart Fund &mdash; the amount of which depends, of course, on Ireland's dollar allocations under the European Recovery Programme&mdash;must be invested in a manner that will ensure an increase in revenue sufficient to service the external debt.  The necessary increase in revenue may be secured either directly, by investment in public projects which are in themselves of a profit-earning character, or, indirectly, by developmental expenditure calculated to increase the national income and, automatically, the yield of taxation. The Dáil will be duly informed and where necessary, asked in the usual way to approve of any such use of moneys in the Counterpart Fund.  It is intended that a proportion of the fund should be invested in readily realisable securities as a reserve against the maturing liability for repayment of principal and interest.</P>
    <P Just="Center">STATE GUARANTEES.</P>
    <P>In addition to direct State borrowing, internal and external, a considerable contingent liability has been incurred in respect of guarantees.  A statement recently presented to the Dáil shows the total principal liability on foot of guarantees of bank overdrafts of certain State-sponsored companies at £9,779,000 on the 31st March last.  Further liabilities existed at that date in respect of the guarantee of the <Col N="489" /> overdraft of the Butter Marketing Committee (£664,000) and of debentures of Córas Iompair Éireann (£14,039,000). These guarantees alone total over £24,000,000, most of which is by no means a remote liability.  In the case of Córas Iompair Éireann the guarantee of debenture interest had to be fulfilled to the extent of £360,000 last year and is expected to entail a further issue of £420,000 in the current year. There is indeed a possibility, which I sincerely hope will be avoided, that the Exchequer may have to meet its guarantee of the principal of £1,150,000 of Córas Iompair Éireann debentures redeemable next January.  In the case of Fuel Importers, Limited, where the guaranteed overdraft amounts to almost £5,000,000 over £3,000,000 represents loss on stores of fuel which will have to be made good by the Exchequer to enable the overdraft to be discharged.</P>
    <P Just="Center">INVESTMENT AND SAVING.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the indications which I have given that capital expenditure by the Central Government and local authorities will reach a record height in the current year.  Gross capital expenditure by public authorities and by private concerns and individuals will probably account for almost one-fifth of total national expenditure.  To keep capital outlay on this scale from having inflationary consequences, it is essential that output and savings should be increased.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SMALL SAVINGS.</P>
    <P>In my last Budget statement I announced the restoration, as from 1st July, 1948, of the traditional rate of interest&mdash;2½ per cent. per annum&mdash;on Post Office Savings Bank deposits.  In addition, the limit for individual holdings of Savings Certificates was raised from 625 to 1,250 unit certificates.  I expressed the hope that savings would thereby be encouraged.  For several months past efforts have been made to direct attention to the advantages of these modes of saving by posters and other publicity devices.  As a result of these measures, I am glad to be able to report a marked recovery in Savings Bank deposits and in purchases of Savings <Col N="490" /> Certificates.  By contrast with a net withdrawal of £241,000 from the Savings Banks in 1947, there was a net deposit of £1,591,000 in 1948.  In the case of Savings Certificates there was, for 1948 as a whole, an excess of repayments (including interest) of £50,000 compared with an excess of purchases in 1947 of £21,000.  Since the publicity campaign was started, however, this adverse trend has been reversed; net sales of Savings Certificates between end-November and mid-April amounted to £161,000 whereas there was a net repayment of £81,000 in the same period the year before. Savings Bank deposits increased by £1,520,000, whereas, there was a net withdrawal of £718,000 during the same five months of the previous year.  Including accrued interest, the liability of the Post Office Savings Bank to depositors at 31st March, 1949, is estimated at £46,086,000, an increase of £4,304,000 over the figure at 31st March, 1948.  The total indebtedness in respect of Savings Certificates at 31st March, 1949, is estimated at £17,097,000, or approximately £592,000 in excess of the liability as at 31st March, 1948.  The recent upward movement is encouraging at a time when the need for savings is so acute.  Now that it has taken root again the habit of thrift will, I hope, grow and spread.  Increased savings are required from all sections of the community as the basis of the capital development which is a precondition of an improved national income.</P>
    <P Just="Center">BALANCE OF PAYMENTS.</P>
    <P>A provisional estimate of the balance of payments for 1948 indicates a narrowing of the gap between outgo and receipts.  Equilibrium is, however, far from being restored.  The deficit on current account is estimated to have been of the order of £15,000,000, involving a corresponding realisation of external assets.  This figure is happily much less than the £30,000,000 deficit recorded for 1947. The trade deficit for 1948 was almost as high as that for 1947&mdash;£89,000,000, as compared with £92,000,000.  The improvement in the balance of payments as a whole is attributable mainly to increased income from tourism, the <Col N="491" /> number of visitors in 1948 being about one-third more than in 1947.</P>
    <P Just="Center">EXPORTS.</P>
    <P>It would be overoptimistic to rely upon a continuance of tourist income at such unprecedented levels and so it is all the more necessary to secure a substantial increase in exports.  The increase in the value of exports from £39.5 million in 1947 to £47.5 million in 1948 is welcome, but the increase in volume was very slight and a much greater improvement is essential. Owing to a decline in the level of imports and an increase in export values, the trade deficit has been narrowed since last summer, but it still remains about £5,750,000 a month, or, say, £70,000,000 a year, a gap which, even if it were not widened again, could be bridged only if investment income, pensions, emigrants' remittances, sweepstake receipts, etc., remained at their present level and tourist income did not sink below £35,000,000 a year.  Obviously these are untenable assumptions and there is no room for complacency about the depressingly low volume of exports, which is still 27 per cent. below 1938. The egg and poultry industry is leading the way to the expansion which is necessary in all branches of the export trade; if this good example is followed in other fields, on a later Budget occasion it should be possible to refer to a worth-while improvement of a more general type.</P>
    <P Just="Center">IMPORTS.</P>
    <P>The value of imports in 1948 was £136.7 million, as compared with £131.3 million in 1947.  The 1948 figure is the highest ever attained and shows an increase in volume of 27 per cent. over that for 1938.  The restocking which characterised 1947 continued during the first part of 1948.  It seems probable that imports have passed their peak as a somewhat lower level on average has prevailed since last summer.  This reduction is welcome as the high rate of imports tended to impose too severe a strain on the balance of payments.  The considerable increase in imports of maize, other feeding <Col N="492" /> stuffs, fertilisers, and oil is a source of particular satisfaction since imports of these commodities help forward the much-needed improvement in agricultural production and exports.  Imports from the United States and Canada fell from £34.9 million in 1947 to £14.3 million in 1948.  The cessation of coal imports from the United States and a general reduction in dollar purchases, of which wheaten flour and cotton yarn and piece goods may be specially mentioned, account largely for this decline, which was offset by increased imports from the sterling area.</P>
    <P Just="Center">AGRICULTURAL OUTPUT.</P>
    <P>Agricultural output is still about 7 per cent. below the 1938-39 level.  In terms of 1938-39 prices gross output for 1948 has been provisionally valued at £50,000,000, as compared with £53.5 million in 1938-39.  There was a slight recovery as compared with 1947&mdash;a year of unfavourable weather&mdash;when the gross output figure on the same basis of valuation was £49.2 million, but there is obviously need for a much greater improvement, especially in the production of cattle, sheep and pigs. Crop yields per acre were much better than in 1947, though still considerably short of 1938 levels.  This improvement was due to good weather and more fertilisers. The output of cattle and calves in 1948 was, however, 22 per cent. below 1938-39.  Sheep and lamb output last year was 40.1 per cent. and pig output 57.6 per cent. under this rather low pre-war standard.  An early improvement is expected in the case of pigs, as supplies of maize are now available and the cycle of production is short; recovery in the case of cattle and sheep will be a slower process.</P>
    <P Just="Center">INDUSTRIAL OUTPUT.</P>
    <P>The figures for industrial output are more satisfactory.  The volume of production of industries producing transportable goods for the year 1948 was 36 per cent. above that for 1938 and 15 per cent. more than for 1947.  In industry as a whole&mdash;including building and construction, Government and local authority works, transport and public utilities, in addition to industries producing transportable goods&mdash;the provisional estimates of the volume of production <Col N="493" /> show an increase of 28 per cent. over 1938 and of 16 per cent. over 1947.  These figures show that Ireland is enjoying the improvement in supplies and in other conditions which has led to the general increase in industrial activity in Western Europe.</P>
    <P Just="Center">WAGES AND EARNINGS.</P>
    <P>Industrial earnings were, by September last, 82.4 per cent. on average above those for September, 1939.  This increase corresponds with the rise in the cost of living since pre-war, so that workers generally have now been fully compensated for the rise in living costs. The cost-of-living index itself has been virtually stable for the past year and it is, therefore, to be expected that the upward adjustment of wages and salaries has been completed.  Agricultural wages and farmers' gross incomes have more than doubled as compared with pre-war.</P>
    <P Just="Center">NATIONAL INCOME AND TAXATION.</P>
    <P>It has not yet been possible to resume publication of the official Estimates of national income and expenditure which were inaugurated in the White Paper published in March, 1946.  Such Estimates are of importance in economic analysis and in the shaping of Government policy, and, as I stated recently, it is hoped, with the collaboration of the new Central Statistics Office, to have up-to-date figures ready for publication next year.  A very rough estimate, prepared by short-cut methods, put the national income for 1947 at about £320,000,000.  The proportion of the national income which is absorbed by taxation&mdash;including local rates and social insurance contributions as well as Central Government tax revenue&mdash; is of the order of 25 per cent., or roughly £27 per head per annum.  The persistence of such burdens over any lengthy period would be deplorable, and all our efforts should be directed towards securing their abatement.</P>
    <P Just="Center">MONETARY SITUATION AND PRICES.</P>
    <P>Total monetary circulation increased by £2,575,000 between March, 1948, and March, 1949.  Advances by the banks <Col N="494" /> to Irish customers increased in the same period by £5,332,000 to reach £90,968,000, as compared with £47,437,000 for the March quarter 1939. This increase reflects the rise in the general price level since pre-war.  The circulation of cheques in 1948, as indicated by the figures of debits, shows an increase of 16.1 per cent. over 1947. The agricultural price index for 1948 was 248, as compared with 225 in 1947, 196 in 1946 and 100 in 1938-39; for the last quarter of 1948 it was 252, as compared with 241 for the same quarter of 1947.  This rise in agricultural prices has far outpaced the rise in retail prices, as indicated by the cost-of-living index, which averaged 183 for 1948, as compared with 178 for 1947 and 100 as at mid-August, 1938.  It is clear that the position of farmers has markedly improved as compared with pre-war, both absolutely and in relation to wage and salary earners.  This adjustment was a necessary correction of their previously depressed conditions, but with world prices for wheat and other commodities falling further below the guaranteed domestic price, it would be unrealistic for farmers to expect a continued increase in agricultural prices.  Improvement in incomes must be sought in increased output and lower costs of production. Wholesale prices advanced 5.8 per cent. between 1947 and 1948 under the influence of the increase of 10 per cent. in agricultural prices.  Import prices showed an increase of about 3 per cent. and retail prices, as already indicated, of less than 3 per cent.  On the whole, it appears that the upward surge in prices has spent itself and that, if the forces making for inflation are held in check, further increases will be avoided.</P>
    <P Just="Center">CONCLUSION.</P>
    <P>This brief survey of present economic conditions discloses favourable and unfavourable features.  Amongst the more encouraging signs are the increase in industrial output and employment, the incipient recovery in certain agricultural exports, the reduction in both the over-all deficit and the dollar deficit in the balance of payments, the increase in small savings and the tendency towards stability in the price level.  On <Col N="495" /> the other hand, agricultural output and exports as a whole are still at dangerously low levels, capital expenditure&mdash; some of doubtful productivity&mdash;is outstripping current savings, rates and taxes are excessive, dead-weight debt is rapidly expanding and production costs are unduly high.  The primary needs of the moment are increased output at lower unit costs from farm and factory and more saving by the community generally.  To this public authorities, central and local, can contribute by reducing their demands on taxpayers and ratepayers.  With such improvements rapidly achieved the national economy would gain in strength and stability.</P>

      <P>When this Government was set up they published instantaneously a declaration of the purposes for which it was formed, the famous ten-point programme.  In that ten-point programme it was stated that one of its immediate aims was to introduce a comprehensive social security plan to provide insurance against old age, illness, blindness, widowhood, unemployment, etc.  Within a few weeks the Minister for Social Welfare assured the Dáil that he would have a White Paper embodying the Government's proposals in relation to social welfare available for the consideration of Deputies before the summer of 1948.  The Paper did not appear.  Further questioned he promised to produce it before the end of 1948.  It did not appear.  He was questioned early this year and again was able to give no firm indication as to when even the preliminary statement of the Government's intentions would be published.  We must assume from the absence of any reference to the scheme in the Budget that there is no intention of bringing it into operation within this financial year.  If the Deputies who are committed to the introduction of that scheme, who pledged themselves to their constituents to concentrate their efforts in this Dáil to have it prepared and enacted, are satisfied with that situation then I think they speak only for themselves.  I also remind the Deputies opposite that there will be widespread disappointment because of the failure of any serious attempt on the part of the Minister for Finance to implement their pledges to reduce the cost of the Government and with it the burden of taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us relate this Budget to one or two preceding it.  It is not possible to consider it in this House except we go back a step or two in time.  Two years ago Deputy Aiken, as Minister for Finance, opened to the Dáil the Budget of 1947.  In the course of that Budget Statement he proposed to this House and secured the approval of this House for taxation which was estimated to yield £53,000,000.  The members of the <Col N="497" /> House who were then in opposition and who are now Ministers were unanimous in their denunciation of these proposals. They protested that the burden of taxation which they involved for the people of this country was beyond their capacity to bear.</P>
    <P>The late Deputy Hughes opened the debate for the Fine Gael Party and he described the Government that proposed it as the spendthrift Government and as indifferent to the effect of that taxation upon the people of the country and their welfare.  The Leader of the Fine Gael Party, now the Minister for Education, described these proposals, proposals designed to yield in that year £53,000,000 in revenue, as leaving the people of this country struggling in misery and distress.  The present Minister for Lands, then the leader of the Clann na Talmhan Party, described the Budget as indicating a policy of reckless extravagance and expenditure.  Similar speeches were made by the Minister for Social Welfare, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  These proposals related to a year in which the post-war economic crisis in this country was at its height, in which there were major economic difficulties arising out of the scarcity of supplies, in which the Government had to take exceptional measures in order to ease the burden of conditions upon our people.  However, because they involved a taxation to yield £53,000,000 they were denounced in these unmeasured terms by the men who are now sitting in the Government Bench opposite.  Later in that year when the proposals in that Budget failed to check the rise in prices which was then occurring throughout the world, the Minister for Finance in the Fianna Fáil Government came to the Dáil with a Supplementary Budget designed to bring in a further £4,700,000 in that financial year for the sole purpose of checking that rise in prices through increasing the food subsidies in force.  Do the Deputies opposite not remember that they made the burden of taxation imposed by that Supplementary Budget the keystone of their general election platforms?  Did they not, at every meeting <Col N="498" /> they addressed in the election campaign, profess their belief, not merely that that burden was more than the people of this country could bear, but that it was an unnecessary burden and that it could be reduced by a more efficient Government, one concerned with retrenchment and economy, the two words of which the present Minister for Finance is so very fond?  The present Minister for Finance described that burden of £57.7 million in words which are worth repeating&mdash;he is fond of dramatic words&mdash;&ldquo;amazing,&rdquo;&ldquo;prodigious,&rdquo;&ldquo;prodigal.&rdquo;  These were the adjectives which flowed from the lips of the present Minister for Finance.  He came to the Dáil as Minister for Finance in March last year and his first public statement was to assure the Dáil not merely that he regarded that burden as too heavy, not merely that he intended to effect a reduction of that burden, but that he had secured from all his colleagues in the Government an assurance of their willing co-operation in carrying out that programme of reducing taxation below the prodigious and prodigal heights to which it had been raised by the Minister for Finance in the Fianna Fáil Government.  Later he introduced his first Budget, the Budget which contained proposals for taxation estimated to yield £61½ million and which, in fact, produced £62½ million.  He excused that Budget on the grounds that he was not long enough in office to carry into full effect the policy of retrenchment and economy to which he said he and his colleagues were committed.</P>
    <P>He promised in his Budget statement last year that the pursuit of retrenchment would be his major concern throughout the year, and he certainly left the House and the people of the country under the impression that when he came here in this month with the first 100 per cent.  Coalition Budget, he would show they were not talking through their hats and that, in fact, they could not merely give the people the benefit of extended Government services but could do so at a lower cost in taxation than had previously been necessary.  Now he presents us with a Bill for £64,500,000.  That is the amount of taxation which the people of this country are going to contribute in this <Col N="499" /> year.  It is true there is to be a reduction in income-tax.  Last year the income-tax payers gave the Minister for Finance £1,500,000 more than he expected. The yield from income-tax and surtax exceeded the Budget estimate by £1,500,000, and so, in his generosity and for the purpose of concealing the increased taxation which this Budget means, he is going to give half of it back.  Because of the passage of the war-time emergency situation and the improvement in supplies of tobacco and petrol, the tax revenue of this State will this year be £2,500,000 higher than last year. Because of that fact, because of these very specific pledges given by the Minister for Finance and his colleagues, because of the knowledge that the special charges upon revenue necessitated by the emergency have ceased, the fuel price subsidy, the cost of production of hand-won turf through the county councils' scheme, and because the reduction of the international price of wheat have reduced the cost of these services by £6,000,000, surely we were entitled to expect not the paltry return of £431,000 out of a bill of £64,500,000, but a far more substantial reduction in taxation than that.  Remember the Minister pledged the Government to it if ever any body of men in Irish politics were deemed to be pledged to anything.  This Government were pledged to retrenchment and economy and the reduction of taxation.  In so far as they got support from the people at the general election it was on that programme.  They did not repudiate that promise when they became a Government.  They repudiated others, but that one they announced their intention to adhere to.  They announced it in their ten point programme and in the first speech made in this Dáil by the Minister for Finance.  They announced it in a more formal manner in the Budget Statement of last year, and that pledge has been dishonoured.  Are we now to take it that that has been repudiated?  I should have thought that the Minister for Finance could have searched in the depths of his soul and found some lingering sense of shame which would have induced him, as the member of <Col N="500" /> the Government that had to announce the dishonouring of these promises and the breaking of these pledges, to make some excuse, however feeble, and some apology for the default.  Search the Budget Statement and see if you can find in it any expression of regret that they have been unable to do what they pledged themselves to do or to fulfil in the least degree the solemn undertakings which they gave to the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The details of this Budget will be discussed later in the Dáil.  I do not want to refer to them now.  I will do this: I will congratulate the Minister for Finance for having given us a far more honest statement than he gave us last year.  It may be that the hypocrisy in it is less obvious than it was last year.  It may be that the references to continued efforts to find economies and retrenchment contained in this statement are so much propaganda to lull the back-benchers of the Coalition into acquiescence, but the recorded fact is that the taxation which the Irish people will have to pay this year will exceed by £8,000,000 the amount which they paid in the last year of a Fianna Fáil Government, an amount which the members of the present Government denounced as excessive and which they undertook to reduce.  Let them explain that to the people of this country.  They cannot hope to explain it to us, but let them have no doubt that they will be often reminded of it during the course of the debates on these Budget Resolutions and on the Finance Bill which will follow.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Financial Resolutions, we have not had an opportunity of considering them and we propose to allow them to pass now without a division.  That, however, is not to be taken as an indication of our agreement with them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (General MacEoin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This short Bill proposes two changes in the existing law relating to district justices, one affecting the retiring age of justices and the other providing for an increase in the maximum number of justices that may be employed at any one time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="522" /> The present position as regards the retiring age of justices is that, under Section 15 of the Courts of Justice (District Court) Act, 1946, all justices must retire automatically on reaching the age of 65.  The only exceptions to this rule are three of the Dublin metropolitan justices and the Cork City justice, whose right to remain on until 70 was preserved for them by Section 15 of the 1946 Act.  There is also a provision in Section 47 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1936, which empowers the Government to extend the retiring age of a justice assigned to an Irish-speaking district, provided that the Government are satisfied that he is able to do the work of his courts through the medium of Irish and that he is not suffering from any disability which would render him unfit to continue to discharge the duties of his office.</P>
    <P>In Section 2 of the Bill we are proposing to confer power on the Chief Justice, after consultation with the Minister for Justice, to continue a justice in office from year to year after he has reached the age of 65.  The maximum period for which a justice may be so continued in office is five years.  The justice must each year satisfy the Chief Justice that he (the justice) is not suffering from any disability which would render him unfit to continue to discharge efficiently the duties of his office.  As a corollary, Section 47 of the 1936 Act, which I have just mentioned, is being repealed.</P>
    <P>Views may differ as to the wisdom of keeping justices in office after they have reached the age of 65, which has been the normal retiring age for the general body of justices ever since our own system of courts was set up in 1924.  I am fully alive to the fact that Section 15 of the 1946 Act, in so far as it reduced from 70 to 65 the retiring age of the Dublin and Cork justices (with, of course, the saving for the justices then in office in these two districts), reflected a policy with which it may be said the proposal now before the House is in conflict.  The conflict may, however, be more apparent than real and in any event I do not think that the proposal in the Bill is to be condemned merely because it may <Col N="523" /> appear to conflict with what was done in 1946.  I may, indeed, recall that when the 1946 Act was under discussion in this House more than one Deputy expressed the view that it was a mistake to reduce the retiring age of the Dublin and Cork justices to 65, and some Deputies, in fact, urged that the retiring age for all justices should be 70.  I do not subscribe entirely to that view myself.  I think that it is better that the normal retiring age should be 65, but, having regard to the safeguards that are provided for in Section 2 of the Bill, I do not think that any valid or reasonable objection can be urged against the proposal in that section to enable the retiring age of any particular justice to be extended beyond 65.</P>
    <P>I would invite the special attention of Deputies to the fact that, unlike Section 47 of the 1936 Act which conferred the power of extension on the Government, Section 2 of the Bill proposes to confer that power on the Chief Justice who is the titular head of the judiciary.  I feel sure that there will be general agreement that this is an improvement.  It will remove even the suggestion of any possibility of interference by the Executive with the independence guaranteed to the judiciary by the Constitution.  If a justice, when he is about to reach the age of 65, is able to satisfy the Chief Justice that he is fit to continue to discharge the duties of his office and, year by year, during the next five years, is able to produce satisfactory evidence of this fact, I can see no reason why he should not be retained in office. From the State's point of view the pension of the justice is saved and the State, moreover, benefits by being able to retain the services of a skilled and experienced justice.  The risk of loss to the State resulting from a serious and protracted illness is reduced to a minimum by the requirement that the justice must produce evidence annually as to his fitness to continue to discharge the duties of his office.  The proposal has manifest advantages also, of course, from the justice's point of view.  He will continue in gainful employment instead of being &ldquo;put on the shelf&rdquo; while still capable of doing <Col N="524" /> the work of a justice and, in many cases, will be enabled to qualify for a higher pension.  This is a consideration of some importance because many justices are appointed to office at 40 or over and they cannot hope to qualify for anything like full pension on retirement at 65.  An extension of the period of office for five years will go far in such cases towards improving the superannuation prospects of the justices concerned.</P>
    <P>I should perhaps say a word about the provision for consultation with the Minister for Justice.  Such a provision is considered desirable because there may be circumstances affecting either the particular justice or the position generally in the District Court at the time of which the Minister for Justice might be aware and which it might be proper and desirable to bring to the notice of the Chief Justice before he decides to extend the period of office of the justice.  I want to stress, however, that the Chief Justice is given a completely unfettered discretion in the matter and is not bound to act upon or accept any suggestions or representations that might be made to him by the Minister.</P>
    <P>In the new circumstances there will no longer be any need for the provision in Section 47 of the 1936 Act which empowers the Government to extend the retiring age of justices in Irish-speaking districts.  In fact, it would be altogether illogical and undesirable that there should be two separate authorities vested with the power to extend the retiring age of justices. Accordingly, the Bill provides, as I have already mentioned, for the repeal of Section 47 of the 1936 Act.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the provisions in Section 3 of the Bill for an increase in the maximum number of district justices. Prior to the enactment of the Act of 1946 the position was that under Section 68 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, the number of district justices was limited to 33.  The Courts of Justice Act, 1928, provided, however, for the appointment of not more than four assistant justices.  The office of assistant justice was distinguished from the office of justice only in that the assistant justice was paid a smaller <Col N="525" /> salary than a justice and was not permanently assigned to any particular district.  In 1946 there were three assistant justices holding office.  For several years before that temporary justices had been employed on an everincreasing scale, as many as seven or eight such justices being necessary at times.  I do not think that I need dwell now on the reasons for this except, perhaps, to mention that the main reason was the extraordinary increase in the volume of business in the Dublin District Court, particularly in the war years.  There appears to have been general agreement that the employment of temporary justices on so extensive a scale as had become necessary was most undesirable and open to serious objections, and I think I am correct in saying that one of the main objects of my predecessor in office in introducing the Act of 1946 was to get rid of the necessity for the continual employment of temporary justices.  The Act of 1946 abolished the office of assistant justice and provided for an increase to 40 in the maximum number of justices.  The three assistant justices in office at the time were appointed justices and permanently assigned to the Dublin metropolitan district where, in fact, they had been continuously employed for several years before that.  The position then was that there were six justices permanently assigned to Dublin.  Four new justices were then appointed, bringing the total number up to 40 as permitted by the new Act.  The four additional justices were not permanently assigned to any district and were, in theory at all events, supposed to be available to be assigned, from time to time, to any district in which their services might be required.  Hence they became known as &ldquo;moveable&rdquo; justices.  It was recognised quite frankly at the time that the services of at least two of these justices would be required in Dublin for some time to come but it was thought, or, at any rate, hoped, that the four &ldquo;moveable&rdquo; justices, with, perhaps, occasional help from &ldquo;temporaries,&rdquo; would suffice to meet all needs including the provision of reliefs for country justices as well as the extra help required in Dublin.  In fact, two of the &ldquo;moveable&rdquo; justices <Col N="526" /> have been employed continuously in Dublin ever since their appointment in the autumn of 1946 and a third &ldquo;moveable&rdquo; has been similarly tied down in that district for the last 15 months or so.  The fourth &ldquo;moveable&rdquo; justice has been immobilised for more than half of his time in one of the districts adjacent to Dublin in which the volume of work for several years past has been far more than the permanently assigned justice could cope with.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances it is not surprising to find that the hopes entertained at the time of the passing of the 1946 Act that it would be possible thereafter to do without temporary justices, except perhaps occasionally, were doomed to be very quickly disappointed. Except for a brief period last year, there has been since the 1st October, 1946, no time when we have not had at least one temporary justice operating and on occasions we have had as many as four, five or six.  In the period from the 1st October, 1946, to the 31st March last, which covers two and a half years, temporary justices were employed to an extent which was the equivalent of more than two full-time justices.  Present indications are that additional assistance to very much the same extent will continue to be required for a very considerable time to come.</P>
    <P>I want at this stage to revert to the position in the Dublin metropolitan district.  As I have explained, following the permanent assignment to that district of the three assistant justices on their appointment as justices in 1946, there were then six justices permanently assigned to that district.  Two of the &ldquo;moveable&rdquo; justices, as I have also explained, have been employed continuously in that district for the last two and a half years, and the Government, when I recently brought the matter before them, decided that as these two justices were doing exactly the same work as the permanently assigned justices and that as there was no prospect of being able to do without their services in Dublin in the foreseeable future, they should now be given the status of Dublin metropolitan justices which would entitle them to the increased salary of £1,430 per annum as <Col N="527" /> compared with £1,300 per annum.  In pursuance of this decision, the Government formally appointed the two justices in question permanently to the Dublin metropolitan district as from the 1st April last.</P>
    <P>The present position, therefore, is that, instead of having four &ldquo;moveable&rdquo; justices as was contemplated by the 1946 Act, we have only two and one of these is at present immobilised in Dublin and is likely to remain there for some considerable time to come, while the other will continue to be required to give at least half of his time to one particular district adjacent to Dublin.  Faced, therefore, with a situation in which the services of temporary justices would be required more or less continually for an indefinite period, the Government have decided that it would be preferable to increase the number of permanent justices rather than carry on as has been done for the last couple of years by having recourse to the employment of temporary justices.  The Bill, accordingly, proposes to raise to 42 the maximum number of justices that may hold office at any one time.  I want to stress that the figure of 42 is a maximum figure and that there will be no obligation to have that number all the time if the state of the business in the District Court does not warrant it.  On the other hand, I should like to make it clear that I can give no guarantee that, even with the maximum number of justices raised to 42, it will be possible to dispense entirely with the services of temporary justices, but I think we may hope that in the altered circumstances it will be possible to avoid employing &ldquo;temporaries&rdquo; except very occasionally.  No reasonable person would, I think, expect that we should maintain a permanent establishment of justices sufficient to meet all and every kind of emergency.  To do so would be to err needlessly on the side of extravagance.  What we should aim at is to have a permanent establishment as nearly adequate to meet all probable needs as is consistent with prudent economy and so reduce to a minimum the occasions upon which recourse must be had to the services of <Col N="528" /> temporary justices.  This is the underlying idea in Section 3 of the Bill and I am confident that it will commend itself to all sides of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that I am surprised that so soon after the passing of the 1946 Act we should have a proposal like this, particularly in view of the answer given yesterday to a question of Dr. Maguire.  He asked the Minister for Health why doctors were required to go at the age of 65 and he received this answer:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The principle of an age limit for retirement is well established in the public service and the extension of the principle to cover additional classes from time to time is inevitable and is, in general, in the public interest.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I thoroughly agree with that and I cannot see for the life of me why the Minister should wish to reverse a decision made here in 1946.  I agree that there were Deputies on the Fine Gael side who objected to the proposals contained in the 1946 Bill reducing the age at which a justice could remain in office from 70 to 65 in Dublin City and in Cork City and who wanted to allow justices all over the country to remain in office to the age of 70.  But apart from the Government Party, there was strong opposition to that proposal by the Labour Party.  There were some members of the Labour Party who very strongly objected and who thought that the provision whereby a justice should retire at 65 a good one and, as the Minister for Health said, in the public interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am at a loss to know what case there is for this at all.  This proviso that the Chief Justice must be satisfied means nothing except that in every case the Chief Justice will be satisfied.  I know the present one well and he is a soft-hearted man and will not turn anybody down.  Whoever gets his place afterwards will probably do the same.  This is a reversal by one Department of a principle proclaimed yesterday by another.  I agree with that principle although I admit I am almost 65 myself.  When I had that Bill before this House Deputy Coburn said that he was already 65 and Deputy Dillon, I think, said that the <Col N="529" /> then Taoiseach was as lively as a kitten although he was 65.  It is a good principle, for a man gives his best services up to the age of 65 and deteriorates after that.  Something could be said in the case of judges but they have not to travel in the way a district justice has to travel from one town to another, and I think that the provision that they should retire at 65 is a good one.  This is a particularly objectionable change and I do not think there is any case for it.  I was not satisfied with the case made by the Minister at all.  He says that it is a safeguard that the question should go to the Chief Justice, but he knows as well as I do that there is none and that in fact it means that the age limit is going to be 70 from this out.  I do not think I can say any more about that part.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of increasing the number to 42, I think the Minister is very foolish to agree to that. It was a long time before I agreed to extend the total number of permanent justices up to 40, because I was satisfied, and the Government at the time was satisfied, that conditions were abnormal.</P>
    <P>There was a great number of temporary justices and I agreed that it was a bad thing to have temporary justices, and I still agree.  If you continue to increase the number of permanent justices, however, you will find pressure brought to bear all along; you will find that you will have more temporary justices and I think the Minister admits that himself.  He does not see any hope of reducing the number of temporary justices if he gets the 42 permanent and that means that you will merely have two more permanents. Something could be done as was done in the Circuit Court reorganisation scheme, which took place, I think, during our last year in office, 1947&mdash;but I am not quite sure&mdash;whereby a Circuit Court judge could be required to give help in an area where there was a lot of work to be done if his own area was slack.  I am sure there are rural areas where there might be slackness and, if so, a provision like that might be useful and the Minister would be wise to consider it.  This is a bad thing.  The Minister should not give in yet but should stick it out as there might not <Col N="530" /> be so much necessity for extra justices when things become more normal.  We are only a couple of years past the war period and people have not settled down.  There is still more crime than we will have when things settle normally. I believe that, and I think the Minister should not agree to that proposal. He should not have done it.  It is a bad idea.  I do not know why he brought it in at this time, because there does not appear to be any necessity for it, particularly following the statement of policy by his colleague yesterday.  I am surprised at his attitude in this connection.</P>
    <P>I think most people will agree it is in the public interest that these people should retire.  Look at the Civil Service and all this talk about men's experience.  In the Civil Service men with great experience have been required to retire at 65&mdash;they are men with the experience of a lifetime in the service&mdash;and many people feel that they would be a great loss but, nevertheless, it is a well-established and a sensible proposal.  Let us remember that there are young people who want a chance and you will be preventing them getting promotion.  That is one of the ideas behind that proposal.</P>
    <P>I think this matter was very fully discussed and, apart from the Fine Gael people, the rest of the House were favourable and they agreed to the proposal to reduce even the Dublin district justices from 70 to 65, and we may take it that they must have convinced the Fine Gael people because they withdrew their amendment.  We took it they were convinced and that there was a good case made and I do not think there has been anything to alter the position since.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have certain misgivings with regard to this Bill and these are based on my own experience. I would have no objection&mdash;I would not have the same objection&mdash;if the Minister went the whole hog and said &ldquo;We will increase the age to 70&rdquo;.  I think that would be less objectionable than what is contained in this very peculiar clause, that a district justice when he reaches the age of 65 and wishes to carry on will have to submit <Col N="531" /> himself to the Chief Justice each year and the Chief Justice then will decide whether he is to carry on or not.  In the machinery of the judiciary there is no contact at all, good, bad or indifferent, between the Chief Justice and the district justice.  The Chief Justice knows nothing about what is happening in the District Court unless some case from the court may reach the Supreme Court, and there are not so many of these cases at all.</P>
      <P>The Chief Justice is, by the nature of his position and appointment, detached from the District Court and from the Circuit Court and where he can be of any help in this matter I cannot see. If it is agreed that it is a good principle I think it would be much better that the Minister should deal with that himself.  A district justice may look perfectly all right; if he has to have an interview with the Chief Justice it may be a satisfactory interview and he may be able to talk very plausibly to the Chief Justice.  If medical reports are required he will be able to produce one showing that he is perfectly capable and fit, whereas the Minister for Justice may know, through the machinery of the Guards, that that particular justice is unfit to be on the Bench.</P>
      <P>I think there is a very serious principle involved in this.  I have always felt that the age at which district justices are appointed is too low, that before a man is made a district justice he should have plenty of practical experience in the courts.  That will mean that between the age of appointment and the age at which he retires he will have short service and it would be a very easy method to get over the difficulty in that connection by providing a full pension for the district justice after a shorter service.  If a man has given up his practice, if he has taken up his appointment as a district justice and if he has to retire in accordance with the law at a certain age, it is only right that he should be able to enjoy the full pension, even though the service he renders is short. That would be a much better approach than saying: &ldquo;Let us extend his service so as to give him the opportunity of getting the full pension.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="532" /> I ask the Minister to reconsider this part of the Bill.  Undoubtedly there are many possibilities of improper conduct in relation to this particular matter.  It is not so very long ago since a district justice thought he should have got an extension of service. He did not get it.  He entered into a public controversy in the newspapers about it.  Now, if a man will do that is it not likely that some individual, a year before his term expires, who is anxious to continue his appointment, may consider that it would be a good thing if he courted certain people who might have the ear of the Chief Justice?  Human nature is human nature and certain people will do everything in their power to achieve some small end like that.  At least, they may do it and I think the likelihood that some individual of the 42 at some stage may do that would be objectionable.  It is for that reason that I think it would be preferable to say right away &ldquo;Extend the age to 70.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A district justice who is 65 does not deteriorate an awful lot between 65 and 66.  I think age helps; age is a great asset, a great benefit to a district justice adjudicating on the Bench. Age, I have discovered, is more important than youth and probably brilliance and if there is a viewpoint that the age of these men should be extended to 70, then let us give the extension right away; let us do it in this House, let Parliament do it and not have this roundabout method that may provide these objectionable things to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>I have always thought that we have too many district justices and, while in Dublin City our justices may have to work very hard &mdash; a grinding job day after day &mdash; the same thing does not apply in rural areas.  It is not an unusual thing in rural areas for a district justice to commence his court at 12.30 and to finish it at 1.30.  Practitioners who have to travel to courts in the country find that in some parts of the country a district justice manages to fit in two courts, one at 12 o'clock and one at 3 o'clock.  That was all right when travel was difficult.  The court had to be held in a particular place <Col N="533" /> and the justice had to go there, and, with travel difficult, he might be able to do only one court in the day.  With the improvement in travelling facilities &mdash;nearly every district justice I know has a motor car&mdash;they can get around more easily, and, by a rearrangement of the courts, it would be possible for them to do more work.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which has often struck me in this regard.  We are very fortunate in Dublin City in that one of our senior justices, the justice who deals with summary cases, is exceptionally satisfactory.  He can get through a list of hundreds of cases in the day and those of us who have to practise before him find that the work in that court is done very well.  Certain people may like to have a field day on a small case, but neither the busy practitioner nor the sensible person wants that.  What they want is to see the case dealt with expeditiously. The District Court was intended to be a summary court which would give speedy justice to the public, but some of our district justices are acting as if they were chief justices.  They must defer or adjourn a case to give judgment at some time in the future.  I suggest that, after all this consideration of the verdict, it is no better than it would be if it had been given on the spot, and in fact it might be better if given on the spot.  If our district justices could realise, as the great majority of them do, that the district court is a summary court to give speedy justice to the public, I believe more work could be done.</P>
    <P>Our courts have been cluttered up with all kinds of offences and I suppose that we in this House are responsible for it.  Some years ago, if a child was seen by an adult doing something wrong, the adult gave the child a &ldquo;clip&rdquo; on the ear and justice was done on the spot.  What happens now, particularly in Dublin?  A child does some small wrong which 20 or 25 years ago would have been dealt with satisfactorily by a &ldquo;clip&rdquo; on the ear and the child has to go through all the machinery of the law as if he were an adult on a very serious charge.  The justice has to sit and listen to the statements made by the child, taken down in writing, and the statements <Col N="534" /> made by the Guards, and in Dublin there may often be four, five and six of these children's cases dealt with in a day.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that this is an opportunity for him to have the whole matter of the District Courts&mdash; the number of justices required, the hours of work a justice is expected to do and so on&mdash;considered.  I am sure it would be quite illuminating if the Minister had a record&mdash;I do not know whether any such record is available&mdash; showing the actual number of hours in the month for which each district justice sits.  If we had that information, we would be able to judge whether or not there was any necessity for the increase suggested, because, once the authority is given, the appointments will be made and then additional temporary justices will have to be taken on.  It will be discovered after a year or so that it is very unfair to these temporary men who have lost their practices and their chance in life, and the Minister may have to come to the House and ask for a further increase in the number of justices.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to reconsider the Bill on the basis of going the whole hog and extending the period of service to 70 years right away.  I do not know what machinery there is at the moment for inquiring into the capacity of a district justice who becomes incapable of working below the age of 65. I do not know if there is machinery to deal with that or not but, if there is, it can be applied to the justice between the ages of 65 and 70.  There is in England at the moment a tendency to keep people in industry well beyond the age of 65; in other words, to get all the work they can possibly get out of everybody.  I think that is right. When certain popular justices have had to retire at the age of 65, I have seen leading articles in local newspapers urging that it was a shame that a particular justice should have to retire when he was at his absolute best, and we have seen some of these justices who have retired taking up the humdrum work of a solicitor.  If a man can retire from the Bench and commence to practise as a solicitor or at the Bar, he is still fit to be on the Bench.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="535" /> The Minister for Finance, in his Budget statement to-day, talked about saving money and spoke of better production and more work.  I think the same principle ought to apply here and I would certainly be strongly in favour of increasing the retiring age to 70 by this Bill and of doing away with this cumbersome machinery which has been recommended to the Minister.  This, like the other Bill introduced by the Minister recently, is not a Bill which is approached from a Party point of view.  It is not put forward just as a Government measure and opposed by the Opposition merely because it is a Government measure.  I think it is the duty of each and every one of us to endeavour to improve this type of legislation particularly, and I ask the Minister seriously to consider the points I have made.  If he does so, he may discover that it would be much better to increase the retiring age to 70 years in the Bill rather than to adopt a procedure to which there are many objections and which may become very objectionable if adopted by the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. Seán Collins Mr. Seán Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Seán Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I was rather surprised at the argument advanced by Deputy Boland on the question of the comparative age of judges and justices. I subscribe very strongly to the opinion that there is a good deal more stress and strain attached to the average district justice's job than there is, in the main, to that of members of the higher judiciary.  I have felt all along that, no matter what the merits of age limits may be, there should be, where judicial responsibility is concerned, the same age limit for members of the judiciary as such and members of the District Court as such.  I know from experience&mdash;and I am sure that Deputy Moran, sitting behind the ex-Minister, has had the same experience &mdash;that some of the older district justices are riper in their experience and far more effective at their job than some of the younger ones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this Bill in principle, as I feel that the Minister is directing his mind to something that we may overlook in the technicality of the Bill, that is, that the pension rates and pension rights that accrue in the District <Col N="536" /> Court are completely and absolutely different from those that accrue in the Circuit Court, in the High Court and the Supreme Court.  Many men who entered the District Court in this State in 1922, 1923, 1924 and 1925 did so at a time when the remuneration was satisfactory and the future was bright. Over that long period, their remuneration has been increased only in very recent years and has not been increased in any way commensurately with the increase in their cost of living.  I feel that this Bill is an attempt to relieve the dire necessity that may face some of the district justices, if they have to retire arbitrarily at 65, as many of them will not have the years of service that will entitle them to a decent pension. I welcome this as a humane and realistic approach to the problem.</P>
    <P>I think, however, the Minister will have to reconsider the Bill to some extent.  He is giving into the hands of the Chief Justice powers that I should be very slow to have this House give to him.  The administration of the District Court in its present form is mainly controlled directly by the Department of Justice and the time has not yet come when any of that power should be delegated to the Chief Justice. The Minister may say he does this because he wants an independent, impartial mind addressed to the problem and wants to take it out of executive control that might be subject to the fluctuation of Governments or the fluctuation of Ministers.  That does not alter the fact that fundamentally he is giving the Chief Justice a virtual power of life and death over the district justice from the time he attains the age of 65.  I do not think that that is a good principle.  We must face the issue straight and fairly. The Minister should fix the age limit at 70 or 72 and leave it at that.</P>
    <P>I would go further than that, since I feel that the purpose of this Bill is to protect certain members who have entered the service of the District Court and who, under present circumstances, in the fullness of their work and in the ripeness of their experience, may have to retire from the District Court with only a meagre pension and who may face a rather difficult future <Col N="537" /> in the world they have to face when pensioned.  If that is what the Minister is seeking, he should decide on an extension of the age limit for district justices who entered the service before a certain date, leaving the case of others subject to the normal incidence of their long service and who would be retirable as the Bill suggests, possibly at the age of 65.</P>
    <P>There is one difficulty which presents itself in this Bill, a difficulty that is recurring constantly.  If the argument is that the judge has less to do and can preserve himself better and, therefore, is entitled to serve until he is 72, I would not agree with it at all.  In general, the proof has been the reverse: it is the man who has to lead the more full, the more energetic and realistically active life who is infinitely better preserved at 65 than the man who may have to lead a sedentary life. This must be faced, once and for all. Even though the relative degree of responsibility may be different, to the normal litigant in the District Court the district justice has the same significance as higher judges have in various subsequent actions.  The Minister must make up his mind to level them all up in some way.  The time has come when he should take the district justices out of the category of civil servants altogether, by changing their pension schemes which are only on Civil Service rates, and he must put them where they should be, in the minor judiciary class.  He should make their pension rights and extent of service which must be given before a pension accrues, virtually the same as that of Circuit Court or High Court judges.  If he does that, never again will this House be troubled with the problem of having to face this from a humanitarian angle.  We all know&mdash;at least all of us, practitioners, know&mdash;of certain justices who, even at the age of 65, are in the fullness of health, agile in mind and adept at their work.  We know that and we would hate to see them go.  Never again should this House be faced with the problem of having to allow a humanitarian outlook to influence our judgment on legislation as such.</P>
    <P>I would urge on the Minister in an earnest way, while I thoroughly agree <Col N="538" /> with the humanitarian approach to the problems of this Bill, to clarify the position regarding the particular category of justice who needs the benefit of that approach.  After that, he should fix the age on a definite basis, be it 65 or 70.  I would suggest to him to bring it, if possible, into conformity with the age for the retiral of the judiciary.  Above all, he should lift the district justice out of the category of having to serve a practically indeterminate period to entitle him to any kind of reasonable pension.  If the circuit judge or the High Court judge, with due respect to the learned gentlemen, can, after 15 years, attain to the full pension attached to the office, I feel we should not leave the district justices under legislation which would not provide properly for them.  I urge on the Minister that, even though he may not concede such a short period of service as a pensionable period for the district justice, at least he should go some reasonable way towards it, so that, after 20 years' service in a District Court, a district justice would not be faced with the prospect of retiring on a microscopic pension which would not enable him to live properly as a respected member of the community.</P>
    <P>I thoroughly subscribe to the principle underlying this Bill, but I think it is unwise and unnecessary and practically useless to leave this discretion vested in the Chief Justice, in relation to the District Court.  I would prefer the Minister to be frank with the House and to tell us exactly the number of district justices involved and the period of service which he wishes to give them.  I think he should allow the machinery of the district courts to continue to operate as it does at the moment and that there should be no interference of any kind either by the Chief Justice or by anybody else.</P>

      <P>This Bill is described in its long title as &ldquo;An Act to amend certain provisions, relating to the District Court, of the Courts of Justice Acts, 1924 to 1947&rdquo;.  It would be more appropriate to describe it as a measure to safeguard Fine Gael pals of 1949. Deputy Captain Cowan asks the House to make some improvements on this Bill.  This is a Bill dealing simply with the extension of the period of service of a district justice.  It is extraordinary that the Minister can find time to introduce a Bill such as this when there are so many other pressing matters with which his Department should cope.  For years we have been waiting for a Bill to extend the jurisdiction of the District Courts.  For years we have been waiting for some kind of law reform.  We all know that much of our legal code is completely out-of-date.  Instead of getting a Bill such as we might naturally expect from the present Minister for Justice we get this Bill which is obviously a political Bill.  No matter how the Minister or his friends may try to cloak this Bill it still remains a political Bill.</P>
      <P>It is extraordinary that as far as the district justices are concerned the Bill is merely one to provide for certain district justices who are evidently near the retiring age.  There is one in particular who is at the retiring age.  He will be given a new lease of life for another five years.  The official attitude has always been that a man should retire at 65.  Yesterday the Minister for Health, in answer to a question, said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I am aware that the Local Government (Officers Age Limit) Order, 1946, has inflicted, and will continue to inflict, hardship on some officers of local authorities, including doctors for whom retirement on reaching a particular age limit had not previously been mandatory but the principle of an age limit for retirement is well established in the public service and the extension of the principle <Col N="540" /> to cover additional classes from time to time is inevitable and is, in general, in the public interest.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What the Minister for Health in his wisdom finds is in the public interest is now to be evaded.  The principle of retirement at 65 is enshrined in legislation. Recognised by the Government, it can now be put completely on one side when the Minister for Justice thinks that in the interests of a certain pal that pal should be continued to the age of 70.</P>

      <P>I submit I am entitled to give analogies for this Bill.  If the Minister thought it wise in the public interest to retire members of the judiciary at 65, 68 or 70 there is a very different procedure that the Minister could adopt.  It is a much more satisfactory procedure.  If judges and district justices are not able to do their job they can do a great deal of harm. If the Minister was concerned with that aspect of the matter some procedure should be evolved whereby the Minister would be enabled to appoint either a judicial committee or a committee of this House to examine the matter and advise him on any problems that might arise.  So far as I am aware there has been no demand from the public or from the judiciary for a measure of this kind.  We have not heard of any hardships being inflicted because of the present retiring age.  I go a long way with Deputy Cowan in connection with the appointment of district justices.  Every practitioner in the country feels that the community would be better served by the appointment of men of experience rather than by shoving briefless barristers on to the Bench.  In the main the District Courts have been most successful.  They are doing a very good job.  Unfortunately the Minister has not yet got round to giving them power to deal with a larger section of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is ridiculous, having regard to the present value of money, that the jurisdiction of the District <Col N="542" /> Court has not been increased and substantially increased.  It is absolutely absurd when a case is brought in a District Court&mdash;it may be only a case concerning a hen crossing a fence-that when the defendant raises a question of title the jurisdiction of the court is ousted and the parties are compelled to engage in a full dress trial in the Circuit Court with all the attendant expense of the briefing of barristers, etc.  If the Minister had concentrated on that aspect of the matter, instead of taking up the time of the House with a Bill of this kind, his efforts would have met with the appreciation of all sides of the House.  Without any particular demand that I know of to deal with this question, he comes along with this Bill which plainly on the face of it is going to increase the judicial life of a district justice by five years.  The Minister has not given any reason for this step.  He has not given any instance in which hardship would occur if the present regulation concerning the retirement age of district justices were continued. He has not suggested to the House that the community is suffering in any way by the mere fact that John Jones, a district justice, must go at 65 and devote his energies to fishing from that age onwards.</P>
    <P>There may be quite cogent arguments on the question of the pension rights of district justices.  I, like Deputy Cowan and some other Deputies who have spoken, think that the work of district justices is not sufficiently appreciated by the Department of Justice.  I think they are doing their job and doing it very well. If their pension rights are not what they should be, that is a matter with which the Minister might deal, but I do not think that bringing a Bill of this type into the House is the way to deal with it.  As I know and as every single individual sitting behind the Minister knows, this Bill is brought in to deal with one particular man.  It is brought in to deal with the case of one justice, who, according to the present age limit, would have to retire at 65.</P>

      <P>I think we have just heard a most unworthy speech from my colleague.  So far as I am personally concerned I have not the remotest idea as to the identity of the individual to whom he refers, if there is such a person. This is the first suggestion I have heard that such a person exists. I have heard my two colleagues ask the question as to who this person is, and I am sure they are in the same position of ignorance as I am.  From what I know of the Minister, I am perfectly sure he would not lend himself to any such unworthy action.  I think that the principle of this Bill is a good one. I understand that the principal purpose of the Bill is to increase the number of permanent justices and that the other provisions, such as that dealing with the extension of the period of office, are merely incidental.  I do feel somewhat disappointed that the Bill does not propose an increase in the jurisdiction of the District Court.  To that extent I entirely agree with what Deputy Moran had to say.  Any lawyer practising in the District Court has had experience, I am sure, of the anomalies to which he refers.  Take a case where a question of title is raised. The jurisdiction of the court is consequently ousted, although the district justice would otherwise have been perfectly competent to deal with the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question that presents itself to my mind about the number of justices is: is the Minister satisfied that he now has enough?  He gave in his opening statement a history of the increase from 33 under the 1924 Act to 40 under the 1946 Act.  It is now proposed to increase the number to 42.  Is the Minister sure that he will have enough now?  The principle of having them permanent is a good principle or, in other words, the principle of having a temporary man, feeling himself dependent on the whim of the Executive, is bad.  If the Minister is not satisfied <Col N="544" /> that 42 justices are enough I certainly would have no compunction whatever in supporting him if he asked for an increased number.  If he accedes to the request of Deputy Moran and myself as to increasing the jurisdiction of their courts, he certainly will have to increase the number of district justices again.</P>
    <P>With regard to the extension of the age limit, I should be very slow to depart from the present limit of 65.  I think it is quite a sound principle that justices should retire at that age and it has worked satisfactorily.  At the same time, I can see cases in which it would be desirable and of benefit to the community to allow a district justice to remain in office until he reached 70 years of age, and I think that the plan outlined in the Bill is a valuable one.  As the Minister mentioned in his opening statement, the giving to the Chief Justice of the power to extend the age does take the matter out of the category of political patronage.  I observe, of course, that the Chief Justice &ldquo;may, if he so thinks proper, after consultation with the Minister for Justice, by warrant made before such justice attains that age, continue him in office for one year, commencing on the date on which we will attain the said age&rdquo;.  I can appreciate that there would be, of course, necessity for the reference to the Minister, which obviously means the Department, by the Chief Justice.  But if, in fact, it could be taken away from the Executive altogether it would, in my opinion, be better.  I would have no fears whatever, like those expressed by Deputy Boland and Deputy Cowan, as to the approach of the Chief Justice in cases of this kind.  The number in the State to be dealt with under the present Bill is only 42.  I think that everybody in the House would be perfectly satisfied that the Chief Justice would discharge that new duty put upon him with complete impartiality and with complete satisfaction.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is much more to be said on this stage of the Bill.  I really thought that there would not be so much latitude allowed on the Second Reading.  I thought that would be more or less for the Committee Stage.  I do not think there is any necessity to go <Col N="545" /> into any further detail save to revert to the appeal for consideration, in any event, by the Minister of the proposal for an increase in jurisdiction.  Unless he is perfectly satisfied that he will not have to come back soon again to increase the number of justices I think the Minister ought to do that now.  I think he certainly will have to do that if he does not increase the jurisdiction.</P>

      <P>I was waiting, when the Minister was explaining this Bill, to hear his reason for bringing it in at the present time.  It is not so very long ago since the Dáil had this question under consideration and came to a certain decision.  Now we are going to have the decision reversed.  I am quite willing to admit that it is not easy to form a firm opinion as to what it is best to do regarding these retiring ages, whether in the case of civil servants or any other public servants. Some people might say that 65 is too high and why not 64, or that 65 is too low and why not 66.  However, the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Health, yesterday gave the general view, namely, that 65 is to be taken as the age at which public servants generally ought to retire.  Is it a question of finance?  Is it a question that there are, as has been suggested&mdash;and indeed suggested, perhaps, more by his own colleague, Deputy Collins, than by anyone else&mdash;a certain number of cases coming up for retirement of people who are in good health, who have had perhaps short service and who, in the Minister's opinion, ought to be continued on?  If that were true I think Deputy Collins was right in suggesting that the Minister should be frank with the House and tell us exactly the position.  It is likely that there are, amongst the justices, men in fairly good health who have come to the retiring age and who may have a short period of service which would mean retiring on a small pension.  The Minister did not, however, come down to deal with it on that basis at all.  We are dealing with it on general principles then.  I have met this question of retirement at a certain age myself; we have met it in the Government and in other realms also.  Most people will admit that very many people are in good vigorous <Col N="546" /> health at 65, the retiring age, and that it does seem a waste of energy in one sense and a waste of manpower, if you like, and also a waste of money to dispense with their services.  But we have to try to get a general average on which we are to work.  There has been a sort of general agreement at any rate on the age of 65 and I think we ought to stick to that unless we have very good reasons to the contrary.  I think that is the first thing&mdash;we ought to stick to the age of 65 unless a good case can be made to the contrary.  One of the things that would make it easy would be if you had some machinery by which you could determine whether a man was fit to continue on or whether it would be generally in the public interest, in the case of a public servant, that he should continue.  I doubt if any such machinery is ordinarily available. I do not think such machinery is available in the case of the district justices. Nobody is going to admit that it should be in the hands of the Executive.  It is quite clear that if it were put in the hands of the Executive&mdash;no matter how honestly, how fairly and how justly the Executive was going to act in any particular case&mdash;it was bound to be suggested that the extensions were the result of favouritism of one sort or another and that they were going to be used by the Executive as a reward for service of one kind or another.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to deal with it quietly and calmly.  I suggest that if the Executive has control of it &mdash;it does not matter what Executive it may be and it does not matter how honestly they may do it&mdash;it will be suggested, when they act in any particular case, that that particular case has been affected by some considerations <Col N="547" /> outside the considerations that should really have affected the case. Of course it will.  We are not living in an ideal world.  We know the sort of suggestions that are always made. I have not suggested that the Executive would do wrong but I said that it will always be suggested that it will do wrong.  Therefore, the Minister himself was perfectly right in saying that this machinery which he was suggesting was not going to be machinery which was going to be worked by the Executive.  The difficulty is to get a machinery of any kind that will work. The Minister tries to get machinery in this case by letting the Chief Justice be the person to make the decision&mdash; giving him the information which the Department of Justice and the Minister may have at their disposal about the particular ability and the state of health and capacity of the person in question.  If you are going to use this particular machinery it is probably as good as any.  Nobody is going to suggest that the Chief Justice is going to have the intimate knowledge the Department of Justice would have of the capacity and the power to continue his work of a district justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We then come to the next stage, to the person of the Chief Justice, whoever he may be.  I am not thinking of any particular Chief Justice.  I am thinking of the Chief Justice who may be in office at any particular time. That Chief Justice will, if he is of one type of character, do one thing and if he is of another type of character he will do something else.  If he is a rigid type he will, possibly, act rigidly according to some rules.  If he is a man who is likely to take into account the considerations which, in my opinion, have suggested the bringing in of this Bill, he is likely to take another course.  I have seen some of these machines at work.  My experience throughout has been that inevitably they have leaned towards favouring the individual as against the community&mdash; in other words saying: &ldquo;Ah, yes, poor fellow.  It would be very awkward and very hard for him.  He would have only a very small pension if he retired now and, after all, he is able to do the work fairly well.&rdquo;  When public money <Col N="548" /> is being spent at all we ought to see that it is spent on efficiency.  Money that gets for it efficient service is money well spent.  Money that does not get efficient work in return is money badly spent.  Sometimes it is a difficult thing to decide whether, for instance in the case of pensions, the public money is being more efficiently spent by waiting until a candidate for the office of district justice or judge has had experience of so many years that his years in office would be relatively few.  Then you have to ask how many years of service should entitle him to a pension.</P>
    <P>Suggestions have been made for the improvement of this Bill.  One suggestion was that it is better that the axe should fall at 70 without any intervening machinery. The idea of our Government at the time was to let the axe fall at 65 without any intervening machinery and the reason was that I do not think it is possible to find any machinery which will work satisfactorily in this regard.  The individual who will be given the task of saying whether a man should continue or go out is bound to lean on the side of the particular person involved.  All sorts of considerations will be put up.  It is not fair to put an individual in that position.  In another case, where a group was responsible for doing certain work, they inevitably leaned almost entirely on the side of the justice when in our opinion that was unwise.  We could not deal with it afterwards, but that was our judgment.  If you have machinery such as is suggested by the Minister, you will have a leaning on the side of the individual in question.</P>
    <P>I believe that the axe should fall at 65.  If you extend it to 70, you will have hard cases at 70.  It is true that there is a five-years period in which the service given would count for pension. I would rather cut off five years from the period necessary to qualify for a pension, even though it might mean an increase of expenditure.  I would rather do that than what the Minister is doing or what was suggested by Deputy Cowan.  I would rather by far reduce the number of years necessary for a justice to serve so as to qualify for full pension rights <Col N="549" /> than extend his service by five years. It may be said that this would mean more cost to the Exchequer.  In my opinion, it would not, because it would be money paid for efficiency in work.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not told us why he is proposing to reverse the previous decision of the House.  It was not put up as being a big political question in which there were strong differences of opinion amongst the Parties.  The Minister has not told us why it is being brought in at the present time.  I believe that the previous decision of the House was a wise one and I will stand for that.</P>

      <P>The decision was for 65 years.  This whole question was discussed in the House in 1946.  It was a decision given by the House after full consideration of this question.  It was, of course, given consideration by the Government beforehand.  I am therefore for 65.  Instead of enabling justices to give five years more service to qualify for a full pension, I think it would be more in the public interest to shorten the period of service required for a full pension, whatever it is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be more in the public interest to say that 25 years' service would qualify for the pension rather than to say that a justice can work on for another five years if, in the opinion of A, B or C, he is regarded as fit.  With regard to judges and justices, it is very important for the public that those filling these important positions should be in possession of every faculty; that they should be able to dispose of cases quickly; that they should be able to seize points quickly.  I do not think that these qualities are likely to continue in the average case in the same way after 65 as up to that age.  In regard to the first part of the Bill, therefore, I am against the machinery and the extension of the age beyond 65.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next matter is the number of justices.  I have also wondered, just as some Deputies who have spoken, <Col N="550" /> whether in certain areas we have not too many justices for the work to be done and in other areas perhaps too few.  This city is undoubtedly growing. I suppose the number of cases is likely to increase roughly in proportion to the increased population, so that, in ordinary times, with the increase in population in Dublin, the number of justices to deal with cases is likely to increase.  Perhaps there is some fallacy in that argument, but I do not see it.  At any rate, I would not be surprised if, in ordinary times, with the increase in population, the number of justices required to deal with the cases which come up for consideration in the city would increase.  But, as has already been suggested by some Deputies, I do think that, with modern transport, it ought to be possible for the justices in rural areas to cover much wider areas than they are covering at present and that there ought to be some machinery by which we could readjust these rural areas so as to reduce the number of justices.  I agree that it is a very bad system to have a large number of temporary justices; nobody wants that.  So far as we were concerned, it was only tolerated because we felt that during the emergency period there were quite a number of cases arising out of the emergency which called for extra work but that that would disappear when the emergency period was over.</P>
    <P>I think the time has come when there ought to be a very close examination of this matter to see whether we have not more justices than are necessary. It is true that, if you extend their jurisdiction, you will give them more work and that ought to be considered. I do not know whether any consideration has been given to this matter. The Minister has told us anyhow that he has not given any consideration to the possibility of giving to individual justices in various parts of the country more work than they are doing at present. Deputy Boland suggested that some such system as we have in the Circuit Courts might be evolved by which it would be possible, where there is little work for a justice in certain cases and in other cases there is a good deal of work, to have a transference from one district to another.  I think <Col N="551" /> the whole of this matter requires examination and consideration and that we ought not to increase the number of justices by two unless we are absolutely convinced that it is essential that it should be done in the public interest while each person does a decent day's work; in other words, that the justices' time is reasonably occupied throughout the country as a whole.  I am afraid, however, that that is a matter which we shall have to leave in the hands of the Minister and the Department. We have no machinery here by which we can satisfy ourselves whether or not the areas could be changed so as to ensure that there would be something like uniformity of work for the justices.  That is a matter for the Department. I think the Minister ought to examine that carefully before he proceeds with this Bill.</P>
    <P>My own belief is that he is bringing in the Bill because there are justices about to retire.  I am not saying that he is doing that for any political motive.  It would seem to me that the point of urgency is that some such cases are arising in the immediate future.  If it is not so, then he can tell the House.  However, I can quite understand the Minister on seeing a number of such cases saying &ldquo;I had better decide now.  If there is a succession of these cases coming along I do not want to be unfair to the men coming out to-morrow and the day after.&rdquo;  I think the fairest thing would be to leave the law as it stands.  If it is to be changed I suppose it is desirable that it should be changed as quickly as possible.  We are in the dark.  From the attitude of the Minister I take it that we are wrong in assuming that there are cases like that coming up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I might say, for the information of the House, that the urgency of the Bill is the congestion of work at present existing in Dublin. We have a large number ill and we have been compelled to appoint temporary district justices.  As far as we can see these conditions are going to obtain for a very long time and therefore it is essential to get rid of this system of temporary men.  We propose <Col N="552" /> in this Bill to increase the number of justices to 42.  There is no compulsion to keep 42.  There is the question of appointing two when there are about 12 perfectly good district justices who are going to retire in a period of years and who appear to us to be perfectly capable to act and who will not have a full pension.  I felt that when the Bill was coming in for the purpose of extending the number of justices I would make this other change, too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that from the Minister.  If I were Minister and saw a number of cases coming along and one justice going to retire, and if I had any idea of changing the law I would do it quickly.  I agree that that is fair.  However, I think that the age of 65 should be kept to because, taking it on the average, it makes for efficiency.  It is a rule which applies to the Civil Service and elsewhere. Any attempt to bring about a change by providing some machinery by which a person can be continued on from year to year will inevitably be abused.  The inevitable result will be the continuance of people beyond the time in which it would be in the general interest that they should be continued. I think the Minister is unwise and we are opposing that.</P>
      <P>With regard to the number I have nothing definite on which I could form a sound opinion because it is a matter of administration and of careful examination and I have no means by which I can judge whether the number is too great or too small.  I do realise, however, that an increase is probably required.  I believed at the end of the emergency this necessity would disappear. However, I do understand that the number of justices for Dublin should be increased with the increasing population.  At the same time I think that with modern conveniences, transport, and so on, it ought to be possible to create wider districts in the country and to get some arrangement, as suggested by Deputy Boland, by which those justices in slack areas would be able to help those in areas where there is a greater volume of work.  I am, therefore, going to oppose this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="553" />
    <Speaker pid="RoderickJamesConnoll" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I speak as a layman on this subject but I was rather alarmed at some of the revelations made by Deputy Cowan of his experience in the District Courts. Though it does not exactly come under the terms of this Bill it directs one's thoughts to the question of the work done by these district justices.  I take it that the main principle of this Bill is to avoid the overcrowding of the law lists, to overcome the large delays that are generally talked about and the congestion of the courts which are a serious burden on many litigants.  In that respect I listened with horror, I may say, to Deputy Cowan saying that district justices were able in the course of a couple of hours, a short session, to dispose of hundreds of cases.  If that is the nature of the work they do, then certainly they are being overworked to an alarming extent rather than being underworked as he would suggest.  No sound justice is being given to a litigant if his case does not occupy more than three minutes of a justice's time, no matter how summary these cases may be.  That, I think, was a very good argument on his part for a very great extension of the number of district justices.  What we want to see and what we are concerned with in this Assembly is not so much the economy or the administration of this Courts of Justice Bill as that justice is done to the ordinary people of the country.  I have heard complaints myself though I have no experience of these courts except occasional attendance before and after trades' disputes.  The frequent complaint of the ordinary litigant is that the solicitor he employs to take up his case does not open his mouth to say a word in his defence. I can understand, if the treadmill of justice proceeds at the terrific pace instanced by Deputy Cowan, that the poor solicitor who is defending his client has no opportunity whatever of opening his mouth.  That is not a type of justice.  It is a very serious matter and it will, in the minds of the ordinary people, lead to a disrespect of the law which will have serious consequences. To avoid this loss of time in the courts there should be some overhauling of the whole procedure and the Minister might well have brought in, in this Bill, <Col N="554" /> some powers to enable his Department so to do.</P>
      <P>However, the main purpose of this Bill, as I see it, is to do away with the temporary justices and to have the power to increase the number of justices if necessary.  If there is congestion to which the Minister has referred in some of the courts in Dublin and throughout the rural areas then everything is in favour of permanent justices rather than temporary ones. Temporary justices are just like temporary teachers in any school; they cannot give full satisfaction, they cannot devote their whole time to their subject and they do not command the same standing as the man who can be there and occupy all his time in that work.  A temporary justice, as far as I can see, is a solicitor or barrister who is taken from his ordinary work and put on to the Bench where the rules are reversed.  Having performed for some time in that capacity he then reverts to his former position of again coming before the Bar of the courts.  He has perhaps certain advantages in that respect in so far as that he has been a district justice and is likely to obtain a better hearing from the then sitting justice than some other of his colleagues. On the other hand, he has the disadvantage of being very embarrassed since he is once more appearing in the ranks in court rather than on the Bench.  On the whole, the idea of temporary justices is, I think, repugnant to the proper execution of the law and the proper carrying out of justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would be very much in favour of the idea of reducing the number of temporary district justices and of increasing the number of those permanently engaged on that work.  With regard to the question of the proper age, it is undoubtedly a fact that we had expressions of opinion in the House much in favour of the age of 65. Deputy Boland said that most of the members of the Labour Party, when he was Minister, were in favour of drawing the line around that age.  I remember that in 1943 this question was raised very largely in regard to local government officials and vocational education teachers.  I put up the <Col N="555" /> plea at that time&mdash;I think it was a valid plea and has as much weight in the case of district justices as it has in the case of teachers&mdash;that there could be no hard and fast line.  There should be some method devised of standardising, testing or finding out what is the efficiency of a man when he comes near some set age limit, but that his retirement should not be automatic. Some men are dead from the neck up when they reach 55 and should really retire.  The same is true of some in public life, and yet they hang on the benches here.  Here we are dealing with people in responsible positions who are concerned with the administration of the law and with the whole life of the country.  I think that a case can be made out for not sticking too strictly to one given line at 60 or 65. Some of the greatest judges that I have read about delivered most of their best judgments when some other people of their age were in their dotage.  The matter is a very difficult one unless the Minister is able to compile an intelligent test to be applied to these justices.</P>
    <P>I am not very much enamoured of the idea of going before the Chief Justice with a doctor's certificate to certify that a man is then able to do his work for another year.  I think the Minister might reconsider getting some better method of overcoming that difficulty. It is a real difficulty.  Some district justices should be retired before the age of 65 if they prove incompetent or that they are not efficient or cannot do their work, while others who, in the opinion of some board or some impartial authority are able to continue, should be permitted to continue for a certain number of years later than 65. I think that is an eminently reasonable common-sense plan, and I commend it to the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister might revise his proposal with regard to going before the Chief Justice.  It may be that it is the best he has been able to think of.  No matter how august the Chief Justice may be, or how high his position in the judiciary, that proposal in the Bill does not appear to me to be entirely satisfactory. No matter who the Chief <Col N="556" /> Justice would be, unless he was a hanging Jeffreys or someone like that, he would have sympathy with a man coming near the age when he has to retire.  The position would be as difficult for any other set of men or even for the Minister himself.  As it is impossible, I suppose, for the ordinary Deputy to think out any better formula than that before us in the Bill, we are back, I am afraid, to the position that we have to accept what the present Minister for Justice has devised as a temporary expedient to overcome this problem.  On the whole, therefore, though I have doubts about the method of operation of the age of 65, I think that we, in this section of the Government Party, welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">

      <P>The question involved in this Bill is really one of principle, and a difficult one of principle at that.  Like Deputy Boland, I want to ask the question, why should this House reverse itself in relation to this one aspect of State administration and in respect of one profession?  Why should we make this exception with regard to this one case?  We have, over a period of years, uniformly adopted a certain policy in regard to public servants, and I use the term &ldquo;public servants&rdquo; in its broadest sense.  The previous Government introduced very drastic age limits in the case of the Army.  They were introduced because the circumstances warranted them; and, in regard to public servants generally, an age limit is in operation.  The general principle has not been challenged, and apparently was recently reiterated by the Minister for Health.  Why, therefore, should there be a sudden reversal of engines?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of the legal profession, is there anything specific about the profession of the law and the profession of the courts, so to speak&mdash;I am using the word &ldquo;profession&rdquo; for want of a better one&mdash;or is there anything in any facade of court administration, of the law, that calls for such a reversal? I think that we should ask ourselves that question in a calm, contemplative state of mind.  I have used the words &ldquo;reversal of engines&rdquo; deliberately. Volume 102 of the Official Reports contains the debates on the Courts of <Col N="557" /> Justice Bill, 1946, which dealt largely with this question of district justices. There is enshrined in that measure the principle of a retiring age of 65. Now, it is significant to note that the Bill was accepted in principle by this House and by all Parties in it because, if one refers to column 215, one will see that the Second Reading of the Bill was agreed to.</P>
    <P>There was no division.  Therefore the principle of that Bill was accepted unanimously by this House, and by all Parties in it, in 1946.  If one turns to the Committee Stage one will see that various amendments were moved.  The discussion on the Bill was altogether on a proper plane.  Amendments were moved and were argued upon reasonably. One will see from the record that many of the amendments were divided upon.  In other words, when there was a clear divergence of opinion between, notably, the main Opposition Party at that time&mdash;now the main Government Party&mdash;and the then Government, and where, so to speak, the difference of opinion was not resolved in debate, matters were pressed to a division.  There were a number of divisions on these matters.</P>
    <P>However, when Deputy Cosgrave, the present Parliamentary Secretary, moved to substitute an age limit of 70 for an age limit of 65, the debate on that amendment commenced at column 383.  The amendment was not pressed to a division, so that the inference to be drawn is that this House unanimously accepted the principle of an age limit, and the difference between 65 and 70 was not regarded by that Party at that time, or by other Parties in the House, as being of sufficient importance to call for a division, notwithstanding the fact that other matters in the Bill were divided upon. Therefore I am, I think, warranted in concluding that there was unanimous acceptance of the principle of an age limit at that time and that even on the question as between 70 and 65 the House finally unanimously accepted the provision of the 1946 legislation.</P>
    <P>What is the case for reversing now in regard to the appointment of district justices?  Let us face the arguments pro and con.  Immediately one can say that in the case of a lawyer it <Col N="558" /> is mental alertness that counts; that that does not deteriorate normally as quickly as physical fitness; that a man may be competent to discharge such duties at a later age than he would be competent to discharge duties calling for physical effort; that appointment to such office is bound to be relatively late; that experience and maturity are bound to be assets.  All reasonable arguments of that nature can be advanced in favour of extending the age limit there, if one wishes so to do. On the other hand, equally cogent arguments may be advanced in favour of maintaining a uniform limit for all services.  One can immediately ask, why is not the experienced Departmental officer to have the same length of service as the experienced justice on the Bench?  As far as the physical equation is concerned, the situations are comparable and experience and faithful service are as necessary in that category as in any other.  One can pursue it that way and then one finds that there is another argument.  It was expressed, as a matter of fact, rather aptly by Deputy Davin of the Labour Party on that very amendment to which I have referred and on which there was not a division.  He said, at column 384 of the Dáil Debates:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Apart altogether from that, there is a recognised rule in the public service&mdash;and in my opinion it is a very good rule&mdash;that all public servants should retire at the age of 65. I do not see why any exceptions should be made in the case of judges or district justices to that very proper rule.  If we are to solve the problem of unemployment in this country&mdash;I do not say that we will solve it to any great extent by employing more of the legal profession on the Bench&mdash;there must be a recognised rule in regard to the age of retirement from the public service and from public service companies.  I fully support the present position.  I hope the lawyer Deputies will not press this to a division.  If they do, and the Minister stands over the 65 rule, I shall go out with the Government.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is an equally strongly arguable case to the other side, very concisely <Col N="559" /> put.  Finally, one can make up his judgment on that point by balancing the pros and the cons and personally, having done that, I should be inclined &mdash;and I think I must definitely so express myself now, I should decide&mdash; to come down on the side of the uniform age limit even in this case, unless a very specific and extraordinary case can be made the other way.</P>
    <P>So much for the principle.  Why do we reverse in this Bill?  Why does the Government bring in an exception in regard to the legal facet of State administration, granted, a very important one indeed.  What is the case for a specific exception here as against others?  I feel a sufficient case has not been made out and in a reversal on a question of principle of that nature, even if I were to feel that there was a strong case to be made in this individual instance, I would immediately ask myself, where shall we be logically and from the point of view of the confidence of the community&mdash;and democratic Government has its roots in the confidence of the community.  Where are we going to be if we are later faced with exactly the same pleas that can be made in this case for extending the service of district justices, in respect of the Army, the Civil Service, teachers, the police, in regard to practically any category you may care to think of?  Upon what grounds shall we differentiate?  Upon what grounds could we differentiate and still preserve that balance as between all people that democratic Government must preserve if it is to maintain the confidence of the community as a whole and if it is to retain democratic forms as a working institution?</P>
    <P>This is the first step.  Therefore, let us face what ultimately is involved. There is a question of principle here. I am not suggesting that it is a morally or objectively binding principle but it is a principle in the sense of being a guiding line.  As in all questions of principle, whether fundamental or merely working rules, one must look to the consequences of an infringement. We are now going to infringe for the first time upon a principle that has been accepted unanimously by this <Col N="560" /> House, with very broad ramifications. Let us, therefore, in making our decisions on this matter fully realise what is involved in this.  Let the Government realise that now they are taking the step, that they through the agency of the Minister for Justice, are taking this step.  Where is it going to stop or can such a differentiation in principle be made as between the case specifically contemplated in this Bill and the general case in regard to such matters as I have already mentioned. It is only right to stress that because, fundamentally, that is the reason, and that is the only reason, for my part, that this Party is opposing this Bill in principle.  On that matter the question of individuals is beside the point.  It is regrettable that in all problems of this nature you will find that some very good men are about to retire.  In this case there is the specific problem and, let me be fair and let me say it, there is the specific problem that very often the best justices may not be appointed until relatively late in life and therefore there may be pension difficulties. I would subscribe to what has been suggested by certain other speakers in this debate that the way to deal with that is to deal with the pension rights. It is worth while paying for efficiency, integrity and knowledge in the case of such an important court as the District Court and the preferable way of handling the matter is to let the age limit operate and to deal with it properly on a pension basis.  There could be a case made here in favour of discrimination, namely, the frequently late date of appointment.</P>
    <P>There is one other objection which I did not hear but I understand that Deputy Collins referred to it.  I want briefly to refer to it now.  Apart from the broader aspect, what we are doing here is to throw the onus on the Chief Justice.  I quite subscribe to the view that the Executive should have very little control over judicial functions, and there is a case for not having such power in the Executive at all.  Generally, I agree with the people who hold that view, but I do not think it right to throw the onus of this on the Chief Justice.  The Chief Justice is the head of the judiciary and is, so to speak, the head and the symbol of the <Col N="561" /> impartiality and universality of our law and should not be left to deal with such matters as the appointment of personnel. He should be shielded and protected from having to take decisions which would bring him down to the level of competition between individuals.</P>
    <P>It is, I submit, fundamentally wrong that the Chief Justice, charged as he is with the guardianship of what I called the integrity and universality of the law, should be asked to come down to making individual decisions of this nature with the consequent odium and criticism which must necessarily attach to such decisions no matter by whom they are made.  I think that principle would be disastrous.  Our courts, particularly our superior courts, have always stood separate and apart from any influence of the Executive.  There has never been a breath of suspicion that anything was done in them but justice according to the law.  Here we are making an inroad, a dangerous inroad, by imposing a function on the Chief Justice that will expose him, no matter how well he exercises that function or were he a Solomon, to criticism, and in the measure of the criticism and odium which he attracts in the exercise of such a function will the dignity and importance of his office before the people deteriorate.</P>
    <P>I am surprised that a Government which is graced by lawyers of distinction, a Government which numbers in its Cabinet three lawyers of eminent distinction, should countenance the coming before this House of a Bill which is fraught with such potential danger.  From the point of view of the administration of justice as a whole and the whole principle of the exclusiveness of the courts&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>The three lawyers should stop a country yob from bringing it in.  You have said it very nicely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh no, but it was a shock to me from a Party so largely composed of lawyers who have fought as the Taoiseach and the others fought so consistently&mdash;and I think there is a lot to be said for their arguments&mdash; for the judiciary.  In imposing such an administrative function involving the selection, the favour if you like, as <Col N="562" /> between individuals, you are bringing the office of the Chief Justice into a sphere that attracts odium and discrimination, and, to that extent, you are endangering the position which that office holds and the superior courts with it.  I may seem rather vehement in that view, but it is because I think that we should in regard to this Bill realise with our eyes wide open that we represent the people here and that our function is to preserve the balance equally between all, and that from our decisions follow consequences.</P>
      <P>It would be better for the Government to come in and say one of two things.  They could simply say that the age limit was to be 70 and let them make a case on that.  I have given some arguments and Deputy Davin has epitomised the arguments against it.  It is, however, definite and does not infringe upon the Supreme Court or upon the Chief Justice and there would be no ramifications through breach of the principle.  We could argue about it or agree to it and if the Minister made a good argument for that specific case, he would not meet with the opposition which he is meet ing at the moment.  That would be one solution and it would be a definite clean solution.  The other is, as has already been suggested, to deal with it on a pension basis.  There again you can make a specific case without going into the dangerous ground which this Bill of necessity brings us into.  So much for Section 2.</P>
      <P>The question of the number of district justices is a moot one and it will always be to some extent difficult to find the correct balance in this matter. One would have hoped that the number of justices would have decreased with the passing of emergency legislation.  On the other hand, I think it would be infinitely preferable for us to have the courts and to divert certain types of disputes to be determined in these courts rather than to have the system which has grown up all too easily in modern times in this country and elsewhere of leaving judicial powers to the executive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Talking purely personally, I am not in a position to express an opinion on sub-section (3) for want of facts beyond saying that the people who think that <Col N="563" /> the District Court has not enough to do are probably mistaken.  Again in the absence of information, I am not prepared to be more definite than that.</P>
    <P>The bone of contention of this Bill is in Section 2 and even if the Minister feels that the limit must be extended for these justices or if he feels that on the restricted grounds that they would, so to speak, evacuate themselves more quickly than others when pressure decreases in the future, I would strongly urge upon him, even on the Committee Stage, to come in with a clean, straightforward Bill to amend section so-and-so of the 1946 Act by putting in the word &ldquo;seventy&rdquo;.  I think it would be infinitely safer than what the Minister is doing not only for himself where the Guards are concerned but in practically every other Department of the State, through the form and intention of that section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>For a very simple Bill this has generated a good deal of controversy.  The principle that I wanted to establish with this was that the judiciary should be independent and I felt that it was not possible for a temporary justice to be independent of the Executive because his reappointment depends upon a whim of the Executive.  I felt when we must have temporary justices that we should get rid of that as quickly as possible. For that purpose an examination was made as to how it could best be done and it was felt that the simple direct method of doing it this way was the best and the simplest way.  There is a need for it in that we have a great number of district justices who unfortunately are ill and the number of temporary justices required will be at least two all the time and by appointing these we get rid of that difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that the Leader of the Opposition took a very reasonable view.  We are examining this matter carefully and there will be a Bill introduced as soon as possible extending the jurisdiction of district justices and reorganising the districts.  I am there up against a very positive difficulty, because an extension of the districts may mean a worsening of the existing <Col N="564" /> district justices' terms of appointment They may rightly argue that this is an interference with them.  We hope that by reasoned thought on their part and reasoned thought on the part of the Department of Justice we will be able so to reorganise the districts and the work of the district justices in the country that we will not require the 42, but as far as we see at the moment there is no possible chance of doing with anything less.</P>
    <P>We have cases in arrears in the City of Dublin and elsewhere that should not be in arrears.  As regards the taking of depositions, there are people in prison and on remand for considerable periods and it is unfair to them. They cannot be released or dealt with until the depositions are taken.  For that reason it is very essential that we get the number required.  That is the main and only reason for bringing in the Bill.  When the question of appointing two justices arises we will be then running up against a situation in which there will be people quite fit to act as district justices, and the principle has already been accepted that in the City of Dublin district justices can and do and will operate up to the age of 70, and the Government have the power, if a justice is able to speak Irish in the Gaeltacht and is capable of acting as a district justice, to extend his service from year to year until he is 70.  I do not think that is quite a good principle because that district justice is practically in the position of a mendicant to the Government and he should not be.</P>
    <P>Having consulted my legal advisers &mdash;though I do not depend on my legal advisers exactly for advice in this matter&mdash;the case was put to the Government that it was felt that the Chief Justice would be a reasonable person to decide whether or not a person was capable not only on a doctor's certificate but mentally, of carrying on the work of a district justice.  In that way we would be removing from the Executive any power it might have over the district justice.  I believed I was establishing a very excellent principle, but the Opposition have indicated that in their opinion I would be establishing a rather peculiar principle. I have no doubt that the Chief <Col N="565" /> Justice in this country will always be a person with so much integrity that if anybody tries to fling mud at him, such as was suggested by Deputies on the Opposition Benches, it will not stick.</P>

I think that is all quite reasonable and I do not see anything objectionable about it.  I think there is a reasonable ground for it.

There used to be a committee consisting of the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court and the Attorney-General, where complaint could be made in the case of irregularities on the part of a district justice.  It is hardly fair to put a responsibility of that kind directly and immediately on one person, as the personal element becomes too obvious. We would like to have a little more time to consider it.

I do not know if it could be accepted by the House now. That is the only one which occurs to me.  Instead of a single individual, a committee would be more satisfactory and it would be better to have such a group.  I understand there is such a group already for considering certain cases.  It is there for another purpose. If the Minister would agree, it would be wiser to do this.  He can easily see the sort of pressure of various kinds that might be brought.  I do not say that it would influence the individual or that he would not do his best, but still we are all inclined to be very soft in these cases.</P>

I am anxious to get this Bill through, but in the public interest I want to see it as good as it can be. It is not a simple matter by any means, nor a trifling matter, but one of considerable importance in the public interest. My suggestion is that this group of three, which formerly met for disciplinary purposes, could act.  The district justice could make his application to the Chief Justice and the Chief Justice could arrange to have the others meet him and consider the case. The Minister for Justice could put before them the facts that he would put before the Chief Justice.</P>

Now that we have been beaten on the principle and that the axe does not fall at 65 definitely, I want to see that the machinery for extending the age as good as we can make it.  I do not think it is fair to have an individual responsible in a case like that, where it would be very much better to have a group of three.

      <P>I wish to make a few remarks on this Estimate.  I am particularly interested in the reduction of £30,000 in the Estimate for heating and cleaning.  I have been amazed to learn here that the old custom of having the children clean the schools is still in existence in some of the rural areas. I can only attribute that to lack of funds to employ a person to do that <Col N="573" /> work properly.  It is amazing that that old custom so reminiscent of the Ascendancy days should still obtain in the year 1949 and should have continued under two native Governments. I remember in my young days school rooms choked with clouds of dust and children using the most primitive methods of cleaning them. From the health point of view one can understand how injurious that is particularly in the case of delicate children.  Instead of reducing that sum the Minister should increase it so that a proper person might be employed to look after the heating and the cleaning of the schools.  The wage of such a person would not be very high in the rural areas.  It is easy to get people to undertake that work in those areas. That should be done.  There is a permanent caretaker in the vocational schools.  There are far more pupils attending the primary schools than the vocational schools.  Why should provision not be made for them?  The primary schools get into a much worse state than do the vocational schools. The Minister has promised a general reform of educational methods.  He is setting up a committee to improve the present methods.  I think the heating and cleaning of the schools should be one of the principal matters to be considered by such a committee.  We hear a good deal about the health of the children.  If children have not got clean schools and homes we can hardly expect them to be healthy men and women in later life.  If we had clean schools and clean homes there would be much less need for sanatoria. There is a duty on those in charge of education to look after these matters. I hope the Minister will give the problem of heating and cleaning our schools sympathetic consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I disagree with the remarks made by Deputy Mrs. Redmond last evening on the evils arising from the education of our children through the medium of Irish.  I have some little experience of children at school in rural Ireland.  I can honestly state that they have suffered no disadvantages whatsover through being taught through Irish.  I know plenty of teachers and they tell me that they have never met children who had any difficulty in learning Irish <Col N="574" /> any more than any other subject.  If children are dull in other subjects they will naturally be dull at Irish, too.  In homes where the parents are not sympathetic towards the language and where there is no love for it the children will naturally be disinclined to learn it.  In some of our cities and towns there are parents who would rather hear their children speak the King's English.  It is sad to think that an Irish woman would decry our native tongue in our own Parliament.  The Minister has a fluent knowledge of the language.  He was the best choice the inter-Party Government made when they appointed him Minister for Education. While he is Minister for Education we can be assured that there will be no slackening in the teaching of the language.  If the children did not learn Irish in the schools where would they learn it?  There are some who believe that the Gaeltacht will keep the language alive.  The amount of money spent on the Gaeltacht has been reduced and naturally the people will not have the same interest keeping the language alive there.  If that happens the language will die.  A people without a language is not worthy to be called a nation.  I appeal to the Minister not to let the language die.  Our children at school have a fairly good knowledge of it now.  The people on the whole are interested in it.  Their children will be the parents of to-morrow and they in turn will teach it to their children.  It is shocking that there should be people in this State who would try to cause antagonism towards the language by public speeches and propaganda.  That is deplorable. I appeal to the Minister to do all he can to strengthen the language and propagate its use in every home. I often wonder what those children would say if some Minister for Education decided that subjects should be taught through the medium of French or Italian.  Possibly they might think that an improvement.  There are some people who think that Irish would spoil their children's accents.  I know people who are old and middle-aged now who thought they had covered wonderful ground when they had learned the first and second book of O'Growney.  I believe that our Irish <Col N="575" /> boys and girls will continue to learn Irish despite all the propaganda. Foreigners on the streets of Dublin always converse, with each other in their own language.  Why should we be afraid to speak our language even if we only have a smattering of it?  I hope that this is the last time on which I shall hear Deputy Mrs. Redmond decry the teaching of our language.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise that Deputy Mrs. Redmond has a perfect right to give her views on the question of the teaching of Irish and its preservation and, realising that, I think we can safely assume that there is no necessity for Deputy Mrs. Rice or any other Deputy to urge upon the Minister for Education the necessity for doing everything possible to ensure that the Irish language is taught in the schools and to secure its preservation.  I think Deputies will agree that the Minister for Education has at all times proved himself a real champion of the revival of the Irish language and it is only a waste of time to ask him to do everything possible to maintain it in the schools.  I am sure Deputies also will agree that the teachers, as one of the most patriotic bodies in the country, will, themselves, without any compulsion whatever, do their utmost for the preservation and advancement of the Irish language.  There are, of course, differences of opinion amongst teachers and various educationists as to the best methods by which the language should be taught in the schools, by which it should be preserved and made as quickly as possible the spoken language of the people.  While it has been more or less the policy of the Department that subjects should be taught through the medium of Irish, where certain conditions exist, the vast majority of teachers hold that the language can best be preserved by teaching it as an ordinary school subject, but as an obligatory subject, of course, and that only where Irish is the home language of the children should subjects be taught through the medium of Irish.  Great difficulty has arisen in areas outside the Fior-Ghaeltacht from attempts to teach infants solely through Irish.  However, certain concessions <Col N="576" /> have been made from time to time and it is really left more or less now in the hands of the teachers to deal with the teaching of Irish in accordance with the views which they themselves may hold as to how best it may be done.</P>
      <P>As 90 per cent. of the children of this country must be content with the education they receive in the primary schools, I think everything possible should be done by the authorities concerned to remove every obstacle which may impede the educational progress of the children.  I do not suggest that the present Minister for Education can remove all the impediments with one stroke of the pen.  In fact, I am delighted to be able to say that, during the short time he has been in office, he has done very many things which are likely to remove many of these difficulties and finally to bring about the realisation of the demands of those who are likely to know best the methods by which Irish education can be advanced.</P>
      <P>Taking some of the factors likely to improve education in this country, there would be, first of all, a well-paid, contented and fully qualified body of teachers; secondly, well-built, well-equipped, well-heated and well-cleaned schools; thirdly, an ideal system of directorship or inspection and fourthly, a suitable and well-balanced curriculum. The question of teachers' salaries, being at present dealt with by the salary committee, need not be referred to by me but we do hope that the findings of that committee will be implemented by the Minister as soon as possible after they have been placed at his disposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the schools, very many of them, as everybody knows, are in a shocking condition and are entirely unsuitable for the education of children. We must realise that during the emergency period very much could not be done in the building of new schools or even in the repair of old ones.  During the past two or three years some advance has been made in this respect. I would ask the Minister that in the case of very many schools, which are not entirely in a most dilapidated condition awaiting the building of new schools, certain necessary repairs <Col N="577" /> should be carried out in order to make these old schools some way habitable in the intervening period.</P>
    <P>A great deal of difficulty exists as regards the heating and cleaning of schools.  It is assumed that the managers are responsible.  Of course that responsibility, because of the conditions which prevail, really falls on the teachers.  This is the case especially in rural schools.  After all, managers, I suppose, have no funds at their disposal apart from the grant they get from the Department of Education but that is entirely inadequate.  Furthermore, the grant should not be given on the basis of the average because if we take an instance of a school where there would be an average of 85 and where there are two rooms, these two rooms must be heated and cleaned to the same extent as a two-roomed school where the average might be only 25 or 30.  Therefore the method of allocating grants for the heating and cleaning of schools is entirely wrong and it is about time that something was done to remove this black spot in the field of education.  I think it would be a good idea, perhaps, if the Minister, having before him the success of the conference which brought about the panel system in connection with the retention of assistant and junior assistant mistresses, were to call together a conference of managers, teachers and of representatives of the Departments concerned&mdash;Education and Finance&mdash; to try to hammer out some scheme by which the heating and cleaning of schools would be placed on a proper basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>It is becoming a serious matter and I think the time has come when something must be done <Col N="578" /> and done quickly to remedy it.  I need not refer to the system of inspection at present in force but I think I remember the Minister in his statement last year mentioned that inspectors would no longer be known by that name but would be known as directors of education. I think it would be a good thing if he made an Order or regulation to enforce that.  In the past there was much friction between teachers and inspectors and it would be a good thing if the actual name were changed.  It might help to bring about more harmonious relations although I will say that the complaints are not now by any means as numerous as they used to be once.  As regards the programme, some Deputies, when mentioning subjects which should be taught in schools, referred to the teaching of agriculture, domestic economy, rural science and so on.  If those people were put into an ordinary national school and asked to teach those additional subjects they would find that the whole work of the school would be turned upside down and that it would be impossible to carry out any such programme.  As it is, when we speak of the teaching of Irish it includes oral Irish, reading, grammar, explanations of various kinds and written Irish.  The same applies in the case of English.  So when you speak of Irish alone, it is really three subjects at least and the same applies in the case of English.  Then geography, history, singing and other subjects must be taken into consideration.  It would be utterly impossible to carry out a programme in the course of the year if you had these other subjects as well.  Besides, it would be impossible to expect teachers to supply the equipment for the teaching of these subjects.  As it is, lady teachers have a real grievance in that they have to supply material for needlework and so also is the case with domestic economy teachers.  There is no use in thinking, that any extra subjects could be added to the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies have mentioned that the children of the present day are not as well taught as the children of the past. In the past, very many years ago, you had mostly the three R's&mdash;reading, writing and arithmetic, and perhaps <Col N="579" /> geography, too.  There was quite sufficient time, of course, to teach those subjects well.  The children of those days may have had a better knowledge of those subjects than is the case nowadays, but my experience, and I think the experience of all teachers, is that the children of the present day have a better general knowledge.  They may not have such a particular knowledge of a particular subject but, on the whole, they are better equipped for the future than were the children of the past.  I think that there may be one thing mitigating against their education, namely, lack of parental control.  In our young days parents saw to it that children learned all their lessons and did their homework, but I am afraid that all that is a thing of the past now.  We see children in the villages and towns, and I suppose in the cities too, roaming about late at night when they should be at home under the control of their parents. However, I suppose we can pass no legislation or say or do anything that would remedy that state of affairs. Perhaps it would be for the Church to interfere in that instance.</P>
    <P>The Minister abolished the system of rating during the past year.  I was very surprised to hear Deputy O'Rourke who, I understand, is a national teacher, remark that he did not think it was fair that teachers who had been highly efficient for years would now be placed on the same level as teachers who were not so efficient. The teachers who have been highly efficient for years have not lost anything by reason of the fact that rating is done away with.  They still hold the salary to which they could attain.  Does Deputy O'Rourke realise, when he makes that remark about highly efficient teachers, that he is saying something very derogatory in regard to teachers who are efficient?  After all, the line between efficient and highly efficient in any school is very thin indeed.  I was pleased to see that efficient teachers were at last raised to the standard which they deserve, not so much from the &ldquo;highly efficient&rdquo; point of view as that all teachers who work satisfactorily will receive the same salaries.  One portion of the <Col N="580" /> rating system is still in operation, and that is the giving of merit marks in respect of special subjects.</P>
    <P>Another matter which is a source of difficulty to teachers is the primary certificate.  It is held that children who are only 14 years of age are not really fit subjects to undergo a pretty difficult examination.  If there is to be such an examination at all or if there is the necessity for such a certificate&mdash; which perhaps there is&mdash;the time at which the examination should be held is when the child is 16 years of age.  I hope that at some future date, when the Minister is likely to raise the school-leaving age, an alteration will be made in regard to the primary certificate examination to the extent that that examination will take place at the end of the higher primary course, as I may call it, for children between 14 and 16 years of age.</P>
    <P>I was very pleased to hear the Minister for Finance in his Budget statement to-day make provision for increased pensions for our pensioned teachers.  I should like to thank the Minister for Education for having put forward a long time ago a scheme making provision for those increases. I am sure that these poor old men and women, many of whom have very small pensions, will be delighted to learn that from a certain date they will receive a substantial increase in the miserable pensions some of them have been in receipt of in the past.  I hope it will be made retrospective as far back as possible.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Minister that he has the confidence of the teachers.  During his term of office he has been doing his best and we feel sure that before his term of office expires he will remove all difficulties and grievances from the paths of the teachers, primary, secondary and vocational, which impede the progress of education in this country. A contented body of teachers is certainly likely to do better work than those who would be hampered at all stages by various difficulties with regard to salary, conditions of service, etc.  Therefore we may look forward to a period when the children of this country will be as well educated as the children of any country in the world, <Col N="581" /> and, as has been said, the progress of a nation depends on the education of its people.</P>

    <P>Nuair a théann an cigire thart agus nuair a fheiceann sé droch-staid ar an scoil, ba cheart go ndéanfadh sé tuarascáil faoi leith i dtaobh na scoile sin agus go gcuirfeadh sé ina luí ar an Roinn gur ceart rud éigin a dhéanamh, rud sealadach, go dtí go bhféadfaí rud seasta a dhéanamh.  Tá mé ag tagairt anois do Scoil Muigh Inse i bparóiste Cárna.  Sin é an ceann is measa a thagann i mo chuimhne anois ach tá cinn eile ann freisin.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom an tAire a mholadh de bharr an deontas do Thaibhdhearc na Gaillimhe a mhéadú agus tá súil agam go mbainfear an buntáiste is mó is féidir as an méid sin airgid.  Tá dream inniúl i bhfeighil na Taibhdhearca, ach, mar tá fhios ag an Aire, is beag is féidir a dhéanamh i dtaobh drámaíochta mara féidir dream seasta a chothú.  Tagann daoine óga go hOllscoil na Gaillimhe ón nGaeltacht nó tagann siad ag obair i nGaillimh ach imíonn siad arís.  Nuair a fáightear daoine maithe ba chóir go mbeadh sé ar chumas lucht stuírtha na Taibhdhearca na daoine sin a choinneáil mar fhoireann seasta.  Sin é an rud is mó atá ag coinneáil an Taibhdhearc siar. Mar gheall ar sin, molaim an tAire faoin méadú sin a thabhairt don Taibhdheare.</P>
    <P>Ceann de na bealaí is fearr le labhairt na Gaeilge a chur chun cinn an drámaíocht chéanna, agus ós rud é go bhfuil mé ag tagairt don drámaíocht, tá gaol gar idir an drámaíocht agus na scannáin agus ní maith liom a fheiceáil sa Mheastachán seo go bhfuil airgead na scannán gearrtha anuas.  Tá dhá chinéal deontas airgid ann agus tá ceann aca gearrtha ó £2,000 go dtí £1,000 agus tá an ceann eile, £2,500, beagnach glannta amach ar fad.  Is é mo thuairim gur ceart don Ríaltas, pé ar bith Ríaltas a bheas ann, cuidiú le daoine atá ag iarraidh scannáin i nGaeilge a sholáthar.  Chonnaic mé roinnt acu, na cinn bheaga, agus bhíodar an-mhaith; bhí an Ghaeilge antsoiléir agus rinneadh na scannáin ar ábhair stairiúla.  Bhain ceann aca le Fr. Damien agus ceann eile le scéal tús ghearradh na bolgaí agus rudaí eile mar <Col N="583" /> sin.  Bhain ceann eile le geáitsí móra mara a bhí ar siúl ar chóstaí Mheiricá, rudaí a thaithneódh leis an aos óg. Bhíodar go léir go han-mhaith agus ba mhaith an rud é dá soláthraítí tuille dióbh sin.  Tá deis in áiteacha anseo agus ansúd na scannáin a thaispeáint. Tá ceann fáighte le goirid ag na Bráithre i Leitir Fraic agus bíonn léiriú aca chuile Dhomhnach.  Ní dóígh liom gur scannáin Ghaeilge a bhiós acu mar ní dóigh liom go bhfuil siad le fáil acu.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom freisin, rud eicínt a chloisteáil ón Aire faoin treoir a cuireadh amach le goirid ón Roinn go dtí na múinteoirí sa nGaeltacht Béarla a mhúineadh níos fearr.  Má cuireadh, níl mé ag cur in aghaidh an ruda sin, ach iarraim ar an Aire treoir eile a chur amach, a ghabhfadh leis an treoir sin, labhairt na Gaeilge a mhúineadh a bhfad níos fearr taobh amuigh den nGaeltacht.  Rinneas tagairt dó sin ceanna.  Bhí mé ag labhairt le múinteoirí taobh amuigh den nGaeltacht a bhfuil spéis acu sa nGaeilge agus dúradar, maidir leis an <i>Primary Cert.</i>, gur tugadh an-iomarca aire do scríobh agus léamh na Gaeilge agus go raibh labhairt na Gaeilge fágtha beagnach i leataoibh. Má tá an t-ullmhú don teastas sin ag cur isteach ar labhairt na Gaeilge sna scoileanna, ba mhaith liom go mbreathnódh an tAire isteach ann agus go n-athróchadh sé an clár.</P>
    <P>Is iomaí sin tagairt a rinneadh ar an Meastachán seo le dhá lá anuas don nGaeltacht agus tá fhios ag muintir na Gaeltachta go bhfuil dualgas orthu féin i dtaobh na Gaeilge, ach deir siad liomsa: &ldquo;cén mhaith do mhuintir na Gaeltachta bheith ag cothú na Gaeilge don náisiún mura dteastaíonn sí ó mhuintir na hÉireann?  Cén fáth an mbeadh muide ag coinnéail ár gclann siar&mdash;&rdquo; adeir cuid acu&mdash;&ldquo;mura bhfuil meas ar an oidhreacht atá againn.&rdquo;? Tá muintir na Gaeltachta ag coinneáil, ag caomhúint, ag sábháil agus ag cleachtadh na Gaeilge ar mhaithe le muintir na hÉireann agus má brúitear isteach ina gceann nach dteastaíonn sí uathu, fágfaigh siad an Ghaeilge ar leataoibh.  I ngeall air sin, táim ag iarraidh ar an Aire labhairt na Gaeilge sna scoileana taobh amuigh den Gaeltacht <Col N="584" /> a spreagadh níos fearr ná mar atá á dhéanamh faoi láthair.</P>
    <P>Baineann sé sin le ceist chuspóir an Rialtais.  Chuir an Teachta Donnchadh Ó Briain ceist ar an Aire.  Táim ag ceapadh gurb é sin an pointe is mó, chomh fada agus a bhaineas an Meastachán seo le hathbheóchaint na Gaeilge.  Níl mise ag rá go bhfuil an dualgas sin ar fad ar an Aire Oideachais, ach tá páirt mhór ag Aire an Oideachais san obair.  Chomh fada agus a bhaineas seirbhís ar bith le saol na Gaeltachta is ceart ceist a chur ar pé ar bith Aire atá i mbun na seirbhíse sin.  Cuidím mar sin leis an Teachta Ó Briain sa gceist sin a chuir sé ar an Aire i dtaobh cuspóirí an Rialtais.</P>

      <P>&mdash;ach in aghaidh iompó mhuintir na Gaeltachta ar Bhéarla.  Ba mhaith liom a rá le muintir na Gaeltachta go bhfuil pé ar bith eolas atá uathu ar mhaithe lena gclann le tabhairt dóibh ag pé ar bith Rialtas a bheas i mbun na tíre, ach ba cheart don Rialtas bheith chomh díograsach céanna faoi labhairt na Gaeilge taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht.  Is minic a chuir mé ceist ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta i dtaobh na cainte a chuala mé féin go minic go raibh an Ghaeltacht ag dul siar agus go raibh muintir na Gaeltachta ag eirí as an nGaeilge, agus <Col N="585" /> nuair a chuir mé féin ceist orthu fuair mé an freagra seo: &ldquo;Is mó an tsuim, is mó an spéis, a chuirfimis i muintir na Gaillimhe, muintir Baile Atha Cliath, nó muintir na gceantracha amuigh dá bhfeicfimis iad ag brú isteach go dtí cinema nó áit ar bith eile a mbéadh Gaeilge ar siúl ann ná bheith ag tabhairt léachta dúinn fhéin i dtaobh an Ghaeltacht a shábháil agus Gaeilge a labhairt i gcónaí le n-ár gclainn.&rdquo; Isé mo thuairim go bhfuil an iomarca den teagasc á thabhairt do mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus gan sampla dá réir á thaispéaint dóibh ag na daoine ar an taobh amuigh.  Tá siad ag breathnú go han-ghéar ar na daoine amuigh agus tá siad chomh cliste le dream ar bith sa tír.  Sin é an fáth gur chuidigh mé leis an gceist a chuir an Teachta Ó Briain ar an Aire i dtaobh cuspóir an Rialtais.</P>
      <P>Maidir leis an gComhairle Oideachais, bhí fhios agam féin ó chaint a chuala mé go raibh go leor daoine sa tír agus bhíodar den tuairim nach ceart bacadh leis an gceist sin, Comhairle Oideachais a chur ar bun ach leis an Ghaeilge a chur d'réir a chéile as chlar na scoileanna agus deire a chur láithreach leis an rud sin ar a dtugtar &ldquo;compulsory Irish.&rdquo; Ar ndóigh, níor thug an tAire&mdash; caithfidh mé sin d'admháil ar a shon &mdash;aon mhisneach do na daoine sin agus, dá mbeadh sé de dhánaíocht agam mo thuairim fhéin a thabhairt dó i dtaobh na ceiste sin Comhairle an Oideachais, sé mo thuairim go mba cheart gan bacadh leis beag ná mór.  Ní fheicimse go mbeidh toradh ar bith as comhairle mar sin ach dreamanna a bhfuil `fads' aca a theacht le chéile agus pé'r bith easaontas atá sa tír i dtaobh ceisteanna oideachais is amhlaidh a dhéanfadh dream mar sin i bhfad níos measa é.  Isí an chéad ceist a bheadh mar chnámh spáirne eatarthu ceist seo na Gaeilge, go mór mór an rud ar a dtugtar &ldquo;compulsory Irish.&rdquo;  Níl aon &ldquo;compulsory Irish&rdquo; ann ach chomh beag is tá &ldquo;compulsory Arithmetic&rdquo; nó &ldquo;compulsory&rdquo; rud ar bith eile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ag labhairt anseo dom ar son muintir na Gaeltachta (mar tá Gaeltacht an-mhór im cheantar), táim <Col N="586" /> chun mo thuairim a nochtadh arís i dtaobh an meas atá agam agus ag go leor daoine eile ar sheirbhís an oideachais mar leigheas ar ghalair na Gaeltachta. Má tá muintir na Gaeltachta le fanacht sa tír seo teastaíonn an t-oideachas uathu.  Tá aithne agam ar dhaoine a fuair postanna maithe sa tír de bharr an oideachais a fuair siad tré scoláireachtaí.  Más féidir é mholfainn go gcuirfí tuille airgid ar fáil le teacht i gcabhair ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta ar an gcaoi sin.  Ní dóigh liom go ndeachaidh aon phinginn amú&mdash;nó is fíor-bheag de&mdash;den airgid sin a caitheadh ar lucht na scoláireachta. Tá an-obair á dhéanamh ag oiliúint daoine mar oidí scoile agus tá siad-san arís ag déanamh an-obair amuigh faoin tír ag múineadh na Gaeilge don aos óg.  Ar chuma ar bith, teastaíonn an t-oideachas uathu.  Ba mhaith liom, más féidir é, go gcuirfí tuille meán-scoltacha ar bun.  Tá a trí nó a ceathair curtha ar bun le blianta beaga anuas ag na Siúracha agus na Bráithre.  Tá péire sa Chlochán agus tá siad ag déanamh obair anmhaith iontu.  Tá ceann ag na Siúracha sa Spidéal agus in Uachtar Ard freisin. Dá mbeadh tuille de na meán-scoltacha seo ann is mór an chabhair a thabharfaidís do na daoine atá ag fágáil na mbun-scoleanna.  Dúradh liom nach raibh an Roinn sásta le tairiscint a cuireadh chucu ag na Siúracha i gCarna.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I was rather surprised at Deputy Palmer's statement with regard to the teaching of agriculture in the schools.  The prosperity of this country is mainly dependent on the land and therefore some agricultural education should be given in our rural schools.  When I was at school there were two books on agriculture, one in the third class and one in the fifth class.  I think that not alone should there be books on agriculture in the country schools but also in the city schools so as to give our boys and girls some knowledge of the background of agriculture.  I think it is rather a strange thing that there is no book on agriculture used in the schools throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not going to repeat all that has been said about the teaching of Irish, but I often wonder why it is that we do not hear more Irish spoken outside by the school-going children and by those who have left school.  I know children who got honours in Irish in school and it is sad to think that there is difficulty in getting them to speak Irish now.  I have tried to find out what is the prejudice against the Irish language.  I am inclined to think that we have lost all our idealism with regard to the language.  It appears to be spoken only by those who feel that they are going to get somewhere owing to their knowledge of Irish.  So far as my knowledge goes, some of the teachers are very good at teaching Irish and go to great pains to impart a knowledge of it to the children.  I must pay a tribute also to the Christian Brothers because, whenever they meet children, whether inside or outside school, they will not speak to them except in Irish.  I think that is very helpful in getting the children to speak Irish.  Once the children leave school and go to work in a factory or a shop or anywhere else, you will never hear any of them speak Irish.  I think, therefore, that a good deal of propaganda is necessary to encourage the children going to school and those who are leaving school to speak the Irish language.  It is rather disappointing <Col N="588" /> when you see children getting honours in Irish in school and not making use of it in conversation afterwards.</P>
    <P>As to the question of the cleaning of schools I should like to know on whom to place the blame.  Even if they are old-fashioned there is no reason why they should be so filthy and so badly kept.  I had some experience in the City of Cork for two years in succession and the contrast between some of the schools is just appalling.  I read a medical officer's report of County Cork. He had one report after another about the condition of the schools.  It was shocking for anybody in this country, as well as anybody from outside, to read what that medical officer had to say about the cleanliness of the schools and the shocking condition of the sanitation in many of them.  I believe it is not the responsibilty of the Department of Local Government or the Minister but of somebody in the area.</P>
    <P>Another matter I should like to refer to is the handicap to the boy or girl who is going to the national school. I know there are schools where there are 63, 64 and 65 children in a class. I just cannot help wondering what are the chances of finding out the latent talents of the brilliant boy and girl and giving them a chance of making some advancement.  I consider that boys and girls in the country schools are handicapped in getting education for higher posts in the Civil Service as compared with the boys and girls in the city schools.  In some of the schools in Cork the children are picked out, put into a class and one teacher concentrates on that class.  As time goes on they are sorted out and the less brilliant boy is left out of the class. In other words, they specialise in scholarship.  What chance has a national teacher to do that when he has to look after 60 or more children in one class?  It is unfair to the children; they are not getting an equal opportunity.</P>
    <P>Any boy or girl with talent should be able to get a university education, and the economic position of his parents should not stop him.  I hope the time will come when we will reach that stage in this country.  I know <Col N="589" /> of boys and girls who reach a certain stage and cannot get any further owing to the financial position of their parents.  I think it is up to the Minister to pay attention to this matter. I am not going to repeat what most of the speakers have already said, but I do say that the teaching of civics to the children in the schools and of giving lessons on their conduct and obligations to the community are as important as anything else.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHarris" hpid="Mr. Harris Mr. Harris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harris</NameTxt>
      <P>I have heard Deputies speak of the 50 or 60 children in a class with one teacher.  This must apply to city schools that I know nothing about. When I heard those Deputies speak of the difficulties of doing their work with very large classes the thought struck me of the difficulties and the handicap of teachers in schools in rural areas.  In a small school where there is one teacher he probably has to deal with 30 children of five or six different classes.  In a two-teacher school one teacher has to deal with three or four different classes.  I know parents in the country who are anxious to get a sound primary education for their children and they have given a good deal of thought as to how best they can get that primary education.  They take an interest in their children and find out what they are doing at school. They meet the teachers and ask them what progress their children are making.  They make inquiries as to how they could help.  I believe the teachers in those schools are greatly handicapped in comparison with their colleagues in large schools in cities and towns who do not have to deal with so many different grades of children.  In many parts of the rural areas a teacher in a small school is not in a position to do his work efficiently, no matter how well inclined he may be.  I know several teachers who are very conscientious, who have vocations for teaching and who complain of how impossible it is for them to do their work as they should.  If they do not have the cooperation of the parents the most that some of them can do is to give their classes and depend on the cooperation of the parents who are willing and able to help out the children <Col N="590" /> at home at night as best they can. Many parents are not able to do that.</P>
      <P>In those rural areas there are parents who are anxious to give their children some primary education.  They know it is impossible for the teacher in those small rural schools to give them that efficient training, and I see children of tender years injuring their health by pushing bicycles in an endeavour to obtain a good education at the larger schools four or five miles away in towns where they can get more attention. That is a condition of affairs which I think the Minister should attempt to remedy.  The children in the rural areas are not getting the same educational facilities as children in large centres of population where there are larger schools.  A teacher will try to get out of those remote rural areas and into a better school if he can. He knows that he cannot show the same results, he has not the same encouragement as a teacher may have in a big school.  I believe that it is all very unfair to the rural community. We want to keep the people on the land and the Minister should do something to see that the children in the rural areas get the same opportunities as the children in the large centres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the teaching of Irish, there are many parents in the rural areas who are anxious that their children should learn and become proficient in the use of the language.  I am afraid that some of the older teachers in small schools who have the difficulty of dealing with so many classes are not able to cope with the education of the children, so far as the language is concerned, in the way that they should.  I think the Minister should consider the appointment of itinerant teachers who would visit those schools and see that the language is properly taught.  There are many well-to-do parents who, I think, know very little about education.  Their idea is to let their child attend the national school until it reaches the age of 12 or 14, and then send it to a secondary school.  When the child goes there he begins to realise that he has not had a sound primary education, and without that, I believe, he is handicapped afterwards in life.  I do not think that we attach sufficient <Col N="591" /> importance to the question of improving our primary education.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hickey spoke about teaching agriculture in the national schools. I am a farmer, and I think that his suggestion is just nonsense.  I am of opinion that most of the parents in the rural areas would agree with me on that.  The farmer's son or daughter attending the national school does not need to be taught agriculture, but is sent there to be taught reading, writing and arithmetic.  The parent's idea is that his children should get a sound foundation of knowledge in the national school.  If the children get that, they can then proceed to the vocational schools which you have through the country, and there they will be taught rural science and agriculture. I was for some time a member of the vocational education committee in my county.  The teachers in these vocational schools complain that they are handicapped by reason of the fact that the children who come to them have not had a sound primary education. That is the weak spot, in my opinion, and I think the Minister should look into it.</P>
    <P>We have in the country many old schools which need to be replaced by modern up-to-date ones.  I think it is a pity that a number of them are not amalgamated.  If that were done it would give the teachers the same opportunity as the teachers in the towns have of carrying out their work efficiently.  That might mean the provision of transport for the children. Even so, I think it would be a step in the right direction.  For one thing, it would mean that the rural community would, so far as education is concerned, be provided with the same facilities as the people in the towns have.  The people in the country are suffering from enough handicaps at present and something on the lines that I suggest should be done for them so far as the education of their children is concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hickey mentioned that the children in the rural areas are handicapped at present by reason of the fact that opportunities are not provided to enable them to get into the Civil Service or to enter the professions.  Well, <Col N="592" /> I suppose if they feel that way, they are entitled to get the same opportunities as the children in the towns. I do know that, in the country parts, if there is a Civic Guard who has a young family he will be anxious to get transferred to a town where there will be greater facilities for the education of his children.  The people in the rural areas are dissatisfied.  They feel that there is no hope for them.  I think that if the Minister were to look into this question, and were to see that the children in the rural areas had the same opportunity for getting a good primary education as the children in the towns have, it would go a long way to bring more contentment into rural life.</P>

Tá formhór na gclamhsán sin mí-mhacánta mar tá caighdeán an oideachais sa tír seo níos aoirde ná caighdeán Shasana, an tír go mba mhaith leis na lochtaitheoirí aithris a dhéanamh uirthi&mdash;agus níos aoirde ná caighdeán Ameiricá freisin, is <Col N="593" /> íl aon chlár dhá-theangach sna tíortha an.  Má tá na páistí aineolach cionas s éiríonn chomh maith sin leo i scrúduithe na Roinne Oideachais gach bliain &mdash;idir bun-scoileanna, meán-scoileanna agus scoileanna Gairm Oideachais? Ag tagairt do mhúineadh trí Ghaeilge sa nGalltacht tá orm a rá nach bhfuil cothrom na Féinne le fáil ag na bun-oidí ná ag na hoidí Gairm-Oideachais sa mhéid seo.  Gheibheann na meánmhúinteoirí deontas faoi leith&mdash;timpeall £30 sa bhliain creidim&mdash; do mhúineadh trí Ghaeilge.  Nár cheart go bhfaghfadh na múinteoirí go léir an deontas sin?  Dá óige an páiste is ea is deacra an múineadh trí Ghaeilge sa nGalltacht agus is ar na múinteoirí náisiúnta a luíonn an t-ualach is troime.</P>
    <P>Molaim don Aire seasamh ar a bhonnaibh agus gan aon fhaillí a dhéanamh ar an obair uasal sin athbheochaint na Gaeilge.  Tá ár gCreideamh is ár dteanga fite fuaite trína chéile agus is iad araon an chosaint is fearr againn in aghaidh na mbaol atá go líonmhar nár dtimpeall inniu.  Do sheas ár sinsear leis na cianta in aghaidh géirleanúint na bPéindlithe agus in aghaidh gach ionsí eile dár tugadh orainn.  Ná bíodh sé le rá go ndéanfaimís faillí anois i dteanga Phádraig, Bhríd is Cholmcille, Bhrian Bóirmhe is Eoghan Ruaidh, Eoghan Ó Gramhnaigh is Pádraig Mac Piarais is na mílte dea-Ghaedhil eile atá imithe ar shlí na fírinne.  Dá bhrí sin ba mhian liom a rá leis an Aire&mdash;caith uait an spriúnlóireacht i gceist na Gaeilge agus i gcúrsaí oideachais, is b'fhéidir le cúnamh De go mbaistfear an ainm oirdhearc ar Éirinn arís a bhí uirthi in allód&mdash;&ldquo;Oiléan na Naomh is na nOllamh.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I wish to congratulate the Minister for the work he has done, for remedying some of the grievances to which I had referred and which were also referred to by other Deputies on this Estimate last year.  During the year I asked questions about various matters.  I will mention them again and I trust that, even though the answers I got at the time were not satisfactory, the Minister will again consider these matters and perhaps by this time next year they will be remedied.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="594" /> During the year I asked a question about the panel system.  I pointed out the hardships that were caused by this system and the Minister indicated to me that the system was accepted by the Irish National Teachers' Organisation and the managers and on account of that he did not propose to make any change in it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether it was devised or not, we will not argue about the word. The Minister says that it was devised and accepted by them.  It was a big step forward at the time.  Every step we take forward, no matter in what field of activity, is a good thing, but if we can go a bit further, if there are some obnoxious clauses we can remedy, why not move in that direction and take that further step?  I can draw an analogy between this and the action taken in the national field.  If we had not the Fianna Fáil Government in office and if we had not taken all the steps forward that we did take in relation to the Treaty that was imposed on us, we would not have advanced as far in the national field as we have advanced to-day.  When we did take those forward steps we had not all the flag-waving and all the ballyhoo that there was over the small step taken recently.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely drawing an analogy.  If we can go a step further in relation to the panel system it will be all the better.  The Minister has informed me that the managers and the <Col N="595" /> Irish National Teachers' Organisation accepted this, but I suggest that if we can go a step further it will make things easier for the teachers who are affected by this panel.  Why should we not be prepared to take that step?  I admit that the panel has given security of tenure to the teachers for the first time.  I know the heart-break it was to women teachers when they saw the average going down.  Some of them were married and had reared families and if they had not the average they had to go on the road the next day. Some of them were the bread-winners of the family.  That was a big heart-break to them, but under this panel they get security of tenure and now they know that if the average goes down they will not have to go on the road; they will be offered a position in the diocese in which they reside.</P>
      <P>But there are still grave hardships under the panel system.  In the diocese that I come from, Elphin, a woman teacher, if the average goes down, has her name placed on the panel and she can be changed from near Donegal down to South Galway or South Roscommon. The Scripture tells us that what God has joined together let no man put asunder, but I am afraid there are some officials in the Department of Education and they have no &mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

      <P>I resent that and I think if the Deputy has difficulties to put up for consideration and discussion he might put these difficulties in a clear, simple way.  I resent very much that anybody with an intimate knowledge of the working of the schools would attack anybody in the Department of Education.</P>

      <P>I certainly do that, but whoever is responsible for these panel regulations, if he knew the hardships, as I know them, that they are causing, he might have a different outlook. They are breaking up homes, I know from the teachers, and I have heard of different cases from managers.  I got several letters on the subject and I can show them to the Minister.  Some teachers have to go long distances to take up positions and they lose a terrible lot of money changing their furniture and so forth.  Homes have been broken up in this way and it is my belief that that is against the Constitution of the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister will allow me to make my point.  One suggestion is that the diocese should not be taken. There are deaneries within the diocese and I suggest that these should be taken.  If they were taken the teacher would not have to break up her home. I have already explained that the diocese of Elphin extends from near Donegal down to South Galway.  If the deaneries were substituted instead of the diocese a teacher who was transferred to a new school within the deanery could travel to that school either by means of her own car or by public transport.  That would be a definite improvement if it were adopted and it would relieve many of the women teachers of a good deal of worry at the moment.  Many teachers have lost money by opting to reduce their status down to junior assistant mistresses rather than break up their homes.  The managers are worried about this problem too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="597" /> I put a question down during the year in connection with residences for teachers.  Apart from the official residences we have residences built for teachers out of local funds or local contributions. The teachers in the latter pay high rents and rates for these. They do not qualify for the £10 grant that they get if they build their own houses or rent them from private landlords.  There are some of those in my constituency.  They are paying high rents and rates.  I understand that the official residences built by the Department and the Board of Works are held at a nominal rental.  In that case nobody grumbles because no rent allowance is made.  I would ask the Minister to look into the cases I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to deal at any great length with the question of compulsory Irish.  I heard Deputy Mrs. Redmond say that non-nationals should be exempt from Irish in our schools.  I hope she was not referring to the children of the hunting, fishing and shooting gang.  These are people who come back here to eat our food and enjoy our scenery and then skip so that they will not be contaminated by learning the language of the mere Irish.</P>
    <P>I want to deal now with the school buildings and their surroundings.  If we are to have contented teachers and happy, healthy children we must provide them with proper school buildings especially in the rural areas.  At the moment a big portion of the cost of erection is borne by the managers and by the people in the particular locality. Irrespective of who provides the money we should have clean, neat and tidy schools.  I do not want palatial mansions. I do not think it would cost much to put some of the existing schools into a proper state of repair. Some provision should be made to have them painted periodically.  Proper cement paths should be laid down going in to the schools and also to the out-offices. Proper sanitary accommodation should be provided.  Where water is not laid on tanks for collecting rain water could be erected.  Some effort should be made to improve the surroundings of the schools.  Trees and shrubs could be planted.  Instead of actually teaching civics, as was suggested <Col N="598" /> by one Deputy, the actual school and its surroundings could be used as an object lesson for the pupils.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the health of the children.  He said that he had a special commission examining the question of articulation.  He said that would have a beneficial effect on the health of the children because it would improve them by making them speak up and speak properly.  He said he would like to have physical training. Let us picture a primary school in rural Ireland for a moment.  In the summer time the boys could be provided with a football or hurley ball and the girls could play camogie during the daily recess.  That would help to develop their health.  <i>Mens sana in corpore sano.</i>  Recreation such as I have suggested would do much to improve the health of the children.  In the winter time when it is not possible to play in the open air provision should be made for them by means of the erection of an ambulatory where they could walk or march round during the recess.</P>
    <P>In the ordinary two-teacher school at the moment there are no facilities for the children.  The usual school consists of two rooms with a hallway in the middle.  The children walk to school, one, two or three miles.  The country roads are bad.  The children may get wet coming in.  They hang their wet clothes in the hallway.  They are in class for three hours and during the recess they all huddle together in this hallway with all their wet clothes hanging around them.  The teachers cannot leave them in the class-rooms because these must be ventilated.  As well as that the class-room is the only place in which the teachers can have their lunch.  I think it would cost very little to build a shelter of some kind where the children could play in winter-time.</P>
    <P>I do not want palatial schools but I do ask that they be kept properly heated and properly cleaned.  I am disappointed because of the reduction made in the Estimate for heating and cleaning this year.  I have had experience of the administration of these grants because I happen to come from a parish where the manager&mdash;and I am sure the Minister knows this&mdash;<Col N="599" /> has built a number of new schools. Nearly every school in the parish is a newly-built school or a newly-repaired school and, since the increased grants were given by the Fianna Fáil Government, there is a caretaker in charge of each school.  In a two-teacher school there is a £12 grant given by the Department for heating and cleaning. That is expended under different headings&mdash;so much for heating, so much for cleaning, etc.  It is very hard to get a caretaker for the amount of money that is left after these expenses have been met, even with the grants we had up to the present to do the work.  The school has to be cleaned out every evening and in winter-time fires have to be put down in the morning. Everybody will agree that it is most unhealthy for the children to keep them after ordinary school hours to do this work.  Now we have the position where these grants have been cut down and it will be very hard to get the work done in future, even in cases where managers were co-operating and getting people at cheap rates to do the job.  It will be nearly impossible to do it under the present grants and we shall have to revert to the position where the children had to do the work.</P>

The Taoiseach when he was paying tribute to the late Mr. Murphy &mdash;Go ndeanai Dia trocaire ar a anam&mdash; said he believed that the last words of the late Minister were as follows: &ldquo;I believe the first step is to remove a considerable section of the public from hovels and slums and to give them an opportunity of bringing up their children.&rdquo;  The Taoiseach then went on and said: &ldquo;He repeated the words, `their children', and died.&rdquo;&ldquo;Their children&rdquo; were the last words that the late Minister, God rest his soul, had on his lips and I would ask the Minister for Education to look after the second home of the majority of these children &mdash;that is, their schools&mdash;and to see that they are situated in proper surroundings and made as bright as possible, so that they will be an example to these children of what a home should be and an inspiration to them for the rest of their lives.</P>

Níl aon mhaitheas don Aire a rá nach bhfuil sé ciontach sa mhéid sin mar tá sé chomh ciontach leis an Aire Airgeadais.

      <P>Mar gheall ar an nGaeilge i scoil na naíonán, bhí baint agamsa leis an gCoiste a cheap an chéad chlár. Rugadh sa Ghaeltacht mé agus fuair mé oiliúint ar scoil i mBéarla.  Nuair a thángas ar scoil ní bhfuair me aon oiliúint ach amháin tré Bhéarla. Annsan, léas leabhar ar conus mar a déantar lucht imirce do mhúineadh i scoileanna Nua Eabhrach tré Bhéarla.

Cumann na nGaedheal ba bhun leis an rud san i dtosac.  hOileadh breis múinteoirí ar feadh 12 bliain fé choimirce Chumann na nGaedheal.  Do chaith siad sé bliana&mdash;ceithre bliana i scoil oilúna agus dhá bhliain i scoil mhúinteoireachta&mdash;agus ansin sé bliana ag obair.  Nuair a tháinig Fianna Fáil isteach, chuir siad feabhas ar an scéal. I gCiarraidhe, i nDún na nGall agus i nGaillimh chomh maith, na contaethe as a dtagann muinteóirí, bhíodar lán de mhúinteoirí oilte gan post.  Bhí Fianna Fáil ró-aibidh.

Tá sé déanta in Alban leis na blianta agus cuirfear i bhfeidhm é i Sasana an bhliain seo chugainn agus ba cheart dúinne tabhairt fé chomh maith. Bhí an Teachta O Loingsigh ag dímholadh na mic léinn dul isteach go dtí na meánscoileanna agus do mhol sé go ndéanfaí iad do chur isteach i gceard-scoileanna.  Is dóigh liom gur mhaith an rud é sin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not satisfied that enough attention was paid to vocational education in this debate.  I contend that the vocational school is the poor man's college.  Until we get vocational education on some sort of a sound footing we will get nowhere with our young people in this country. I have heard a good deal about primary education, higher education and graduation from the various schools. The ordinary man in the street will not, unfortunately, take advantage of the benefits of vocational education in regard to trade and so forth.  If we do not pay attention to that aspect of the matter I think our educational system will go to a higher plane and we will not have enough space for the higher educated people in this country. We want to get the poor man's child trained.  If he gets, say, two years' training in a vocational school this young lad could be apprenticed to some contractor.  It is being done in the motor trade, but it has not been done in the building trade nor in the carpentry trade either.  I heard some Deputies in this House saying some time ago that they could not get tradesmen in Dublin.  They could&mdash;plenty of them&mdash;but the union people will not admit young men who come up from the country.  They will not let them into their labour union and therefore no person will work with them.  That is what is holding back your building and your various works in the City of Dublin.  I do not want everybody to come to the city.  I want people trained in the country because we in the country want things too.</P>
      <P>I come from the borders of West-meath and in that district the population is, unfortunately, going down. We have nothing there but big white bullocks.  We have to reduce the standard in our schools there, say, 35 to 25. Some person will ask the Minister for Education to reduce it still further. We require a motor car in various places.  That facility has been provided in other districts.  We need to have those children who have to travel four or five miles to school carried to some central school that will be kept going.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was sorry last night to hear the language decried.  I consider that that <Col N="606" /> is a very great mistake.  I happen to have school-going children and I want to hear them speaking the national language.  The only way they can be recognised abroad as Irishmen is by their language.  What is the use of talking nonsense?  In any other Parliament in the world no language other than the native language would be listened to.</P>
    <P>We were to build three schools in County Longford, but the Minister has sanctioned only one and that is a vocational school in the Granard area. A school is needed in Ballymahon and another in Ballinamuck where we have a big population, thanks be to God, and where we fought the best battle of all.  We want to get that school in the Ballinamuck area.  That area will supply good scholars and fine fellows&mdash;do not be a bit uneasy on that score.  I should like the Minister to sanction those two schools.  I am not on that committee now.  I could not attend to all the committees I was on. I have to attend to my Parliamentary duties.  I want to make an appeal on behalf of the old teacher pensioners some of whom are in a very bad way.</P>

      <P>Fuair an Teachta Conchubhar Ó Liatháin locht orm os rud é nár labhair mé i nGaeilg agus mé ag tabhairt isteach an Meastachán seo.  Tá súil agam nár thug mé drochshompla uaireanta&mdash; agus an deaghshompla a thug seisean agus mórán eile, dhom san díospóireacht a bhí ar siúl.  Raghaidh an deaghshompla sin i bhfeidhm orm.

    </Speaker>
    <P>Nuair a bhí an Teachta MacPhárthaláin ag caint dhein sé tagairt do mhórán rudaí.  B'fhéidir go mba chóir dom tagairt a dhéanamh dó anois. <Col N="607" /> Bhí sé ag chur síos ar an nGaeltacht agus dúirt sé gur cuireadh rial amach le déanaí i dtreo is go múinfear an Béarla níos fearr san nGaeltacht anois. Ní fheadar ar aon chor cad atá ina cheann mar gheall air sin.  B'fhéidir gurb é an rud atá ina aigne ná, mar adúrt nuair a bhíos ag tabhairt an Mheastacháin os comhair na Dála, gur cuireadh Ordú amach chun fiosrúcháin a dhéanamh ar an uchtach cainte atá ag na páistí agus feabhas a chur orthu i dtaobh labhairt an Bhéarla san nGaeltacht:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Os annamh a bhíos caint na ndaltaí go sásúil de leith cruinneas foghar agus soiléiréacht urlabhra, fiú amháin sna dréachta a bhíos curtha de ghlain-mheabhair acu, iarrtar ar gach cigire tuairisc ghearr le haghaidh an Aire a sholáthar faoin gceist roimh Nollaig, agus tagairt a dhéanamh do na pointí seo:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(<i>a</i>)  Na lochta is coitianta ar urlabhra na ndaltaí (i nGaeilge agus i mBéarla);</P>
    <P>(<i>b</i>)  Fáth na locht sin; (bhfuil aon bhaint ag faitíos roimh pionós leis an locht sin);</P>
    <P>(<i>c</i>)  An méid is féidir a dhéanamh chun na lochta sin a leigheas;</P>
    <P>(<i>d</i>)  An áit a bhfuil urlabhra na ndaltaí go sásúil, conas a thárla go bhfuil?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is féidir a rá, b'fhéidir, gur Ordú é sin atá ag iarraidh feabhas a chur ar labhairt an Bhéarla san nGaeltacht, ach ní dóigh liom gur cheart aon eagla a bheith ar éinne san nGaeltacht nó in aon áit eile sa tír go ndéanfadh Ordú mar sin, feabhas mar sin, díobháil don Ghaeilge, mar má labhrann siad an Béarla níos soiléire labharfaidh siad an Ghaeilge níos soiléire más í an Ghaeilge a dteanga féin.</P>
    <P>Tá fógra eile ann a cuireadh amach agus b'fhéidir gur cheart an tOrdú sin a chur os comhair na Dála toisc an chaint i dtaobh na Gaeilge a bhí ag an Teachta agus ag Teachtaí eile. Cuireadh alán ceisteanna orm faoi cad é cuspóir an Rialtais i dtaobh na Gaeilge agus dheineas iarracht a dhéanamh amach ón Teachta O Briain <Col N="608" /> agus an Teachta Bartley cad a bhí ina naigne mar gheall air sin.

      <P>A number of questions of a general kind were dealt with.  A number of Deputies were anxious to know what is being done by the Minister for Finance with regard to the teachers who were pensioned before the scales of November, 1946, came into operation. The Minister will give the fullest details of the general plan with regard to that when replying to the debate on the General Financial Resolution. Generally it is that, with a certain condition with regard to service of a particular kind, these teachers with less than £2 per week will have their pensions increased from 1st April by 50 per cent.  Those with pensions between £2 and £3 will have their pensions increased by 40 per cent.&mdash; they will not lose at the lower end of the scale, they will get as much at the lower end of their scale as they would get at the higher end of the £2 scale&mdash; and those with £3 a week and upwards will get an increase of 30 per cent., with a limiting provision that no increase of pension under the scheme shall operate to raise the income to more than £450.</P>

      <P>From 1st April, the beginning of the financial year. Reference has been made to certain matters, such as the Council of Education and the school-leaving age.  I have indicated quite clearly that it is my intention to set up a council of education. Different opinions have been expressed about that.  Some Deputies do not want it, some want it in a particular way and some want it in other ways.  Deputy Cowan indicated that he did not want a council of education which would do away with Ministerial responsibility to this House.  On the other hand, he wanted a Bill which would define both the structure and the powers of the council.</P>

      <P>I asked Deputies before to give me my head in regard to this.  I would strongly recommend to the House to keep a grip on their Minister for Education; to have a person <Col N="614" /> who would be responsible to the House.  Let him get the best advice he can and see that he does get the best advice he can so that he will be closely in touch with every aspect of the practical work of education, on the one side, and closely in touch with the religious authorities who are the managers and the controllers of education in the country and whom we want to keep in that position.  We have a very satisfactory position between the Church and the State.  Magnificent work is being done by teachers in various parts of the country in technical, primary and secondary education.  A lot of that work is unknown and, in the public agitation which goes on about certain aspects of education, a lot of it is completely ignored and forgotten.</P>
      <P>I want a council of education which will raise the educational ideal, create an educational climate, give Irish talent and Irish capacity in the schools a chance of coming out and co-ordinate that effort so that the administrative machinery maintained and controlled by Parliament will be fully informed and will faithfully serve the ideals of our people in regard to education. That council will have very many problems to deal with because we are at a very difficult and very important point in educational development.</P>
      <P>References that have been made to the school-leaving age are evidence of the anxiety of our people.  They feel that our children are not long enough in school; that they do not get a finishing touch of a practical kind to fit them for the life in front of them.  The raising of the school-leaving age raises very many serious problems which require the most careful and experienced educational thought to be brought to bear upon them.  The first thing that it brings you up against is the curriculum. If you are going to raise the school-leaving age compulsorily to 15 or 16 years of age, then you are immediately up against the question of the curriculum of the schools from 12 years of age and upwards.  At any rate, the curriculum of the primary school and the post-primary school will have to be very fully reviewed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then there is the question of the provision of teachers and the provision <Col N="615" /> of school buildings; where you are going to have the additional schooling carried on; whether you are going to have it carried on in the primary schools or as a development of the primary schools or as a development of the technical schools.  All these things have to be very fully considered in a country in which religion is the foundation of our whole educational system.  Religious ideals and the religious point of view must be maintained fully and completely through the whole course of education which will be given up to 16 years of age.  We have, by co-operation with the Hierarchy and the local clergy, seen that religious instruction is given in the technical schools, as it is in the other schools.</P>
    <P>We have a very big and important problem to be settled there and it can be settled very constructively.  I want to have selected from amongst our educationists a council of education that can sit in consultation with the Minister in connection with that particular type of development in our whole educational system.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that I have had difficulties with people in setting up the Council of Education.  I have not. The only thing that is delaying me is a sense of the importance of the work to be done, the desire I have to envisage it in the widest possible way and be ready to meet the council of education and guide them and take their guidance in seeing that the whole of the educational problem involved from 12 to 16 or 18 years of age is fully envisaged at this important hour of our national and economic life.  Therefore there is no point in my going further into details.  I can put proposals before you and I would put proposals before you for increasing the school-leaving age at the present time. The Commission on Youth Employment, the chairman of which is His Grace the Archbishop of Dublin, sent an interim report to the Department some time in 1944 indicating that they were going to put forward as one of their proposals when they reported that the school-leaving age be increased. It might be suggested that with that warning, in Dublin at any rate, an extension of building either <Col N="616" /> for primary schools or technical schools should be gone ahead with. However, apart altogether from the difficulties of building in the last four years, I do not think that any Minister for Education envisaging the whole problem would move in that particular matter until he had received the report of that commission.  If the commission had found it necessary to arrive at a decision to make a communication like that to the Minister for Education they must have had a lot more to say and I think it would be important to have the report of that commission before taking any positive steps towards making any changes in the system.  I think I did say before that the previous Minister for Education had a Departmental review made of the possible changes there ought to be in the educational system from, say, 12 to 16 years of age.  I have not considered that any purpose would be served by making any publication of those Departmental suggestions because I think that any suggestions made in that Departmental report which was prepared shortly before I took office had better be discussed by a council of education in close consultation with experienced officers of the Department.</P>
    <P>I would ask Deputy McCann and others not to come here and, in the most public spot in Ireland, complain of dilatoriness on the part of the Department of Education lasting over four, five or six months when they have not taken the trouble to make the slightest representations to myself.  It is quite unfair and most unbusiness-like. If there is any educational establishment, other than perhaps the headquarters of the I.N.T.O., that is closely in touch with the Department of Education it is the Vocational Education Committee's office.  There is hardly a day in the week and, at any rate, there is no week in the year when there is not full telephonic communication on quite a number of matters between the officers of the Department of Education and the officers of the Vocational Education Committee.  It is extravagant to charge the Department with being dilatory and not dealing with any matter in discussion with either the executive officers or the Vocational Education Committee itself. <Col N="617" /> I did receive a deputation recently from the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee and we discussed the whole of their programme for the next two years.</P>
    <P>It was agreed that the committee would proceed at once with three extensions in their existing day schools; one at Marlborough Street, Denmark Street and Aldborough Parade, North Strand.  These are for boys.  It was also agreed that they should go ahead with a new school at Clogher Road, one of the three regional schools they had in mind.  They also had in mind a regional school at Whitehall for boys and girls and one at Killester.  I suggested to them that they had plenty on hand, that they should go ahead with their three extensions and Clogher Road School at the present time and that they could come to a final decision as to the last details with regard to the school in Whitehall when they had gained experience in watching the advancement of the Clogher Road School to completion.  I do know that there is the completest possible understanding between myself and the Vocational Educational Committee in Dublin.  We are in close touch and we keep in close touch and I take the greatest possible interest in their developments.  It is a fact that pound for pound while Cork and other urban areas may get £4 of Government grants to £1 that comes from the rates, Dublin and Dun Laoghaire get £2 as against £1 that comes from the rates. No serious damage is done either to the interests or to the rights of Dublin, as far as I can see, in fixing the grants in that way.  Half of the £115,000 that the City of Dublin will be expending on their present work will be the responsibility of the State.  There is, I think, another £15,000 that the Dublin Committee propose to use but, if it is used in a particular way, half that amount will be refunded by the State, too.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe complained that there was a lack of educational facilities of a secondary kind in his area. There is a private secondary school for girls on the Crumlin Road but the development of secondary schools in the city, as in any other part of the country, is a matter of private initiative. <Col N="618" /> The position with regard to secondary schools is that they are all privately owned.  The State pays a sizeable grant in respect of children of particular ages with which the school is maintained and the basic salaries of the teachers paid.  The State provides whatever amount of additional money is required.</P>
    <P>The general complaint with regard to the dilapidation of schools and the State's responsibility in relation thereto is a very serious matter.  However, sometimes I feel that there is no part in this country where a person is able to straighten a slate on a roof. It seems to me that a great deal of the dilapidation that is complained of is dilapidation due to neglect.  There is no doubt that there is a certain foundation for the condemnation of some of the schools by the county medical officers of health but I feel that the neglect of our graveyards and the neglect of our schools have something very much in common and that a certain development of citizenship would result in the prevention of a great deal of that dilapidation.</P>
    <P>It is quite true that some managers have very serious responsibilities, and that these responsibilities and the cost of building their schools and maintaining their churches have become very heavy as a result of war conditions. To think that you can turn aside from local responsibility and local power to do the work of maintenance, repair and building and throw all the responsibility on some central machine is simply just to bury your local talent. The State cannot step in to do parochial work.  That can only be done by parochial persons, so that while I am quite satisfied that there is work here to be done that may throw additional cost on the State, and I am fully prepared to discuss the general problem with all those who have any responsibility for it, I do not face that discussion on the understanding that the State has to support all this.  I think it would be a very disastrous thing for the citizenship, for the character and morale in this country if parochial responsibility of this kind were simply thrown over on the State.</P>
    <P>The rule in the past was that the <Col N="619" /> local people had to provide one-third of the cost of a new school.  Up to a couple of years ago the actual figure that was provided was about 25 per cent.  In the last two or three years, it has come down to 17 per cent., down to 15 per cent. and down to about 13 per cent.  That is a point at which a scheme of assistance cannot be maintained.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The principal responsibility there is for the local people.  It is for them to see that the schools are going to be a credit to themselves and a credit to the neighbourhood in the same way as their churches are.  It is quite true that the condition in which a school is has a very powerful effect on the children, the teacher and the neighbourhood. Any neighbourhood that would tolerate its school being in a half-battered way is a neighbourhood that cannot flourish either intellectually or economically.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CormacBreathnach" hpid="Cormac Breathnach Cormac Breathnach">

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year the State paid 85 per cent. of the cost of putting up any school and of any substantial <Col N="620" /> improvements that were made in schools throughout the country, and the local people were asked to bear in respect of construction or improvements only 15 per cent.  However, there is a problem there.  It is a problem that can be solved, and it must be faced by a new orientation of mind in certain localities where there has been neglect.  No person can say that the State is not doing its part in making provision to meet it.</P>
      <P>The extension of technical schools has been discussed.  My difficulty in the matter of giving permission to increase the number of schools that are being built is that, from the point of view of licensing alone, I have been restricted to something like £500,000 as an annual expenditure.  I have had to earmark £300,000 of that for primary work, about £50,000 for secondary schools and £50,000 for technical schools.  Another £100,000 is money that is kept under the control of the Minister for Industry and Commerce for other aspects of school building that I may dip into from time to time but that I have not complete responsibility for.  The £50,000 is not a great lot spread over the technical schools.  I think that, on what is called a superpriority programme, I have rather spread myself a little bit more than I may be entitled to.  With a number of vocational education committees I have had quite satisfactory and quite understanding discussions.  I would be glad to deal with each vocational education committee in that way.  They are the people who are up against the practical side of life.  I have not found any want of reason or understanding in any of the various committees that I have had discussions with as regards their understanding of present difficulties.</P>
      <P>What I have said with regard to the maintenance of schools applies to heating and cleaning.  We pay half the cost.  The manager has to apply for it. There is no delay in making payment when the manager applies for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, there cannot be many cases.  I again emphasise that there has been no reduction in the amount&mdash;in the type of grants that are being made for the cleaning of schools.</P>
      <P>There has been a considerable amount of reference to the position with regard to Irish in the infants' schools and the changes that have been made.  I think it may be well to touch on that.  The original National Programme Conference in 1922 stipulated, with regard to infants, that &ldquo;the work in the infant classes is to be entirely in Irish&rdquo;.  The situation was reviewed by the Primary Programme Conference in 1925, and following an examination of the situation it reported as follows with regard to the National Programme Conference report:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;One of the leading characteristics of that programme is in its insistence on the principle of teaching the infant classes through the medium of Irish.  The members of our conference agreed on the supreme importance of giving effect as far as possible to this principle; and in confirmation of their belief they received authoritative evidence. It was argued with much weight that a `direct' method of teaching Irish, continued during the length of an ordinary school day for a few years between the ages of four and eight, would be quite sufficient&mdash;given trained and fluent teachers&mdash;to impart to children a vernacular power over the language, while, in the case of older children, it was shown that such a result would be more difficult of attainment.  The members of the conference were, therefore, at one in holding that the true and only method of establishing Irish as a vernacular is the effective teaching of it to the infants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With this point in view, we would recommend that the Department favour&mdash;it could not, for many evident reasons, make obligatory&mdash;the policy of having the infants entrusted to the best Irish teacher in each school&mdash;even if that teacher be the principal of the school. Having had much evidence before <Col N="622" /> us to the effect that the methods at present being followed in the teaching of infants&mdash;and especially in the teaching of language to them&mdash;leave much to be desired, we would also suggest that some wellqualified persons &mdash; inspectors or others&mdash;should be devoted, partially at least, to the duty of giving lectures, specimen lessons, etc., to such teachers throughout the country as seem to need this help.</P>
    <P>Yet, in this matter of teaching Irish to the very young children, it was felt by us that the principle of the motto <i>festina lente</i> is especially applicable.  The note, which in the national programme stood at the head of the course for infants, while in some cases it proved of the greatest utility, in other instances had some harmful results.  Its wording, being absolute and making no allowance for difficulties, made a literal obedience to it sometimes impossible, and often inadvisable.  Though assurances were given that the note would not be applied without discretion, it was left standing unchanged.  Consequently, it was sometimes treated as a dead letter; sometimes&mdash;more often&mdash;it resulted in inefficient teaching.</P>
    <P>We have, therefore, changed its wording; and we hope that in its new form it may serve as an indication to all teachers of what should be their aim, and at the same time serve as a practical direction and a sympathetic exhortation to those of them who are not as yet fully qualified in Irish.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The notes run:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The work in the infants' classes between the hours of 10.30 and 2 o'clock is to be entirely in Irish where the teachers are sufficiently qualified.  All teachers holding bilingual or higher certificates are regarded as sufficiently qualified, but the possession of such certificates is not regarded as an essential qualification.</P>
    <P>It is expected that the use of Irish for infants' teaching will be gradually extended until the stage is reached when, in all schools, the work of the infants' classes will be done entirely in Irish.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="623" /> That was changed in 1934, when the notes were made to read:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The work in the infant classes is to be entirely in Irish where the teachers are sufficiently qualified. All teachers holding bilingual or higher certificates are regarded as sufficiently qualified, but the possession of such certificates is not regarded as an essential qualification.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The position was changed in the notes issued in July of last year to read as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The aim of the infant school is to provide the atmosphere and background in which the child's whole personality may develop naturally and easily.  It should, therefore, take cognisance of the child's interests, activities and speech needs, and utilise them to the full in aiding and directing such development.</P>
    <P>The present programme positively integrates with this a further aim, that of giving to young children, from English-speaking homes, a vernacular power over Irish at an age when they are most adaptable and imitative and when their vocal organs are plastic.  Where the teachers are sufficiently qualified the aim should be to reach a stage as early as possible at which Irish can be used as the sole language of the infant school.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The change brought about in that way might be regarded as hearkening back to the 1925 programme, but it was really in order to bring the rule back into conformity with practice.  It was done in quite a number of schools in various counties and it was introduced into the programme that, where the managers wished it, English would be taught for half-an-hour a day.</P>
    <P>It is quite wrong to suggest that under these regulations Irish can be avoided as a language of instruction in infant classes.  Anyone in touch with children who are taught in two languages and with the work done in the infant schools, will know that after a few months in the infant schools where the work carried on is of a kindergarten kind, where you have a teacher who knows Irish and who knows how <Col N="624" /> to handle the children, the children begin to speak the Irish language quite naturally.  There would be few cases where, after six months, the work of the schools could not be entirely through Irish, so for the last one and a half years in the infant school there would be nothing to prevent satisfactory work being done through Irish where the teacher is competent to do it.  Where there are older teachers who have not the competency there are the younger teachers and the teachers now going out and they are perfectly well able to do their work through the medium of Irish.</P>

      <P>I do, and that is the thing that particularly offsets me with regard to conditions in the City of Dublin.

I will leave nothing undone that I can do to improve that particular side of things in the places where you have this particular problem.  I appreciate the dig that Deputy Breathnach gave me on this particular matter.  The dig will not do me any harm and may help me to do some good, but I do not think anybody could be satisfied that proper work could be done under these circumstances.</P>

      <P>I am unable to furnish the information requested by the Deputy in the first part of his question as copies of estimates have not yet been received from some local authorities. The total increase over the amounts for 1948-49 recorded up to the 30th April, in the amount of rates leviable by 27 county councils, 48 urban district councils and one county borough council for the year 1949-50 is £1,268,575.</P>
