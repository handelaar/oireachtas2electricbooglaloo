    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether he is aware that the Statute Book is cluttered up with laws that ought to be repealed, and that there is an urgent need for codification and revision of our criminal and civil laws, and whether he will indicate to Dáil Éireann whether the Government intend at an early date to put in hands the work of codifying and revising our laws and of making them easily accessible to the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is assumed that the Deputy intends to refer to the process of consolidation when he refers in his question to condification.  By consolidation is meant the bringing into one statutory measure all the existing law on any particular subject matter. Statute-law revision, while related to consolidation in general, is a separate step in the process, and refers to the repeal of the dead statutes.  Apart from the Fisheries (Statute Law Revision) Act, 1949, which was enacted on the 17th of last month, no Statute Law Revision Act has been passed by the Oireachtas since 1922; minor repeals have, however, been effected in the schedules to several of our enactments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that the Statute Book is cluttered up with laws which <Col N="2362" /> ought to be repealed and that a consolidation of our statute law is highly desirable.  The process of consolidation in particular is, however, a long-term one in which the results will not be seen for many years.  The matter was taken up some years ago and a scheme was formulated in which a law-publishing firm were to publish the statutes in force; the scheme would have necessitated the enactment of a number of Statute Law Revision Acts. Unfortunately, however, the law publishers did not proceed with the work, and no further action has been possible to forward the completion of this project.</P>
    <P>The parliamentary draftsman's office has undertaken the preparation of some consolidation measures&mdash;notably one in connection with the fishery laws&mdash;and the Deputy will appreciate from that consolidating Bill the tedious nature of the work involved.  This work in the parliamentary draftsman's office has to yield in priority to the claims of current legislation, but it is hoped that the work of consolidation and revision will be put on a more satisfactory basis with a view to achieving the end which the Deputy has in mind, and with which there will be general agreement.  I would reiterate, however, that the final result could not be achieved for years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach consider availing of the assistance of a Committee of the House in regard to that matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid a Committee of the House would be of no avail in connection with this matter. It is a highly technical matter, involving research by experts in the draftsman's office, and I think that it would not be forwarded by the services, however eminent the members might be, of a Committee formed from the House.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will, no doubt, realise that this question raises many difficulties and matters of wider application than those involved directly in connection with inshore fishermen. I shall, however, have the Deputy's suggestion examined in connection with certain proposals for the reorganisation of the inshore fishing industry which are at present under consideration by the Minister for Agriculture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach when it is expected that the results of the inquiry into the calculation of an Irish based cost-of-living index figure will be completed, and when it is hoped to be able to publish such figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost-of-living index numbers in use since the establishment of the State have all been based on Irish data.  No inquiry into the calculation of such an index number, to replace the present interim cost-of-living index (essential items), is at present being made but the question of inaugurating a national family budget inquiry with a view to the calculation of a new index number is under consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach recall that in 1947 an intimation was given to the House that an interim cost-of-living index figure was being prepared, that inquiries on a long-term basis were being carried on and that it would take probably two years to determine a complete and satisfactory figure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot recall exactly what the Deputy has referred to, but, doubtless, his information is correct. The advice I have from the Statistics Office is that the only possible satisfactory way of getting a proper index figure for this country is by the institution of a national family budget inquiry and we are considering that at the moment.</P>

      <P>Mr. Joseph O'Donnell, of Tiernee, Lettermore, County Galway, who received payment of unemployment assistance continuously from the 11th December, 1944, to the 14th June, 1949, was refused unemployment assistance from the 15th June, 1949, on the ground that he failed to comply with the statutory condition for the receipt of unemployment assistance which requires an applicant to be genuinely seeking but unable to obtain suitable employment.  His applications for unemployment assistance were considered on three occasions by the court of referees, and on each occasion disallowance of the application was recommended by the court.</P>

      <P>I should, perhaps, inform the Deputy that this man received unemployment assistance benefit, as I have indicated, continuously from December, 1944, to June, 1949, that his record in respect of work compares most unfavourably with all other persons in the area in which he lives, and that he was refused unemployment assistance benefit on application made as from the 15th June, 1949. He appealed against the disallowance then, and on two subsequent occasions his case came before the court of referees.  It was constituted of representatives of employers and of representatives of workers, with an independent chairman.  On three occasions that court, so constituted, recommended that unemployment assistance should not be paid to him as they were not satisfied that he was genuinely seeking work and was unable to obtain it.  On one of the occasions, when he appeared before the court to give evidence in person, he stated that he was required at home in connection with the spring's work on, presumably, whatever holding he has, and was not in a position to take alternative employment if it interfered with his being required at home for the spring's work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government (Mr. Corish) (for the Minister for Education)</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the necessity for the provision of extra school accommodation for children resident in the Monkstown Farm area was considered in June, 1948 and as a result of inquiries then made it was found that there was sufficient accommodation in existing schools in the locality for the senior children from this area within reasonable distance of their homes.  As regards the younger children, the accommodation available for infants in the nearest suitable school is inadequate, and the question of providing additional classroom accommodation has been taken up with the manager.</P>
      <P>In view, however, of the continued building activity in the Dún Laoghaire district generally, I am having further investigation made as to the requirements of the area in the matter of school accommodation.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether he is aware that since the abolition of the rating system for national teachers in April last, no payment of arrears has been made to those teachers who were upgraded as a result of this decision; and whether, in view of the fact that the increase in pay in 70 per cent. of the cases concerned involves the payment of upwards <Col N="2371" /> of £10 to each of the persons concerned, he will ensure that these arrears are paid without further delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy appears to be completely misinformed.  The position is in no respect as represented by him.  The regulations issued, following on the discontinuance of the award of the &ldquo;highly efficient&rdquo; rating for national teachers, indicated that, from the 1st April, 1949, all teachers who were giving &ldquo;efficient&rdquo; service on that date would proceed by annual increments to the appropriate maximum salary prescribed under the then existing scales for teachers rated &ldquo;highly efficient&rdquo;.  Teachers, who on the 31st March, 1949, were in receipt of a salary less than the maximum salary then prescribed for those rated &ldquo;efficient&rdquo; would, subject to the usual conditions, receive an increment on the revised scales on their next incremental date.  Teachers, who on the 31st March, 1949, were for at least one year in receipt of the maximum salary then prescribed for those rated &ldquo;efficient&rdquo;, received, subject to the usual conditions, an increment on the revised scales as from the 1st April, 1948.</P>
      <P>In no case, therefore, did the immediate increased salary benefit exceed the amount of an increment on the appropriate scale.  Payment at the increased rate of salary and, following on the abolition of the &ldquo;highly efficient&rdquo; rating, payment of principal's allowance at the higher allowance in the case of those not rated &ldquo;highly efficient&rdquo; has already been made to the teachers concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Motor vehicle parts are liable to duty at varying rates and are required to be shown on the customs entries under numerous import list descriptions.  As an economy measure the compilation of statistics of customs duty by reference to the separate import list descriptions was discontinued in 1939 and since that date receipts of duty have been recorded under the appropriate tariff heading only.  Motor vehicles complete, as well as their component parts and accessories, are in the main included under one tariff heading. Separate figures are not, therefore, available of the yield of duty from all imported motor parts and could not be complied without considerable difficulty and expenditure of time.</P>
      <P>It has been found possible, however, to calculate the approximate yield of duty in respect of one important category of imported parts, viz., complete or substantially complete aggregates imported for assembly purposes and entitled to admission at special compounded rates of duty.  I propose to have these figures circulated with the Official Report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if it is a fact that former <Col N="2389" /> members of the Royal Irish Constabulary who resigned on national grounds or were dismissed from that body for their support of the struggle for independence, and who are now employed in Government services, are penalised by having their pensions reduced in proportion to any cost-of-living increases awarded them as civil servants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The pensions granted to former members of the Royal Irish Constabulary who resigned or were dismissed from that force on account of their national sympathies are subject to the provision of Article 5 (a) of the Royal Irish Constabulary (Resigned and Dismissed) Pensions Order, 1924, which provides for reduction or withdrawal of pension if the pensioner subsequently takes service in a police force or is appointed to any office remunerated out of moneys provided by Parliament.  Provision for the suspension of pension on reemployment is a normal feature of superannuation legislation, and similar provisions apply to Civil Service and Garda pensions and to other pensions payable out of public moneys.  It would not be possible to make an exception to the rule in the case of Royal Irish Constabulary pensions, and I am satisfied that the application of Article 5 (a) of the Royal Irish Constabulary (Resigned and Dismissed) Pensions Order, 1924, is not in any way inconsistent with the procedure appropriate to other classes of State pensioners.</P>

      <P>Proposals similar to those mentioned by the Deputy have been referred by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe to the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation for detailed study. They have not so far been remitted for examination to the individual member countries of the organisation. The Government has shown its support in principle for measures designed to promote the free international convertibility of currencies by its adherence to the Convention for European Economic Co-operation, its signature of the Agreements for Intra-European Payments and Compensations and its active participation on the Council of Organisation for European Economic Co-operation in the discussion of proposals for the liberalisation of European trade and payments.</P>

      <P>The Press report referred to is tendentious in tone and inaccurate in detail.  The works at present in progress on Leinster Lawn are not designed to extend or increase the amenities available to members of the Oireachtas: their object is the provision in a suitable setting of a permanent memorial to Arthur Griffith, Michael Collins and Kevin O'Higgins in replacement of the temporary cenotaph which had to be removed some years ago.  The permanent memorial will be erected on the central site formerly occupied by the Albert Memorial which has been moved to a new position.  Certain incidental improvements in the layout of the lawn consisting of the removal of the unsightly air-raid shelters, the provision of flower beds, ornamental trees and a pond and fountain are included in the scheme, which is estimated to cost in all about £20,000.</P>

      <P>(1) Under the Labourers Act, 1936, a county council is required to place cottages in good repair before vesting them in tenants.  I have been informed by the county council that the delay in vesting cottages in South Kerry is occasioned by the exceptionally heavy demand by all tenants of county council cottages to have their cottages repaired.  The county council has now decided to give priority in the matter of repairs to cottages, the tenants of which have applied to have their dwellings vested in them.  This should expedite vesting operations.</P>
      <P>(2)  I am not aware that there is undue delay in the formulation of housing schemes for sites voluntarily offered which are suitable for housing purposes.  Proposals for the acquisition of a number of sites by agreement for grouped cottage schemes have been submitted by county council and decisions on these proposals will be conveyed to the council at an early date.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he will state whether any consideration has been given to the amendment of Section 78 of the Local Government Act, 1946, to enable local authorities to alter the names of public thoroughfares in accordance with the desire of the majority of those whom they represent, and thus terminate the position whereby one or two big ratepayers can impose their will on a much larger number of less highly rated occupiers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 78 of the Local Government Act, 1946, was designed to enable the appropriate local authority to change the name of a street with the consent of not less than four-sevenths of the ratepayers in the street, irrespective of the valuations of the hereditaments on which the rates were made.  Under the section and the regulations made thereunder each rate payer has only one vote.  The Minister has been advised, however, that the occupier, who is not also the owner of a house to which the Local Government (Rates on Small Dwellings) Act, 1928, applies is not a ratepayer for the purposes of Section 78 and accordingly is not entitled to vote.  It is not known whether this position has operated to prevent any local authority from changing the name of a street in accordance with the desire of the majority of the persons concerned.  The position has, however, been noted for consideration in connection with future amending legislation.</P>

    <P>NOTE: For the works marked * formal tenders were not invited.  The carrying out of these works (apart from cooking and surgical equipment, for which competitive quotations were obtained), was entrusted to a Contractor, who was working in the Sanatorium on a large contract for the erection of two forty-bed ward blocks, which he had secured in open competition. This course was adopted because of <i>(a)</i> the difficulties of having more than one contractor working in a very restricted sphere; cted sphere; <i>(b)</i> the nature of the different small works, most of which were of a piecemeal character; <i>(c)</i> the probability that tenders, if invited, would not be on a competitive basis because a Contr actor was already proceeding with major works at the Sanatorium.</P>
    <P>The building and installation works included in the items marked * were entrusted to the Contractor in question at the rates for the same or compara ble work to which he was bound under his contract for the erection of the two forty-bed ward blocks.</P>
    <P>&dagger;The equipping of these temporary staff homes at a cost of approximately £6,000 may be regarded as a first instalment toward the cost of the permanent staff home to which the equipment will be transferred in due course.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Deputy is aware that my functions relate to nurses employed by local authorities and that such nurses who hold permanent appointments are entitled to pensions under the Local Government Officers Superannuation code.</P>
      <P>Some of the voluntary hospitals already have pension schemes for their nurses.  I am aware that others have schemes under consideration, but the Deputy will appreciate that it is difficult to frame final schemes until the legislature has decided on the proposals contained in the White Paper on Social Security, which provide, <i>inter alia,</i> for retirement pensions for women at the age of sixty and involve contributions from the employee and the employer as well as the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>

In the town of Cashel, for instance, there is a difference of 7d. per lb. in the meat supplied to the county home and that supplied to the county hospital.  Does the Minister not consider the matter of sufficient importance to merit his intervention or, to put it another way, if the price is right is the meat right?</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware from statements which I have made in the House, I have decided, in order to make rapid progress with the hospital projects most urgently needed, to proceed with a limited short-term programme of building work for completion in seven years.  It would defeat the whole purpose of this scheme if the programme were to be overloaded by the addition of many projects which must rank as being less urgent.  For that reason I would not be prepared to approve of the building of a district hospital at Gort in the immediate future.  When the short term programme is nearing completion the whole position will be reviewed and the claims of districts such as Gort will be fully considered.</P>

      <P>With your permission, I propose to take Questions No. 138 and 139 together.</P>
      <P>The most recent development regarding the proposed new district hospital at Caherciveen was the discussion of the matter by the Kerry County Council on 14th November when, according to Press reports, a revised estimate of £124,775 for this hospital was under consideration.  On 29th November I inquired from the county council as to the reasons for the increase in the estimated cost of the project as compared with the previous estimate of £78,000. I have not received any reply so far.</P>
      <P>I think the Deputies will agree that for a 34-bed district hospital the cost given in the latest estimate must be regarded as unreasonably high.  Until I receive the information requested from the local authority and the possibility of securing economies is fully explored I would not feel justified in issuing instructions for the immediate completion of the planning and the preparation of contract documents which, as the Deputies will be aware, is necessary before tenders could be invited, a contract placed and the work started.</P>

      <P>On Section 2, I have two amendments to the Schedule of the Bill.  I am told by the Ceann Comhairle that they are out of order, that they seek to impose a charge and cannot be moved by a private Deputy. I should like to mention again some cases to which I referred last week. They come under sub-section (1) (a) of Section 2.  They belong to the class of lowly-paid pensioners.  I mentioned last week certain classes of junior assistant mistresses.  The type of case I have in mind is that of teachers who retired after the new scales of salary came into operation on, I think, the 1st October, 1946.  I gave one instance of such a pensioner who on retirement early in 1947 got a pension of £74 a year and the only addition she can get to that now is £15.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it would be possible for the Minister to provide that in the case of these lowly-paid pensioners, the minimum of 50 per cent. increase or at least a minimum of £50 would be paid. It seems also that there was a recommendation made on this particular point by the Roe Commission and that the Government has not accepted it.  If it is possible to soften the Minister's heart, I should like to appeal to him again in regard to these cases.  I do not know what extra expenditure would be involved but I think the number of cases must be very small.  The <Col N="2455" /> only thing I am pleading for now is that the 50 per cent. increase be allowed in the case of pensions awarded to junior assistant mistresses, who retired after the new scales of salary came into operation and who would not have, in the calculation of their pension, the full benefits of these new scales of salary.  When I mentioned the matter last week the Minister did not seem to be inclined to yield anything.  I hope that he has been able to examine the matter since and that he is now in a position to announce a change of heart on his part.</P>

      <P>I submitted amendments to this section which I thought would be in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However the amendments have been ruled out of order because there happen to be within that particular section officers of vocational education authorities, for one half of whose pensions the State is responsible.  Because their case happens to be within the section, the amendments which I intended to propose are out of order.  I regret this very much because the amendments were designed to do a measure of justice to a number of pensioners affected by the section.  The Irish Local Government Officials' Union, which represents these particular pensioners, are very keenly interested in this particular section which the pensioned officials of local authorities consider is doing them a very great injustice.  This section imposes a ceiling of £450.  That is considered unjust in the case of a number of pensioners <Col N="2456" /> who retired before the 1st July, 1940, on fixed pensions exceeding £450. They receive no increase.  If they had retired before the 1st July, 1940, on variable pensions adjusted under Section 79 (2) of the Local Government (Superannuation) Act, 1948, they would have been entitled to pensions substantially higher than the maximum of £450 permitted by this Bill. If they had retired after the 1st July, 1940, and before the 1st July, 1946, on fixed pensions under the Local Government (Superannuation) Act of 1948, and on the terms of the circular letter of the 14th February, 1948, they would also have been entitled to a very substantial increase, amounting in some cases to 30 per cent.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that there are those classes, some of whom are entitled to increases bringing them substantially above £450, it seems to me and it seems to them very unfair that this restriction should be imposed in this section.  The number of persons affected are not very many and the amount that would be involved, as far as local authorities are concerned, would not be very much.  I would press the Minister, because it is all I can do now that the amendment has been ruled out of order, to agree that the ceiling of £450 would be removed so far as this small number of local authority pensioners are concerned, that there should be an improvement on the increases set out in Section 2 and that the increased pensions should operate in the case of local government, mental hospital and certain Electricity Supply Board pensions with effect from the 1st November, 1946.  As I said on Second Reading, the imposition of this ceiling is inequitable because it tends to punish financially those who during their working lives forged ahead with initiative and industry, so that they were entitled to retire on substantial pensions.</P>
    <P>If they had not the same initiative, the same energy, or if they had not made the top grade, as it were, they would have been entitled to substantial increases in their pensions now.  But because they did make the grade and retired with pensions exceeding £450 <Col N="2457" /> they find now that their pensions will not be increased.</P>
    <P>As I say, the Bill affects only those local government pensioners who retired prior to 1st July, 1940, and, to a lesser extent, a small number who retired in the period from 1st July, 1940, to 1st July, 1943.  Most local government pensioners were treated fairly under the Local Government (Superannuation) Act of 1948.  The small number for whom I am now speaking, who retired prior to 1st July, 1940, on fixed pensions, who were the only ones left out of the 1948 Act, and who are now nearly all 80 years of age or over, should in fairness receive treatment similar to the treatment afforded under the 1948 Act to those local government pensioners to whom that particular Act applies.  I am informed and believe that they were bitterly disappointed at being left out of the Local Government (Superannuation) Act of 1948 and they look forward to some measure of justice now.  I would ask the Minister, as the number concerned is small, to agree to make such amendment as is necessary in the Bill to do a measure of justice to those particular individuals.</P>
    <P>From a list of pensioners affected by this legislation and by the Act of 1948 I see that many who came within the Act of 1948 and who retired between 1st July, 1940, and 1st November, 1946, on fixed pensions revised under the Act of 1948 got increases such as these: from £500 to £650; from £450 to £585; from £500 to £637 10s.; and from £500 to £562 10s.  In respect of officers who had variable pensions and who retired prior to 1st July, 1940, I see increases given under the Act of 1948 as follows: from £356 to £475; from £915 to £1,193; from £333 to £504; from £306 to £459; from £388 to £565; from £410 to £594; and from £325 to £504.  The small number of persons on whose behalf I am now speaking and who retired prior to 1st July, 1940, on fixed pensions exceeding £450 were debarred under the 1948 Act and they are also debarred under this Bill.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is adamant that under this Bill he is not going to increase the ceiling beyond £450 for anybody, then there is nothing that can be done about it.  But I would ask the Minister not <Col N="2458" /> to take that particular line because, as I say, in these cases, the number concerned is small.  They might have been and perhaps should have been included in the 1948 Act.  They were left out of that Act.  They felt a great grievance and they are anxious that this opportunity should be taken to put them on a reasonable basis of fair play and justice.  We are entirely in the hands of the Minister in regard to that; but I would press him as strongly as I possibly can to agree to an amendment that will do justice to these particular people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I had intended to give my full support to Deputy Cowan's amendment if it had been in order. Now all I can do is to join with him in the appeal he has made to the Minister to remove the ceiling of £450, because it does cause grave injustice to a very small number of old hands who served in various departments in the Dublin Corporation especially and a few in the Electricity Supply Board who had been transferred originally from the Dublin Corporation.  I think the number concerned is only nine.  These people served for 40 years as heads, second heads and third heads of various departments in the Dublin Corporation. They are men who shared in the fight for the independence of this country. They carried on in their departments during very difficult times.  They reached the age of 65, however, at some period prior to 1940 and had to retire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could give dozens of names which would be familiar to the Minister, and I know that if he could do anything personally for these people he would be glad to do it.  They served the municipality and the country well.  They had good appointments and lived up to the standard to which their salary allowed them at the time.  But they had to retire before 1940 and as they had reached their maximum they got a pension of £450.  Since 1940 the cost of living has gone up considerably and these men should not be allowed to suffer hardships.  They are trying to live up to the standard they lived up to when they came out on pension first.  Their pensions have been reduced in value to a considerable extent so <Col N="2459" /> far as rent, clothing and the cost of living generally are concerned.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to remove the ceiling of £450 and fix a pension for these people which will leave them in a position to buy the same quantity of food, to pay the high rates and other expenses and to meet the present high cost of living.  It would be very easy for the Minister or any actuary to find out what it would be necessary to give to these individuals to enable them to live on the same standard they were living on at the time they were awarded the maximum pension.  Their pension should be raised to a figure which would enable them to buy the same quantity of goods now as they bought when they went out on pension.</P>

      <P>I join with the previous speakers in making a plea to the Minister on behalf of those local government officials who retired prior to 1940 and who, unfortunately, were not covered by the provisions of the Local Government Superannuation Act of 1948.  I gladly acknowledge that the present Minister had nothing to do with that omission.  In so far as it seems to have been an act of discrimination against that section of the officials who retired prior to 1940, I am supporting the plea on the ground of injustice rather than on any other basis.  The House will appreciate what the position is.  At the time the 1948 Act was going through four classes of persons fell to be dealt with: those who retired before the 1st July, 1940, with a variable pension; those who retired before the 1st July with a fixed pension; those who retired after the 1st July with a variable pension and those who retired after the 1st July with a fixed pension.  The people who retired previous to the 1st July, 1940, with a fixed pension were excluded.  The other three classes were dealt with.  I may point out that the fixed pension was not a matter of choice for those who retired previous to the 1st July, 1940.  They were excluded for some reason or another which nobody seems to understand.  That is why I say there is a sense of injustice felt by those people.  They are small in number and, by reason of age, are a dwindling <Col N="2460" /> element.  It is regrettable that they should be left with this feeling of injustice for the rest of their lives.</P>
      <P>The matter might easily have been settled in 1948.  How it passed in 1948, or how it was that their representatives did not draw attention to that injustice, I do not know.  Some of those people have less pensions now, because of the fact that they have got no increase, than some of those whose pensions have gone up as a result of the 1948 Act, and of the measure which the Minister is now putting through.</P>
      <P>After the 1948 Act was passed, I went with a deputation to the Minister for Local Government and pointed out to him the injustice which the operation of that Act was inflicting on those people.  There was reason to believe that an opportunity might be taken to make an adjustment whenever it arose in connection with those officials. They were caught under the terms of the 1948 Act because they were deliberately excluded, and, as far as I know, no reason was given for that. Unfortunately, they are caught under this Bill again because there is a ceiling. The Minister gave the reasons for that in his Second Reading speech.</P>
      <P>As previous speakers have pointed out, this small number of pensioners will have their pensions met by the local authorities out of the local rates. In that way, any increase given to them would not fall on the National Exchequer.  I suggest to the Minister that it would be very greatly appreciated by Deputies who have raised the question of these pensioners if it were possible for him, in some way, to direct the local authorities to right the wrong which was done under the 1948 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephPatrickBrennan" hpid="Dr. Brennan Dr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with previous speakers in the appeal they have made to the Minister. Deputy Cowan told us that the House is in the hands of the Minister, but, surely, in a matter which concerns justice and equity, the House is not going to allow itself to be in the hands of any Minister.  If the Minister is wrong it is the duty of the House to correct the injustice that has been done.  I rather think that the Minister is in the hands of the House.  In relation to <Col N="2461" /> the case which has been put to the Minister on behalf of those who retired before 1940, and who are not covered by the Superannuation Act of 1928, it seems to me that the Minister has not dealt fairly with them.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister said last week that those who retired in 1929 engaged in alternative employment.  I have not the Official Report with me, but if I am wrong in that I should like the Minister to correct me.  But from inquiries made it is quite clear that only 11 or 12 of these obtained alternative employment. The numbers who retired, and who benefited by the conditions which prevailed at that time, were, I understand, over 600, and the number of people who are now excluded from benefits to which they are entitled is, I think, 160.</P>
      <P>Surely the Minister should rectify this wrong.  I support the suggestions which have been made by Deputy Cowan on the grounds of injustice and by Deputy Byrne on the grounds of economics, because a great many of the disabilities under which these pensioners suffer can be laid against the Department over which the Minister presides.  No matter what the Minister says, or what any of the officials who advise him say, the commodities which these pensioners have to buy in the year 1949 are at least 100 per cent. dearer than they were in 1929.  These are the things which concern the pensioners who retired in 1929.</P>
      <P>The Minister is advised by his Department, but we have been listening to replies given by Ministers to questions put in the House and we know perfectly well that this advice which is given at a desk is by no means a realistic summary of the actual position which faces the people.  Like all other Ministers, I am afraid the Minister for Finance has become a slave to his advisers.  That seems to be a kind of epidemic which gets a hold of persons when they attain Ministerial office.  If we are to judge from the statements of the present Minister when he was in opposition, we can only conclude that he has changed his views since he became Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to him to do justice to those <Col N="2462" /> people.  Nobody can do anything but appreciate the change of front on the part of any Minister who, when a case has been put to him, a case based on justice and equity, changes his mind. I appeal to the Minister to remedy the disabilities under which those people suffer.</P>
    <P>With regard to those pensioners whose pension is over £450, I think they, too, suffer from a grave injustice. These men or women who were on rather big salaries, as the times went, and who lived at the rate of £1,000 a year, are now forced to live on £650 or £750 a year under conditions which are much more exacting than those which existed when they were serving the State nobly and well.  I suggest the Minister should also change his mind in regard to those people.  It is not easy, under normal circumstances, for a man who has been accustomed to live at the rate of £1,000 a year, to live on £500 or £600, but it is much more difficult for him to have to do so under the changed economic conditions.  Inflation is rampant, and when the Minister takes no step to prevent that inflation, he is bound in all fairness to make provision for those people for whom I join with other Deputies in appealing for justice and equity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to the speeches delivered by various Deputies in support of this small section of pensioners, but I must confess I cannot subscribe to all that has been said on behalf of them.  Some ceiling had to be fixed and what occurs to me is that if this Bill had not been introduced, these people would have been quite satisfied with their pensions as fixed at £450.  I may be wrong and I may be right, but I feel I must consider the position of the people of the country as a whole. Arguments have been advanced by Deputies here with regard to the hardships suffered by people accustomed to live on an income of £1,000 a year and who suddenly found themselves, when retiring, having to live on £400 or £500. Whilst I never was an advocate of class distinction, I would like to remind these Deputies that I have in mind thousands of working men who had £7 a week and who, when they reached 65 years, had to retire without any pension <Col N="2463" /> and are now living on the dole.  Those are the thoughts that occur to me.</P>
      <P>I do not want to be taken as one who advocates class distinction in any shape or form.  The Minister has to consider the people as a whole, and I do not subscribe to the theory that any official who is in the enjoyment of £1,000 a year must have the same standard of living until he goes to the grave.  I cannot subscribe to the theory that a man who is in the enjoyment of £1,000 a year has not put something away for the rainy day. These people must have something and, therefore, it does not follow that they are enduring any great hardships. Four hundred and fifty pounds a year means between £8 and £9 a week. Being a realist, and as one who mixes with the people and who realises their position, I say that a man with £8 or £9 a week cannot be suffering from the hardships that were outlined here this evening.</P>
      <P>Arguments have been raised with respect to the cost of living and a comparison has been made between the cost of living when these men retired and the cost of living to-day.  I do not think there is any great difference between the cost of living when these men retired and the cost that appertains to-day.  My view is that in the present circumstances, with the resources at his disposal, the Minister for Finance has to consider the position of the people as a whole.  Whilst the passing of certain legislation may be a hardship on certain sections, at least these people must realise that in the ultimate the Minister is following a policy which he believes is in the best interests of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a firm believer in the policy that if there are hardships to be endured they should be spread over as many shoulders as possible.  No section of our people should be put on a pedestal at the expense of the majority.  I am one of those who would like to see every man with £1,000 a year, or even £10,000 a year, but I strongly hold the view that I must consider the position of the tens of thousands of our people who have to live on very much less.  The argument has been put forward that these people <Col N="2464" /> are only nine or ten in number. They could be 9,000 and the same argument could be put up.  It is not a question of the number but of the principle involved, and some ceiling would have to be set up.</P>
    <P>I do not care three straws what Minister is in power, he must have consideration for (1) the resources of the country and (2) the capacity of the people to put up the moneys necessary to pay any increase that may be asked for by various Deputies and sanctioned by the House.</P>
    <P>As far as that is concerned, I am not against this minority of officials who have retired and who, possibly through hard luck or otherwise, do not come under this Bill.  I do not think that is an argument that can hold water.  It is just their fortune, good or bad, as the case may be.  It could happen the other way about.  I think the time has come when Deputies must recognise the position of the country with a population of only 3,000,000 people and limited resources at its disposal. There must be some ceiling, not only in relation to pensions but also in relation to national taxation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the general case put forward.  I would be deeply interested to ascertain from the Minister how he came to fix a ceiling of £450 above which no provision can be made under the terms of this particular measure.  I have a copy of the document from which Deputy Cowan read.  In one portion of that document there appears the name of an official of the Dublin Corporation who retired in 1931 on a pension of £306 2s. 7d.  That particular official has now an important position outside the State at a salary of £2,000 per year.  Under the 1948 Act he was lucky enough to have his pension increased from £306 2s. 7d. to £499 15s. 3d.  This Bill by fixing the ceiling at £450 prevents a small number receiving any increases.  I know one individual who is in receipt of a pension of £481 from the Dublin Corporation to whom no increase can be given under the Bill as it now stands.  Why fix the ceiling at £450?  Why not make it £500 or £600?  I appeal to the Minister to raise the ceiling to a figure that will enable people who received <Col N="2465" /> no benefit under the 1948 Act to get something under this measure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I put this before the House as being something definitely in the hands of the House.  I find it difficult to adjust myself to change according to the changing moods of the House in recent months.  When I was in opposition I spoke on behalf of pensioners. I do not withdraw anything I said in those days.  Probably it was the knowledge of what was said from the Opposition Benches then that led those people now supporting the Government to urge that some increase should be made to certain pensioners or some adjustment in regard to the moneys they receive so that they would bear a better relation to the present reduced value of money.  That was urged early in 1948.  Pressure was again put on in the early months of this year.  But in those days all the pressure was with regard to the people on the low pensions and I very definitely took my lead from the House.  I felt the sympathy of the House lay more particularly with the people on the lower pensions and was more justly applicable to them.  Consequently, when we came to arrange some scheme of readjustment, instead of doing what would have been the simplest thing and merely taking a new pension related to a new cost-of-living figure and applying that right down the line, we appreciated that that would not be of very much benefit to those in receipt of very low pensions.  Therefore, we gave a very decided increase&mdash;an increase that has not been bettered in any increased pension legislation anywhere. It was a distinct improvement, a better improvement than has been made elsewhere, in regard to the people on the lower levels.  There was a considerable sum of money involved&mdash;a sum approaching £40,000,000 a year&mdash;and somebody had to suffer.  I think the case can be made, as has been made here, that those above the £450 mark are penalised.  If they are, it is for the benefit of the lower-graded people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I was to take the mood in which I find the House now and decide to remove any ceiling and not to care whether people had £450 or £480, then I would have to think out a new <Col N="2466" /> scheme.  I would have a different scheme and that scheme would give those on £450, and over, something, but it would correspondingly reduce the people on the lower levels.  That figure of £450 appears in legislation on the other side.  As I said on the Second Reading, they made two efforts in England to increase pensions.  In their first effort they had a lower ceiling than £450.  For the time being, I am leaving civil servants out of the picture. Then they raised the ceiling and the highest point they have reached so far is the £450 mark; that, I may say, is for married people or single people with certain dependents.  We took the ceiling of £450 as representing a proper figure.  In England, as I mentioned before, they have a means test.  That might not work to the disadvantage of people here because the probability is that folk with a pension over £450 are living on those pensions.  Therefore, the application of a means test to them would not make any great difference. That was the way they balanced things in England.</P>
    <P>We decided to take a figure of £450 and apply it all round without any advertence to any other means a person might have.  I have a good deal of sympathy with those who are outside the scope of these increases.  Deputies have talked about &ldquo;nine&rdquo; people. That figure relates only to local authority pensioners over the £450 mark.  It would be quite wrong, of course, to give local authority pensioners a better scale and better conditions than those given to the police and civil servants.  If I were to take the standard proposed in Deputy Cowan's amendment, if that appeals to the mood of the House, I would have to readjust the entire pension legislation. I would not tie myself to £220,000 or £250,000 or something approximating to that.  I do not know that in the end we would not have the same grumbling that we have now attaching to a completely different group of people.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowan proposes three changes.  First of all, he would associate all pensions with a cost-of-living figure of 270; secondly, he would make retrospective payments back to 1946; and, thirdly, he would have no ceiling. <Col N="2467" /> If I took these three amendments and applied them to everybody, it would involve a considerable addition to the proposed expenditure.  As I have arranged the scheme with civil servants and others, I think it is only equitable that local authority pensioners should be on the same footing. The phrase was used in this House that local authority pensioners are being victimised.  They are not.  They are as well-off to day as are civil servants and members of the Garda.  In fact, they have had something in their favour in the years gone by because some of them have pensions paid by reference to a cost-of-living figure of 270 as from 1st November, 1946.  Teachers have had no increase up to this moment and civil servants have been limited to the cost-of-living figure current at the date of their retirement.  Although there is some justification in the argument that it is not indifferent justice to them all, it is at least equal justice to teachers, Gardaí, civil servants, on the one hand, and local authority pensioners on the other.  I would ask the House to take it as the best that can be offered in present circumstances.  Deputy Dr. Brennan raised a different point with regard to Article X pensioners.</P>

In respect of those people, I am unrepentant. The Article X people do not deserve any sympathy in this House.

      <P>Under the Local Government (Superannuation) Act, 1948, a small number of people were omitted.  I do not know why, because I was not here at the time.  Increases in pensions were granted to all sections with the exception of one section, namely, those who retired before the 1st July, 1940, on fixed pensions: that is a small body.  Would the Minister consider putting them in the position, under this Bill, in which they should have been put under the Local Government (Superannuation) Act, 1948?  If the Minister could ease that injustice he would be going a long way towards meeting the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to emphasise that particular point also. As a matter of fact, that was the point which brought me to my feet in connection with this particular Bill.  The Minister, in his reply, did not deal specifically with that point of view.  He said that employees of local authorities should have no reasonable grounds for complaint if they were dealt with on the same basis.  I think that is quite acceptable and that the House would accept that all right, that is, if everything were normal.  However, up to the introduction of this Bill, things have not been normal for that particular small section referred to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that Act of 1948, a small number &mdash;and it is easily distinguishable here in respect of the Dublin Corporation and of the Dún Laoghaire Borough Council&mdash;for reasons that none of us <Col N="2469" /> can understand, was excluded by the previous Minister for Finance.  If they were normally included at that time with the other three categories there would be no grievance this afternoon in respect of the Minister's measure. Can the Minister for Finance suggest any way whereby that small number can be dealt with in the way I believe the local authorities would like to deal with them if they had permission? There is the snag, the backwash of the 1948 Act, for that small number of persons.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The principle at the back of this particular piece of legislation is that I take people who were in receipt of certain pensions; I look at the pensions and make a calculation that the pension is not worth anything like what it was at the time these people first were awarded them.  I am trying to readjust in relation to that. I am not setting out to correct all sorts of injustices that either were or may have been done.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan refers to local authority people.  Deputy Palmer put to me very vigorously the case of a group of women teachers who were, he said, forced out at a certain age when they were, on practice, entitled to go on for a longer period.  There are all sorts of anomalies, here, there and everywhere.  It would be an impossible task to correct all injustices done with regard to the allocation or distribution or termination of pensions in regard to certain people.  I take pensions as they are and give certain increases.  That is the best I can do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephPatrickBrennan" hpid="Dr. Brennan Dr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will not deny, I am sure, that those who retired previous to 1929 did so at a cost-of-living figure of 320 and that those who retired in 1929 retired on a cost-of-living figure varying between 150 and 180. Therefore, these people are surely under some disadvantage.  It may be argued by the Minister that some retired under Article X.  I do not take that case at all.  Not all of them retired under that Article.  I think, in fact, that only a very small number of them did so at the time.  I am sorry to hear the Minister say that he is not out to correct an injustice.  I think he <Col N="2470" /> should do so, where injustices exist. I think that it is his duty to correct any injustice under this Bill.</P>
      <P>As Deputy M. O'Sullivan has said, there are only a few cases in respect of local authorities which have to be dealt with.  I must say that I am rather disappointed by the attitude taken up by the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious to raise the case of widows of members of the Garda Síochána, and I feel that I can raise it under the Schedule, particularly under paragraph (d).  As I understand it, the widow of a non-commissioned officer enjoys or endures a <Col N="2471" /> pension of £30.  I think that anyone will agree that that pension is abnormally low, and even if an increase is granted under the terms of this Bill, it will still be abnormally low.  I should like the Minister to give a special consideration to that particular class.  I have in mind for example the case of a sergeant of the Gardaí who died on duty and left a young family.  His widow, who was in the position of having enjoyed an income sufficient to maintain that family on a fairly reasonable standard, now finds herself trying to maintain that position on an absolutely inadequate pension.  I think there is need for special consideration for cases of that particular type.  We have also the cases of the widows of members of the commissioned ranks. I think the pension of the widow of a commissioned officer is only £50.  Everyone will realise that a commissioned officer has been enjoying a fairly substantial income and has had to maintain a certain standard of living.  When that man dies it is an extraordinary injustice upon his widow and family to expect that they should live on £50.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to the case of people with pensions of over £450 and a special plea has been made for them.  We have also heard of the case of a person who enjoyed, while employed, over £1,000 a year, and who now finds himself, on retirement, reduced to an income of £500 a year.  Is there not a much greater injustice in the case of a man who dies young, if his family are left almost destitute? One instance that has been brought to my notice is that of the first Deputy-Commissioner of the Civic Guards, a man who was in a great measure responsible for building up that force. I understand his widow has a pension of only £50 a year.  I think that some special consideration should be given to that case.  It is a terrible injustice, in my opinion, that the widow of a man who took such a prominent part in building up the State should be left with such a miserable pittance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are Deputies who may say that, in the case of a commissioned officer or even a non-commissioned member of the Garda, these people, <Col N="2472" /> as prudent and good citizens, should have made provision for their families by way of insurance with some commercial insurance firm.  I understand that, in the case I have mentioned, the man had actually his life insured but the insurance company availed of some frivolous quibble in order to avoid making any payment on the policy.  I am sure the Minister himself sympathises with the particular types of case I have mentioned and I would urge him to do something in the matter because I am sure he will realise the injustice, not only to widows of members of the non-commissioned ranks but also to widows of members of the commissioned ranks, occasioned by the present miserable allowances.  I would ask him specially to consider the children of those particular members of the force, and if he cannot do anything for their widows, I would urge that, at least, he should make some provision for the children until they are able to fend for themselves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that.  I have personal knowledge of at least three cases in addition to that to which Deputy Cogan refers.  I think it is a terrible scandal that in these days the widow and orphans of a man who served the State very well as a commissioned officer should be asked to subsist on a maximum pension of £50 a year.  The same remarks apply to the widows of non-commissioned officers who have to exist on even a smaller pension.  There should be some reasonable minimum pension, if you like to call it a pension or if it is entitled to be described as such, in the case of non-commissioned officers who have served the State faithfully over long periods.  Apart from the case to which Deputy Cogan referred and of which many of us including the Minister <Col N="2473" /> are aware, I know the case of one commissioned officer.  I was surprised to discover that when he passed out by the will of God he left a widow and two young children in rather straitened circumstances.  The two children are now living outside the State and I do not know how the widow has been living for some time.  It is a disgrace that the State should prescribe a sum of £50 a year as a suitable pension for a widow who finds herself in such circumstances.  I would appeal to the Minister&mdash;I know the Minister has as much sympathy as anybody else with these cases&mdash;that if he cannot do anything under the terms of the Bill, he should look into the whole question at an early date with a view to providing pensions which will afford a reasonable standard of living for widows and families of commissioned and non-commissioned officers of the Garda.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make an appeal to the Minister on behalf of certain ex-officers of mental hospitals who had only about 25/- or 35/- a month under the old régime.  While we are giving them a 50 per cent. increase, it will mean very little to these people.  I think that £1 a week should be the absolute minimum and 50 per cent. will not bring them even up to £1 per week. If the Minister could do something to enable a small number, at least, to receive £1 a week minimum for the rest of their lives, it would be much appreciated by those people.  Some figures given to me show that 50 per cent. works out at £1 15s. 10d. per month in some cases; in other cases, £1 10s.; in another, £1 7s. 11d.; and another £1 4s. 11d.  These are people who are very old now, but who retired on a miserable pension, and 50 per cent. increase would not mean anything to them.  If the Minister could rectify the position, to enable them to get £1 a week minimum, it would not be looked upon as extravagant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephPatrickBrennan" hpid="Dr. Brennan Dr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have heard this instance given by Deputy Davin and, judging by what Deputy Cogan and others have said, it is quite obvious that this question deserves the serious attention of the Minister.  From what he has stated previously, I can imagine <Col N="2474" /> that he would not be inclined to rectify exceptional cases of injustice, but in part of this area for which I happen to be one of the Deputies, I know of three cases, two of which have been referred to by Deputy Davin.  It is rather scandalous that a man who has given the best years of his life in the service of his country should, when he dies, leave a widow and children to the mercy of the poor law authority.</P>
      <P>One of the cases to which Deputy Davin referred is that of a superintendent of the Gárda.  He died in the last 20 years and left two children and his widow received the sum of £50 or £52 a year.  All his life that man was contributing to a widows' and orphans' pension, but all his widow received was this trivial sum.</P>
      <P>There is another case of a man who married a second time the year after his first wife died.  He had four or five small children.  Having retired, he died, leaving the widow with four young children and she received a gratuity, the sum of £50.  All his life that man had been contributing something towards the insurance of his wife and children, but, because of the circumstances in which the second wife found herself, with the responsibility of bringing up the first wife's children, she got the magnificent sum of £50. Had the first wife lived, she would then have been entitled to a pension of £36 a year.  I think the Minister should consider seriously, not embodying in this Bill but at least making some provision for dealing with instances of that kind.</P>

These men and girls left <Col N="2475" /> mental hospitals years ago, after having to work 90 hours a week, and now find that a 50 per cent. increase will mean for some of them only £1 15s. 10d. a month, or £1 10s., £1 7s. 11d. or £1 4s. 11d.

      <P>That the Dáil hereby approves of the Royal Irish Constabulary (Resigned and Dismissed) Pensions Order, 1949, made on the 4th day of November, 1949, by the Minister for Finance under the Superannuation and Pensions Acts, 1923 and 1929, and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on the 8th day of November, 1949.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this Order is to increase pensions awarded to widows of the resigned and dismissed members of the Royal Irish Constabulary, with effect from 1st April, 1949.  The increase that is being given is in accordance with the scale adopted under the measure <Col N="2476" /> that has just been discussed&mdash;the Pensions (Increase) Bill, 1949.  I am making the provision in this case by Order instead of in the Bill itself, because it is desired in this case that it would apply to all widows' pensions granted in the future as well as to those already paid.  I have to introduce it by Order, because under the Superannuation and Pensions Act, 1929, it comes into operation only by resolution of the Dáil.</P>

      <P>There is a figure of £125,000 in respect of excesses in certain items included in the Vote for Public Works and Buildings, offset by Appropriations-in-Aid. The gross additional expenditure is estimated at £125,000 and the surplus receipts at £25,000, leaving a net shortage of £100,000, for which a Supplementary Estimate will require to be voted.  The gross shortage is in respect of sub-head B&mdash;New Works, Alterations and Additions.  In most years this sub-head has shown a saving due to the cumulative effect of sundry unforeseen circumstances which suspend or retard the numerous individual works for which gross provision is made and allowance is made each year for this factor by way of a deduction from the gross total of the individual provisions in the original Estimate.</P>
      <P>This year, the gross provision in sub-head B, of £810,385, was reduced to a net figure of £600,000, this being the amount suggested by experience as likely to be spent.  This calculation was upset, however, by the rapid progress made with the programme this year, due to such matters as exceptionally fine weather and the easier supply of materials.</P>
      <P>Of the additional sum required, £75,000 is in respect of grants for the building or improvement of national schools.  The balance of £50,000 is made up of a few large unforeseen works, including (1) the transfer of the Garda Síochána headquarters from the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham, necessitated by the discovery of structural defects in the roofs, secondly, the adaptation, furnishing and decoration of the new legation premises at Washington and a number of other items of expenditure which, at the time the Estimate was prepared, it was thought would have been discharged during the previous year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the surplus of Appropriations-in-Aid, the additional sum of £23,000 in respect of rents and fines is due principally to the grant of a new <Col N="2478" /> lease to the United States Legation of the premises occupied by them in the Phoenix Park, for which they paid a fine of £17,000.  The principal other additional receipts arise from harbour tolls, dues, etc., and from sale of stores, old materials.  The estimated receipts from hire of plant are down by £6,500, giving a net increase in Appropriations-in-Aid of £25,000.</P>

      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £16,990 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1950, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for External Affairs and of certain Services administered by that Office (No. 16 of 1924), including a Grant-in-Aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a Supplementary Estimate for £16,990.  This Supplementary Estimate is rendered necessary by reason of devaluation.  It is estimated that the total increased cost on the basis of the Estimate for the current year, that is, from 18th September to the end of the current financial year, will be in the <Col N="2479" /> neighbourhood of £25,000.  Therefore, it will be seen that the Supplementary Estimate amounts to less than the total additional cost thrown on the Department by reason of the recent devaluation. However, by reason of savings on different sub-heads and money which was not spent, it has been possible to limit the amount of the Supplementary Estimate to £16,990. The total additional cost thrown on the Department of External Affairs by reason of devaluation would amount in the full year to approximaely £46,000. The House, will appreciate, of course, that the allowances, salaries, rents, travelling expenses, sustenance allowances, and so on, payable in respect of our posts abroad have all been very substantially affected by reason of devaluation.  The additional burden thrown on the Department has been particularly heavy in regard to the United States.  The amounts are shown in separate items in the Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <P>The first item is in relation to travelling expenses in respect of the headquarters. The increased amount is partly due to devaluation and also partly dur to increased activity in the Department.  The creation of the Council of Europe, the work connected with the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation, have added to the amount spent on travelling expenses. In addition, we had this year a delegation at the Red Cross Conference in Geneva, which lasted some four months.  The House will also bear in mind that practically all travelling expenses have been substantially affected by the increased cost in our currency arising from devaluation.  The sub-head is also intended to cover travelling expenses which may be necessary this year by reason of the visit of the Taoiseach and myself to Rome in connection with the Holy Year ceremonies.</P>
    <P>The next item is in relation to official entertainment, which has been substantial this year by reason of two main causes.  First, because of the number of distinguished visitors who have visited this country during the course <Col N="2480" /> of the year.  The number was heavier than had been anticipated.  The House will recall that we had a great many very important and distinguished visitors to this country.  The Government felt that adequate entertainment should be provided.  The House will recall that we had, among others, Pandit Nehru, Prime Minister of India, the Aliquat Ali Khan, Prime Minister of Pakistan. We had, in addition, numerous visits by Ministers from Australia, Canada and the United States and we also had a large pilgrimage of visitors from Boston.  As well, many members of the American Senate and Congress visited our shores.  We were glad to receive them and we felt that the necessary provision should be made for their entertainment here.</P>
    <P>The next sub-head is in relation to information material.  This is a new sub-head to cover production costs of booklets, pamphlets and posters produced by the information section of the Department.  They include the production and distribution of a bulletin from our legation in Washington and of a special bulletin issued by the Department here.  The costs of the publication of the bulletin in Washington have been fairly heavy, but we feel that it has more than justified its cost.  Apart from the political aspect of the work carried on by the information section of the Department, there is also the Economic Co-operation Administration and the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation aspects of it.  Under the bilateral agreement entered into in relation to the working of the Economic Co-operation Administration, we undertook adequately to publicise the whole programme here.</P>
    <P>The next item is in relation to salaries, wages and allowances of representatives abroad.  In the main, the increases are due to devaluation. In the case of the next item also, travelling expenses connected with posts abroad, the increase is also largely due to devaluation.  The increased activity of the Department on the information and political side, as well as on the economic side, is reflected in the additional cost for postage, stationery, telegrams and telephones.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2481" /> The last item is an item of £390 in relation to property belonging to two officers of the Department which was destroyed in our Berlin legation premises on 22nd December, 1943, in the course of an air-raid.  The property of one officer, amounting in value to £385, was destroyed, and the property of another member of the legation staff, valued at £3, was also destroyed. If there is any point on which any member of the House would like to have further information, I shall be glad to give it.</P>

      <P>There are some savings referred to on which I should like some information.  One of these is the saving on the news agency service and the other in relation to the non-filling of certain posts.  Perhaps the Minister would be good enough to tell us what are the posts which have not been filled?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Offhand, the press officer posts at London and New York are vacant.  As the House will recall, provision was also made for the filling of a post at The Hague in connection with the opening of a legation there. That post has been filled.  The vice-consular posts at Boston, Chicago and San Francisco have not been filled, but staffs have been taken into the Department and we hope to be able to fill them shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The sum of £13,000 is a rather large item which is scarcely covered by the cases mentioned by the Minister, but there may be some others.  However, it gives us a general indication of the nature of the posts that have not been filled.</P>
      <P>Every Deputy must be concerned with the rapid increase in the amount required for this Department.  We started this year with an Estimate of £207,000 and now the sum required is £278,000&mdash;an increase of over one-third. If Estimates are to be of any value at the beginning of the year they ought to be reasonably near the sum required, and, in view of the fact that the filling of other posts is in the offing, the question arises whether we shall not be asked for more within the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation, <Col N="2482" /> and the Council of Europe. It seems to me that these are not covered by this Vote at all.  They are covered by a separate Vote and the expenses, such as travelling expenses and so on, ought to be covered by that Vote.  They are not provided for, so far as I understand, in this Vote.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is perfectly right, in so far as delegates to the Council of Europe are concerned, but not in so far as staff or some of the travelling expenses are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that that is bad accountancy.  It would be very much better if we had the expenses in connection with the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation, and the Council of Europe as a separate item, so that we would know exactly what sums of money were being spent on them.  I have no idea how far the expenses in connection with the Council of Europe and so on are being provided for in the present Vote or whether, if the increase is due to devaluation, we shall not also have to deal with it in connection with the other Vote.  If this supplementary is the result of devalution. I am surprised that we did not have another Supplementary Estimate in connection with Vote 73.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I say, everybody must be concerned with the rapid increase in the amount necessary for this Department. We have had an increase in the total Estimate of over one-third since it was introduced.  We on this side opposed the news service because we felt that every 1d. that can be spent on this is required and any 1d. that is spent has to be justified.  If we go back to 1947-48, we find that the Estimate has gone up by 80 per cent., which means that, for every £100 then spent, according to the audited accounts, we are now spending £180.  The items which can scarcely be referred directly to devaluation are those required for headquarters purpose, and perhaps travelling expenses, to some extent. The sum provided for entertainment has gone up from the original Estimate this year of £4,200 to £6,500, and, comparing that with the Estimate for 1948-49, we find that, for every £100 then spent, we are spending £240 <Col N="2483" /> now.  Devaluation can scarcely have accounted for the fact that travelling expenses have gone up to the extent that, for every £100 spent in 1948-49 on this item, we are spending £360 now.</P>
    <P>Of course as to the total Vote, if we want to see exactly what External Affairs is costing us we must add the sums to be provided under other Votes. If you make deductions for the possible receipts you find that there is still a sum of £24,000 on the wrong side and if you add that to the £278,000 you get over £300,000.  That is very nearly twice what it was in 1947-1948.  If we add the Organisation of European Economic Co-operation and the Council of Europe we find that we are not very far short of one-third of £1,000,000. Everybody who is anxious about the increase of public expenditure must be anxious about the rapid increase in the Vote for this Department.  The present Government was particularly strong at the election time on the question of reducing public expenditure.  Since that, instead of being reduced, public expenditure has gone up.  The total amount for the Supply Services in 1947-48 was less than £60,000,000, £58.9 millions, and in 1948-49 it went up to £64.6 millions.  You have there an increase of close on £6,000,000.  In the present year if you take the Estimates as originally introduced it is £65.4 millions and with the Supplementary Estimates there is no doubt whatever that at the end of the year that will have gone up considerably.  I think it is only right that these things should be pointed out.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce, speaking here recently, said that every Minister should be as careful of the public money as he is about his own.  I think everybody will agree that that should be the attitude of every Minister, and it must be the attitude of the Opposition to see that every penny which is asked for is justified. It is not possible for anybody who has not got the accounts to go into each particular item and satisfy himself that every item of expenditure is justified; all we can look at are the main trends and tendencies.  Everyone knows that there are posts which have <Col N="2484" /> yet to be filled.  I should like it to be deduced from the whole of this argument that in view of the fact that we are a small country with limited resources, and have to play an important part in the world, we should be careful that no penny is spent except it is absolutely necessary and justified.</P>
    <P>This Vote will ultimately reach about one-third of a million pounds.  Remember, you cannot go back.  You can refrain from filling certain posts for a time, but the moment they are filled you cannot go back, and therefore you should advance very carefully indeed. I must admit that devaluation has affected the position with regard to many of our representatives abroad in hard currency countries, and therefore some of this extra provision may be justified.  I am not in a position to tell whether these Estimates are close ones or not.  I take it that some are to cover expenses which have already been incurred and others prospective expenses.  We cannot satisfy ourselves in detail with regard to these matters and have to depend on the Department and on the checking Department, the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>With regard to the item about information, we on this side of the House are concerned that whatever information is sent out should be sent out as State information and should not bear any Party complexion.  The confidence of members of the House in Departments of State will be seriously weakened if any documents which are sent out can be reasonably regarded as having a Party complexion.  I have been thinking whether it would not be possible to get greater confidence with regard to documents of that kind.  In the first place, in the case of documents sent out which are not confidential it ought to be possible to have copies in the library.  I mean documents that are circulated but are not confidential documents in the sense that they are from the Minister to his officials. Documents that go from a Department to newspapers or bulletins should be available for inspection in the library of the House.  Another idea that occurred to me regarding documents of that sort was whether it was possible <Col N="2485" /> to have a Committee of the House under the chairmanship of the Ceann Comhairle to inspect or pass them as being really State documents and not Party.  I have not thought out that idea very fully and it might not possibly work.  I would be concerned, however, with the fact that we will lose a great deal of the confidence of the House in the work of Departments if there seems to be any just basis for the complaint that they are of a purely Party character.  This Estimate contains a fraction of the amount that is required for the news agency service.  There is £14,000 saving which has not been used up to the present.  We feel that the whole £25,000 should be a saving on that basis and as long as there is any fraction of that expense being provided for we cannot support the Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not delay the House more than a very few minutes. There are only one or two points made by the Leader of the Opposition with which I would like to deal.  A great deal of what he said appeared to be based on the view that members of the present Government had advocated a policy of retrenchment, in some instances for retrenchment's sake. That is a policy to which Clann na Poblachta never subscribed nor was it a policy ever advocated by our Party or by the present Minister.  Deputy de Valera's plea for consultation regarding official bulletins and documents issued which could be described by the generic term &ldquo;State documents&rdquo; between the Government and the Opposition is one with which, perhaps, many Deputies could have a good deal of sympathy, but I think it is a plea that comes badly from the Leader of the Party opposite because, during the period of office of the present Opposition Party, that consultation was denied to other Parties in the House on very many important matters and in respect of very many important State documents.  The approach that I feel the House should make to this Estimate is that it is a proof that the Department of External Affairs is now alive, is conscious of the job that has to be done in placing this country on the map and in placing in the forefront <Col N="2486" /> of our external policy the wrong of Partition.  In saying that, I do not want to be taken as being hypercritical of the failure of the Opposition when in office, because I am prepared to concede that there were world factors operating which did prevent them from doing many of the things which are now being done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I was endeavouring to make&mdash;I thought I made it perfectly clear&mdash;is that during the period that has passed there were world factors which prevented the expenditure of as much money as is now presented to the House in this Estimate.  I am in no sense attempting to make Party capital in my approach to this Supplementary Estimate.  The consideration that I would put before the House is that, in the more normal times which have now returned, it is in the very nature of things that it would be possible and proper to spend an increased sum under the various sub-heads set out in the Estimate.  We all know perfectly well that in previous years it was not possible for representatives of this country, for Ministers, to travel in order to put our case before the world as it has been possible to do so within the last 12 months or as it will be possible within the <Col N="2487" /> next 12 months.  I think Deputy Childers was a little bit premature in imputing to me a desire to approach this Supplementary Estimate in a partisan or controversial fashion. That was not my desire.  Owing to Deputy Childers' interruption, I was not allowed to develop the point I was making.  Let me repeat it again for his benefit.  In the changed circumstances of the present day, it is in the very nature of things that it is possible properly to expend money under the various sub-heads set out here.</P>
      <P>Deputy de Valera attempted to minimise the fact that devaluation was responsible for many of these increases. No matter what attempt is made to minimise it, Deputy de Valera must realise that it would be impossible for us to expect to get efficient service to the State from our representatives abroad unless we are in a position to maintain them in a proper fashion.  The only comment that I have heard from our people who have visited America and other countries on the Continent, particularly with reference to America, is that we are not spending enough money in this Department, because, in so far as it is concerned with putting Ireland's case for the reintegration of our territory before the world, it is one upon which there can be no retrenchment; that we should approach it with a prodigal mind and a desire to spend every penny possible in order to achieve the reunion of our country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the question that some of these sums are intended to cover material for putting the facts of Partition before the world, I think that this is a wrong way of doing it.  If a sum of money is required to put the facts of Partition before the world we ought to have a definite sum voted for that purpose and it should not be used as a sort of blanket to cover every sort of expense.  The only expenditure under this Estimate that deals with information material directly is £8,000.  I think that this <Col N="2488" /> House would be willing to give a much larger sum than £8,000 if it were suggested that its purpose was to put the case of Partition before the world and that it was a separate Vote.  I am prepared to support any proposition of that sort.  It is a wrong way of doing it, however, to use Partition as a sort of blanket to cover up criticism which may be justly levelled at various sections of the Estimate.</P>
      <P>I did not minimise the question of devaluation.  I said with regard to our representatives abroad, in America and other places, that that has to be taken into account.  Rough figures are given here&mdash;£6,000 and other sums.  The Minister mentioned the sum of £25,000 as being the sum necessary altogether. I am not in a position to estimate what it would be.  It would require a more detailed calculation, an accountancy calculation, to find out exactly how much money would be required to cover the increased cost due to devalution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy accept it from me that my Departmental officers estimated that the added cost due to devaluation for the current year was £25,000?  It is not my estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  The main duty of the Opposition in connection with this Estimate is to examine each item and to see that every item of public expenditure is justified.  I accept £25,000 as being the sum necessary to cover that particular point and, therefore, the Estimate would have to go up by that amount in any case.  I agree with that.  I take it, however, that the Minister is not going to suggest that devaluation had anything to do with the amount spent, for instance, on headquarters' entertainment &mdash; entertainment in Ireland.  I do not think that devaluation could possibly cover the increase there.  That increase has been justified on a different basis&mdash;that we had a number of foreign visitors coming to the country who had to be welcomed in a proper manner.  I have had too much experience of the need of that to be one of those who would decry reasonable expenditure in connection with entertainment.  I am not going to do that.  I shall leave that to the people <Col N="2489" /> who, when they were on this side of the House, were scandalous in their criticism of the necessary expenditure in that particular regard.  It is vital when foreign visitors come here that they should be treated in the same way as Ministers and others from this country are treated when they go to other countries.  That is essential.</P>
      <P>What I have been trying to argue is that as these expenses have to be incurred, the necessary part of our expenditure is going to be so great for a small country such as this that it is vital that everything else which is capable of being cut out should be cut out; that we should not try to expand too quickly or behave as if we were a very wealthy nation.  As the Minister knows, there are some further places to which it will be necessary to send representatives.  Each of these representatives will require a staff and that will add some thousands of pounds to the Estimate.  We have, therefore, to move cautiously.  It may be unavoidable, but I am disturbed at the rapid growth of this Estimate, because I know that, whatever sum you reach at any particular time, there is no going back.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>What I feel, and I have expressed it more than once in regard to External Affairs, is that it should be as non-contentious as possible. There was an expression of opinion during one of the earlier debates on the Estimate that perhaps a Committee of this House might be formed for the purpose of co-operating with the Department of External Affairs in regard to matters that might and should be termed national rather than Party.  If there was such a committee, clearly it would not prevent an individual Deputy from raising any question in regard to an Estimate such as this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, the Deputy understands that only the items in the Supplementary Estimate should be discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to deal with any matter that the Chair will find any fault with, but if there was such a committee, the justification <Col N="2490" /> for this increase could be discussed in the quiet atmosphere of a committee room.  That, as I have said, would not prevent any Deputy from rasing any question here, although it is likely that no question would be raised in regard to the Estimate.</P>
      <P>The sum total of expenditure, in connection with the Department of External Affairs now, is £278,000 for the year, based on the original Estimate and on the Supplementary Estimates.  The question that will have to be considered is this: have we reached finality in expenditure, and can there be any cutting in that expenditure in the future?  Is that sum a sum that is inadequate, or is it a sum that is excessive?  Clearly, if this State is to act as if it were a major State, the total Estimate for this year would not meet the bill at all.  It is very difficult to know where one can stop.  What I feel in regard to external affairs is that we are not influencing world events very much.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;on the increased Estimate which is before the House at the moment.  In so far as the increase is due to devaluation, I do not think we can do very much about it unless we were to decide to reduce our staffs abroad to counter the increase in cost due to devaluation.  However, I take it the Chair would not want me to develop that point either until we reach the Estimate next year.  At any rate, it is a matter to be considered, whether the impact of world events can compel us to increase our expenditure. We can follow the flood, as it were, or go with the flood and increase <Col N="2491" /> expenditure, or we can adopt the other line of reducing staffs abroad and keepling within the Estimate.  I take it, however, that raises the general policy of the Department, and that it would not be in order to discuss it now.  But, perhaps, when replying, the Minister would deal with the effect of meeting devaluation by some decrease in staff or some decrease in expenditure abroad.</P>
      <P>Now, Official Entertainment is increased from £4,200 to £6,500.  I take it that is Official Entertainment in the Twenty-Six Counties&mdash;in the Republic of Ireland&mdash;or, perhaps, in Dublin.  I am not altogether clear on that point. The Minister will put me right on it.  If the cost is £6,500, it is a sum of well over £100 a week on Official Entertainment here in Dublin.  I wonder are we serving any useful purpose by increasing the amount to be spent on Official Entertainment?  There is an increase of £2,300, almost £50 a week.  I wonder is there any great national benefit from that?  I see members of foreign legislatures entertained here.  They are generally termed &ldquo;distinguished&rdquo;, and I am quite sure they are distinguished. They generally tell us what fine fellows we are, and how right we are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">

      <P>They tell us how right we are and what fine fellows we are.  I want to look at it from the point of view of the other side.  If members of this House go abroad, are they taken in hands in the same way as we deal with foreign representatives coming here?  Are they met at the airports and brought into the nearest city?</P>

    <P>I am raising that point because I think we can go too far in that respect. I am all in favour of giving distinguished visitors a proper Irish reception, but I do not think it is right that our Minister for External Affairs should spend so much of his time travelling from here to Collinstown to shake hands with those visitors.  I would like the Minister to consider the matter <Col N="2492" /> from the broad, general point of view of the national interest.  Quite a number of our people are concerned about this; it is the general topic very often.</P>
    <P>This nation has a well-established standard of courtesy and kindness to visitors of all kinds.  I think it is the desire of the House that, from the official point of view, there should be courtesy and kindness extended.  But let us consider whether we are doing more than that.  If this increase in the cost of official entertainment is based on a wrong conception of what our duties in that regard are, it is rather a difficult subject to deal with.  For that reason, I want to be as restrained and as objective as I can in dealing with it.  I want the Minister to realise that what I am expressing now is, in fact, the view of a very large number of the taxpayers, who are being asked to contribute to the increased charges indicated here.  I would like the Minister to point out the justification for this particular increase.  I would also like him to say whether he believes this increased Estimate will meet the bill for the rest of this financial year and that there will be no further Supplementary Estimate required.</P>
    <P>There is an item of compensation for the loss of personal property in 1943. I do not know what the difficulty was that caused six years to elapse without adjusting this matter.  If those officials lost property valued at the sum of £390 that should have been settled long ago.  Does the £390 represent the then value of the property destroyed, or is it the present value, having regard to the devaluation of the £?  I gathered from the Minister that one of the items in the £390 was a sum of £3.  I do not know if I heard that correctly.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>If anybody examines this bill and compares it with the original Estimate introduced this year and makes a comparison with the amount paid for this service in the financial year 1948-49, he cannot be but alarmed, at least to some extent, with its growth.  The total in 1948-49 amounted to £177,417, so far as can be ascertained. The present bill, which amounts to £278,000, represents almost 100 per cent. of an increase.  One might also take into consideration the savings which the Minister has been able to effect.  There is, for instance, £14,000 saved on the News Agency Bill and there is a saving which, possibly, he has some influence over, of £13,000 in relation to certain posts; but notwithstanding all that, the bill for this Department has reached alarming proportions.</P>
      <P>I take it that if the News Agency Bill is not passed into law as early as the Minister expects, we will be blessed with a saving on the original £25,000.  This is the second Supplementary Estimate for the Department, the first being substantial enough&mdash; £53,000.  This sum amounts to £16,990.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like Deputy Cowan, I agree that when visitors from foreign countries come here it is the duty of our citizens to act in keeping with our status as a nation, adequately to entertain these visitors.  On the other hand, we ordinary legislators have a duty to the taxpayers, and particularly to the less well-off sections of our community. These less well-off sections, when they see, as Deputy Cowan has pointed out, something like £100 per week being spent on luncheons and dinners for distinguished visitors, while many of our people are badly housed, naturally look on these functions with a certain amount of disgust because they consider this expenditure unnecessary. As a Deputy, I like to hold the balance evenly between my duties as an ordinary citizen and as a Deputy who <Col N="2494" /> must have regard to the status of the nation.  I do not want to blow hot and cold on this subject, but I believe there are certain items on which economies could have been effected within the last few months.  I consider the Office of the President a very essential establishment.  On occasions recently I have seen where distinguished visitors have been entertained to luncheon at Iveagh House and to dinner that same evening in Arus an Uachtaráin.  I think we are being somewhat extravagant in this respect considering our resources as a nation.</P>
    <P>The Leader of the Opposition referred to the voting of £8,000 for information material.  I do not think we should be asked blindly to vote money for this purpose this year, next year and in the years to come without some opportunity being vouchsafed to us of seeing what this information material is.  I take it it will consist of pamphlets boosting the country and its progress. I think, and I believe I am expressing the opinions of the majority of Deputies now, that this House should have an opportunity through the medium of the Library of seeing for what purpose we are voting this £8,000.</P>
    <P>In explanation of the increased amount for travelling expenses the Minister said that these were expenses in connection with the Council of Europe and for the Organisation of European Economic Co-operation.  As Deputy de Valera pointed out, it is, to say the least of it, bad accountancy. Not very long ago we voted a sum of £24,130 for expenses in connection with European co-operation.  There were two sub-heads&mdash;one for the Council of Europe and one for the Organisation of European Economic Co-operation.  In the first there was a sum of £2,250 voted for travelling expenses.  In the second there was a sum of £3,000 voted. From the accountancy point of view and from the point of view of the Minister's duty to the House, I think the Minister should be able to say in what respect the money is being spent, whether it is out of Vote 65 or Vote 73.  We should not be in the position of not knowing how much we are spending on the Council of Europe and how much we are spending on the <Col N="2495" /> Organisation for European Economic Co-operation.  We should be given an opportunity of weighing that expenditure against the benefits we receive. The Minister has said that there is a difference between Ministerial expenses and staff expenses.  Surely, it should not be impossible to include staff expenses with those of the Minister and others attending at meetings held by either of these organisations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I could explain the position more clearly.  It would be completely unsatisfactory from an accountancy point of view if the expenses of a departmental officer appeared under one of two different sub-heads.  Therefore, all the departmental expenses and my travelling expenses do not appear in the special Votes taken in relation to the Council of Europe.  I have to attend meetings in connection with the Council of of Europe.  I have also to attend meetings in connection with the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation, but that does not form part of the Council of Europe Vote.  If forms part of the headquarters travelling expenses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not press the matter any further.  At first sight I thought it was one that could easily be rectified to my satisfaction.  The Minister says there are administrative difficulties.  Reference has been made to the many times the Minister has had occasion to go abroad.  I am sure some of the increased expenditure under sub-head A (2) for travelling expenses must be devoted to the increase in the number of visits abroad. Like Deputy Cowan, I, too have heard comment on that.  I have heard the Minister for External Affairs referred to as the External Minister for Affairs, not without a certain amount of justification. I take it the Minister does not go needlessly abroad to attend conferences at which his presence is not required. But here, again, I think we should examine the value we receive from the Minister's visits abroad in relation to the expenditure on those visits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem of Partition was lightly touched on.  I do not wish to pursue <Col N="2496" /> it.  Deputy Lehane referred to it until the Ceann Comhairle intervened. Deputy Lehane then said that he intended to finish at that, but I took exception to his remark that at least the Department was now alive.  He did not elaborate on that and has retraced his steps to some extent from his original bald statement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Ceann Comhairle first interjected in the course of Deputy Lehane's references to the Department of External Affairs being now alive, Deputy Lehane said that he had finished with the matter. At that stage Deputy Childers rose and Deputy Lehane seized on the opportunity to retrace some of his steps.  I think that is the position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall examine the report of the debate with Deputy Lehane, and if he is right and I am wrong I shall apologise to him; but I do not think the necessity for an apology will arise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">

      <P>I think Deputies ought to express some concern at the increase in this particular Vote.  We are now proposing to spend over £250,000 on a Department that in 1946-47 only cost us £118,000.  I certainly agree that, because of devaluation and because of our participation in certain European organisations, an increased amount of money is necessary.  From the point of view of lavish entertainment at home we are spending far more than is really necessary.</P>

      <P>Maidir leis an chéad chuid den Mheastachán Breise seo, ní fhéadfadh duine a bheith ró-shásta ar fad go bhfuil géar-ghá leis an airgead go léir atá curtha ar leataoibh le haghaidh taistil agus eolais.  Fágaimís fo-mhír a 5 ar leataoibh.  Is dócha go bhfuil mórán de'n cheart ins an méid adúirt an Teachta Ó Cabhain agus an Teachta Seán Ó Loinsigh faoin bhfomhír sin.</P>

An bhfuil aon deimhniú againn anois ná beidh Meastachán Breise eile le breithniú ag an Dáil roimh dheire na Bliana Airgeadais seo.  Tá tuairmí faoi leith agam féin mar gheall ar an taisteal sin go léir atá ar súil ag an Aire Gnóthaí Eachtracha agus Airí eile nach é.  Bhféidir nach n-aontódh cuid de mo cháirde féin leis na tuairmí atá agam.  Bíodh sin mar atá, tá sé de thuairim agam gur airgead amu cuid mhaith den taisteal sin agus go bhfuil an íomad ar fad de ar siúl.  Sé mo thuairim féin go bhfuil a lán cumann gluaiseachtaí ag obair ar an MórRoinn ná fuil mhaitheas ná tairbhe ar bith le baint astu.  Má tá aon tairbhe nó maitheas le baint astu, ní fhacamarne aon rian de fós.  Dá bhrí sin, ba chóir don Aire agus don Rialtas na rudaí sin go léir a mhion-scrúdú agus gan airgead na ndaoine agus na tíre seo a chur amú.  Má iarrtar airgead, a chreidimídne, a raghadh chun leasa agus tairbhe na tíre agus a chuideodh linn an cuspóir deireannach atá róinn a thabhairt chun críche, creidim ná beadh an Dáil doicheallach i dtaobh é thabhairt d'Aire ar bith go mbeadh gá aige leis.</P>
      <P>Maidir leis an chéad chuid den Mheastachán Breise seo, sé mo thuairim go bhfuilimídne ag dul ró-fhada agus go bhfuil an tAire seo agus an Roinn Gnóthaí Eachtracha ag dul ró fhada ar fad.  Ba chóir stop a chur anois leis an sodar agus machtnamh a dhéanamh ar ci bhfuilimídne ag dul.

Ach ní hé sin an rud a thuit amach.  Tuigim go maith an fáth atá le cuid mhaith den bhreis atá ag teastáil le haghaidh na Roinne. Nuair a bhí an Rialtas eile ann, ní raibh aon Aire speisialta i gceannas an Roinn Ghnóthaí Eachtracha.  Bhí an Taoiseach a bhí an uair sin ann&mdash; an Teachta Éamonn de Valera&mdash;agus bhí seisean i gceannas na Roinne sin. Ní mar sin atá an scéal faoi láthair.</P>
    <P>Níl mé sásta, ar chor ar bith, go bhfuil gá leis an mbreis mhór seo go léir.  Creidim go bhfuil sé in am dúinn an scéal a scrúdú go mion agus go géar agus creidim go mba chóir don Aire agus don Rialtas an rud céanna a dhéanamh agus stop a chur anois le tuille airgid a bheith á chaitheamh ag an Roinn Ghnóthaí Eachtracha.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I should, at the outset, repeat what I said in introducing the Supplementary Estimate. The total amount of the Supplementary Estimate introduced is less than the added burden put on to the expenditure of the Department by reason of devaluation.  The amount of the Supplementary Estimate is £16,900.  The total estimated amount of the additional cost cast upon the Department in this financial year by devaluation is £25,000 or, in other words, approximately £8,000 more than the amount of this total Estimate.  If it were not for certain savings that have been made in the Department we would now have to come to the House and ask for a Supplementary Estimate of £25,000.  I want to make that clear because members of the House have said: &ldquo;Oh, of course, we are not questioning anything due to devaluation. We are referring the whole time to the increased expenditure of the Department.&rdquo; In point of fact, I am sorry to say the Department has not spent its full Estimate in the current year and the only reason the Department has to come before the House with a Supplementary <Col N="2499" /> Estimate is because of devaluation.</P>

That accounts, in part at least, for part of this Supplementary Estimate. I have been spending £300 a week on publicity in Washington since the British Government decided to introduce the Ireland Bill in their Parliament&mdash;and I make no apology for doing so.  I wish I could spend ten times that amount in every capital in the world.</P>

      <P>There is another aspect which, I think, Deputies have not taken into account, and that is that a large proportion of the economic work has been falling on the Department of External Affairs by reason of its relationship with the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation and with the Economic Co-operation Administration.  That has entailed, as I explained to the House before, the creation of an economic division and the carrying out of a vast amount of economic work both in Paris and in Washington.  Members of the House do not appreciate that, in relation to all orders for goods coming from America, under the European Recovery Programme, the necessary organisation has to be carried out through the Department of External Affairs.  That has increased the work of the Department tremendously.  Again, it is work in respect of which I make no apology. It is work that is essential to the economic life of the country.  If that work were not being done, we would not be able to import things from America.  I am satisfied that we are getting, and will get, large dividends far in excess of the expenditure on the whole of this Department by reason of that work.</P>
      <P>I am not going to say, or to take any credit for the fact that there is far more activity in the Department now.  The ending of the war made that inevitable.  The ending of the war and the development of the present position were bound to increase the activity of the Department.  For instance, inevitably, this country will have to be represented in Germany.  I think, too, that it will be necessary to have a number of commercial attachés at various places in America and other countries in order to enable us to develop and increase our trade with these countries.</P>

      <P>Deputy de Valera has underlined the expenditure on entertainment. He said that he realised the necessity for it and, in effect, he approved of it.  Deputy Lynch, on the other hand, seemed to criticise it. Deputy Cowan criticised not so much the entertainment as the fact that I went to meet people whom I thought I should meet at Collinstown.  I can assure Deputy Cowan that that will not cost the State one 1/2d.  It may cost me a good deal of personal inconvenience in obliging me to get up much earlier in the morning but it does not cost the State anything.  The Deputy may rest assured that I shall continue to meet whomsoever I think I should meet, either because they are friends of mine or friends of this country abroad.  There is one thing that I should correct&mdash;the statement which I made when I interrupted Deputy Lynch on the question of travelling expenses in relation to the Council of Europe and the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation.  The position is not quite as clear as I thought it was.  I think some of the travelling expenses have been charged on the departmental travelling expenses while others have been charged on the separate Vote.</P>

      <P>The Organisation for European Economic Co-operation is the same.  There is a special Vote for travelling expenses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand there are certain travelling expenses in relation to the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation which do not arise in relation to the council or committees.  These are occasioned by officials going backwards and forwards to clear up various points.  It is a matter which can be examined and gone into again.</P>
      <P>I should like to point out once more that the expenditure on this Department is the lowest of any other Department of External Affairs or Foreign Affairs in proportion to our Budget. I have the figures here.  I think the expenditure is .38 per cent. of our Budget.  In other countries of comparable size and comparable importance the figures were, for instance: Norway, .59; Sweden, .58; Denmark, 1.18; Switzerland, 2.63, and so on.  I think these are not new figures.  I think they are old figures which I had at the time of the introduction of the last Budget, and I should imagine that, as a result of devaluation, they have gone up very considerably.  Again, it is very hard to compare these things, but the total cost, including the Supplementary Estimate, of the whole Department and every other form of expenditure we have to meet, is less than the cost of one big embassy kept by one of the major countries.  The cost of the British Mission in Cairo amounts to £328,000, and the cost of the British Missions in the United States of America amounts to £925,000. I merely mention that so as to get the general perspective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one thing which I would like to emphasise and ask the House <Col N="2504" /> to bear in mind: there is no use in having a Department of this kind or in having a post unless it is adequately manned and people are put in a position to do their work.  That is what we have been trying to do.  I am anxious to have the co-operation of the House in a matter of this kind, and on every occasion on which I introduce an Estimate for this Department I shall gladly give any information the Leader of the Opposition may require. I would welcome the formation of a foreign affairs committee on a nonParty basis so that they might have more information and take more interest in the working of the Department.</P>
    <P>I think I can claim that the increased activity of the Department following the war is a good investment for the country&mdash;a good investment from the political point of view as regards Partition, from the trade point of view as regards our trade, from the tourist point of view and also, I hope, from a financial point of view.</P>

The first intimation we had of the nature of the amendments was when they were circulated to-day. When the Taoiseach announced to the Dáil that he proposed to ask the Dáil to take this Bill to-day I assumed that it was the normal procedure that was being followed.  You are aware that the normal procedure is that, when the Seanad inserts amendments in a Bill, the Minister in charge of the Bill informs the Dáil of his attitude to the amendments&mdash;whether he proposes to ask the Dáil to accept or reject them &mdash;and he then fixes a day on which they can be discussed in the Dáil.  A member of the Dáil, under Standing Orders, has a right to propose amendments to amendments passed in the Seanad.  I submit, Sir, that a member of the Dáil cannot be deprived of his right to move an amendment to amendments inserted by the Seanad in this Bill.</P>

I would make this appeal to them not to do that.  This is an urgent measure. It is a necessary measure.

We do not think it is urgent.  I have a very strong objection to the first amendment inserted by the Seanad.  It will set up here, if adopted, a precedent which will be quoted on other occasions. I do not think that ever before <Col N="2508" /> there was a suggestion that the Seanad would have power to act on its own in a matter concerning the Dáil.  We have had cases before where the nomination of members, or action of a similar character, required the consent of the Dáil and Seanad.  I do not think there is any precedent for the suggestion that the nomination of a member of the Seanad concerned the Seanad only.  The Dáil on this occasion insisted that the nomination of members of the Oireachtas on the board should be subject to its consent.  We now are faced with the situation where, if we accept this amendment, a member of the Oireachtas can be nominated without the consent of the Dáil.  It is not only a bad amendment, but a bad precedent, with which I cannot agree.</P>

I am standing here for something which represents more, in my opinion.  It is a principle of greater importance than this Bill or the amendments proposed to the Bill. If the Seanad inserts an amendment to a Bill, this Dáil is entitled to consider that amendment at its leisure, and to decide whether or not it will accept it or accept it with amendments. We cannot be deprived of that right by the action of the Government in submitting the Bill and the amendments to the Dáil and asking for its adoption on the same day.

      <P>As far as the House is concerned, this is, as Deputy de Valera says, a fundamental matter.  It is not a question of getting the work done.  It is a question of doing the work right.  Amendments come to-day from the Seanad, amendments that the Seanad is entitled to make in this Bill. Those amendments come before us. Each and every one of us&mdash;it is not a question of the Leader of the Opposition or the Deputy Leader of the Opposition&mdash;has a right, if he so wishes, to put down an amendment to <Col N="2512" /> the amendments made by the Seanad. I understand that, under the Standing Orders of this House, a Deputy must give two days' notice&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In my view, if we do not hurry, we will arrive at a satisfactory conclusion.  The satisfactory conclusion is to assert the right of every Deputy.  My only reason for standing up in regard to this matter is that we are inclined to take the view that it is a matter for the Leader of the Opposition or the Deputy Leader of the Opposition.  I cannot subscribe to that, while I pay all the respect to which the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition are entitled.  I want to assert the right of the ordinary Deputy and, so long as that right is asserted and is clear, we can make progress.</P>

      <P>There is no right peculiar to any Deputy that does not belong to every other Deputy. The Chair is making no difference.  The objection came from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition.  The practice has been for years, where there is no objection, where there is agreement, to take the amendments as they come from the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  May I intervene? The practice has been that on a Bill being returned to the Dáil by the Seanad with amendments the Minister in charge of the Bill informs the Dáil that he is proposing to the Dáil to accept or reject the amendments.  Then he indicates the day on which he wishes to have them discussed.  That is the practice and that practice has been followed even when amendments were non-contentious.  It is entirely contrary to practice to ask the Dáil to deal with the amendments on the same day as they are circulated.  The Chair, I think, will agree.</P>

      <P>I heard the Leas-Cheann Comhairle state, quite correctly, that the practice has been for the Minister to state, when amendments come down, whether he proposes to accept them or not, and when he desires to take them. Amendments to these amendments, which would have to arise out of them and be relevant thereto, might be moved but Deputies might require time to frame them.

When we get this Order Paper, we are able to see the amendments on it and to study them. Every member of the House knows about them.  If an amendment is moved and accepted <i>ad hoc,</i> we have had no notice of it, and it is quite possible that a Deputy who, for some reason, is absent, would make a point of being in the House if he knew the amendment was coming on.

      <P>What is the Minister's attitude to the amendments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is accepting the amendments.  I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 3, Section 8, sub-section (2), line 40, &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; deleted and &ldquo;the House of which he is a member&rdquo; inserted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill, as passed by this House, provided that the articles of association should provide that a member of either House of the Oireachtas shall not, except with the prior approval of Dáil Éireann, be appointed a director of the agency.  It was, in other words, a proviso to preclude a member of the Oireachtas from being a director of the news agency.  An amendment was introduced by Deputy Lemass and I think I asked him to leave the door slightly open so that, if a situation arose where there was obviously somebody who was a very desirable person, the Dáil would be able to pass a resolution. Deputy Lemass, with common-sense and owing to his experience, thought the Seanad might resent the exclusive right being left to the Dáil. The attitude of the Seanad was that they did not see why this House should have the right to discuss a member of the other House, and they thought the best solution was that each House should reserve the right to discuss its own members, that it was somewhat <Col N="2515" /> undignified that this House should discuss a Senator, or that the Seanad should discuss a member of the Dáil, as to whether or not he would be a suitable person for membership of the board of directors.</P>
    <P>I felt that they had made a reasonable case in that respect.  I felt, too, that the position was rather academic, because I could not visualise the possibility of my desiring to appoint a member of the Dáil or Seanad.  I did feel, however, that a situation might arise in the future in which there might be an outstanding journalist who might become a Senator&mdash;the Seanad is a place where you might have an outstanding retired journalist, and possibly not even retired&mdash;who would be a person ideally suited for a position of this kind and upon whom every Party might be agreed, and that to a certain extent it was as well to leave a provision of that kind in the Bill.  I also agreed with the view of the Seanad that it was a matter for each House to decide on its own member. It would lead to a good deal of conflict if both Houses were to discuss each other's members.</P>
    <P>In the course of the discussion in the Seanad the whole question of whether or not members of the Oireachtas should be on State boards arose and was discussed, not conclusively, but the suggestion was made that it was a matter that should be examined either by a commission or by a joint committee of both Houses at some time in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>An excellent idea.  The Dáil agreed to that at one time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is a matter that should be discussed.  It is a matter which is going to arise rather acutely from another point of view.  It is going to arise acutely in respect of employees of State companies.  For instance, when transport becomes nationalised, the question will arise whether servants of the transport company are eligible for the Dáil or Seanad, and the whole of the position will require clarification.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>However, that is travelling beyond the scope of this measure.  I feel that the amendment put forward by the Seanad in this respect, in this particular case and not as a matter of principle, is probably the wisest course, but I should not like to put it forward as a precedent for future legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a bad precedent to establish.  If the Dáil is to have any function in relation to the board of the news agency, that function should operate whether the member of the Oireachtas is a member of the Dáil or a member of the Seanad.  The objection there is to members of the Dáil having remunerated posts in companies established by statute applies equally, in my view, to members of the Seanad.  I move as an amendment to the Seanad amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete the words &ldquo;the House of which he is a member&rdquo; and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;each House of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The effect will be to ensure that if there is a proposal to appoint a member of the Oireachtas on the board of the agency, each House of the Oireachtas will be required to approve of the appointment.</P>

      <P>If there has been a misunderstanding we can leave it at that. On consideration, I will not take advantage of the Minister's offer on the grounds of a misunderstanding to hold this matter further.  I am however moving the amendment.  I have already said a few words and I hope you will not rule me out of order if I repeat them.  The position is as follows: When the Bill came to the Dáil an amendment was moved here to exclude from membership of the board of directors of the proposed news agency members of the Oireachtas.  That amendment apparently received support in various quarters of the House and the Minister agreed to accept it in principle.  He <Col N="2520" /> subsequently brought in an official amendment which was not quite the same as that which I had put forward in committee in so far as it accepted the possibility of members of the Oireachtas being appointed to the board of directors with the approval of the Dáil.</P>
      <P>The Bill as it left the Dáil and went to the Seanad so provided: that members of the Oireachtas could not be appointed to the board of directors except with the consent of the Dáil. We are now faced with an amendment in the Bill by the Seanad, the effect of which is to deprive the Dáil of the power of approval if the member of the Oireachtas appointed to the board is a member of the Seanad.  I have mentioned already that there are many Acts which require that things should not be done except with the approval of the Dáil and Seanad.  It is, I think, without precedent that the Seanad should be given power of approval of Ministerial actions or appointments on its own.  It is, I think, an undesirable power for the Seanad to have in so far as the Dáil thought fit in the case of this news agency to require that members of the Oireachtas should not be appointed to the board except with their approval.  I do not think we should modify that decision now by adopting an amendment which would permit of members of the Oireachtas being appointed to the board of the news agency without the knowledge, much less the approval, of the Dáil and, therefore, I move the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of the amendment is not to deprive the Seanad of the right of approval of the appointment of Senators to the board.  It is to require that such approval, however, must also be given by the Dáil.  That is in accordance with all precedents, to the best of my recollection and is, in any event, the course which common-sense dictates. I dislike the idea of members of the Oireachtas being appointed to these boards at all.  Such action should only be taken in the most exceptional circumstances and those exceptional circumstances should be so clear that approval of the proposed appointment would be forthcoming from the Dáil and Seanad.  I suppose it is <Col N="2521" /> necessary to submit the amendment to you in writing?</P>

      <P>I should like to say, in the first place, that when the Minister was speaking, I interjected that in the Transport Bill there was such a provision for all employees.  Clearly, that was wrong.  It is simply a provision in relation to directors, or that is my recollection.</P>
      <P>I think a matter of serious principle is involved in this whole matter.  The Oireachtas, under the Constitution&mdash; from the legislative angle, anyway&mdash; consists of the Seanad and Dáil.  The President has a particular function but we are not concerned with that now. A point of agreement has, apparently, been reached over a number of years that in those State boards&mdash;if one may call them so&mdash;members of the Oireachtas should not be directors.  That seems to be gaining general acceptance and, when this matter was before this House, this House provided that no member of the Oireachtas could be appointed unless with the consent of each House.  That was reasonable. Once we were forced into the position of admitting or agreeing that a member of the Oireachtas might be a member of this board, it was wise to have the precaution that each House should sanction it.</P>
      <P>The amendment made by the Seanad is one of fundamental importance because what they say is this: Let Dáil Éireann deal with itself; we will deal with our own House.  A situation may arise where some member or members of the Seanad may be appointed to this particular board and this House which, after all, is completely elected on a basis of direct representation, may be deprived and, in fact, would be deprived of its right to criticise or to prevent any such appointment being made. The issue involved here is so serious that it cannot be glossed over, nor can it be accepted in the framework in which the Minister has put his suggestion to Deputy Lemass&mdash;that he should agree to have this Bill disposed of and the Seanad amendments accepted this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take it that if the Minister had resisted <Col N="2522" /> this amendment in the Seanad it would not have been made.  The Minister can have had no doubt whatsoever as to what the feeling of this House was in regard to this matter.  I have had no opportunity of seeking the debate on this particular amendment in the Seanad and I do not know whether the Minister did tell the Seanad that from what he had expressed here it was unlikely that such an amendment, if made, would be accepted by this House. If the Minister did not convey that to the Seanad, he was leaving the Seanad under some misapprehension.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">

      <P>The essential fact is that the amendment is before the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know it is.  The Minister understood what the viewpoint of this House was and he was in charge of the Bill in the Seanad.  I take it that if he had resisted that amendment in the Seanad it would not have been made.  I understand the Minister is very anxious to get the Bill through quickly.  I take it that there would not be any trouble about getting it through this evening had this amendment of fundamental importance not been made in the Seanad.  This House has, over a considerable period, dealt with this type of legislation, this type of restriction, and there had grown up a viewpoint that, if any such appointment was to be made from the Oireachtas, whether from the Dáil or the Seanad, it should have the approval of both Houses.  The Seanad says that as far as a member of Dáil Éireann is concerned they are not interested whether he is appointed to this board or not and that, as far as they are concerned, they do not want Dáil Éireann to interfere with their discretion.  That is what I consider the fundamental issue involved.  Is that to be permitted or is it not to be permitted?  Is Dáil Éireann to accept that position?  If we do accept that position, we create a very bad precedent that will very likely be followed and we will be establishing a position in which Seanad Éireann may obtain powers gradually that it was never intended to have within the Constitution and that Dáil Éireann will <Col N="2523" /> allow itself to lose powers gradually which are clearly given to it within the Constitution.</P>
      <P>This House is elected directly by the electorate and has a responsibility to the electorate and that responsibility will not be discharged if we allow legislation to pass through containing within it matters of this kind by which the House permits itself to hand over to another part of the Oireachtas powers which it ought to retain in its own interest and in the public interest.  That is what I consider to be the fundamental aspect involved in this amendment.  For that reason, I strongly urge on the House to accept the amendment proposed by Deputy Lemass so that this undesirable precedent will not be created.</P>

      <P>In effect, anyway. Certainly if what Deputy Cowan has said were taken as being in favour of Deputy Lemass's amendment, the insult that he sees to this House is the fact that the Seanad exercised its constitutional right to propose and pass an amendment to this Bill.  Let us leave that out of the discussion, because it is a matter that we should not discuss here and that I am sure nobody wishes to discuss.  But, as I said, the position is that the Seanad felt itself entitled to this view&mdash;that with regard to its own members, as a House of the Legislature it should retain jurisdiction and control over them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall come to that.  In connection with their own members they felt that it was right that they should retain that power and control over them.  Now, from that point of view, I can appreciate the <Col N="2524" /> arguments which would appeal to the Seanad in that connection.  But, looking at it from the point of view of this House, I do see some difficulty in following the arguments of Deputy Lemass.  As the Bill stood when it left this House, it was possible that the Seanad itself, contrary to the wishes of this House, could exercise control over a member of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the amendment then, the position could be that the Seanad itself, contrary to the wishes of this House, could exercise control with regard to a member of this House.  That I think involves a question of principle to which ordinary Deputies should be opposed.  As members of Dáil Éireann, the major branch of the Oireachtas, we should insist that our wishes with regard to our members should not, by any act of the Oireachtas, be interfered with by any outside body.  It is clear, if the amendment were accepted, that such a situation could arise: that we might decide&mdash;I do not suppose we would and it is hard to imagine circumstances where it would be possible &mdash;that a member of this House should be a member of the board under this Bill, and that the Seanad might think otherwise.  In that situation our view and our opinion would be completely set at nought if the amendment were accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In all fairness I do see sense and reason in the attitude of the Seanad. I think that unfortunately there has been too much of a tendency for members of this House, and for people generally, to curtail the activities of the Seanad in all directions.  I think that is a bad tendency.  Here, where they ask for a reasonable right merely in regard to the members of their own <Col N="2525" /> House, I do not see why we, in reason, should object to it.  In contradistinction to the Seanad view, I cannot see a reason for bringing about a situation in which we should give to the Seanad powers which they have not now, powers almost equal to the powers of this House.</P>
    <P>It is my recollection, certainly, that this very situation was foreseen by Deputy Lemass on the Committee Stage of this Bill.  The Deputy will correct me if I am wrong, but it is my recollection that Deputy Lemass was slightly opposed to the Minister's amendment in this connection.  He voiced his apprehension that, by reason of the wording of the Minister's amendment, he could see the Seanad having something to say about it and perhaps suggesting the very thing that was suggested here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <P>I do not want to go into details of the possible reactions of the Seanad, but for the reasons I have given, first of all because I consider the attitude or the request of the Seanad a reasonable one, I think we should agree with it. Secondly, and I take a strong view on this, I think the amendment proposed by Deputy Lemass could deprive this House of control with regard to its own members.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>Under his amendment we could have a situation which, by reason of a veto exercised by the Seanad contrary to the wishes of this House, a member of this House could not act on the board set up by this Bill.  In these circumstances we are giving to the Seanad a right which they have not at present, the right to veto action of ours and to dictate to us concerning members of this House. That is a situation which, as members of this House, and as the properly elected members of the people, we should not tolerate.  I commend that view particularly to Deputy Cowan.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that some members of the House are arguing this on a completely wrong basis.  This is not a matter of the privileges of members of either.  House which each House might be anxious to protect.  This is a matter of the public interest.  The suggestion is that a person should not be appointed to a board of this sort if he is a member of the Oireachtas, unless in exceptional cases.  That is in the public interest, and this House is the primary House concerned with the public interest.  If this House is to be deprived of that position I would rather by far not have the question of veto brought in at all.  If we, here, consider that it is in the public interest that a member of the Oireachtas should not be appointed a member of some board, then we should have the right to say &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  If the Seanad is to come in, as it insists on coming in, then the only way it can come in is by having the co-ordinate right to say &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  If I were drawing up an amendment, I would prefer restricting their right to a member of their own House, but, again, that might appear that it was a question of privilege and not a question fundamental to the public interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister very sincerely not to accept the amendment of the Seanad and not to use the majority which it is possible for him to get by putting on the Government whips to get the amendment accepted.  I do not know whether the Minister has consulted his colleagues about this.  I think it is a matter of very grave importance as far as the rights of this House are concerned&mdash;that is, its position in the safeguarding of the public interest.  We either do regard this as a matter affecting the public interest, or we do not.  If the public interest is involved, then we should not surrender our rights.  What Deputy O'Higgins has said is true to a certain extent, viz., if the Seanad have the power of veto and that we are prepared to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; and they say &ldquo;no&rdquo;, then you have the same situation as happens in the case of certain Bills, but in the case of Bills there is a way of resolving the dispute. If there is a difference between the Dáil and the Seanad about Bills there is a way of resolving it, but in this I <Col N="2527" /> do not see any way of resolving it if we say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; and they say &ldquo;no&rdquo;. They will have a definite veto.  If however it is in the public interest that a person who is a member of the Oireachtas should not be appointed to the board in question, unless in an exceptional case their veto is, I think, going in the right direction if they say &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  The public interest is going to be served by saying &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I strongly appeal to the Minister not to accept the amendment from the Seanad.  They have approached this from quite the wrong point of view.  It is not merely a question of privileges or of the rights of members of the House, it is a question of the public interest and we should not surrender our rights to pronounce upon it.  We are elected as the primary House, and it is on this House that the main burden of safeguarding the public interest is laid.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I should like to set the thing right.  I am sure Deputy Lemass did not intend to mislead the House in any way.  I stated what was my recollection of what happened on the last occasion that we discussed this in this House. May I refer to Volume 118, No. 8, column 1065 of the Dáil Debates in relation to that amendment?  I said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Might I shorten the discussion by asking if the Deputy would be prepared to alter amendment No. 15 slightly by providing at the end of the amendment that &lsquo;...no member of the Oireachtas shall be eligible to be appointed a director of the agency without a resolution of the Dáil&rsquo;?  I have no case in mind, but I could visualise circumstances in the somewhat distant future where you might deprive yourself of an extremely good man.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy Lemass then said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I accept that.  Let me say, however, that Deputies of this House know my views on this subject.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the amendment that I put forward to the House complied exactly with what I have suggested.  I mention that because I gathered the Deputy <Col N="2528" /> was under the impression that I had put forward a slightly different amendment.</P>
    <P>I think this whole matter is getting somewhat out of focus.  There have been a great many State corporations and companies formed, and different attitudes have been adopted in relation to them.  In some cases there was no provision, in the Acts creating them, precluding members of the Oireachtas from being members; in other cases there were provisions which precluded members of the Oireachtas from being members.  I think, in most cases, there was either a complete embargo or an embargo subject to a resolution in both Houses.</P>
    <P>On the whole, I think it is unwise that members of the Oireachtas should be on the board of any company which derives its funds from the Oireachtas itself.  I agree with Deputy Lemass in that.  On the other hand, I feel that you should not deprive yourself of the possibility, in an exceptional case, of availing of the services of a member of the Oireachtas.  But it would be only in an exceptional case, only where it is an outstanding case&mdash;a case where you would feel justified to the extent of coming before the House and saying: &ldquo;I ask leave of the House to put soand-so on because, obviously, he is an outstanding man.&rdquo;  I feel that no responsible Minister would take that step unless he felt absolutely justified and was assured of a certain degree of co-operation from the other side.</P>
    <P>I felt that the one purpose to be achieved by the amendment which was put in was to have some check, some brake on any tendency a Government might have to make a member of the Oireachtas a member of the board of directors.  That was the purpose of the amendment which was put forward when the Bill left this House.  The Seanad took the justifiable viewpoint that they felt it was wrong that one of their members should be discussed in this House.  There is a certain amount to be said for that.  I think you will get a reflection of the same differences in the Seanad as you will here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is an appointment in the public interest, surely not? <Col N="2529" /> It is not the man who would be discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy de Valera has in his time introduced many Bills in this House setting up State companies, and they contained no provision at all. You can introduce a Bill with no provision, leaving it open to any member of the Oireachtas to be a director, as was done by the Opposition during their term of office.  In that case the public interest was determined by the Government that made the appointment, not by this House nor by the Seanad.  In this case the public interest will be determined by the Government that makes the appointment, but, as a check on that, as a brake on the tendency that the Government might have to create a post or give a post to a political friend, we are providing in this Bill that that can only be done with the consent either of the Dáil or the Seanad, depending upon whether the proposed appointee is a member of the Dáil or Seanad.</P>
      <P>There is no question of principle involved. If there were a question of principle involved in this, then Deputy de Valera and his Party have broken that principle years ago, have ignored it completely.  It is purely a question of common sense, and there has been no set policy pursued.  I think there would be a question of principle actually involved in so far as this House is concerned if Deputy Lemass's amendment were passed, because it is in effect giving to the Seanad a right of veto on an appointment made by the Government and sanctioned by the Dáil, giving a right of veto to a body that, according to Deputy de Valera, is incapable of determining the public interest.  Therefore, it would be doing the very mischief that Deputy de Valera is worried about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lemass mentioned that the Dáil was depriving itself of powers.  It is not, as I am sure the Deputy fully realises.  The Dáil has power at all times to put down a motion to call for the dismissal or resignation of the whole board of directors.  In any case, the Dáil has already done so on many other occasions, because it has passed Bills without any provision, so I do <Col N="2530" /> not think there is much substance in that.  The aim is to put some brake on the tendency of this or any other Government to make a political appointment that would be unjustifiable. I feel that purpose is being achieved by compelling the Government concerned, should they ever be tempted to appoint a member of the Oireachtas, to seek the sanction of the particular House of the Oireachtas to which that person belongs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister's argument is altogether on a specious plane.  It is true that the previous Government did make appointments on boards of members of the Oireachtas, but we gradually came to the view that that was not a wise procedure, for two or three reasons.  One reason was that the Minister was, in this House, responsible for the conduct of some particular board&mdash;had some responsibility to the House in connection with it.  Suppose there was a member of the House also on that board.  If he was going to use his rights as a member, he would speak here, perhaps with a more immediate knowledge than the Minister.  The result would be that you would have two different voices about the same matter.  We came to the conclusion that it was better, in the public interest, that appointments of members of the Oireachtas should not be made to these companies.  It was argued here that there might be a very exceptional case.  What we are now trying to safeguard is that, if the exceptional case does occur, this House shall have a say in the matter.  The present amendment of the Seanad deprives the Dáil of any voice in the matter.  The Minister could make an appointment from the Seanad and this House, to which the Minister is primarily responsible, would have no say in that appointment.  I would regard it as a better procedure to have no check at all rather than to have what I consider to be the wrong type of check.  The Seanad amendment proposes to give the Seanad power in a case of this kind, a power which will put them in the position of taking the place of the Dáil, so to speak, in determining a matter which is fundamentally one of public interest.  I am quite prepared <Col N="2531" /> to accept the amendment put forward by Deputy Lemass which stipulates &ldquo;each House of the Oireachtas&rdquo; because that means, in effect, that such an appointment would have to pass the check, not of one House, but of both Houses.  If the Seanad are safeguarding their privileges, I think that is a quite sufficient safeguard.  The Minister is introducing a very bad principle in permitting one House, the Seanad, to act by itself as the guardian, so to speak, of the public interest because, if it is not on the grounds of public interest, there is no reason at all for it.</P>

      <P>Deputy de Valera has done both.  In his time he introduced some measures of this kind in which there was no safeguard at all.  He introduced others in which he left the veto on a question of public interest in the hands of the Seanad.  I am taking the middle course.  I am trying to benefit by the two diametrically opposite views and the two diametrically opposite policies pursued by Deputy de Valera in his time.  I am trying to take an in-between course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is right in one respect.  That is that the views of the Dáil, and particularly the views of Deputies at this side of the House at present, on the matter of the appointment of members of the Oireachtas to boards of statutory companies have changed.  At the beginning there did not appear to be any ostensible objection.  I think there was a member of the House appointed to the first Electricity Supply Board by the Cumann na nGaedheal Government. On the first Turf Board there were members of the Oireachtas.  There were members of the Oireachtas on some other boards.  It was experience gained over a number of years which showed the unwisdom of that course.  It was not a matter of suggestion that the Government might buy political support in either House by giving remunerated posts to Independent Deputies. <Col N="2532" /> It was because it impeded the proper functioning of the bodies themselves. It was because it complicated the position in the House and created unnecessary difficulties for the Government and because it generally proved to be an undesirable system.</P>
      <P>That change of outlook occurred over a number of years.  Subsequently boards, like the Turf Board, which was set up without any restriction upon the appointment of members, were made by subsequent legislation subject to this power upon the appointment of members of the Oireachtas. Towards the end, in 1946-47, the matter was once more discussed here.  It was our idea at that time, an idea which was clearly indicated to the Dáil, that there should be an overriding rule adopted in the Dáil and Seanad and implemented by legislation which would determine the circumstances under which Deputies or Senators could be appointed to any remunerative post in statutory companies, if at all; and it was contemplated that that overriding rule would follow from the recommendation of a committee of both Houses, which was to have been set up following the adoption of a resolution by both Houses.  Because of circumstances into which it is not necessary to go now that committee never functioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be a very good thing if such a committee was set up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly we may get agreement on its functioning now which we could not get heretofore.  In so far, therefore, as the Minister can point to the fact, that the practice was not uniform under various previous enactments, it is merely a debating point because the idea was that there should be some overriding rule, either a rule of the House or a rule of law, which would settle the matter and settle it, if our views were adopted, by the method of precluding members of either House of the Oireachtas from appointment to these posts except, perhaps, in very, very unusual or exceptional circumstances.  Now that is what the Minister has in mind in this Bill&mdash;the possibility of an appointment <Col N="2533" /> being made in unusual or exceptional circumstances.</P>
      <P>I think it is undesirable that the Dáil should not be consulted if these unusual or exceptional circumstances affect a member of the Seanad.  The purpose of my amendment is to ensure that if there is, in the view of the Government, a good and sound reason why a member of the Seanad should be appointed to a remunerative post on these boards, then the Dáil shall have an opportunity of expressing its views on the matter.  If I follow the Minister aright, his argument is that a member of the Dáil shall not be appointed without the consent of the Dáil and a member of the Seanad shall not be appointed without the consent of the Seanad.  I shall not try my hand at drafting another amendment <i>ad hoc</i> now.  I submit that the one I am proposing comes nearest to achieving that and is, in any event, in accordance with precedent.  May I suggest to the Minister that if he has in mind any idea that acceptance of an amendment to the Seanad amendment may delay his Bill, I do not think the position is as serious as he believes it to be?  We are now approaching Christmas.  I assume nothing will be done to implement the Bill before Christmas.  The Seanad must meet early in January to implement legislation from this House.  The delay would not be more than a matter of a few days and I am sure that if the Seanad learns the Dáil insists on having it in this particular form, they will not insist on having their amendment in its original form.</P>

      <P>I have a feeling that this matter is not nearly as important as Deputy de Valera and some others believe.  I am sure they are sincere in their belief.  I think this is a question of very much ado about very little.  I do not think it matters a whole lot which of the amendments are adopted.  I favour the attitude taken up by the Minister because I do not think it would be right, and Deputy de Valera has stated that this would be one of the effects of adopting the suggestion put forward by Deputy Lemass, to give an indefeasible right <Col N="2534" /> of veto to the Seanad.  That is what the result of Deputy Lemass's amendment would be.  That is what would result from the adoption of the proposition that the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas is necessary.  Deputy Lemass indicated that the views of the members of his Party in relation to this question have changed over the years as a result of experience.  He said the important thing was to get some overriding rule.  I think he indicated that in his view and in the view of his Party that overriding rule should be a general rule prohibiting members of the Oireachtas from appointment to these boards.  The Minister and most Deputies who spoke from these benches indicated that they agreed that members of the Oireachtas should not be appointed to these boards as a general rule.  The Minister also indicated that exceptional circumstances might arise. Deputy Lemass, in referring to the principle of an overriding rule, also limited that by saying that there might be unusual or exceptional cases where the general rule would have to be departed from.  It seems to me there is a large measure of agreement between all sections of the House on the subject. The only matter in question is the type of machinery which should be set up to carry into effect the clearly expressed and defined views of the House.  The Minister has pointed out that there are different types of enactments which have been used in the past and which could be used again.  The first is that you might leave out any reference to this question at all.  That view would not find favour now with any section of the House because of what both Deputy de Valera and Deputy Lemass have stated, that they and their Party have, over the years, changed their view in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second type of machinery would be the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  That carries with it, as Deputy de Valera stated, the granting of an indefeasible right of veto in the Seanad over the actions and wishes of this House in the matter.  The third is the proposition made by the Seanad and accepted by the Minister that the decision should be with the House of <Col N="2535" /> the Oireachtas from whom it is proposed to appoint the member.  It seems to me that course has some very practical advantages.  The whole argument made for providing any such machinery at all is that you may, in the course of time, come across a case of exceptional merit and, because of the exceptional merit of the individual in question, it is felt that that individual should be appointed to the board.</P>
    <P>One practical consideration which occurs to me is this: I am now a member of this House for nearly two years. I think I can say that I know, by appearance and by name, all the Deputies of this House.  I have formed my own opinion and come to my own conclusions with regard to the merits and to the competency and to the capabilities of the various Deputies in the House.  But I do not know, personally, or by appearance even, I think, one-third of the members of the Seanad. I think I would be completely incapable of, and incompetent to, pass judgment on a member of the Seanad as to whether or not he was a member of exceptional merit&mdash;of such exceptional merit as would warrant his being appointed to this board.  I think that is a practical matter which should be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>I should imagine that very many members of the Seanad do not know me or do not know more than one-third of the Deputies of this House and that they might feel exactly the same way and feel the same degree of embarrassment, if you like, if they were asked to discuss the merits of individual members of this House.  I think Deputy de Valera seemed to brush this aside, but I think it is essential to bear in mind that should an appointment of a member of the Oireachtas come up for discussion in either House of the Oireachtas it is going to be a very personal discussion.  The only case that could be made for the appointment relates to the personality, to the competency and to general merit of the individual.  It does not relate to any general question of public policy or of public interest.</P>

      <P>No, it is as an individual and because of his individual merit.  My example was that I, as, I think, an average new Deputy in this. House, could not claim to know anything about more than, roughly, one-third of the members of the Seanad. I think, therefore, that it would be most unfair to ask me to adjudicate on their merits.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lemass objected to the proposal which is made now by the Minister because he considers that the Dáil should have the opportunity of giving their views on the matter.  I think the Minister, in his opening statement, gave the answer to that.  At all times, in relation to this bit of legislation or any other legislation, the Dáil, and every Deputy in the Dáil, will have an opportunity, should he so desire, of giving his views on an appointment, even if the appointee is a member of the Oireachtas and the consent of the Dáil is not necessary.  He can do that by motion.  He can do that on the Minister's Estimate.  He can do that by means of a parliamentary question addressed to the Minister.  If necessary, as Deputy Lemass knows, he can raise the matter on the Adjournment.</P>

      <P>I do not think there is anything very important about this whole matter.  I think the suggestion put forward by the Minister at the behest of the Seanad is a very reasonable one. Generally speaking, I think it is a better one than the suggestion put forward by the Minister himself in response to Deputy Lemass and to which Deputy Lemass agreed in the Dáil&mdash;that the Dáil should have the say, and only the Dáil should have the say, no matter out of which House of the Oireachtas the appointee was coming. I think that there is really nothing of exceptional importance about the difference between the systems adopted.  I suggest to the Deputies opposite that they should let it go through.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>May I put the Deputy right on one point anyway?  It is quite true that we changed our mind over the years on the question of the desirability of appointing members of the Oireachtas to these boards.  In that connection I would point out to him that my amendment to this Bill was to impose a flat prohibition on such appointments.  I accepted the Minister's suggestion that an appointment could be made with the concurrence of the Dáil because it was the farthest I thought we could get him to go, though I think the best provision is a flat prohibition on such appointments.</P>
      <P>We have never changed our view as to the desirability of retaining in the Dáil full control over every matter which, in the opinion of the Dáil, is of public interest.  May I remind the House that on one occasion when that became an issue between the Dáil and the Seanad we enacted the necessary legislation&mdash;followed by a general election&mdash;which resulted in the dissolution of the Seanad?  We felt that was an issue on which the Dáil should not budge and we feel similarly now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This question which is before us may appear to be a comparatively minor question but the principle behind it is important.  Are we going to say that in the matter of the appointment of a member of the Oireachtas to a board of this kind the Dáil is to have no voice?  That is the question.  Deputy O'Higgins assumes that we debate here the individual merits only of the person proposed.  If there were a suggestion to appoint a member of the Seanad on the board of this company the first question we would discuss would be whether it was desirable that there should be a member of the Oireachtas on the board of the company.  If there were a claim of outstanding individual merit we would have to consider whether that individual merit was so outstanding as to outweigh the objections to the appointment of a member of the Oireachtas.  In that event, I think the question should come here. If, as would appear to be, there is objection to the amendment I am proposing here I am prepared to change that amendment, in the form I suggested, to provide that a member of <Col N="2538" /> the Dáil shall not be appointed except with the consent of the Dáil, nor a member of the Seanad without the consent of the Dáil and Seanad.  That meets the theoretical point that we are giving, by this amendment, the Seanad the power to veto an appointment of which the Dáil is prepared to approve. I think it is far better to give that power of veto, if you may so call it, to the Seanad rather than that we should deprive ourselves of the power to have any voice in the appointment of a member of the Seanad to the board.</P>

      <P>The point I want to make is this.  The method <Col N="2539" /> adopted by the Deputy and his Party was a method which took the control completely out of the hands of this House and vested it in the Minister or the Government as the case might be.  Deputy de Valera says that that was all very well, that he preferred that to this because no check is better than a wrong check.  I think that was the actual phrase used by him.  I do not want to become controversial about this at all, but it seems to me that, in fact, the attitude adopted opposite is that any check which is proposed by the Minister is a bad check.  I venture to suggest that it took Deputies opposite 16 years to have a change of viewpoint in relation to the major question of whether such appointments should be made or not. I think if they wait another 16 years they may change their mind on this, too.</P>

      <P>I feel the Minister ought to have accepted the gesture made by Deputy Lemass to him, that is, the gesture of accepting the amendment, going to the Seanad at the earliest opportunity and getting the Bill through.  I think that was a reasonable suggestion which might have been accepted.  However, it is entirely a matter for the Minister.  I do know of my own knowledge that this matter of the appointment of members of the Dáil or Seanad to State companies or State boards has been under consideration for a number of years and, strangely enough, the greatest objection to it arose in the Seanad.  It was really in the Seanad that the objection to the appointment of members of the Oireachtas to those State companies and boards developed. In the different debates, that point was stressed very strongly by Senators, particularly by Senator Luke Duffy, who was exceptionally keen on this particular matter.  Having stressed this over a number of years, the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, who had to do with a number of these companies, did come to the conclusion, so far as I recollect, that it was undesirable that any member of the <Col N="2540" /> Dáil or Seanad should be a member of those boards.  That was the changed opinion that has been mentioned here to-night by Deputy Lemass.  It was a change brought about by experience and also by criticism over a period. We had what you might call that mental development in regard to that. When the Minister introduced this News Agency Bill, he based it, as he told us, on the precedent of Bills that were introduced by the Fianna Fáil Administration.  He has defended this amendment this evening on the basis of the precedent created by Fianna Fáil.</P>

Gradually we can surrender our rights and give up our duties on very many important things in that way.  I take it that if a Senator or a Deputy is appointed by <Col N="2541" /> the Minister it is not absolutely necessary that one should know that individual personally.  I do not think that comes into it at all but one can at least know his political line-up.  I think that can be understood.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know there have been some appointments of that kind but that is the position that arises generally.  I should like to see this <Col N="2542" /> possible power of appointment of any member of this House or of the Seanad abolished as far as this Bill is concerned. After all, no member of this House or of the Seanad can be a member of the Civil Service and remain a member of this House or of the Seanad.  He cannot be a member of the judiciary or of the Army.  There are quite a number of other appointments that a member of the Seanad or of the Dáil may not hold and remain a member of these bodies.  Deputy O'Higgins has said&mdash;and I think the Minister himself puts it&mdash;that in the future there may be some exceptional person in the Dáil or Seanad who should be appointed to this board.  I gathered from the Minister that he does not see the possibility of making any immediate appointment, but that at some time in the future there may be this extraordinary person who should be appointed.  I would ask him not to bother so much about the distant future in regard to this particular Bill or in regard to any of the organisations that may be set up.  The view has been expressed, and I do not believe that this Bill will have a tremendously long life.  It is for that reason that I think it is unwise to be making provision for something that may happen in five, ten or 20 years' time.</P>
      <P>As far as the present set-up in the Dáil or Seanad is concerned, the Minister seems to take the view that there is no person of outstanding merit who could be appointed.  I gathered from him that the power he is seeking, to appoint a member of the Oireachtas, is not one that is going to be exercised immediately.  If that is so, and if this is only something that may arise in the future, then I think he should take the sense of this House and the very strongly expressed view of the House in regard to it.  As I said at the beginning, if he had accepted the approach made to him by Deputy Lemass and had agreed to this particular amendment, there would clearly be no difficulty whatever about having it accepted in the Seanad and the Bill would be in operation as soon as it was possible for him to have the articles of association prepared.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2543" /> I would make a further appeal to him to accept the suggestion that has been put forward.  It is a reasonable one but, however, that is a matter for the Minister. If he will not accept it, we will only have to try to convince him by argument that he is wrong in the line to which he is holding.</P>

      <P>I rise to appeal to the Minister, to Deputy Cowan and to the House to agree to the compromise suggested by Deputy Lemass.  Having heard the matter thrashed out for the last hour or more, I think the last suggestion of Deputy Lemass would fit the bill, that is, to provide that in the case of a member of the Dáil you leave the approval to the Dáil, and in the case of a member of the Seanad, you leave the approval to the Dáil and Seanad.  It could be easily fitted in and a few words would do it.</P>

      <P>The position is that the Seanad has strong views on this question.  They do not believe it would be proper for one of their members to be discussed here.  The whole question is largely academic.  I do not visualise any likelihood that the Government would want to appoint as a director on this board any member of the Oireachtas. I do not visualise that any person would be worth appointing on a board of this kind who would be prepared in present circumstances to submit himself to the kind of discussion that would take place about him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2544" /> There is a lot of nonsense talked about the public interest.  The public interest in matters of that kind is, and has been, usually left in the hands of the Government; but the Government is in this case including provisions which give a right of veto to one or other House of the Oireachtas, depending on the House to which the possible appointee would belong.  The public interest remains in the hands of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>This Bill has been discussed <i>ad nauseam</i> in this House and in the Seanad.  I do not think that anything more could be said.  This represents the views of the Seanad.  Two different courses have been adopted so far and I have taken the middle course.  I agree entirely with Deputy Lemass&mdash; and I hope that something may be done about it in the future&mdash;that there should be an examination by a Committee of the House of the over-all position, not merely of the rights of members of the Dáil or Seanad on the directorates of companies, but also as to their supporting position in State-sponsored companies.  I am in complete agreement with Deputy Lemass in his view that it is desirable that members of the Oireachtas should not be members of State companies.</P>

      <P>Why I asked was that I was wondering whether that amendment was put forward by some Senator with a sense of humour.  It is a very slovenly drafted amendment whoever was responsible.</P>

      <P>What I feel should be done is to try to keep up-to-date. Even if that objectionable form has been used in previous Acts, there is no reason why it should be followed. It is cumbersome and ridiculous.  Might I ask the Minister whether he will simply appoint this board for a year? This Bill would seem to imply that if this advisory board is to be of any value at all, it would need a reasonable period of office.  This system whereby the members of the board will be appointed for one year, will attract very few people because immediately any member of this advisory board expresses a viewpoint that the Minister does not like, he will disappear at the end of 12 months and somebody else will be appointed.  That is a matter for consideration.  I would like to know from the Minister what reason he had for agreeing to the introduction of this particular amendment, apart entirely from its form which will make membership of the advisory board membership for one year only unless the person is <Col N="2550" /> reappointed.  However, I cannot discuss it without having some information on the point and therefore I should like to know what the Minister's views are.</P>

      <P>(5)  The remuneration, if any, of the members of the advisory board shall be determined from time to time by the Minister after consultation with the Minister for Finance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make my position clear in regard to this.  As this Bill went through the House, there was some difficulty as to what the functions of the advisory board might be.  None of us visualised the possibility that any member of this board would be remunerated.  That was perfectly understood.  I think it is still the Minister's view that there will be no remuneration for any member of the board.  In this amendment there is provision for the remuneration of members, subject to its being determined <Col N="2551" /> from time to time by the Minister after consultation with the Minister for Finance.  That opens the door to payment. I can see no circumstances in which a person who accepts membership of the board, which will be rather in the nature of an honorary appointment, would be remunerated.  If we pass this amendment, there is no reason in the world why, if the Minister for Finance agrees, the members of this board may not be paid substantial salaries.  I feel that perhaps there ought to be an amendment to this amendment to provide specifically that no remuneration will be paid to any members. But that is hardly necessary.  If the Dáil rejects this amendment, then I do not think there will be power under the Bill to provide for remuneration. At no stage was the Minister able to indicate what the particular functions of the board would be, whether the board was to advise the Minister or to advise the directors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not discussing the functions of the board.  The point I am making is that, if the board has no work to do, then we ought not to provide remuneration for it.  This seems to be the last stage of the Bill as far as this House is concerned and it would be much better if we did not insert this amendment because during the discussions in the Dáil no person conceived that in any circumstances remuneration might be paid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say to the Minister that if we decide to pay salaries to the board I would regard it as a very grave abuse?  The provision for the remuneration of the directors of the news agency ensures that there will be sufficient salaried appointments in connection with it, and to put another tier on top of the whole structure, in the form of salaries to members of the advisory board, would be unprecedented and a gross waste of public funds.  It is a matter of indifference to me whether the Minister proposed this change in the Bill himself or merely accepted it to meet the Seanad.  I think, however, that he should make it quite clear now in everybody's mind, including his own, that he does not intend to provide salaries for the members of the advisory board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment merely provides that the remuneration, if any, will be determined by the Minister after consultation with the Minister for Finance.  If there was no such provision, it would be within the power of the directors to pay any remuneration they desire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cowan is quite right.  When the Dáil was considering the Bill in Committee, nobody even thought of the possibility of the members of the advisory board getting salaries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>There was incidental reference to it.  I cannot accept the Minister's contention that, if this amendment is not inserted, remuneration can be paid.  Clearly, if there is no statutory provision for remuneration it cannot be paid to anybody except with the authority of the Minister for Finance.  Is it not the general principle of the control of public funds that, if there is no statutory authority for payment, it cannot be done without the authority of the Minister for Finance?  What then is the purpose of this amendment?  It seems to me that the purpose of the amendment is to provide for the payment of remuneration. If words mean anything, that is what the amendment means.  The Minister says that, as far as this is concerned, it only provides that remuneration can be determined by the Minister in consultation with the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment provides that the remuneration &ldquo;shall be determined&rdquo; and not can be determined as the Deputy has said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I think that is even stronger because it does provide that there will be remuneration, and that it shall be determined by the two Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy deliberately misreading the amendment, which says that &ldquo;the remuneration, if any... shall be determined&rdquo;?  Is there anything mandatory about that? Is it not being deliberately left open?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>The words &ldquo;if any&rdquo; are put in there for no other purpose than to mislead.  It would be a simple thing for the Minister to answer and say whether or not the members of this advisory board will be remunerated, to say what likely circumstances may arise whereby they may be paid.  When the Bill was going through the Dáil, which is the House primarily concerned with the control of public funds, no such section was inserted in the Bill. When, however, it reached the Seanad the Seanad put in a clause which imposes a charge on public funds.  I can <Col N="2554" /> do nothing more than express my opposition to such a section as this, coming at the end of a very long debate on this Bill.  We cannot even yet get anything from the Minister beyond this, that remuneration may in certain circumstances be paid.</P>

    <P>That Dáil Éireann hereby approves <Col N="2555" /> of Control of Imports (Quota No. 13) (Amendment) Order, 1949.</P>
    <P>This Order relates to the importation of worsted and woollen piece goods. It is made under Section 4, sub-section (2), of the Control of Imports Act, 1934.  The Control of Imports (Quota No. 13) Order prohibited the importation, except under licence, of goods wholly or partly of wool weighing seven ounces per square yard.  The valued at 4/- per square yard.  The operation of the quota was suspended during the war.  It was reimposed on the 1st March, 1948.  The amount of the quota was fixed at 3,000,000 yards annually.  As it was clear that heavy importations were taking place, representations were made on behalf of manufacturers and trade unions to the effect that the business was getting into a critical condition and that employment in the industry was threatened.  The quota was amended in June of this year by the deletion of the price limitation and by a reduction in the weight from seven ounces to four and a half ounces for the first nine months of the year.  The effect of that amendment was not felt, mainly because commitments had been entered into and because supplies, which were ordered, only arrived subsequent to the amendment.  In the first nine months, approximately 5,000,000 square yards of all types of woollen and worsted fabrics were imported at a cost of just under £2,000,000.  The indications are that, as a result of the alteration in the weight and the deletion of the price limitation, the industry is now getting increased orders.  The employment that is at present being given is between 4,000 and 5,000 persons.  Machinery has been installed by a number of manufacturers which will enable the mills to produce cloths which have not been maunfactured in the past, mainly gaberdine cloth for raincoats and lightweight cloths for women's costumes.  It is expected that the competition which will result will have the effect of keeping prices at a reasonable figure and that the quality of the goods will also be satisfactory. The present import quota was fixed at 3,000,000 yards.  The quota for this <Col N="2556" /> part of the year, which will end at the end of February, is 1,500,000 yards.</P>

      <P>We are in favour of the Order and we will facilitate its adoption here, but I think the House should be made aware that the clothing manufacturers, or a section of them, are not very enthusiastic about it.  At all times there has been an obvious conflict of interests between the manufacturers of cloth and the manufacturers of clothing, arising out of the opposition of the clothing manufacturers to any extension of the protective measures for the benefit of the cloth manufacturers. That conflict of interests was not ever fully resolved, but in the interests of the protectionist policy we have to coerce the clothing manufacturers into taking the products of the Irish woollen mills in order to get the development of woollen manufacture. I think it is fair to say the woollen manufacturers were not always as appreciative of the help given to them as they should have been, or anxious to make a sufficient effort to meet the genuine needs or overcome the real difficulties of the clothing manufacturers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said that in the case of lightweight cloths competition will remedy the situation. I do not think there are so many producers of these lightweight cloths yet. There is one mill that is very efficient and I am sure there are very few complaints about the quality of its products. The clothing manufacturers want variety and that can only be assured by the introduction of a number of different producing units. The Parliamentary Secretary will want to keep pressure on the woollen manufacturers so as to ensure that they do not take advantage of the protection given to them to the detriment of the clothing manufacturers.  He must see that they will produce a full range of varieties.  He must supervise their <Col N="2557" /> quality and take whatever steps are open to him to extend the number of firms engaged in the manufacture of lightweight cloths.</P>
    <P>It is a difficult end of the woollen trade and only in the course of time can we hope to acquire here the proficiency that exists in other countries. That will not be done by all the clothing manufacturers on their own initiative. Whatever initiative they put into it will have to be supplemented by considerable pressure from the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what Deputy Lemass has said.  There has been a conflict of interests.  I think the Deputy will agree that one of the problems here is that most people expect the same variety in this country as is available elsewhere, and the size of the market has not in the past been sufficient to induce manufacturers to provide the degree of variety that is expected.  I can say, however, that one meeting has been held between representatives of the woollen manufacturers and the traders and also between representatives of the Industrial Development Authority, with a view to seeing what steps can be taken to meet the requirement to which the Deputy refers.  Further meetings will take place before the new quota is introduced in March.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Cosgrave)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This is a small measure designed to amend the Industrial and Commercial Property (Protection) Act, 1927, by deleting from Section 9 (1) certain words and repealing the Second Schedule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section makes provision for the fees to be charged by the Controller of Industrial and Commercial Property in respect of matters dealt with by the Industrial and Commercial Property Register Office under his control.  The <Col N="2558" /> office, which is commonly called the Patents Office, was established under Section 5 of the Act and deals with the grant of patents and the registration of designs and trade marks.</P>
    <P>Most of the activities under the control of the office involved the payment of fees by applicants and interested parties.  These fees are prescribed by the Industrial Property Rules, 1927, and the Register of Patents Rules, 1927.  The fees prescribed then have remained unaltered since that year.  In view of the change in the value of money, and in view of the alteration which has taken place in fees of other kinds under other Departments, it has been decided that there is a need for the revision of these fees by way of increase.  It is proposed, if this Bill is passed, to revise the fees upwards.</P>
    <P>Normally, fees of this character are variable by Order and the Order can be revoked or amended by a Deputy bringing it before the Dáil for discussion. Under this Act fees were prescribed and Section 9 provides, in respect of certain actions, the maximum fees which may be prescribed, and the 1927 Rules prescribe these fees as maximum fees.</P>
    <P>In effecting this amendment, it is proposed to remove from the Statute the provision enacting maximum fees, so that fees may in the future be prescribed and varied by statutory Order. Consequently, if Deputies require to discuss a particular fee or a variation in the fees, the Order can be brought before the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is probably correct enough that the fees fixed by the 1927 Act now require revision, but I think I am correct in saying that, when the 1927 Act was before the Dáil, there was considerable importance attached to the principle of having maximum fees prescribed in the legislation.  What this amending Bill does is to take the lid off, not merely to authorise an increase, but to remove statutory control over the fees.  In future, the fees will be prescribed by Order, but there is no provision for its annulment by the Dáil.</P>

      <P>Normally, I would prefer to argue this matter more fully, but in view of the limited time at my disposal, I shall not do so now.  These fees in the past usually produced about enough to meet the cost of running the office.  If the Parliamentary Secretary will give an assurance that they will be fixed on that basis, at whatever level will cover the cost of running the office and no more, I will be satisfied. I hope the Minister for Finance is not looking to these fees to meet his budgetary difficulties.  If he is satisfied to meet the cost of the Patents Office from the fees, and fix them on that basis, we will not argue any further.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">

      <P>What the Deputy says is a fact.  The fees received showed some profit until last year, when there was a slight loss.  The number of applications now coming in, and the variety, have increased considerably. I think I can give an assurance that the fees prescribed will bear relation to present-day values.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>On to-day's Order Paper I had a question addressed to the Minister for Agriculture.  The question was:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;To ask the Minister for Agriculture if he will state (a) what arrangements he has made for the marketing of the 1949 potato crop, (b) the countries with which he has negotiated for the export of potatoes, (c) <Col N="2560" /> what quantities of (i) seed and (ii) ware potatoes, set out for each of the different varieties which will be required by each country, and (d) the price per ton, under each head, which will be paid to the growers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The reply given by the Minister for Defence, Dr. O'Higgins, deputising for the Minister for Agriculture, was as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The export of both seed and ware potatoes has been undertaken by the Irish Potato Marketing Association who are acting for the Irish Potato Marketing Company which is about to be incorporated.  As negotiations for sale are at present in progress I am not in a position to give the information sought in the remaining parts of the question.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I submit that was an entirely unsatisfactory reply and I think it is fairly obvious that no attempt was made to give the information sought.  Let us take now the second paragraph in this reply, which reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As negotiations for sale are at present in progress I am not in a position to give the information sought&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Let us refer back to February of this year and to a quotation from the Dáil Debates of 24th February, 1949, at column 547.  On that date I asked the Minister for Agriculture:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If there will be a guaranteed price for this year's crop of seed potatoes, and if an unlimited market will be available.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister replied:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This matter is at present under discussion, and I am not yet in a position to state what the price may be or for what quantity a market will be available.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that the matter was under discussion and he added:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I hope soon to be able to make an announcement on the subject.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was in last February.  To-day we find that negotiations for the same sale of the same potatoes are still in progress. Let us refer then to the debates of 6th April, 1949.  On that occasion I also asked the Minister what the prospects <Col N="2561" /> were for the potato industry as a whole and what the prospects were for the sale and marketing of the 1949 crop.  At column 2377 the Minister also replied on that occasion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Negotiations are at present in progress regarding the export of seed potatoes of the 1949 crop but I am not yet in a position to make a definite statement in the matter.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In reply to a supplementary question on that date at column 2378 the Minister for Agriculture stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I can assure the Deputy that everything possible is being done to get a firm price which we can communicate to those who are concerned and who partake in the seed potato industry.  I expect to have it very shortly.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was in April.  The previous question was in February.  Both related to the sale and marketing of the 1949 potato crop.  According to a reply given to-day, these negotiations are still in progress.  If we wait a few months longer we shall be marketing both the 1949 crop and the 1950 crop together.  In to-day's reply we had a reference to the Irish Potato Marketing Association acting for the Irish Potato Marketing Company.</P>
    <P>In August of this year a prominent buyer, who has operated in County Donegal for many years, wrote to the Secretary of the Department of Agriculture asking for an export licence for the export of 2,000 tons of seed potatoes.  These seed potatoes were to be paid for at the rate of £12 3s. 4d. per ton for the first grades and £10 13s. 0d. per ton for other grades. That was the price to be paid to the grower at his farm.  The reply to that application for a licence in August last issued from the Department of Agriculture reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am directed by the Minister for Agriculture to refer to your letter of the 6th August and to state that he has arranged for the establishment of a non-profit-making company to handle and develop the export trade in potatoes.</P>
    <P>It is intended that the company, which will be representative of the <Col N="2562" /> exporters, growers and the Department of Agriculture, shall handle all exports whether for Great Britain or the Continent.</P>
    <P>As it is understood that the British Ministry of Food does not propose to purchase seed potatoes this season importers in Great Britain will no doubt make contact with their pre-war suppliers in this country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is exactly what did happen in the case of this buyer to whom I have referred.  The buyers in Great Britain, whom it had been his custom to supply in pre-war years, got into touch with him early in the summer and asked him to make arrangements to export to them 2,000 tons of seed potatoes.  He was not facilitated in that respect in any way by the Department of Agriculture. Further, in this letter the Department of Agriculture also stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Merchants may enter into negotiations with firms in Great Britain for the sale of seed potatoes, but pending the completion of legal formalities for the formation of the company the Irish Potato Marketing Association (Secretary, Mr. G. Finlay-Mulligan, 114 Grafton Street, Dublin) should be consulted before any sale is completed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There was then a further letter addressed by this buyer, as instructed by the Department of Agriculture, to Mr. Mulligan, secretary of the Potato Marketing Association.  He again asked for an export licence and facilities to export 2,000 tons of seed potatoes.  That was in last September. The reply he received was as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;With reference to your inquiry of 6th inst.  I should mention that after meeting our commitments with foreign countries there will be no Arran Banner or Up-to-Date available for export to England.  As regards other varieties, the committee of the association and the Department of Agriculture are at present considering the best policy and means for disposal of the surplus seed remaining after meeting foreign commitments.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Apparently they had then entered into <Col N="2563" /> certain commitments.  One would think that if they had entered into these commitments at that time that information could surely have been given to me in my question to-day.  But that information was not given to me to-day and that is one of the reasons why I am raising the matter now on the Adjournment.</P>
    <P>I would like to tell the House exactly what is happening to the surplus of seed potatoes in my county. At the present time seed potatoes are being sold and exported to Great Britain and the price to the growers is as yet unknown.  The growers, remembering the glut and the bad price of last year's crop, are stampeding to sell their potatoes in case they might be left on their hands.  While one might excuse the farmers in such circumstances rushing the sales of these potatoes, one cannot excuse the Department of Agriculture for encouraging this stampede by virtue of the fact that their inspectors are present at the shippers' stores checking in these potatoes, seeing that they are properly graded and sealing the sacks before they are put on the ship.</P>
    <P>I have made considerable inquiries in this whole matter.  So far as I can gather, the unknown price will not be more than £7 12s. 6d. per ton for these potatoes.  The particular variety is Home Guard.  In Northern Ireland the same variety is selling as seed for export to Great Britain at a price of £12 3s. 4d. per ton ex-farm.  Who are the buyers who are buying these potatoes from the Northern Ireland farmers?  Some of them are the very same people who contacted their agents in this country to get them the seed potatoes from Donegal and those buyers, in turn, were refused export licences by our Department of Agriculture and were later refused facilities by an Irish Potato Marketing Association. Those agents would have given, and are still prepared to give, £12 3s. 4d. for Home Guard Donegal seed which is now being sold at £7 12s. 6d. at the maximum as ware potatoes, and both sets of potatoes, ware and seed, of that variety, are going to the same market.  How does it come about that the same potatoes, <Col N="2564" /> the same seed and the same varieties, are being sold on the same market at a difference of £4 10s. 0d., approximately, per ton to the grower?  How can any Minister stand over his negligence&mdash;and it is negligence that has led to the state in which we find the potato market in our Twenty-Six Counties at the moment?</P>
    <P>Referring again to this Potato Marketing Association, we were led to believe during the summer of this year, and possibly earlier&mdash;this record which I have of it is of early September&mdash; that the Potato Marketing Board was being set up as a non-profit-making company.  On several occasions since, we have been told that this board was about to be set up.  In the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 15th November last we find a heading: &ldquo;Effort to Reduce Adverse Balance.&rdquo;  Under that heading, and in black type, is the following extract:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A potato marketing marketing board, promised by Mr. Dillon recently in the Dáil, will shortly be set up to seek for markets, especially for seed potatoes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This board has not yet been set up, although it has been promised time and again.  The only thing we have in its place is a Potato Marketing Association. This body, the Potato Marketing Association, have been the cause&mdash;on one occasion that I know of and possibly on other occasions&mdash;of refusing facilities to help our farmers to get the best price obtainable on the British market for seed potatoes.</P>
    <P>I have here another query in respect of a firm in Liverpool&mdash;the firm of Messrs. J. Johnson and Sons, Liverpool&mdash;who wanted 1,000 tons of Home Guard at £12 3s. 4d. and 400 tons of King Edwards.  They wrote, as they had been led to believe they could, to this Potato Marketing Association.  I think it is approximately six weeks ago since they addressed a query about these 1,400 tons of potatoes.  As yet, they have received no reply.  That is what this Potato Marketing Association have done for us.  We are wondering if this potato marketing board will ever come to light, and if and when it does, if it will be any improvement on the exhibition given by the Association <Col N="2565" /> to date.  If it should follow the same lines of those taken by this Association, then I think it would be better for the potato growers, in my county at any rate, that there should be no board of any kind set up and that, as in former years prior to the emergency, the buyers and the agents should seek the markets and obtain them as they did then&mdash;and with much better results, I think, than these people have given us to date.</P>
    <P>Another thing that strikes me as being very peculiar is that in the Twenty-Six Counties the estimated yield of seed potatoes for this year is approximately 60,000 tons.  In the Six Counties, I am informed, the approximate yield this year is 160,000 tons.  In the Six Counties at the moment there is no trouble whatsoever.  The farmers there find no difficulty in any way in disposing of all this quantity of seed potatoes.  Yet here in the Twenty-Six Counties, and with only 60,000 tons, we are already selling our seed potatoes as ware potatoes and at a ware potato price, and, I may say, at a bad ware potato price at that.  Surely there is, therefore, something very far wrong with people in charge of this very important industry?  I suggested to the Minister in February of last year that unless encouragement were given to our farmers and a price announced, and they were assured that a market was available, our acreage under potatoes would fall.  The Minister, on the 24th February, I think, scoffed at the idea that any such effects would follow if he did not get a market and a price and announce them immediately. It is worth noting that, on the statistics available at the moment, we are short 40,000 acres approximately under potatoes this year as compared with last year.  I would suggest that if this bungling of the seed potato market is allowed to continue this year, and considering the hardships suffered by the seed growers last year, you will find a much reduced acreage under seed potatoes in the coming year.</P>
    <P>I would go so far as to say that, unless a very definite improvement is arranged in connection with the marketing of the seed potatoes, this very <Col N="2566" /> lucrative industry will eventually peter out.  We must not forget that this is an industry which takes years to build up.  If the stocks of the different varieties of seed potatoes are allowed to dwindle and disappear, and if we are to get back to the competitive market again it would take nothing short of ten years to build up the industry to the strength at which it is to-day.  Therefore, this question of the seed potato market is much more serious than it actually appears.  It is not just this year's crop&mdash;it is the whole seed potato industry that is at stake.  Even now, at this late hour, I would ask those responsible&mdash;since negotiations according to themselves are still progressing&mdash;to make a public statement to the effect that these negotiations are still going on and that while they are going on and until they are concluded the seed potatoes should not be sent out of this country as ware potatoes and at a bad price.  They are going out, and with the knowledge of the Department of Agriculture, and they are going out with the help of the inspectors of that Department at the shippers' stores.  That is something over which the Minister has direct control.  Despite the fact that things are in a bad condition at the moment and although, at the same time, many farmers have lost considerably already &mdash;after all that&mdash;if our negotiations were rushed through we could save some of those farmers from hardship and save this seed potato industry.  I would again point out that the same potatoes, the Home Guard variety, are fetching £12 3s. 4d. per ton ex-farm in the Six Counties while they are being sold by the farmers in my county at a price which will not exceed £7 12s. 6d.  Something is wrong there and I would ask the Minister that some action should be taken about it.</P>

      <P>I think it rather unfortunate that the Deputy could not discuss this matter without, in a rather laboured and irrelevant manner, going outside the scope of the question, in order to pay a fulsome tribute to the Government of Northern Ireland and, at the same time, attempt to detract in the eyes of <Col N="2567" /> the world from the respect and esteem in which the Government of this State is held.  The whole substance of the question on the Adjournment Debate this evening would never be raised by any Deputy of adequate experience and it is a pity that the Deputy, before raising the matter, did not seek the advice of some of the ex-Ministers opposite.</P>

      <P>I am sorry to hear the Deputy say that.  There was a question put down to the Minister for Agriculture to-day&mdash;and I would ask the exMinister present to pay attention to this&mdash;which asked the quantity of potatoes exported, the type of potato and the price for each type of potato exported to the various countries.  The Deputy got a reply to the effect that an attempt was being made to organise the marketing of potatoes through the marketing board, that negotiations had concluded with some countries and that they were still proceeding with other countries.  In light of the fact that negotiations are actually under way, that Dutch negotiators are there at the present moment and that our officials are trying to make the best possible bargain and to get the highest rate possible for Irish potatoes, I was expected to bleat out, for the edification of Deputy Blaney, what price we got for each type of potato in every country where negotiations had concluded. Ex-Ministers opposite would be able, and would be entitled, to charge me with national sabotage if I disclosed figures of that kind while negotiations are taking place.</P>

      <P>Deputy Killilea should conduct himself.  I replied to the Deputy to the effect that negotiations were actually proceeding at the moment and that, in the circumstances, I should not be pressed to give the <Col N="2568" /> information asked for.  Negotiations have been proceeding right through the year in connection with various items of agricultural produce, with every possible country prepared to engage in such negotiations with us.  Negotiations have been concluded, and very satisfactorily concluded, with regard to potatoes with five countries already, and the sixth may be concluded to-night. In replying to the Deputy, I asked him not to press for further information on this point and the way that request was received by the Deputy was to move for permission to raise the matter again on the Adjournment. The Deputy has an unfortunate knack of doing, perhaps unwittingly, immense national damage by the speeches which he makes and the matters which he raises.  Last year it was flax.</P>

The Deputy is not long here but he should learn that by attempting to seize on any particular policy here in order to acquire a temporary political kudos, he can do immense harm to his neighbours.  If I were to answer the Deputy very fully, when he raised the question this afternoon and repeated it this evening, I would be doing great damage to the interests of the Deputy's constituents and neighbours and of every potato grower up and down the country.  I, therefore, refuse in the public interest, and particularly in the interests of potato producers and people who have potatoes for sale, to give the Deputy the information he is asking for.</P>
