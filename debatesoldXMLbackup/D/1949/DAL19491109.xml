      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he will state the present position regarding the proposal for the erection of national schools at Ballincollig, Kilmurry and Knockamanna (Minane Bridge), County Cork, and when building will commence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="Minister for Education (General Mulcahy) Richard (General) Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (General Mulcahy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department has sanctioned a grant towards the cost of the erection of new schools to replace the present Ballincollig Boys' and Girls' National Schools, County Cork, and the arrangements for the erection of the new buildings are in the hands of the Commissioners of Public Works.  I understand from the commissioners that they hope to have in the near future the working drawings, specification and bills of quantities completed and to be in a position to invite tenders.  It will be necessary, however, to have the site vested in trustees by an official lease before the commissioners can proceed to invite tenders. This matter is being attended to and is not expected to cause any delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of Kilmurry National School, certain difficulties arose as regards the acquisition of a suitable site and the type of school to be erected.  These difficulties have been overcome and the Department has now received an estimate of the cost of the new school from the Commissioners of Public Works.  Subject to agreement with the manager as to the local contribution to be provided towards the cost, and to the production of evidence of title which will enable the site to be <Col N="560" /> vested in the trustees, the Department will be in a position to sanction a grant for the erection of the new school.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Knockamanna National School, the manager has offered a suitable site for a new school and as soon as the local contribution to be provided has been determined and satisfactory evidence of title to the site has been furnished, a grant towards the cost of the new school will be made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Considering that the building of these schools has been simply at the proposal stage for many years past, may I take it that the Minister will do all he possibly can to have their erection expedited?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Circumstances over which nobody had any control operated to delay the consideration of some of these matters that are of very old standing&mdash;at least some of them.  The position is now so clear that I do not think there will be any difficulty and it will be possible to proceed in the normal way once certain points are settled, particularly with regard to the sites and the vesting of the sites in the trustees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he will make regulations requiring the National Flag and a copy of the 1916 Proclamation to be displayed in all national schools in the Republic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether he will arrange for the display in every classroom in our national schools of a copy of the Proclamation of Easter Week, 1916, and of photographs of the signatories to the Proclamation, and if he will further arrange to have instructions given to all children attending the national schools in regard to the respect to be paid to the National Flag and the National Anthem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have given careful consideration to the suggestions implied in the Deputies' questions and I have come <Col N="561" /> to the conclusion that no useful purpose would be served by making and enforcing regulations such as they recommend. Symbols so precious as the National Flag and the 1916 Proclamation are apt to have their significance obscured and their appeal blunted if, instead of being reserved for solemn national occasions, as I think they should be, they are made subject to casual every-day familiarity.  The better way, in my opinion, to inculcate patriotism in the young people of our national schools is to base it firmly on instruction in our language, our history, our music and song and our folk-lore.  Respect for the National Flag and worthy pride in the sacrifices and achievements connected with our history will naturally follow and be stronger and more deeply rooted than if their growth appeared to be dictated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the view expressed by him is one that runs directly counter to that taken by leaders in other countries and that suggestions such as are implied in the Deputies' questions have for a long number of years been carried out in the United States of America?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>We are going through our own growth, both in our institutions and their management and in the rooting of our patriotism in the realities of Irish character and Irish tradition.  If at any time it appears that any of these things is necessary and would help in any way towards that, then the matter can be reconsidered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister reconsider it if he accepts the assurance from me that there are numbers of young people in our schools who cannot give a list of the leaders executed in 1916?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, land acquisition is a slow and protracted procedure at present.  When the Land Bill, recently circulated, becomes law, many of the delays attaching to land purchase will be eliminated, while the payment of market value for land will result in greater satisfaction for all parties to the proceedings.</P>
      <P>As regards the Land Commission's recent activities in County Meath, proceedings have been instituted in respect of 6,000 acres while a further 4,000 acres are under consideration.  It is impossible to forecast what area will be allotted in the coming 12 months.</P>

      <P>Steps have been taken already to develop afforestation in West Cork.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree that when a worker takes up employment it is reasonable that such worker should know exactly what his conditions of employment will be? Does he not agree that that principle should operate in the forestry section?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the actual practice.  Forestry workers are always informed by the forest foremen what their conditions of employment will be &mdash;their wages, hours and so on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week, in reply to a question similar to this, the Minister indicated to me that the conditions of work of forestry workers were more or less confidential matters for the guidance of Departmental officers.  Surely it is not equitable that such matters should be kept secret?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>In actual practice nothing concerning forestry workers is kept secret.  There is no reason why such a practice should exist.  Forestry workers always inquire as to what their conditions are.  I am sure they do so.  Certainly we have had no complaints from workers along those lines.</P>

      <P>By the very simple explanation that I have been Minister for Agriculture for 18 months and that no amount of mechanisation will persuade pullets that were hatched nine months ago to lay eggs mechanically. I agree with the Deputy that the object should be so to breed the fowl population as to ensure that there will be willing pullets at work at this time of the year.

Speaking recently at the county committee of agriculture in Sligo, I announced my intention of employing a series of remedies in the event of the bacon curers trying to depart from equity and justice in this matter.  I am not satisfied, that, by and large, the bacon curers are not acting reasonably on the whole.  I do not expect the bacon curer, and I never asked the bacon curer and I never will ask the bacon curer to pay the top price for every pig brought into the factory.  I expect them to pay 190/- for the top grade and to reduce the price payable by 2/- in respect of each higher grade pig up to 1¾ cwts. But, so far as farmers who desire to bring their pigs of over 2 cwts. to the factories are concerned, I have said on more than one occasion that day is done and I will be no party to pretending to farmers that it will ever come back again.  There is no market now for pigs of that weight.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Prices for over-weight pigs have declined, but prices for pigs of optimum weights have remained generally at a satisfactory level.  I have repeatedly pointed out in recent months that the day of the over-weight pig is gone.</P>
      <P>Prices charged by the factories to merchants have been reduced in the case of bacon of the heavier type, while, for the more choice cuts, the prices have not fallen.  Similarly, the retail price of the choicest cuts has not been reduced, while the retail price of other cuts has.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government whether he is aware that the cul-de-sac roads in County Roscommon are badly in need of repair, and that the local authorities, although willing and anxious to improve these roads, are prevented by statute from doing so unless the roads were repaired in the grand jury days prior to 1898; and, if so, whether he will take steps to alter this state of affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It has long been the <Col N="596" /> practice for the local people primarly interested in the improvement of roads of this type to co-operate in the preparation of proposals for which grants may be made available by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance through the special employment schemes office.  Since the enactment of the Local Authorities (Works) Act, 1949, local authorities possess certain powers to carry out works for the protection from flooding, etc., of roads for the maintenance of which they are not responsible where in the opinion of such local authority the carrying out of such work is in the public interest.</P>
      <P>A new policy was embodied in the scheme of Road Fund grants notified to local authorities this year, whereby a greater proportion of the total grant was diverted from work on main roads towards the cost of carrying out essential and durable improvements on county roads.  This policy will be continued in the forthcoming financial year to such extent as the relative needs of the various classes of roads in each area permit and the full amount estimated to become available from the Road Fund will be needed to give effect to it.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, I do not consider that any useful purpose would be served by conferring further statutory powers on road authorities in respect of roads for the maintenance of which they are not at present responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that it is with the improvement and repair of these roads that I am concerned, not the drainage of the roads?  Is he further aware that this year the Roscommon County Council was surcharged £2,700 for the repair of cul-de-sac roads?  Is he also aware that we have now the extraordinary position that, in the case of two villages side by side, a road into one village is being repaired by the county council because it was repaired prior to the grand jury days, while the road into the other village, which is equally in need of repair, cannot be repaired because it was not done prior to the grand jury days?  I understand that the people living in that village <Col N="597" /> had to subscribe for the repair of the road.  Does the Parliamentary Secretary consider that is a fair position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>If the county councils consider that a cul-de-sac is of any general public utility they may expend certain moneys on its repair.  As far as the surcharge on the Roscommon County Council is concerned, I think the Deputy is also aware that it did not adversely affect the Roscommon County Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Although it did not adversely affect the Roscommon County Council inasmuch as they have not to pay the £2,700, yet, more than 120 miles of cul-de-sac roadway have been knocked off the repair list permanently by the Roscommon County Council because they are afraid that in future years they would be again surcharged and would not get away with it as they did this year.  These roads will no longer be repaired by the Roscommon County Council.</P>

There are 50,000 miles of public roads and 20,000 miles of cul-de-sac roads.  It is a matter that has been a source of trouble to every Government and that requires earnest consideration continuously with a view to dealing with the matter.  Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware of the fact that the definition of a road which has a general public utility from the legal point of view, precludes the repair of cul-de-sac roads unless there are very exceptional circumstances?</P>

      <P>When the debate was adjourned on Thursday last.  I was dealing with the right given by Section 8 to the prosecution to read depositions in cases of the death, insanity and illness of a witness.  I had at the time indicated that I agreed altogether with the views expressed by all the other Deputies who had then spoken, that the giving of this right to the prosecution is undesirable.  I should be prepared to concede that right in the case of the death of the witness who had made the deposition, but, in the other two cases, I think it is a right which the House ought not to give, and <Col N="600" /> accordingly, I ask the Minister to reconsider the terms of Section 8.  I agree that it is very necessary that the State should have effective means of dealing with criminals and bringing them to justice, but we should be very jealous of the rights established by tradition in our courts.  These rights leant very decisively in the direction of the liberty and protection of the individual.</P>
      <P>The next section to which I wish to refer is Section 21.  In passing, I might mention that the explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill refers to Section 18 as the section which deals with the remission of punishment, forfeitures and disqualification imposed by a criminal court.  There is obviously a mistake in the memorandum because Section 21 is the relevant section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timoney</NameTxt>
      <P>I see; I did not know that this was the original memorandum circulated with the Bill.  In any event, I welcome this provision, because the Minister will agree that the law was in a fairly uncertain state with regard to the rights of remission of punishment and forfeiture.  There is a very interesting article on this very question in the <i>Irish Law Times</i> of 27th November, 1948, with which I expect the Minister has acquainted himself.  It deals generally with this right of remission, points out that it is part of the royal prerogative and goes on to indicate that this power of remission, which the Minister for Justice apparently, since the setting up of this State, exercised, was hardly constitutional at all.  Certainly, since the passing of the present Constitution, it would appear that there was in fact no right in any person, Minister for Justice or anybody else, save the President, to remit punishment.</P>
      <P>The relevant article of the Constitution is Article 13, paragraph 6, which reads:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The right of Parliament and the power to commute or remit punishment imposed by any court exercising criminal jurisdiction are hereby vested in the President, but such <Col N="601" /> power of commutation or remission may, except in capital cases, also be conferred by law on other authorities.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am not aware of any enactment which gives this power of remission to anybody and it would be well, now that the power is being expressly conferred by statute, that the Minister would direct his attention to abuses which occurred as a result of the exercise of this power, which, as I said, appears to have been altogether <i>ultra vires.</i></P>
    <P>It has occurred on several occasions that a warrant was issued, endorsed to be returned in three months if not executed, and the Guards would not execute this warrant if they found out, in some way or other, that the convicted person had sent a petition to the Department of Justice.  I understand that there was a circular issued to Garda superintendents to the effect that they were not to execute warrants where a petition had been sent to the Minister for Justice.  I do not know what machinery there was to notify the Guards whose duty it was to execute the warrant that a petition had been sent.  They were certainly, I am quite sure, seldom if ever notified by the convicted person who was sending the petition.  In any event you had the rather ridiculous situation that, while the Minister for Justice, or whoever was acting for him in the capacity of examining the punishment inflicted with a view to its remission, was going into the question, the warrant was lying unexecuted and very often went out of date.</P>
    <P>It is a nice question which I would like the Minister to consider as to whether we are entitled to give to him the right to interfere with the order of a competent court.  If we pass Section 21 as it stands we are giving, not only to the Minister for Justice but to any other Minister of State, the right to say to a court that the court was wrong and that the infliction of the penalty was incorrect.  There is power in the court to give time for the payment of monetary penalties and it has been the experience of every practitioner that, where any sort of case at all is made <Col N="602" /> by a convicted person who asks for time, the court is generally very generous indeed.  As I say, it is a very serious thing to interfere with the administration of justice in the country.  It is a question which I should like the Minister to consider as to whether the taking of this power to himself, or to any other Minister, is within the terms of the Constitution. It would be most unlikely, I agree, that even if this power is given, the question of its constitutionality will ever be raised, because the only people who would be interested in it would be those who would be trying to have penalties remitted, and they certainly, if they get a remission of the penalty, would not take any steps to show that the remission was unconstitutional. However, that does not detract from the fact that we should be particularly careful here that we do not lend ourselves to unconstitutional legislation.  There has been enough of it, perhaps, already.</P>
    <P>While saying that, I quite appreciate that it is a useful thing to have a power of this kind, provided we can be satisfied that it is within the Constitution because there are cases where circumstances may not be known to the court or to the defending solicitor or counsel which, if known, would induce the court to inflict a penalty less severe than that inflicted. As I say, it is a useful power to have in the statute subject to the provision that, firstly, it is constitutional and, secondly, that it is a power which will not be abused.  Perhaps the second provision, that of the abuse of the power, is as important, if not more so, than the first.  It does lend itself to abuses and they are abuses that it is perhaps very hard to have brought to the light of day.  I think I can fairly say that, as far as I know, heretofore it is a power or privilege which has not been abused by the present Minister for Justice or any of his predecessors.</P>
    <P>The provision in Section 17 with regard to the transfer of trials in the Circuit Court from one place to another has been attacked very vigorously by Deputy Cowan, I think. I must say that I would approve of this provision.  I had personal professional <Col N="603" /> experience of one criminal trial in which the jury disagreed twice and on the second disagreement it was mentioned in court that there were five members of the jury who had the same surname as the accused.  It was almost a certainty that more than 50 per cent. of these five people were related to the accused.  There was a second disagreement, as I said, and on an application by the counsel for the Attorney-General, the Circuit Court judge directed that the case be returned for trial from the Circuit Court to the Central Criminal Court.  There is power there already to transfer a case from the Circuit Criminal Court to the Central Criminal Court.</P>
    <P>I think that that is a greater hardship on the accused and the witnesses than transferring the Circuit Court trial from one town to another.  I think that the interests of justice would not be defeated at all by giving this specific power to Circuit Court judges and, accordingly, I approve altogether of this section.  I do not think that there is much in Deputy Cowan's point about hardship with regard to witnesses, because I have found that the local superintendents of the Garda are extremely helpful and obliging in cases where a defendant's solicitor sends in a request to have a particular witness for the defence brought.  Even though the prosecution did not want him at all, they would bring along that witness at State expense.</P>

      <P>That may very well be, but I do not think it has any relevance to Section 17.

      <P>The power is already given to Circuit Court judges to send cases to the Central Criminal Court. This power given under Section 13 to members of the Garda to fix bails for persons whom they have arrested is, I think, an outrageous thing.</P>

      <P>I am not familiar with the practice in Dublin, but I certainly think that members of the solicitors' profession in the country would be horrified at the provisions of Section 13. It is conferring, so far as I can see, a judicial power on members of the Garda.  I can very well envisage a member of the Garda taking a man into the barracks for some reason or another and fixing a very high sum for bail.  I can very well envisage a case arising on the constitutionality of the Garda's right to fix bail and exercise a semi-judicial, if not altogether a judicial function.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to Section 18, on the question of clearing the court and prohibition of publication of the court's proceedings, I read the Seanad debate on that section.  There were very strong views expressed there.  I think, however, that it is a good provision to have and I have none of the fears expressed in the Seanad that the enactment of this provision would give power to turn the <Col N="605" /> courts into private star chambers.  I do not think there is any danger whatsoever of that happening.</P>
    <P>With regard to the provision which enables accused girls to have with them a woman friend, I think that is rather too narrow in these cases.  I think the accused should have the right to have a number of people present. It was mentioned that the right should be confined to the parents of the accused.</P>

      <P>Section 19 is a very useful section, but I doubt if it will do what it is intended to do, and that is to remove the formality that surrounds the entering up of the justice's minute book.  It is not the first attempt which has been made to have decisions of the District Court made what you would call, without any disrespect to the justice, foolproof.  There is a very strong attempt being made in the section to make the recording of the decisions foolproof.  Whether that will be successful or not, time alone will tell.  It is, however, a strong attempt and, as such, I welcome it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just a few matters that I wish to refer to in regard to this Bill.  It is a Bill of some importance and I think is a welcome one.  I make that general observation in relation to the Bill, but I should like to say this.  Reference was made by Deputy Boland to the fact that this Bill is confined purely to the criminal jurisdiction of the District Court and <Col N="606" /> that he was rather looking forward to a similar Bill dealing with the civil jurisdiction of the District Court.  I should like to say a word of warning to the Minister with regard to any extension of a similar provision to the civil side of the District Court, because it seems to me that in this Bill, and in many other Bills of a similar nature dealing with civil matters, we are rapidly getting back to the stage where we will have a court similar to the old British County Court in operation here.  There were defects in that system.  It was tried for a great number of years here and, generally speaking, it was not a success.  I hope, if there is any further extension of the civil jurisdiction of the District Court considered by the Minister, that this matter will be gone into very carefully, and after due consultation with the members of the legal profession interested.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Bill itself, I think Deputies will appreciate that, under this Criminal Justice Bill, added responsibilities and added duties are being placed upon the officers of the District Court, not merely the justices, but also the clerical officers employed in that court.  Might I say in passing that, while the House, if this Bill is passed, does cheerfully give to those officials increased duties, increased work and increased responsibilities, it must also remember that, at some stage under the operation of this Bill, these particular officials, both justices and District Court clerks, will be entitled to better conditions of pay and better conditions for their services?  The District Court clerks, upon whom will fall the main responsibility of enforcing the provisions of this Bill, are, in my opinion, amongst the most neglected of State servants.  I think it is high time that some proper gesture should be made to them and that some proper recognition should be given of their responsible position and duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Bill itself there are only one or two matters which, in my opinion, require some attention.  The first relates to the provisions of Section 8. I entirely endorse the criticism which has been levelled, I think, from all sides of the House, at the provisions <Col N="607" /> contained in Section 8.  There is always the tendency in any Parliament legislating in criminal matters to make the job of those in a State prosecution, in securing a conviction, easier.  That tendency has always been there.  It is a tendency which, in my opinion, should be fought as much as possible. We have in our system of law the pious feeling and the pious notion that we do everything to ensure a fair trial for a person charged with a criminal offence. We insist that, under our legal system, the person in the dock is afforded all the protection which justice requires, but that, in my opinion, particularly in view of the legislation passed over the last 20 years or so, is rapidly being whittled away.  Under Section 8 we are providing an easy mode of proving matters in a criminal case which could not be proved in a case tried on the civil side of the court.  I do say to the Minister that, if we are going to allow a deposition taken in the District Court to be used in evidence at the trial of an accused person&mdash;if the conditions set out in the Bill are satisfied &mdash;then we are enacting something completely novel in the history of criminal law.  I think that is a provision which will require considerable study and consideration before it is enacted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should read sub-section (2).</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that.  I understand it was suggested that sub-section (2) of Section 8 afforded some protection to the accused.  In my opinion, no protection is contained in that sub-section.  The sub-section provides that:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In the case of the deponent's insanity or illness the deposition shall not be read without the accused's consent&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>Now, if the sub-section stopped there, of course, there would be ample protection and no serious injustice would be caused, but the sub-section goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;&ldquo;unless the court is satisfied that the deponent is unlikely to recover within a reasonable time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, power is being given <Col N="608" /> under that sub-section&mdash;if the deponent is ill or is unlikely to recover within a reasonable time&mdash;to insist that the deposition be read in evidence.  I agree that, under that section, there is a provision which provides that the deposition can only be so read if the accused person, or his legal representative, has had an opportunity of cross-examining the deponent at the time the deposition was made.  That appears to be fair, but in actual practice experience will show that it is really no safeguard.  When depositions are taken in a case which is likely to be tried out before a jury, no representative appearing on behalf of an accused person will lightly indulge in any vigorous cross-examination of the deponent.  More often than not, cross-examination is reserved, and even where cross-examination does take place&mdash;the depositions are taken in long hand&mdash;no cross-examination could under any circumstances be effective.</P>
    <P>I do say to the Minister that the whole provision in that section should be further considered by him and by the Department.  It has, of course, been pointed out very effectively by a number of Deputies that, under Section 8, we are providing for something which would not be tolerated on the civil side of the court.  Every plaintiff bringing a civil action in the district, or in any other court where his case is subject to appeal, always has to run the risk that a witness of some importance to him may be ill, dead or insane or otherwise unavailable at the hearing of his appeal.  If that takes place, well it is just too bad for him and for his case.  But, why should we, in relation to a criminal case where the liberty of a citizen in this State is in jeopardy, provide an easy way for the State of overcoming the ordinary difficulties and the ordinary circumstances which shall attach to every other type of case?</P>

There is no provision which entitles the prosecution in a criminal case, in a trial before a jury, to use a deposition <Col N="609" /> in respect of a deponent who is ill or insane.  There is a provision in relation to a deponent who is dead.</P>

      <P>This is something new.  I want to say to the Minister that it is an extension which should be resisted or, if not resisted, should be examined very carefully.  I do not think that the implications of that section have been considered sufficiently.</P>
      <P>I should like to say a word or two about Section 17.  I understand there has been some criticism of it already. I can see, with Deputy Timoney, the merits contained in the section, and at the same time I can see, with Deputy Cowan, a considerable number of objections.  The Minister should consider introducing an amendment at a later stage to provide that the transfer of a criminal trial by a Circuit Court judge from one part of the circuit to another should be made only on certain specified grounds.  The motives which prompted the Minister to insert this section in the Bill are perfectly good. It may be that in the particular area in which the trial should take place under the Courts of Justice Act a fair trial would not be possible.</P>

      <P>It might not be possible to have a trial fair to the State or to the accused.  It may be that on account of local feeling a fair and proper trial could not take place. Those, I am sure, are the reasons why this section was introduced.  If I am right there, I suggest that those grounds for a transfer order should be inserted in the section and that a trial should not be transferred from one county to another county unless the grounds that I have suggested are specified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of expenses and costs, I am not going to say anything in relation to legal costs, but I would like to say to Deputy Timoney that he seems to be rather innocent in relation to a lot of these criminal trials.  It is <Col N="610" /> not the practice of the police to provide travelling facilities or anything else like that for witnesses on behalf of the accused person.  I do not think a police officer who did so would get any refund for transporting witnesses for the defence to the place of trial.  I suggest that when a Circuit Court judge makes a transfer order under Section 17 the order should expressly provide for the added expenses of the trial to the accused.  I know that under sub-section (2) (b) provision is made so that the order may provide for matters ancillary or incidental to the transfer.  It is possible that particular sub-section was intended to cover the added expenses of witnesses in the trial, but again, I suggest that some express provision in relation to this matter should be inserted.</P>
    <P>That is as much as I want to say with regard to any of the principal matters in the Bill, but I should like to point out one thing to the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Deputy O'Higgins proceeds any further, I should like to draw attention to the fact that there is no quorum.  It is simply disgraceful that when an important measure like this is before the House there are only seven or eight Deputies present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I was about to refer to the remarks of Deputy Timoney with reference to Section 13. I do not share the views he expressed on this section.  So far as I can see, in Section 13 there is no power given to the Garda officer to fix any amount in relation to sureties or bail.  I do not know whether that was an omission from the section or whether it was definitely intended, but it seems to me that the Garda officer is bound to accept any sureties or recognisances that may be offered by the person to whom the giving of bail is being considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to say a few words about the section dealing with power of remission. I merely want to refer to it by way of reply to Deputy Timoney. <Col N="611" /> I do not see any objection, good, bad or indifferent, to providing expressly for this power being given to the Minister for Justice.  I think all of us, irrespective of any legal considerations, are aware of the considerable disparity in relation to sentences and penalties imposed for similar offences and frequently on the same facts.  These sentences or penalties vary from district to district and district justice to district justice.  I think it would be very wrong if there were not some power given to some member of the Government in respect of cases of individual injustice, cases in which by reason of various matters an injustice might be done.  If that power were not expressly provided for in the Bill the Minister might find cases where quite obviously the penalties imposed were out of all proportion to the offence and he might be unable to mitigate the penalties in any way.  I think it is a section which should receive the approval of the House.</P>
    <P>I think, speaking on the Bill generally, that it is a good one.  I have the one serious criticism, which I have already offered, concerning Section 8 together with the qualification I have mentioned in connection with the section providing for the transfer of trials.  I hope that the Minister will consider the provision of additional safeguards on the Committee Stage of this Bill with regard to both those sections.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to be very brief in dealing with this Bill. I agree that the Bill is a good Bill. It is certainly an improvement on the existing legislation.  Anything that tends to speed up the work of the District Court and the administration of justice in criminal matters, particularly in Dublin, is undoubtedly to be welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like the last speaker, I think there are definite objections to be made against Section 8.  I notice in the Dáil Reports that practically every Deputy who spoke on this measure had some criticism to make on Section 8.  I think the criticisms were justified.  Unlike the last speaker, I am prepared to <Col N="612" /> accept the fact that this particular section must have received very careful consideration from the Minister and his officials before it was put into the Bill. It must have received consideration because it is an entirely new departure in a very serious direction.  Even in the circumstances outlined in sub-section (2) of Section 8, it is, nevertheless, a very serious departure to permit the use of depositions.  It seems to me that, once the Bill is passed with that section in it, any lawyer defending an accused person in the District Court will find it practically impossible to adopt the present practice of reserving his defence.  I think that such a lawyer may, in future, find it essential to disclose his defence in the District Court for the purpose of getting that defence on deposition and on record, particularly in the case of a witness whose deposition may ultimately be used at the Circuit Criminal Court because of the absence of the particular witness for one reason or another.  Lawyers defending accused persons will be compelled to cross-examine and thereby disclose the nature of their defence, even though it may be the feeling of such lawyers that a defence should not be disclosed at that particular stage.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Boland and the other Deputies who pointed out that there is a precedent with regard to the use of a written statement of a deceased person in evidence.  That precedent is there.  But I cannot see any sound argument in favour of admitting in evidence the depositions of persons who in the meantime become insane. Surely, the depositions of such persons are immediately suspect.  Surely, it would be a travesty of justice if the deposition of a person who, subsequent to the making of that deposition, becomes insane were to be admitted in evidence in any subsequent criminal trial.  Possibly that deposition might be a vital link for the purpose of convicting an accused person.  Unless the judge were satisfied that such insanity between the date of the District Court proceedings and the subsequent trial was traumatic in origin, it would seem to me at any rate that under no circumstances should the evidence of any person who, subsequent to the <Col N="613" /> making of the deposition, becomes insane be admitted in evidence.  If the injury which caused the insanity was traumatic in origin there might be something to be said for it.  That, at least, would put the deposition of the insane person in the same category as that of a witness who subsequently dies.  Generally speaking, I do not think that the provision is a good one. It is an alarming provision from the point of view of the lawyer Deputies in this House.  I regret that those Deputies who are not lawyers have not so far taken part in this discussion to any considerable extent, because I would like to have their views on that provision.</P>
    <P>There is another viewpoint I would like to put before the Minister.  Depositions can never represent to a judge and jury the entire evidence given in the District Court.  No deposition will show hesitancy on the part of a witness, if there is any hesitancy; no deposition will show the general demeanour of a witness under either direct or cross-examination. All these matters affect to some extent the mind of the conscientious juryman.  These things cannot appear in a deposition written down in longhand which merely represents the actual word spoken.  The manner in which the words are spoken is not shown.  The pauses which may result between a question and its answer cannot be indicated.  These are matters which may very well give a judge or juryman a completely different impression as to the reliability or truthfulness of a witness.  I would like the Minister to bear that in mind on Section 8 as it now stands.  I think there are serious objections to the section.  Every lawyer who has practised in the District Courts immediately perceives the objections.  If the Minister can assure the House that all these matters have been considered by him and that, despite the very careful consideration given, there are overriding arguments against the objections which have been advanced here, I am prepared then to accept the Minister's decision, but I tell him quite frankly that I do not like the section as it stands at present and that I would like to see it amended.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which was <Col N="614" /> raised by both Deputy Captain Cowan and Deputy Boland.  I would like to add my voice in support of what they said.  Strictly speaking, it may not be in order for me to do so.  It is just that, under this Bill, it is possible that there will be a substantially increased amount of work to be done by the district justices.  Many or most of them already do a very hard day's work&mdash;particularly the justices in the Dublin area and in and around the Dublin area.  I should like if the Minister would indicate, in replying, whether he proposes in the near future to allow any increase in the salaries paid to these district justices.  I think they are entitled to it and I think, particularly, as Deputy Cowan mentioned here, that there should be some general levelling-up in the salaries paid to the ordinary district justices, whether they be functioning in the city or in the country area.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Cowan mentioned, and I think the Minister is aware of it&mdash; Deputy Boland, as Minister, was aware of it&mdash;there are many district justices of very long standing who, because they are functioning outside the Dublin metropolitan district, are in receipt of a lesser salary than junior justices in the service who happen to be operating in the Dublin metropolitan district. I should like to see these people who have given very faithful and good service in the administration of justice in this country being properly rewarded and their salaries at least being made level with those of justices in the metropolitan district.</P>
    <P>The Bill, generally speaking, is excellent and the Minister is to be complimented on introducing it.  With the exception of Section 8 of the Bill, I would approve of it in its entirety.  I feel that it is a very good measure and a measure that was certainly required in order to assist in the administration of justice.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Deputies, especially the legal Deputies, who have applied themselves so vigorously to this Bill for the attention they have paid it.  It is a technical Bill, of course, and every suggestion made by people who have experience of <Col N="615" /> the law in a matter such as this is of great advantage.  I am glad the Bill has been approached in that way.  I can say that the members of the Seanad applied themselves with care and diligence to the Bill and suggested various amendments.  As I told this House when moving the Second Reading of the Bill, the Bill did improve between the time it was introduced in that House and the time it left it, and perhaps this House may be able to improve it further.</P>
      <P>A great many points were raised. As I have said, this is a technical Bill and, therefore, I would much prefer to have time to examine all the points than to commit myself now as to what I would concede or what amendments I would like to bring in on the Committee Stage.  I can assure all the Deputies that every point made will be carefully considered because this is a Bill to amend criminal law administration&mdash;and everybody is very anxious that the administration of justice in that aspect of our courts should be the best that can be produced, and I am anxious to give the best that can be devised.</P>
      <P>I shall touch now on some of the points.  Again let me assure everybody that I am approaching the matter in the manner in which they have approached it.  For a great number of years no accused person has ever been placed at a disadvantage because he could not get depositions.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am assured that that is so.  I shall have that point examined but I am assured that, in any genuine case where the solicitor of an accused said the accused was unable to pay for a copy, the deposition was made available.  The governor of the prison was always able to make them available for any person, and use could be made of them.  However, I shall have that point examined again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of free legal aid is another matter.  That question has been agitating the minds of the people of this country for a considerable time. <Col N="616" /> There is a certain development in that respect in Great Britain, and, of course, it has been argued that because they did it we, too, should do it.  I do not exactly take the point of view that because a thing is done in Great Britain we should automatically follow their example.  At the same time, I am satisfied that degrees of hardship arise from time to time.  Outside the scope of this Bill, I am having that examined in a different way.</P>
    <P>I am going to touch on the question of civil jurisdiction&mdash;a point which has been raised by some people in this House.  Of course, there are some conflicting views about it.  While I am extending in this certain points, I do not want to get them involved.  This is a single independent matter and I do not want the two things to get involved with each other at all.  If we bring in a Bill for the extension of civil jurisdiction I am sure that it will get a good hammering and that it will be thrashed out to its limit.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>That point could be made but, as I say, it does not arise in this Bill.</P>
      <P>A point was made about having statutory declarations instead of the solemn form of oath.  That has always been a very serious matter.  In cases such as this, criminal cases, I think that the solemn form of oath must be maintained.  Anyhow, it is so involved that I should not like to undertake the task of lightly throwing it aside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Some people do respect the oath.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, some do.  It it a pity that even the ordinary affirmation before the peace commissioner is not more rigorously observed in the wording but I should not like to subscribe to the view that it is general. We hear comments from time to time from district justices and others to the effect that the sanctity of the oath is not fully observed or that the people who are taking the oath do not fully understand the seriousness and responsibility <Col N="617" /> they are undertaking when they take it.  We shall have to teach them that, and, if there is any slackness in that regard, I hope that it will be got over in the future.</P>
      <P>It is clear that the accused has always the right, on an indictable offence under Section 2, which was referred to, to apply to be tried by a jury.  However, everybody knows that sometimes the accused does not want to be tried by a jury&mdash;that he wants to get the thing over quickly.  However, I do not know that it is necessary to make it any more binding on the district justice to tell the accused that he has the right to trial by jury.  If it is thought that it is not clear enough it could be made mandatory on the district justice to inform the accused that he has the right to be tried.  Deputy Cowan made the point that any fellow who is brought before a commanding officer in the Army says: &ldquo;Sir, I want you to deal with me yourself; do not send me to the courtmartial,&rdquo; in the hope and belief that he would have a softer heart than a great number of people. Be that as it may, I will see if that can be made mandatory, although I do not think it is necessary.</P>
      <P>On the question of the Ministerial Order for indictable offences, it was said that this should be done by legislation instead.  As long as the Minister is compelled to lay the Order before the House and the House must confirm it, I think it is equivalent to legislation.  Every time you wanted to amend the Act or add to the list of indictable offences, it would hardly be reasonable to have to bring in a whole Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">

      <P>I am prepared to consider it, but I submit to the House that the procedure is sound enough when something is being added on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Section 4 and the term of six months' imprisonment, it was considered necessary to increase the powers of punishment in the District Courts as we were increasing their <Col N="618" /> jurisdiction.  Further, the District Court has the power at present to impose consecutive sentences totalling 12 months so no great risk seems to be entailed in fixing that the court should have the power to impose a sentence of 12 months.  Of course, I agree that it is a serious matter to extend the power without giving it full consideration but I can assure the House that the matter has been examined fully.</P>
    <P>With regard to Section 8, on which I was attacked by friends on every side of the House, as I pointed out, the deposition of a person who has died can be put in at all times, but cases arise in which a mapper, doctor or other person whose deposition is of a purely technical nature, falls and breaks his leg, becomes ill or even becomes insane, and the whole case is held up although the production of that map would be in the interests of the accused.

I have been aware of cases&mdash;so have members of the legal profession and many members of this House&mdash; which have been held up for months because some deponent who would give technical evidence of a map or a post-mortem has become ill.

The question as to whether malicious damages should be paid by the local authority or by the State is another day's work.  I, for one man, have always argued that it is an obsolete provision, but whether I will be able to secure the agreement of the House or not I cannot say.  We can have that looked at on another occasion.  I admit that the value of the £ has not altered from £5 to £50.</P>

    <P>A good many things have been said about the power of a Guard to release on bail.  As Deputy Cowan pointed out, that has happened in Dublin for I do not know how many years.  The Commissioner has set under order the amount of bail a Guard can impose and we are extending that provision to the whole country.  It is a matter for regulation by the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána, so there is no <Col N="620" /> danger of a station sergeant saying £500 or £1,000.  If the matter is so serious as that, a person can only be released by the proper people, namely a peace commissioner or district justice.</P>

I think it was a terrible disadvantage to the people of the country that they had to suffer, they had to wait, while in the City of Dublin a station sergeant could sign a bond for £10.  I think this is an advantage.</P>

No matter how difficult that may be, it certainly is easier than transferring it to Green Street.  The jurors who attend there complained that if these footy cases were stopped coming up to them and things were done in a different way, they would not have so much work to do.

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me cite a case. Supposing a fair trial could not be given in Longford, it might be given in Mullingar, Athlone, or Roscommon, instead of sending it to Green Street. On the application of the Attorney-General, the person can be sent to Green Street.  On the application of the accused, it has to go to Dublin also, as that is the only place that he has.  There are various things referred to here which are indictable offences and the case might not get a fair trial in that particular area.  However, he might get it in Roscommon or somewhere within the circuit.  I do not take away the existing power he has.  I am leaving that and, in addition, I am going to give this discretionary power. If the application is made by the Attorney-General saying he wants it brought to Green Street, the circuit judge might say: &ldquo;No, I want to transfer it to Mullingar and get a jury there&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I will look into it, but I do not think we should be asked to do that.  A reference was made by Deputy Timoney to remissions.  I do not think there is any doubt whatever that the power was carried on for remissions by the Minister for Justice under certain enactments or under the Adaptation of Enactments Act. Whether it was or not, this is to put it beyond yea or nay.  When it was introduced in the Seanad, it was said that the Government might delegate to &ldquo;a person&rdquo;.  The Seanad, amended that to &ldquo;a Minister of State&rdquo;.  The reason for that is that, under some of the various Acts&mdash;revenue cases, for instance&mdash;the power of remission is vested in the Revenue Commissioners or the Minister for Finance; and the Minister for Justice, though he had certain functions in the matter, really had no power to remit in those cases.  This is giving the Minister power to remit. I have not yet met a Deputy who was not anxious to see that the power of remission was exercised often and with great mercy.  Therefore, it would be a pity to take that away.  Time after time, circumstances have arisen in which, notwithstanding all the care of justices and judges, miscarriages of justice have taken place and it is something of importance that there is a reviewing authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Somebody asked how the Guards get to know.  It seems that the procedure is not fully understood.  When the Minister gets an objection, he informs the Guards of the nature of the petition. <Col N="623" /> He informs the district justice and, if it went to appeal, the Circuit Court which tried the appeal.  He sets out the facts, giving the police report on the matter&mdash;that is, in the light of the new circumstances.  Before the Minister exercises any function, all the facts are viewed by the judge and other authorities concerned, and also by the Departments, if there are Departments concerned.  If it is a motor taxation case, or breaches of industry laws or agricultural regulations, the Department concerned is consulted.  The Minister then exercises the prerogative and exercises his duty on those facts as put to him.  He is not bound to accept all or any of them, but he would be a very courageous man who would ignore advice against taking certain steps.</P>
    <P>I think I have covered most of the points made.  This is a technical Bill and, as I said before, I am quite prepared, on the Committee Stage, to examine any amendment that may be put down.  There were some points not touched on by anyone and I will have to put in amendments myself, consequential on things that happened in the Seanad.  However, it will all be with the intention of improving the Bill so that, when it becomes law, we will have an improved legal code dealing with these particular matters.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  In moving the Second Reading, I might point out that the main object of this Bill is to allow persons who were refused service certificates under the Military Service Pensions Acts, 1924 and 1934, to appeal against those refusals and, if necessary, to have their claims reinvestigated. As Deputies are aware, under the original Act persons refused certificates could appeal to the Minister for review on the ground that evidence not previously available was <Col N="624" /> then available.  Such appeals were made to the number of 1,294.  That number of cases was reopened and the result of reopening 1,294 cases was that 654 persons who had been previously refused succeeded in getting the certificate and obtaining the pension.  I mention these figures in order to let every Deputy appreciate what has been the result of having cases reopened on appeal.  Something more than half the cases reopened on appeal succeeded in getting a certificate and a pension.  If it were not for that right to reopen on appeal, more than half that number of people would be suffering under a distinct and continuing injustice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was the situation up to the Act of 1945.  Section 5 of the 1945 Act removed from disappointed or rejected applicants the right of appealing to the Minister and took from the Minister the right of asking the board to review their cases.  The result was that the work of the board was terminated in 1946.  Since that date, from various sources, here and there, it has been alleged, and it continues to be alleged, that there are very many people with meritorious service who would have succeeded in having decisions reversed if Section 5 of that Act had not been passed and who would enjoy pensions if the right of appeal had still been left with the Minister.  This Bill reopens to anybody, subject only to the opinion of the Referee, a right to appeal to have cases reopened.  I do not think that, generally speaking, there will be any grave objection to that particular proposal. Statements have been made that many of these persons failed in their original application because of the dissension and political controversy that existed in years gone by and that people in opposite camps would not certify or substantiate the claims of political opponents.  That statement has been made to me in a great number of different areas by a great number of people.  I have been listening to statements of that kind for years.  As long as there is any doubt on the point, I think it would be the responsibility and the duty of the Minister to clear the air and to give all such people a right to appeal and a right to a <Col N="625" /> rehearing, subject only to the power of the Referee to come to the conclusion that there is or is not sufficient material to allow a rehearing of the case.</P>
    <P>In this Bill it is proposed, so as to remove any suspicion of political favouritism or political prejudice, that the power of reopening cases or directing that a case should be reopened will no longer rest with the Minister.  It is not just a simple repeal of Section 5 of the Act of 1945.  Under this Bill, if it meets with the approval of the Dáil, the power to reopen or to decide not to reopen will not rest with the Minister but with the Referee appointed under this Bill and the Minister's power to request a review is not revived in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The procedure under this Bill is simple.  The applicant has to state the grounds on which he considers that his claim should be reconsidered, and if he makes out a case then the Referee must investigate the claim.  If such a case is not made, the Referee will reject the appeal, but it is intended to make regulations whereby the Referee will inform the applicant of the proposed rejection and will give him reasonable time to produce any other evidence he may have in support of his appeal.  The power of review here is much broader than the power of review that did rest with the Minister prior to the Act of 1945.  Prior to the enactment of Section 5 of the Act of 1945 the Minister could only direct a review of a case on appeal if he was satisfied that there was available new evidence of an important nature which had not been previously available.  The Minister had not power to reopen a case on the ground that new evidence was available which could have been available to the applicant when he was making his original application.  Under this Bill power is left to the Referee to reopen a case if additional evidence is available even if that evidence was previously available but was not produced or was not forthcoming.  Any Deputy can understand that that opens a much wider field and a much easier course to succeed, at least, in having the appeal reheard.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="626" /> The machinery in this Bill is the same type and design but not necessarily in personnel as obtained under the previous Act.  The Referee will be assisted by a committee of four members, two of these being members of the I.R.A. and one representative from each of the Departments of Finance and Defence.  For appeals under the 1924 Act the Referee will be assisted by two members of the committee which will constitute a board of assessors.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not provide for new applications but only for appeals from those who already applied and were refused certificates.  It is not intended to extend the date for fresh applications but power will be taken, by regulation, to admit new applications from persons who can produce satisfactory reasons why they did not apply within the statutory time limit.  Any fresh certificates granted under the Bill to appellants or persons applying for the first time will commence from the date of the passing of the Bill.</P>
    <P>In connection with the powers taken in this Bill, by regulation to allow of a case of a new applicant who did not previously apply, we have to relate that to the political conditions that unfortunately existed in this country for a great number of years back, where there was a number of people who possibly had as good pre-Truce and post-Truce service as very many enjoying pensions but who for political reasons of one kind or another would not apply under the 1924 Act or under the 1934 Act until the date for applying or appealing under those Acts had passed. When we are reopening this matter at all, I think it is sound and fair and reasonable that such persons should at least have the right to apply and, by regulation, we propose to give the right to apply to such people.</P>
    <P>Pensions under this Bill will only date from the date of the passing into law of this Bill.  I am anticipating, perhaps, some portions of the debate when I call attention to that particular fact.  There will be criticism, there will be, perhaps, divided opinion, as to why pensions are paid only from the passing of the Bill and why pensions under this particular Bill are not made retrospective.  Retrospective is a simple <Col N="627" /> word in itself, but, when you convert that word into pounds, shillings and pence, it amounts to an amazingly large sum of money.  According to any estimate I can get&mdash;and, of course, an estimate is only an estimate&mdash;under this Bill, the increased volume of money that will be distributed amongst old members of the I.R.A. will be approximately £50,000 per annum. Appeals under this Bill will, some of them, date back to the 1924 Act and the balance will date back to the 1934 Act.  The 1924 Act is 25 years ago and the 1934 Act is 15 years ago.  If we take £50,000 as the amount of extra money that will go out annually under the Bill and if we take the average of 25 and 15 years, the average number of years over which these pensions would have to be made retrospective would be 20 and 20 times £50,000 is £1,000,000. That is the lump sum that would have to be found in order to make these new pensions retrospective.</P>
    <P>I wonder if that £1,000,000 were piled up on the table here and if we left it to the House to say: &ldquo;We can either give this £1,000,000 in back money to the new cases who will get pensions under this Bill, or we can devote it to some other useful national purpose&rdquo; whether the vote would be to give the £1,000,000 in back money, particularly when we take it that the big end of new pensions under this Bill will be for people who could have applied under either of the existing Acts, but, for one reason or another, did not apply and the balance line-ball cases of people who had been previously rejected and whose legal entitlement at the present moment is the large sum of nothing per year.  Under this Bill, if they succeed in their claims, we are proposing to give them a pension from the date of passing this Bill.</P>
    <P>These are the figures, but figures in this case can be supported by facts and by precedent.  Under the 1934 Act, we did give a right to 1924 Act people to appeal against the previous decision or verdict, so that, when the 1934 Act was passed, people who had been rejected under the 1924 Act and at that moment were entitled to no pension, were given the right to appeal, but they were <Col N="628" /> given the right to pick up their pension only from the date of the passing into law of the 1934 Act.  I think that was a generous Act at the time.  It gave the possibility and opened up the avenue to giving pensions to people who had previously been rejected, but neither the Government at the time nor the Dáil at the time would consider making those pensions retrospective.</P>
    <P>That is the particular precedent that we are re-enacting in this Bill, but the volume of money which would be earmarked in order to make pensions under this Bill retrospective would be staggering, and the fact of the matter is that it would not be possible to find it or to pay it.  As the Minister responsible for the introduction and formation of this Bill, I have no hesitation in saying to the Dáil that, if I sought from the Government permission to make this Bill retrospective and if I were to ask the taxpayers to find, in addition to the £50,000 per year extra money which I am asking them to find, a lump sum of £1,000,000, then definitely, frankly and candidly, there would be no Bill.</P>

      <P>Or 2,000 people get half.  To make it retrospective, the lump sum which would have to be found would be approximately £1,000,000.  That is the estimate.  The claim for retrospection, at least in the cases of the great bulk of them who did not apply before, when they should have applied, would not be a sustainable case.  The case with regard to the others might be based on the fact that they got a raw deal in the past, that, for one reason or another, the pension that should have been given was not given and that, now that they were getting a pension, it should date back for at least 15 years, if not for 25 years.  My answer is that the Government and I, as Minister, would not be prepared to look for £1,000,000 cash, plus what it is proposed to give under this Bill, and the alternative was to give pensions from the date of passing the Bill or to leave people just as they are without a pension at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister think there will be in fact quite a number of applications from people who would not recognise either the 1924 or the 1934 Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I do.  I may be wrong, but I believe that will be so. It is difficult to arrive at an estimate of the number of new or fresh claimants under the Bill, and in that respect we can only work on figures with regard to the past.  Under the 1924 Act there were 21,000 odd applications, of which 3,906 were successful and 17,000 failed.  Under the 1934 Act there were 60,852 applications, of which 11,862 succeeded and 48,000 failed.  It will be seen from these figures that roughly one-fifth or one-sixth of the applicants succeeded in their claims and four-fifths or so failed, under each Act.  There are, therefore, a possible 66,000 persons who could apply under this Act, but as the requirements of the Acts regarding the service necessary to qualify are now better known than when the original Acts were passed, it is estimated that only about 25 per cent., that is, roughly, about 17,000, will actually appeal.  How many of these will succeed is again a matter of conjecture, but from the information available it <Col N="630" /> would appear that not more than 2,000 could succeed and that the cost would be approximately £50,000 a year.</P>
      <P>In this Bill also occasion has been taken to extend certain provisions of the parent Acts.  Thus Sections 8 and 12 vest in the Minister the power to restore forfeited pensions and Sections 7 and 13 vest in him power to review the refusal by himself to grant service certificates where persons have been sentenced to imprisonment of three months or more.  These are briefly the main outlines of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do think that the one point on which there will be an amount of discussion will be the question as to whether pensions should be retrospective or not.  I think the other sections of the Bill in the main will be agreed to as being reasonable and just.  I merely want to reaffirm, on the question of retrospective application of pensions, that the Bill would never be considered or would never have seen the light of day in this Dáil under the present Government if it were associated with the finding of a lump sum of £1,000,000 in order to make it retrospective.  As Minister for Defence I was approached by very many organisations in very many counties, representing the Old I.R.A. and sections of the Old I.R.A., who were disappointed in the past in regard to pension claims.  To every single such deputation and delegation I made it very, very clear that if I did get authority to introduce a Bill of this nature, it would be without retrospective effect.  On every single occasion, without exception, as long as the Bill was merely in the air and not on the Table, all such deputations and delegations agreed wholeheartedly that they would not ask to have retrospective application given to that particular section.  Not only that, but, as most Deputies are aware, the one application that was made to me from every Party was, not to go as far as this Bill proposes to go at all, but merely to repeal Section 5 of the Act of 1945.  I have made the position as clear as I can.  I hope the Bill will be discussed in the light of the information I have given to the Dáil and, above all, in the <Col N="631" /> light of the information that was given to me by representative associations before the Bill came to the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures which the Minister gave us in his opening remarks I think refute the suggestion that there were injustices inflicted under the 1934 Act.  He gave the figures in respect to appeals&mdash;the number who appealed and the number who succeeded in their appeals.  The fact that a number of applicants could succeed was, I think, proof that the Referee and his advisory board were prepared at all times, if evidence of the character which they sought could be supplied, to give an applicant justice. The Minister has been in office for a period of 21 months, and it is reasonable for me to assume that he has acquired a fairly extensive knowledge of the Acts for which he is responsible to this House.  Among these Acts is the Military Service Pensions Act of 1934.  I am of opinion that, of all the Acts for which the Department of Defence was responsible, the 1934 Act is perhaps the most controversial.  It was not only developed in a controversial way but it developed a form of acrimony in this House that, to my mind, was regrettable.  The debate on the Act, and on the Estimate which arose out of it, began in a rather leisurely and peaceful manner but as time went on and applications poured in, Deputies were being compelled by a number of applicants to demand greater speed in dealing with the applications. The efforts to secure the speed which was demanded brought about the introduction of a regulation which, I presume, the then Minister had power to make to allow the Referee to act in the manner in which he did eventually act&mdash;to get the members of the advisory board to separate to examine claims and, having examined them, to make certain recommendations to him in respect of them. It must be borne in mind all the time that the Referee was there as an executive officer, as the judge, who alone would give a decision in respect of these applications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another stage developed as time went on.  Many of the applicants were under the impression that all the <Col N="632" /> Referee had to do was to examine their particular applications and make a decision in respect of them, these applicants always believing that their applications were <i>prima facie</i> applications and that their examination presented no difficulty.  It was then that pressure was brought to bear on Deputies and that Deputies were being told hard luck stories and stories of alleged injustices that had been inflicted.  Many Deputies, accepting these stories without the proper examination which they should have been given, began to make statements in this House about this person and that person not having been given the measure of justice to which they were entitled.  I at all times endeavoured to refute the suggestion that there was anything in the nature of injustice done to any applicant and I think the figures which the Minister has given in respect of the appeals support me in that claim.  The Minister told us that of the 60,000 odd people who made application under the 1934 Act some 48,000 failed in their application.  I suggest that these 48,000 provided a magnificent field for politicians in this House to sow the seeds of discontent, seeds which they hoped they would harvest at some time and eventually bring about the downfall of the Government of the time.</P>
    <P>I have a very distinct recollection of a speech made by the present Minister for External Affairs during the election campaign in 1948 in which the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;What we had no information about and could not get was the number of cases wherein pensions were granted which should not have been granted.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am quoting from the <i>Irish Independent</i> and, on the same date, the 27th January, 1948, he also said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If Mr. Traynor wishes, he could supply me with the names of some of these cases.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When I saw that particularly dirty charge&mdash;that is all I can describe it as &mdash;I replied to it as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Would it be at all possible to <Col N="633" /> get Mr. MacBride to come down to earth and speak in terms of fact and give me or the public at large, to whom he has already confided his charge in rather vague terms, I must say, the names of persons to whom the Referee or Referees gave pensions to which they were not entitled?  The public have a right to be protected against maladministration anywhere, especially if it would cost them money, as it would if Mr. MacBride's wild accusations were correct.  Will Mr. MacBride give that protection to the public now as an earnest of his sincerity and prove that he is not talking in terms of general propaganda?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Although he stated that he would be prepared to give me the names of the persons who got pensions to which they were not entitled, from that day to this I have not received any such information.  I do not know if Deputy MacBride, since he became Minister for External Affairs and a member of the Government, with all the information at his disposal to examine that particular statement which he made then, has done so or if he has asked the Minister for Defence to have these charges investigated.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Defence, who is now in charge of the Department, must know, as a result of his experience in that Department, that these statements were false and without any foundation whatever.  The Minister must know that Section 10 of the 1934 Act makes it mandatory on the Minister to accept the decisions of the Referee, whether the decisions are nil awards or whether they are grants of pensions or service certificates, as the case may be.  He must know that there is nothing which can compel the Referee to produce any reason for his decision or to give the evidence upon which he based it.  No tribunal or no person can compel the Referee to give that evidence.  Having come to the decision, the decision is final, conclusive and binding on all persons and tribunals, and that naturally includes the Minister, the Government and the courts of justice.</P>
    <P>I should like to think that when <Col N="634" /> Deputy MacBride, as he then was, made that statement, he made it in the heat of an election campaign.  I should also like to think that, even at this stage, now that he has the experience and the wisdom which I hope has been added to his experience as a result of becoming a Minister, he will have the courage and the manliness to come into the House and express his regret for that statement or, failing that, give this House a proof of the statement which he made on that occasion and, if necessary, get the Minister for Defence to set up an inquiry to investigate the charges and the suggestions contained in that statement that pensions were given to people who were not entitled to them.</P>
    <P>I want to say, and I said it on that occasion to which I have referred, that that was not in any circumstances a charge against the Government, although it was intended to be.  It was a charge against the Referee or Referees who had been appointed and, at that particular period, at least four gentlemen had occupied that position. To my mind, it was a charge against these gentlemen, three of whom were judges of the Circuit Court and one of whom was a lawyer of not less than ten years' standing.  That was a rather serious charge because, if that charge was made then, it could be made in the future.  There is no reason that I can see why disappointed applicants for pensions in future will not be in a position to make similar statements and charges.</P>
    <P>Under the 1924 and the 1934 Acts, over 80,000 persons applied for pensions and only 15,000 succeeded.  That leaves 65,000 persons who failed in their application.  These 65,000 persons, minus those who are deceased, may apply for pensions.  My own impression is that it would be more reasonable to argue that the 30,000 odd persons who appealed their cases are likely to reapply and that the balance who failed to appeal against the decisions were probably people who had little faith in their applications. If we put the number who will reapply at 20,000, that would be 5,000 more than those who succeeded in getting pensions under both Acts.  Are we to <Col N="635" /> believe that these 20,000 persons are likely to succeed?</P>
    <P>I hardly imagine they will, and, if they do not succeed, is it not possible that the doctrine which Deputy MacBride was disseminating in 1947 and 1948 is likely to have effects now that the Minister is providing means for all these disappointed applicants to apply again?  I rather imagine that in the examination of these appeals&mdash; I suppose that is what they will be, appeals under the 1934 Act and that the machinery, so far as the Referee is concerned, will be practically the same as under that Act&mdash;the standard of service will be the same.  If it is, I rather think that the number who will succeed will not be very great.</P>
    <P>During the period in which I was responsible for putting the Army Pensions Estimate through this House I never at any time, in the course of discussions on that Estimate, suggested that everybody who was entitled to a pension had secured one.  I was quite certain that there were large numbers of people who were very close to the borderline that had been set up and failed to get over it.  Some failed, I think, by reason perhaps of their inability to make their case in the manner that other people were able to do it, or perhaps, to express to the Referee, in the language that would convince him, that they, too, were entitled to a pension.  I have no doubt that quite a number of people were ruled out on grounds of that kind.  I feel, from the point of view of a rehearing, that this will go some way towards removing any discontent that these people may feel in that respect, but, as I have said, it is opening the field that we have been going through here over the last ten or 12 years, and it is quite possible that we are going to have a recurrence of all the debates that we have had in the past, with all the acrimony of the past.  I am pretty certain that it will not be all on one side either.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Bill itself, I can hardly see any reason why it should be brought before the House with an operative date fixed when it becomes an Act.  The Minister has made it very <Col N="636" /> clear that the question of discussing the operative date is taboo: that we can talk about it as much as we like, but that no matter how much we talk about it he is not going to be moved from that particular date, and the reason he gives is pounds, shillings and pence.  All that I can say is that pounds, shillings and pence should not be allowed in the way of doing justice to any individual.</P>

      <P>The Minister has said that he is not going to be moved from that date, and he has given us the reasons why he is not going to be moved, reasons which, no doubt, will appeal to large numbers of people&mdash; that is, because it would mean taking money from those people by way of tax.  The fact is that the Minister cannot get away from this, that if justice is to be done to those individuals it should be done in full or not done at all.  If those men were so close to borderline service as we have heard here from time to time in the course of discussions in the House&mdash;and God knows we heard enough about it&mdash; then very little would have prevented them from securing pensions under the 1934 Act.  If they had succeeded at that particular period they would have been entitled to all the retrospective <Col N="637" /> payments for service under that particular measure.  I say that under that measure&mdash;and this being only an amending Bill&mdash;they are entitled to full retrospectiveness.  However that may be, the Minister made it very clear to the deputation that waited on him that he was not going to be moved from that, and that they could have that and nothing else, and they accepted that rather than nothing else.  If that is being regarded as the form of justice which this Bill meets, I am not going to argue about it.  If the Minister is satisfied that he is going to get it through, well that is that.</P>

      <P>So far as I remember, if a person to whom the 1924 Act applied was turned down, he had no right to appeal under the 1934 Act. We are not opposing this Bill.  Anything we can do to expedite it, we will do.  We would like to see the Bill put through as quickly as possible, so that the long-drawn-out matter of examination <Col N="638" /> of applications will begin at once and those who are likely to be successful will, in the shortest possible time, receive whatever amounts they are awarded.  I take it the Minister will not be moved by any appeal I make with respect to the operative date.</P>

      <P>One of the regrettable things about recognition of service during the pre-Truce period is that those people who, under the different Acts obtained pensions, should be thrown into what I might call the vortex of Party politics. Deputy Traynor has mentioned some observations of the Minister for External Affairs when he was engaged in the last election campaign, but that was only an extension, if you like, of what happened in connection with the 1924 Act.  Every one of us saw the placards all over the country about the roll of honour.  Those pensions that were granted for service were held up by means of posters and placards to humiliate people in their own localities.  The very same thing applied subsequently in connection with the 1934 Act, and apparently it will be done also in relation to this legislation. I think that, having gone through the fight for freedom in this country, people who received official recognition of their services by means of a pension should not be made the playthings of Party politicians.</P>
      <P>One fundamental mistake was in those Acts, the 1924 and 1934 Acts, and it is also in this measure.  The first thing an applicant must do is to succeed in getting a certificate of service, and a certificate of service will not be granted him until he is entitled to a pension.  I think that was a fundamental mistake and it has caused a lot of the trouble we have had under the 1924 and the 1934 Acts.  If it is allowed to remain it will cause trouble here, too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A certificate of military service should be quite independent of a pension. As regards those persons in receipt of certificates of military service, if this country wants to be generous to a proportion of them and grant certain financial payments to them annually, that is a matter that ought to be covered.  Where the trouble <Col N="639" /> has been caused is this.  A number of people applied from a particular area for a certificate of military service&mdash; because that is what the application is for&mdash;and the board or Referee examining that case decided that a certain proportion of them were entitled to have a certificate of service and, because of that certificate, to a pension. Other persons who rendered as good service are refused the certificate. I know quite a number of people who are more annoyed at being refused the certificate of service than at being denied the pension that follows it.  That was one of the fundamental mistakes.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope the passing of this measure will mean that all people who have just claims will have those just claims examined and determined justly in accordance with the law.  Those persons who will be entitled to receive pensions as a result of that inquiry will not, it is hoped, be pilloried in the future.  I think it is a shameful thing, almost 30 years afterwards, that people who were then heroes should now be held up to ridicule by the country for which they fought.  I want Deputies to realise that there is a very big volume of opinion outside that is nauseated with this continual repetition in the Dáil and elsewhere about pensions for past service to the country. Men and women who should be held in honour are not held in honour because of the peculiar way things have gone on here.</P>
    <P>I understand that the board that will examine these applications will be a board on which there will be two officials, one representing the Department of Finance, and the other the Department of Defence.  What standard have those two officials in regard to the examination of this point: is this a person who is entitled to a certificate of military service?  It has been commonly stated in the past that the function of the representatives of the Department of Finance and the Department of Defence on that board was simply to say: &ldquo;We can award this year pensions up to £30,000, £40,000 or £50,000 as the case may be and we cannot go beyond that.&rdquo;  That is quite a common criticism one hears throughout <Col N="640" /> the country&mdash;that this is their function, to force, in so far as they can, refusals when the number of persons considered as entitled to pensions goes beyond the limit laid down for expenditure on pensions that year.  I could not imagine that that should be so, but that is the common viewpoint.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the board reconstructed so that persons, capable persons with experience, who were at the hub of things in the pre-1921 period, would examine into those applications and deal generously with them.  There ought to be what I might call the humanitarian, the reasonable approach, but where you have officials of a Department, particularly officials of the Department of Finance, they are concerned only with the very sharpest letter of the Act dealing with the matter. That is why I would like to see a reconstructed board so that this thing will be finished once and for all and we will not have to come here possibly some four or five years hence, when this Act is being administered, to reconsider whether injustices have been done to a lot of people or not.</P>
    <P>I did not like the Minister's reference to the question of what it would cost to make these payments retrospective. I think such observations, even though the position was made clear to the deputations that met him, are entirely wrong.  Where a matter of justice is concerned, the fact that it costs £500,000, £750,000 or £1,000,000 should not be a determining factor one way or the other.  I believe that it is justice that should count and not the cost.  If a large number of people were wrongly refused pensions in the past and this new board decides that they were wrongly refused, I think that ordinary justice demands that they should be paid as from the operative date of the Act under which they made their applications in the first instance. These men did not consider their own future at the time; they did not consider how their actions might affect their future.  The country either owes something to these people, or it does not.  If it does owe them something, then it should pay; if it does not owe them anything, then it should clearly say so and be done with it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="641" /> I believe the country does owe them something.  I think it is our duty to ensure that any person whose claim has been unjustly turned down should not continue to suffer because of that unjust decision.  I was surprised to hear the Minister say that it was anticipated that quite a number of the people who would not apply under the 1924 or the 1934 Act would now apply under this Act and that to them would go the bulk of the estimated £50,000. I think that is a different case.  Again, it is a matter for consideration.  To me it certainly appears to be a matter for the consciences of these particular people.  If they declined to recognise the 1924 Act and the 1934 Act, what has happened recently to make them recognise this Bill?  That is an entirely different matter and I do not think any support could be given to a plea that the certificates and the pensions should be granted from a date prior to the date of application.  I was surprised by that statement of the Minister. I thought this Bill would deal in the main with people whose applications were turned down and who felt that they had been unjustly treated.  If the Minister's estimate that the bulk of this £50,000 will go to people who did not apply under either the 1924 or 1934 Act is correct, the amount left for the people appealing from decisions under those Acts will be very small. Only one in 100 will have a chance of getting a pension under this Act.  It is just as well that should be made clear.</P>

      <P>I do not think the Deputy heard me properly on that point.  I did not refer to the money at all.  I referred to the possibility that the great bulk of the applicants would be people who had not applied before.  That is quite a different thing from saying that the bulk of the money would go to those who had not applied before.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely take that as a figure.  In a document which I have got I see that the number of privates who got pensions is very small as compared with the number of officers who got pensions.  I merely take £25 as an average.  Working on that basis, that means that 2,000 people will benefit on an average of £25 each.  If 1,000 of those are people who never applied before because they did not recognise either the 1924 or 1934 Act, then we are left with 1,000 out of the 66,000 that have been rejected.  That is, one in 66 has a chance of getting a pension under this Act.  I think the Old I.R.A., who have organised themselves in different associations for the purpose of getting this Bill through, should appreciate the true position.  I think we should make it perfectly clear to them that the number who will benefit will be very small. The Minister thinks&mdash;and I think Deputy Traynor is of the same opinion&mdash; that the 66,000 will not apply.  I interjected earlier that &ldquo;hope springs eternal&rdquo; and the first applications in will be from those who have no chance at all.  The really genuine ones will come in slowly and hesitantly.  The big bulk of those 66,000 applications will come in again.  How long will the investigation take?  It will certainly continue on past the next general election. There is no doubt about that.  It will probably reach the election after that.  It is a question then for the Minister to decide, as each case is determined, whether the applicant will be informed or whether, if there happen to be 1,000 rejects in the year immediately preceding the general election, that 1,000 will be held over until the election is over.  That did happen in the past.  It was unwise to announce it prior to a general election.  I hope that the board that will examine into this will make their announcement right away&mdash;that they will endeavour to carry through this with expedition &mdash;because it will be a source of worry to everyone until it is finished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some matters in this Act which I think are very wise&mdash;the power the Minister is taking to grant a certificate where that certificate has been refused and, in the case of pensions <Col N="643" /> which have been revoked, the power to reissue them.  I think those are wise provisions and I think it is certainly a good thing that they are included in the Bill.  Deputy Traynor mentioned this.  There will be no solution of this problem until the definition of &ldquo;active service&rdquo; in the Act is dealt with.  &ldquo;Active service&rdquo;, in my view, was interpreted too narrowly and in too restricted a manner. It was interpreted so that if a person did not actually fire shots he was not entitled to be considered as on &ldquo;active service.&rdquo;  If a man was engaged in an operation, perhaps a mile away from the scene of activities, where he might have come under fire, where he might have gone into action, I understand that it was held that he was not on &ldquo;active service.&rdquo;  If that old definition of &ldquo;active service&rdquo; is to be maintained and if the Act is to be operated on the basis of that old definition of active service, then the number of people to whom it will apply will be pretty small.</P>
    <P>Another point that has been mentioned to me is the matter of the inquiry. The investigation of those claims should be done in the open.  It should be done in a court as near as possible to an open court.  Each person ought to be entitled to go there, to bring his witnesses, to have them examined, to examine them; in other words, to conduct his case and to put it forward in the best way he can.  I have some experience of the operation of the Acts and, certainly, the investigations were not held in the open, as they should be.  There was documentary evidence and there were certificates there but the applicants left feeling that they had not had a fair chance at all&mdash;and then, there were thousands of applicants who never saw anybody, who simply saw their rejection slips.  I hope the Minister will be able to arrange that these applications will be heard in open court as it were and that the board will, if necessary, travel round the country so that local evidence, if available, will be presented to the court.</P>
    <P>I am glad that this Bill has been introduced and I am glad to see those <Col N="644" /> sections to which I have referred included in it.  However, I do think that the Minister's statement in regard to what it might cost to do justice is a statement that ought not be made by any Minister nor, in fact, by anybody else in Parliament.  That is not the basis at all on which that matter should be decided.  We run into an expenditure of £70,000,000 or £80,000,000 a year.  We can do justice to many types of people&mdash;whether they are shareholders of bankrupt concerns or otherwise.  We ought to do justice to this particular body of men although I readily admit that were it not for the fact that there has been a change of Government, were it not for the fact that we have a new Government, this Bill would not have been introduced at all.  There is that much to be said in its favour but, having said that, I must repeat, in conclusion, that the principles of justice mean that justice should be done and it is not a question of whether we are able to pay for it or not that should concern us.  The matter is to do justice.</P>

      <P>Like many other Deputies in this House, I am glad to see this Bill introduced.  However, I am afraid that, possibly, the Minister is only storing up a future of trouble if not for himself at least for his successors who may come into that office in the years to come.  I have a feeling, looking objectively at the whole I.R.A. question&mdash;and I feel I can do it because I am too young to have had any active part in it myself or to be actively influenced by partisan considerations that might have arisen&mdash;that this is a problem that will have to be dealt with finally in a courageous and in an audacious manner.  I do not think this Bill is doing it.  I find myself in the extraordinary position of wholeheartedly agreeing with Deputy Cowan&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that justice should be done and that, if this Bill is to serve the purpose that I feel we all would like it to serve, then justice must be done and whether that is going to cost £100,000 or £1,000,000 or £2,000,000 should not influence this <Col N="645" /> House, because we purport to make that payment to the people who, above all others&mdash;and I say this without qualification&mdash;above all others, have merited the consideration not only of this Parliament but of this country. It may be that many things affected the decisions in the past with regard to pensions but one kernel must remain&mdash;whether or not the service was rendered to this State that the person alleged was rendered, and if that service was, in fact, rendered and is so established, it does not matter how you cover it up or what excuse of lack of money you make, justice is not being done to the person who, but for some technical hitch, but for some political hitch or some victimisation, could have and should have enjoyed 25 years of this pension.  No justice is being done to him if you turn round some day during the next 12 months and grant him a pension as from that date.</P>
      <P>We do not want to get into a political discussion on this matter at all.  I do not care who was right or who was wrong in the past.  If there remains a nucleus of people&mdash;and I am certain there is such a nucleus&mdash;who have been excluded for any reason under the 1924 or the 1934 Acts but who are in justice entitled to that pension, then I say that justice cannot be done unless the pension is made payable from the date on which they were entitled to have it, the date the service was rendered. I am not in the least anxious to embarrass the Minister or the Government.  I am standing on my two feet to say in fairness to a generation of people who have suffered many things that they should not have suffered that there is no body of people to whom the bulk of the people of Ireland should more gladly or willingly pay what is due than the Old I.R.A.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are inclined at times to take the realisation of freedom in this country too lightly, and it is deplorable.  I hope that the day is soon to come when we will not have queer quips or questions put down here about anybody's pension. I hope that in the public life of this country we will come to respect the judgments given and the assessments made under the Pension Acts, and accept that the people who have <Col N="646" /> been so awarded pensions are justly entitled to them.  Not only are they justly entitled to draw their pensions but they are justly entitled to, and more than worthy of, the respect of the nation because it is their sacrifice that has made it possible for a free Ireland to pay pensions to anybody.  I know perfectly well that the Minister is facing a difficult situation of a Finance grasp, but I say to him in all sincerity in relation to the pensions that will be paid under this Bill that there is no more deserving section of the community than the people he will have to deal with and that he should ruthlessly lift the cruel hand of Finance off their back.  I want a position where the people who have claims either actual or imaginary will have them dealt with once and for all.  I want the matter wound up once and for all.  It is a heartbreak to the older Deputies and it has become a terrible problem to me in the constituency I represent where, despite the crack once made by Deputy John McCann in this House, there was a fair bit of fighting and a fair bit of nationalism at all times.  Representing such a constituency, I say that there are a number of people who feel they have genuine claims and they should at least have the right to a full, thorough and final investigation of them.  If in that thorough, final and full investigation it is found that they are entitled to a pension which was denied to them under the 1924 or the 1934 Act they should get it from the date on which they were entitled to it.  The measure of justice done will ultimately enhance the position of the Government to a greater extent than the denial of their right.  It is easy to be penny wise and pound foolish.  In dealing with people upon whom the very foundation of this State is built, no matter what their present political views may be, it ill behoves us to be niggardly.</P>
    <P>There are features in the Bill which are very welcome and which will give great satisfaction.  With the exception of the retrospective end of the pensions I think the Bill will give admirable satisfaction to all sections of the community, but I feel that we will only increase the political feelings with regard to Old I.R.A. pensions by such a <Col N="647" /> piece of legislation as this because we are only opening a door to having this question thrashed out again as long as any people who fought in that period may survive.  What we have to analyse is the question of a person who will now be awarded a pension, a person who applied under the 1924 or the 1934 Acts and was rejected.  It may be that at the time of the rejection the people who rejected him acted perfectly <i>bona fide.</i>  That claim now comes before this new board on the constitution of which I will have a word to say in a moment.  This new board, again acting completely <i>bona fide,</i> decides that he is entitled to a pension.  I feel that the man who gets a pension in 1950, say, that he should have been entitled to in 1934 or 1924 is going to be a lot more bitter than if he got no pension at all. I think it is only rubbing the salt into the wound if he gets a pension from 1950 and from that date only.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to decide what would be an ideal tribunal to deal with the question of pensions but it is very easy to visualise people who would be absolutely unsuitable to sit on such an appeal tribunal, and I think that such people would certainly be officials of either the Department of Defence or Finance.  I think this question must be taken outside the realm of officialdom altogether.  The interests of the State can be protected by a Referee. That is what he is there for.  Like the case of the ordinary criminal who is entitled to trial by a jury of his fellow men I feel that all the surrounds to the Referee should be people who know a little about the period with which the Bill will deal and who themselves served the cause of freedom of the country.  Through their experience and an innate instinct of comradeship they would give more humane and sympathetic consideration to the question than any official would be capable of giving.</P>
    <P>With the best intentions in the world a senior official of either the Department of Defence or Finance who has had a long tortuous passage up the ladder to reach the stage of being sufficiently competent to be drafted on to such a board has long lost his flexibility and all capability of any <Col N="648" /> thought outside the rigid orbit of Civil Service routine.  I do not think that is the type of mind that should be addressed to a period of our history marked by the generous enthusiasm of youth and a lack of consideration of the consequences that the effort might bring.  I think that the best type of minds to deal with that problem would be people who were wholeheartedly and absolutely within the movement and who since then&mdash;if it is possible to find them&mdash;have in the main kept out of the realm of violent Party politics or any violent partisanship.</P>
    <P>I disagree completely with the suggestion made by Deputy Cowan that certain people who, for reasons of conscience or of belief, or actuated by honest conviction, found it not to their liking to apply under the 1924 or 1934 Acts, should not change their minds now.  If those people, in a new political situation, in a new era and in a new drive towards general unity, decide they will apply now under this Act, I think no odium, no stigma or anything like that should be attached to them.  We should welcome the fact that bitterness can be sunk to such an extent that we can give everybody an opportunity now to have fair play.</P>
    <P>Might I say to the Minister, in conclusion, that that fair play can be had only on one basis&mdash;and I am stressing this because it is something on which I personally feel very strongly&mdash;that is, on the basis of justice?  In the case of a man who was refused for any reason a right or entitlement that is found in 1950 to be his, relative to something that happened in the pre-Truce or immediate post-Truce days in connection with that service, he can have justice only under one shape and one form, that is, the full measure of justice that will give him his pension retrospective to the day he earned it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HarryColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill deals, in the main, with people who applied under the previous Act and whose claims were rejected.  It makes no provision for altering the procedure that existed under the 1934 Act, as far as I can see. It accepts what was embodied in the <Col N="649" /> 1945 Act, though we had great criticism of it from these particular benches here at that time.  This Bill now accepts all that.  Therefore, the only people who can make good their claims under this Bill are some who, through some accident or calamity, were not treated fairly at the time of their last application.  For one minute I do not think that the referee or the board dealt unfairly with any applicant. They dealt, I believe, as fairly as their nature could allow them, on the facts before them.  If anybody was turned down at that time, it was due to some other cause.</P>
      <P>There is one type of case that strikes me as one which could be rectified under this Bill.  It is that of a man who, at the time of his original application, could not produce certain evidence, though it was available in the legal sense, as he could not find the particular people he wanted and who might be able to do that to-day.  If I read the Bill correctly, that man's case can now be put right.  I can see only cases similar to his making good under this Bill.</P>
      <P>I do not for a minute accept that there is any number of men who were ruled out through failing to be certified on political grounds on any side.  It has been one of the features of the Old I.R.A. movement&mdash;let those who have not been in it say what they like &mdash;that, no matter what side men took in the past, as far as certification under these Acts went, or as far as comradeship went, their present politics never count.  On both sides, to their honour be it said, men have certified their greatest political opponents just because they were doing justice in recognition of what those men had done in the past.  I do not believe there are many cases on which any of the allegations that we have heard in the past could be based.  Because of the fact that it deals mainly with men who have suffered injustice in some form&mdash;as I have tried to put it&mdash;in the past, I think there is a perfect case that these men, if now certified, should be paid the pension from October, 1934.</P>

In all fairness to him, as between him and his colleagues he should be paid from the same date.  There is no analogy between this Act and the 1924 Act.  The 1934 Act dealt with a class of person who was not entitled to a pension at all before that date.  This Act is simply an amendment of the 1934 Act, opening the door for people who, it is alleged, were not treated justly under it.  If that is the case and they succeed now in getting justice, there is no reason why they should not get full justice, as Deputy Collins has just said, and be put on proper parity with the others.</P>

      <P>The Minister, from the figures he gave us as to the estimated cost, does not seem to think that a very large number of the 48,000 rejected applications under the 1934 Act or the 17,000 under the 1924 Act are going to succeed in making good their case now.  He told us that the bulk of the £50,000 a year estimated cost would go on new applications.  Therefore, even taking it on Deputy Cowan's figure of an average of £25 a year, there will not be a large number or, at any rate, it is not estimated that a large number will succeed. That, to my mind, will create exactly the same position as we have had up to now of agitation by the remainder of the thousands of applicants that there was political influence against them.  It will not relieve that in the slightest.  If it does succeed in remedying even a small number of cases of injustice it will be all to the good.  The number who appealed under the 1934 Act and succeeded in their appeal is proof that the board were acting conscientiously. I do hope that an end will be put to the charges that were levelled against the former Minister of giving pensions to his colleagues and political friends. <Col N="651" /> As he pointed out here to-day, he had no function whatever under the Act except to carry out the award of the Referee.  Anyone who reads the Act can see that he was in exactly the same position with the Referee as the Minister for Justice is with the courts and I wonder what people would think if the Minister for Justice were to interfere with the judges in the courts and tell them how they were to decide certain cases.  I do hope that we will have an end of these charges, although I am afraid we will not.  At any rate, here in this House we should have an end of them.  As a beginning, I hope the statement to which Deputy Traynor referred this evening that was made by the Minister for External Affairs during the last election will be either proved or withdrawn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to pay a tribute to the Minister for Defence for introducing this Bill.  Undoubtedly, mistakes were made in the past under the 1924 Act and under the 1934 Act.  I classify them as mistakes but I cannot say the same in regard to what happened in the case of certain soldiers of the I.R.A. who appealed against decisions and who were flatly turned down in 1945.  On an Estimate here in 1948 I mentioned four names.  A present Deputy of this House received a deputation that I introduced some time about 1938.  He listened to the case being made by one of those men. I do not know whether he assumed that the man took a certain line in the civil war or not.  He asked him, &ldquo;Is that all&rdquo;, when he came to deal with the Truce and post-Truce period, before the civil war.  &ldquo;No&rdquo;, was the reply, &ldquo;I was in the attack on Urlingford Barracks, I was in the fight at Mary Willie's and I was in other small engagements in County Tipperary.&rdquo; The Deputy, who is listening to me now, put down his pen and said, &ldquo;Tell me, is it possible that you did not get a pension,&rdquo; and the answer was &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;  I must say that that Deputy did his very best to have justice meted out to that applicant afterwards but he failed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The applicant appealed again in 1945. He had pre-Truce column service, he <Col N="652" /> had served in ambushes, and had served during practically the whole Truce period and civil war period.  He was captain of a certain company in the Second Cork Brigade.  His appeal was rejected.  There were other people who appealed at that particular time and it was the first time that I realised that some other factors were at work besides those which up to that had operated in putting pension cases before the board.  I know very well what flimsy and fictitious statements certain people brought before the Referee and the board after 1945.  I was a witness on a couple of occasions before that board and I do believe that it was the proper and only way to try pension cases.  Nobody was precluded from going into that court.  Every witness and every applicant went in on oath and much good work was done by the board.  Where, however, the applicant did not get past the bastion of Defence, where some civil servant with practically autonomous power for either rejecting or approving, was putting every claim under the microscope, that board did not get the cases that were rejected and, of course, had no function in the matter of deciding whether these cases were genuine or not.  It is just as well to let the dead past bury its dead.</P>
    <P>The present Bill is undoubtedly an act of justice.  It is not an act of generosity; it is merely an act of justice. I personally am agitated, so far as the retrospective effect of this Bill is concerned.  When we are embarking on the giving of a certain measure of justice, why should we not give 100 per cent. justice?  If some people who applied under the 1924 Act and who were turned down come forward under this Bill and are accepted as being genuine applicants, why should they not get what was honestly due to them, by reason of their services to this country when the services of men were required?  We should not be perturbed about what a certain element will think of any generosity which we are supposed to extend through this Bill.  It is not generosity.  These men are not looking for charity.  They are looking, as soldiers of the Republican Army, for what they believe they <Col N="653" /> are entitled to and what many of us believe they are more than entitled to.</P>
    <P>The same thing applies to the 1934 Act.  If a man who was turned down under that Act comes forward now with his case and somebody finds that an injustice was done to him, 100 per cent. of that injustice should be done away with and he should get 100 per cent. justice.  The only way to do that is by making the payment retrospective from the date on which the application was first made or from the date specified by the Act as the qualifying date. In both Acts, and particularly in the 1934 Act, the definition of &ldquo;active service&rdquo; was left very vague.  I know soldiers of the Republican Army who went before the board.  They found themselves in an atmosphere that was more or less strange to them and they may have developed a complex which many lads from a country district develop when they come to the city and go before such a board as that which sat under the Act of 1934.  They make certain statements and I know of a statement made by one man&mdash;he was comparatively young at the time of the engagement&mdash;who was in an ambush. He held a shotgun and when asked what distance he was from the actual firing, said &ldquo;1,000 yards&rdquo;.  That man did an injustice to himself.  It was proved conclusively after that he had been holding perhaps a very important position and was not more than 100 yards from where the lorry was attacked.  Still, he was bound down by his statement, although anybody who knows the range of a shotgun would laugh at it.</P>
    <P>Some consideration should have been given to that young man at the time he was giving his evidence.  The peculiar thing is that he was not called under the 1945 amending Act.  With regard to the setting up of this tribunal for deciding the claims of the people who will reapply and those people who will be making their first applications, I have a very strong objection to any body setting itself up as a brigade advisory committee or a battalion advisory committee.  I was not concerned under the 1934 Act, but some of my comrades were, and they asked me on several occasions about <Col N="654" /> the advisability of participating in these advisory committees.  I said to them that they were perhaps very good, but I pointed out the snag&mdash;it is only human nature&mdash;that the people comprising these boards, in some cases, although not in all, feathered their own nests first and then proceeded to feather their friends' nests.  I do not want that to be taken as having been general throughout the country, but it happened in part of the area I represent, and there are Deputies on the Opposition side who are conversant with what happened.</P>
    <P>If any aspersion were to be cast on Referees, it certainly would not be cast by me, because there were systems introduced by some certifying officers who were acting, or supposed to be acting, on the advice of these committees which resulted in these officers being a greater barrier to pensions being given to applicants than the representative of the Minister for Finance sitting on the Board of Referees.  They turned themselves into watchdogs to look after the finances of the country and to see to it that no man got what he was not entitled to, but they took very good care to give it to themselves. I believe that the board set up after 1945 could be copied by the Minister with very good results when setting up his new tribunal&mdash;trial in open court, with witnesses and applicants on oath.  I found, with one exception &mdash;and I do not hold the board completely to blame for it&mdash;in all the cases in which I was a witness that they were 100 per cent. just.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will remember my words when setting up this board and will set up an open board before which everyone concerned will hear the evidence given on his behalf or against him, because I am afraid that the old French system was introduced at one time into the various pension boards that sat both in 1924 and 1934, the system of <i>letters de cachet</i>&mdash;a good letter of reference followed up by a letter of poison, liquidating the applicant.  I am afraid that too much notice was taken by certain people of those letters.</P>
    <P>There are a certain number of Republican soldiers who are salaried <Col N="655" /> officials under the Government and in the service of local authorities, receiving pensions and there is in operation against them an abatement system.  I cannot very well understand why this system was introduced the first day. There may have been very good reasons for doing it; I have a certain suspicion of the reasons why it was introduced but I have no hesitation in stating here to-night that all these reasons have gone by the board now and I think it only fair to put the position of these men before the Minister.  I am not concerned as to whether they are £1,500 or £1,000 officials or whether they are receiving just £250.  I believe that all these men should be paid salaries commensurate with their work and responsibilities, and that whatever pensions they were allowed under the various Acts, they earned by taking an active part in the fight for Irish freedom.</P>
    <P>I do not see why these pensions should interfere with their salaries and why there should be any abatement of their salaries as a result.  &ldquo;Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's.&rdquo;  These men are earning their salaries at the moment by doing their work, but back in the halcyon days from 1914 to 1923 they earned their pensions by risking their lives and their liberty in the fight for freedom. I think the Minister should be generous and should blot out that abatement system.  Some people may say that these men are getting sufficient salaries.  I believe that on principle, irrespective of what they are getting, there should be nothing deducted from their salaries or from the military service pensions which they receive under the various Acts.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like again to emphasise the injustices that can be carried out under an act of justice. Perhaps it may not be too late to suggest to the Minister, so that he may suggest it to the Cabinet, that in order to ventilate properly the feelings of this House, we should have a free vote on this matter.  Some of us are not concerned that a lot of &ldquo;shoneens&rdquo; will say throughout the country in the morning that we are going to run the <Col N="656" /> country into bankruptcy.  After all, there would be no bankruptcy or no opulence in this country, were it not for the men for whom this Bill is intended to provide.  I do not mind being called a spendthrift.  I would prefer to be called that any day than to be called a &ldquo;shoneen&rdquo; or a reactionary. I believe that in implementing this Bill we should make it retrospective to the 1924 and 1934 Acts and give those men what they are entitled to get. Again, I should like to reiterate my gratitude to the Minister.  I am satisfied, although he may not satisfy any one of us, he has gone a certain distance and I hope that by giving consideration to the cases put forward by my colleagues Deputy Cowan and Deputy Collins and also by Deputy Colley, he will go still further along the road than he intended by making this Bill retrospective.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedOSullivan" hpid="Mr. T. O'Sullivan Mr. T. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that the Minister will find that all Parties in the House are satisfied as to the necessity for this Bill.  As one with a certain experience of the working of previous Acts, I am satisfied that mistakes were made both under the Acts of 1924 and 1934 and that this Bill is needed to remedy these mistakes.  It would be a great pity if the experience gained in the administration of the 1924 and 1934 Acts were not brought to bear now in an effort to ensure, so far as it is humanly possible, that the mistakes will not be repeated under this Bill.  I am not at all satisfied with the figures given by the Minister as to the number of persons likely to benefit by this Bill.  I feel, from the knowledge that I have, that these figures are too low.  I am sure that as time goes on the Minister will find out that the expenditure under the Bill will amount to more than £50,000, and that in order to rectify the mistakes of the past the Bill will have to provide for more than 2,000 persons.  After all, there were about 80 brigades in the whole country, and I feel sure that the minimum number who would have a <i>prima facie</i> case under this Bill would be 25 or 35 from each brigade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first and most important step to be taken in connection with the <Col N="657" /> administration of this has been referred to by three or four Deputies, and that is, the setting up of this board and the taking of evidence.  For a number of years past there has been much talk through the country about the words &ldquo;active service&rdquo;.  The people dealing with these matters and mentioning &ldquo;active service&rdquo; do not seem to know what &ldquo;active service&rdquo; means, nor has it ever been defined.  I feel that it would be impossible to define these two words in connection with the services given by the I.R.A. because, no matter where a volunteer was, whether in a shop, in the street, or on the hillside, he was always on duty no matter what his occupation was and ready to grasp any opportunity which would arise.  If membership alone and being, as you might say, in the country where the operations were being carried out constituted active service for other armies, it should constitute active service for our Army.</P>
    <P>I would prefer to have these two words cut out completely in connection with the consideration of these claims and that the board and the Referee should evaluate the military value of the services rendered by the applicant rather than setting up any standard. Standards varied in different brigades in the country and what was very easy in one brigade may have been very difficult work in another brigade. Taking the local circumstances into account, I submit that the board should try to arrive at the military value of the applicant's activities rather than having any standard of active service.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to all Deputies, who, I know, are imbued with the same desire as I am, to have any mistakes made rectified under this Bill, to be careful in the suggestions that they may make.  If we profit by the experience of the other Acts, I have no doubt that any board set up under this Bill will also profit by that experience and will have before them all the records and files in connection with the matter. I feel that this new board will be guided also by the speeches made by Deputies and that they will seek to discover, by reading through the <Col N="658" /> Official Debates, what the spirit of the Act is meant to be.  It is for that reason that I ask all Deputies who speak on this matter to try to interpret the real spirit of this Bill as we see it.  I feel it is the unanimous wish of this House to have an opportunity given to these people who believe they can qualify under either of these Acts.</P>
    <P>I am whole-heartedly in agreement with the Deputies who asked the Minister to reconsider the question of making the awards retrospective. Deputy Collins, Deputy Keane, Deputy Cowan, Deputy Traynor and Deputy Colley have put that matter very forcibly. I should like to add my voice to theirs and I believe that the Minister, with the unanimous voice of the Dáil behind him, will have sufficient strength to see that these awards are made retrospective.  It may be that the bill would appear to some to be too high.  As other Deputies have mentioned, I believe that no bill of that nature which is likely to be presented will be refused by the Dáil and that the money will not be begrudged by anybody in the country.  I am satisfied that, having the Dáil unanimously behind him, the Minister will reconsider that matter.</P>
    <P>I submit to him that the number of awards to be made retrospective under the 1924 Act would be very small.  I am aware that, for various reasons, some people were not able to apply under the 1924 Act and that would represent the longest term.  On the Minister's own showing, the number he expects to qualify under the 1934 Act would be very small also.  I am satisfied, however, from my own information that that number will have to be substantially increased.  However, that remains to be seen.  I therefore join with other Deputies in requesting the Minister to reconsider this matter of making the awards retrospective.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the efforts of the Minister in bringing in this Bill and I welcome it, but I believe that certain amendments will have to be accepted before it will meet our requirements on behalf of the Old I.R.A. members throughout the country.  Like Deputy O'Sullivan, I fail to see how the figures given by the Minister were <Col N="659" /> arrived at.  He said that 60,850 persons applied under the 1934 Act and 11,000 succeeded.  The Minister anticipates that 66,000 will apply under this Bill and that 2,000 will succeed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>If I have made a mistake, I withdraw it.  These were figures which I took from the Press reports at the time that Deputy Traynor was Minister for Defence.  I refer to the time when the 1934 Act was amended, and when Section 5 was introduced. The Minister at that time admitted, unless my memory is at fault, that there were between 2,000 and 3,000 border-line cases.  In other words, that under the 1934 Act there were that number of cases which should have succeeded.  If that were so, and if these men are still in the country, how can the present Minister assume that only 2,000 new applicants can succeed under this Bill?  When one bears in mind the admission that was made by the former Minister for Defence and the number that will apply now, together with those border-line cases, I, like Deputy T. O'Sullivan, am of the opinion that the number to be estimated for annually will be between 5,000 and 6,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am of the opinion that the proposals in this Bill should be retrospective. If necessary, I will table an amendment to that effect.  The difficulty that we in the country are up against at the moment is that we have men who were turned down on a technical point under the 1934 Act, men who should have succeeded in the ordinary way.  They were turned down through no fault of their own, but simply because they were not able to supply dates and all the details required by the board.  I believe that the test as regards &ldquo;active service&rdquo; should be drastically amended.  It appears to me that the Minister, in view of the number that he estimates as likely to qualify under this Bill, is taking the same line as his predecessor, and that he is going to appoint the same type of board and the same type of referee.  If that is so, it is a waste <Col N="660" /> of time for us to mention any man's case.  The board at that time acted within the strict letter of the law.  In fact, it had a man there from Finance &mdash;I am not going to mention any man's name&mdash;but he was a regular tyrant.</P>

      <P>Coming back to the question of the board, I would appeal to the Minister to set up another type of board or tribunal: to have, say, a court in each provincial centre, as was suggested by other Deputies, before which an applicant could appear with his witnesses and make his case.  He could be examined there and let the court, if necessary, give full publicity to the evidence submitted.  Heretofore, the onus was on the applicant to prove active service.  That all depended on the interpretation which was put on a particular section of the Act by the board.  They interpreted &ldquo;active service&rdquo; as meaning a major engagement.  They came to the conclusion that, unless a man actually carried arms and took part in important engagements, he was not on active service. But, in every other country in the world, when a man dons uniform and takes a rifle in his hand, he is held to be on active service, even though he is 100 miles away from the scene of action.  The board that operated in this country under previous Acts took <Col N="661" /> the line that I have stated, so that their interpretation of &ldquo;active service&rdquo; was quite different from that which applied in Europe or America. That is the snag in this, that if the same line of procedure is followed under this Bill, as was followed under the previous Acts, it will be a waste of time for men to apply under it.</P>
      <P>I see nothing new in this Bill in regard to a definition of &ldquo;active service&rdquo;, or as regards the machinery to be set up for dealing with applications. Is there simply to be a review of the evidence again in the case of men who were turned down under the 1934 Act and who now make fresh application under this measure?  Are the old files which have been there since 1934 to be dug up, and is the applicant to be examined on that same evidence?  I should like the Minister to say if there is to be a departure from the line of procedure that was followed under the 1934 Act.  Are we to take it that the whole thing comes down to this, that there will be another review of the evidence which a man submitted in 1934, that it will be taken into account again and examined, and that, unless he submits additional evidence not then available, his case will be rejected?  If that is the type of procedure that is to be set up, then this Bill is not very much good to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a few other points that I have to put before the House.  As regards the constitution of the board, it was mentioned here that some man, other than a civil servant, would be welcome as a member of it.  I agree with that.  An ex-member of the Republican Army who has had experience would, by reason of his knowledge of procedure, be an asset on such a board or tribunal, but by all means have a representative of the Department with the legal assessor as well. We believe that very few will qualify under this measure.  Assuming that the last Minister for Defence was correct when he said there were between 2,000 and 3,000 border-line cases that in justice should have qualified, I ask the Minister to accept that position and say, for a start-off, that those border-line <Col N="662" /> cases that should have qualified will now qualify.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder did he say that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFlynn" hpid="Mr. J. Flynn Mr. J. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I remember he did.  The Minister should also, I suggest, make it possible for the men who were rejected under the 1924 and 1934 Acts to have another opportunity of submitting evidence about their active service.  I ask him not to adopt the drastic interpretation that was adopted by previous boards.  I know several cases of men who got a pension, while their brothers or neighbours who had the same type of active service were turned down under the 1924 and 1934 Acts.  If we can show that certain men had the same service as others who qualified, will the Minister accept that position and permit them to make a case?  Will he give another chance to those who were turned down through a technicality?  If the Minister will accept that position it will go a long way towards getting over this crux about active service.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's anxiety to do something for those men who were left out and who got a raw deal.  If he accepts the principle of doing justice to these men, I would like him to go further and, despite what people may say about cost, he should make this retrospective. We have assisted civil servants and other people in various ways. Why not assist the men who helped to make this State?  They went out never dreaming that they would be entitled to anything; they did not expect it.  They went out unselfishly to fight for their country.  They never imagined they would get a monetary reward, but it is only justice to them now in their old age that they should get some recognition. Some of those men are now 50 or 60 years old.  As Deputies Cowan and O'Sullivan have said, it is not a matter of money but of justice and we should make these payments retrospective. I desire to thank the Minister for his assurances.</P>

      <P>I read this measure very carefully and I listened attentively to the last Minister for Defence <Col N="663" /> and Deputy Colley and other Deputies on the Opposition Benches.  They should remember that in 1945 they closed the door to the Old I.R.A. men. I welcome this Bill and I will give it every support.  The Old I.R.A. are not demanding pensions; they are merely demanding a fair hearing of their claims.  They were denied this by the last administration.  Deputy Colley said the referee gave a fair trial to every man.  Perhaps Deputy Traynor can tell me why men in the country were sent a circular by the Department of Defence and when they could not attend at Griffith Barracks on a certain day their claims were turned down?  How could the referee say they were not persons to whom Section 8 (1) of the Act applied? There was something wrong with that decision on the part of the referee.</P>
      <P>Certain statements were made by Deputy Traynor as to what the Minister for External Affairs said about pensions during the last election. I know that people got pensions on the eve of the 1948 election because they threatened not to support Fianna Fáil if they did not get the pension. That can be looked up in the records.</P>

      <P>How could he come to any decision when he did not hear the claims of those men?  That is what the Old I.R.A. men complain about-that they were turned down and never got a chance of going before the referee.  Some of them were in America and others were in England, all genuine Old I.R.A. men.  I come from a town that took part in the Rising of 1916.  It is now very much in the news, in the <i>Sunday Press.</i> There are in that town genuine fighting men who were in prison and went on hunger strike and they were turned down as persons to whom the Act did not apply although their next door neighbours qualified.  All those men had the same active service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Enniscorthy was one of the towns that took part in the Rebellion.  There are men there to-day who are getting <Col N="664" /> old and they were put to the expense of hiring motor cars and going to Griffith Barracks and then they were told the Act did not apply to them. If you had not got sufficient pull you were unsuccessful.  If you were not a supporter of the Government of the day your application was turned down because you would not be certified as having taken an active part.  The keynote was &ldquo;active service,&rdquo; as Deputy Flynn said.  I know one man who was out in 1916 who was turned down. I know two members of the Cumann na mBan who applied; one applicant was successful, the other was not.  There is no doubt that political influence had a good deal to do with it.  Deputy Traynor, in answer to a question of mine, said that the certification was a matter for the officers concerned and that he had no function.  If there were no grievances in this respect, would the Old I.R.A. associations now approach Deputies to have these grievances remedied?  Thousands of applicants were refused.  On the other hand, thousands were successful to whom awards should never have been made.  I am sure every Deputy has received a copy of this circular from the Old Comrades Association in Cork. One can see from it that there was injustice done.</P>

      <P>To-night we hope there will be a remedy.  You provided no remedy when you were in power. We all hope that justice will be done. Every Fianna Fáil Deputy in the House is clamouring for retrospective payment of these pensions.  Were it not for the change of Government that opportunity would have been denied to them.  It took a change of Government and a sympathetic Cabinet and Minister to bring in this measure.  The Opposition is in the position that it cannot vote against it.  I hope that these men will get fair play.  I hope there will be no secrecy about it. These men are looking for justice. They are taxpayers like everyone else and they are just as anxious about the taxpayers in general as is any member in this House.  We had £7,000,000 for defence during the emergency.  We <Col N="665" /> ought to be able to find £1,000,000 now for the men who helped to establish the State.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill as one who is aware that there are a number of cases throughout the country which are, not only border-line cases, but over the Border as well.  I admire the manner in which this Bill has been met by both sides of the House.  In the atmosphere created here to-night we ought to be able to approach this problem in a proper way and do justice to all concerned.  If we can afford millions for others who are not perhaps as much entitled to it as those men who have first claim upon the State, surely we ought to be able to find sufficient for them.  Judging by the speeches up to the present, the Minister appears to be in a minority of one in relation to the clause governing retrospective payment.  Why deprive a man, if he is entitled to a pension under this Bill, of the arrears of pension he should have been enjoying under either the 1924 or the 1934 Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Captain Cowan said, no question of finance should stand in the way of seeing justice done. Anyone who has battled through these cases knows very well that in a large number of them the applicants were knocked out, not on any statement made by the certifying officer or anyone else, but on their own statements.  Ordinary country men were brought up here to Dublin and marched in at 11 o'clock or 12 o'clock in the morning before three or four gentlemen who fired questions at them.  It was only natural that they would make mistakes.  Deputy Keane gave instances of several mistakes that were made.  These things are bound to occur.  I know three men who were captured three weeks before the Truce. They were released three days before it.  They were asked the apparently simple question: &ldquo;What did you do when you were released?&rdquo;  They replied: &ldquo;I kept out of their way.&rdquo; Because the answer was not that they had reported back, they were knocked out on the ground that they were not on active service on the date of the Truce.  Their officers went in and gave evidence that they did report back and <Col N="666" /> did serve actively up to the date of the Truce, but it was no use.  These are the injustices that must be remedied.</P>
    <P>It is no use approaching the problem in any other way.  The Minister has the entire House with him in this matter. I quite realise that, when he is putting something across the Department of Finance, he must start at a small figure and keep the figure low for the purpose of getting it through.  The Minister knows that he will have far more than 2,000 cases to meet.  Knowing the position in my own county, I would say frankly that there are far more than 2,000 cases in County Cork alone.  If the Minister were to open a list in Cork City to-morrow I am sure he would get over 2,000 cases within a week of men who are, in fairness and in justice, entitled to a pension and to their certificates.  There is no doubt about that and there is no use in approaching this matter from the point of view of cheeseparing.  There should be no cheeseparing.</P>
    <P>You have, then, the position as regards the definition of &ldquo;active service&rdquo; and what is &ldquo;active service&rdquo; and what &ldquo;active service&rdquo; will consist of.  The vast majority of the men who took part in the struggle for freedom are now men in their 60's, you might say, who will not be a trouble in the natural course of events to this country much longer.  In decency, and for the sake of the decency of this nation, the nation should treat them fairly and decently now.</P>

      <P>Let us deal with them now and let me say that if the attitude now is to be on the same tight line as previously you are not going to settle it now.  You are going to have even more dissatisfaction, when this Bill is finished with, in two, three or four <Col N="667" /> years' time than you had before.  Take, for instance, the case of the two men whose applications were turned down on what I consider a technicality.  On the other hand, their comrades have been enjoying their pensions since 1934. These men are now going to get their pensions.  We had cases as late as 1944 and 1945.  I remember getting three cases from Mourne Abbey, near Mallow, in 1944.  Those men only got through then, but they got their ten years' back money.  Now, if they come along under this Bill as it stands they are not going to get any retrospective money at all.  They will start off now. We all know that the average pension paid to the average volunteer in this country is somewhere between £10 and £25 a year.  That is not going to be such a big financial obligation, considering the few thousands that peg out every year in the natural course of events and that the most of those men will not, in the natural course of events, be drawing it very long.  Certainly, in fairness, I would urge the Minister, in view of the opinions given here from all quarters of the House, to make a decent gesture.  If he does that I think he will have the whole House with him and not only the House but the nation. We are anxious to finish this once and for all.  We are anxious to finish it decently now.  Let the Minister make one decent gesture and say: &ldquo;Very well, we are finishing it off.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the position going to be? You have the trouble still in regard to the definition of &ldquo;active service&rdquo; and what &ldquo;active service&rdquo; means.  I was brought up against several cases. Take, for instance, a barrack attack. A dozen men were in the attack. Altogether there were 18 men summoned on the job.  Some were put on this road, watching a mile outside the village, to block the road and stop reinforcements from coming in.  Similarly, in perhaps two or three other roads in the vicinity.  The board held that the only men who were entitled to be considered as on active service in that attack were the men who were actually fighting in the barrack, though the other men were, you might say, in a far more dangerous position if the reinforcements <Col N="668" /> came, and it is only a matter of luck that they did not come. The question is, what is now going to be the definition of &ldquo;active service&rdquo;. Let us face that problem.  Are these men who were ordered to watch the roads on that attack to be taken as men on active service on that occasion, as compared with previous decisions? That is a door that I think will certainly have to be opened in fairness to everybody.  I cannot see, for the life of me, how you are going to confine this thing to a point where, if the Minister is correct, he is going to have 17,000 applications and only 2,000 are going to get pensions.  What about the other 15,000 men and what are they going to get?  We are going to have more dissatisfied people at the end than there were previously unless, once and for all, you do the decent thing and say that any man who was an active Volunteer and who obeyed all the orders of superior officers from 1916 to 1921 is entitled to a pension.  That, to my mind, is a fair and honest definition of &ldquo;active service&rdquo;.  Anything less than that is only cavilling and is only going to keep out one brother, one comrade, from the other and create dissatisfaction.  The time has arrived now when the decent thing should be done and when we should end this bickering once and for all.  You have men here who served together at one period, who fought with one another afterwards and who did not agree with one another ever since but, at the same time, you have that common feeling, if you like, for the satisfying of the grievances of old comrades who were with us.  That is something that should be faced up to now and it would help to get rid of this bickering.</P>
    <P>I know what is going to be said down the country.  It will be said that if £1,000,000 can be afforded for the teachers surely the Minister can afford a couple of hundred thousand for the Old I.R.A.  People will say that if we can afford to provide pensions for all the doctors down the country surely the Minister can afford pensions for the Old I.R.A.  After all, it is not going to take so much money to end this now.  I, to be honest about it, felt quite happy to-night when I heard <Col N="669" /> Deputy Seán Collins, Deputy Seán Keane and other Deputies from all sides of the House get up and voice the one viewpoint in this connection, namely, that financial interests or the question of finance should not be let stand in the way of seeing justice done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>The most humiliating thing to us in the Old I.R.A. to have to listen to over the past ten years has been the question of pensions.  We in the Old I.R.A. never sought pensions in the past.  They were brought in to get the first Government out of a dirty mess and if the first and the second Governments had done their duty there would be very little trouble in this country as regards pensions for the Old I.R.A.  I am satisfied that there is a minority of Old I.R.A. in this country who have suffered an injustice over the past 25 years.  It is only right that this injustice should be remedied and although it may be 25 years too late&mdash; better late than never.  If the first Government brought in a proper pension Act for the proper period, 1916 to 1921 and no further, all this trouble would be ended.  We who fought between 1921 and 1924 in the regular Army were paid for our services and that should be enough.  If the period had been fixed from 1916 to 1921 all the Old I.R.A. men, whether they were pro-Treaty or anti-Treaty, could go before a pension board; justice could be done to them and there need be no wrangling at all over the past 25 years.  I have no apology to make to anyone because we are pressing the claims of the Old I.R.A. who have had an injustice done to them over the past decades in this country.  It has been said that the Fianna Fáil Government were the cause of certain men not getting their pensions but I do not believe that.  Under the 1934 Act however a certain number of mean vindictive men throughout the country who should have given evidence to support certain people refused to do it.  There were other mean vindictive men who gave wrong evidence in order to deprive others of their pension. The cause of that was the civil war mentality.  I hope that that has gone and that under this Bill a clean manly effort will be made to fill the gap <Col N="670" /> and give justice to the survivors&mdash;there are not many.</P>
      <P>I would also make an appeal to have these pensions retrospective.  There are men who have suffered a grievance over the past 25 years in poor miserable circumstances. Most of the men who fought were the sons of poor workers and small farmers who never had much of this world's goods and who have not much of this world's goods to-day.  It is only right that we should vindicate them.  I agree with Deputy Collins and other speakers who said that this Bill will not remedy the injustice unless there is a proper definition of &ldquo;active service&rdquo;.  That was one of the cruxes over the past 25 years.  If it were defined I am satisfied that justice would be done to many men who gave active service.  I know men who were not in major operations but who blocked roads, cut trees, carried despatches and had lorries ready for their leaders but who were put down as not having been on active service and were deprived of their pensions.  That is a desperately mean state of affairs and I hope that the Minister will rectify it at the earliest opportunity for otherwise he will have endless trouble.  A large number of men will apply under this Bill and unless that point is defined he will be in as bad a way as the last Government were.  Men who should have got pensions before will come up with the same evidence as they gave at the last court.  They cannot produce new facts.  They will give the same evidence of service as they gave when they were turned down and they will be turned down again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no use in people insulting the Old I.R.A. by dragging them up to Dublin and asking them to wait upon a board if we are not going to do something definite and get down to brass tacks about it.  I am satisfied that we have been humiliated over 25 or 30 years.  I could never find out exactly how many men fought in this country but it is a small number and not the huge number who have applied for pensions.  The first Government is the cause of all that trouble because they did not define the period as being from 1916 to 1921.  From 1921 on we were paid in the regular Army and <Col N="671" /> the men who fought and were called the Irregulars made well by robbing banks and shops so that the people on each side on the Civil War were well paid.</P>

      <P>If it is insulting I will withdraw it.  But is it not a fact that the men who fought at that time walked up to banks with guns in their hands and got away with the swag and the money?  The Minister has promised the Old I.R.A. that he will see justice done and I know that he is a man with a big enough heart to see that justice will be done.</P>
      <P>The old Cumann na mBan are also people who got very little justice. There is a vast number of them who gave far more service to the cause of freedom by the valuable work they did than many who got pensions although they did not carry guns.  They went through the streets of Dublin and many of them were forgotten when the work was over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As has been pointed out, the Old I.R.A. organisations in the country could do important work in finding out <Col N="672" /> what people are entitled to.  We have an active Old I.R.A. organisation in my part of the country which brings together members of the Old I.R.A. from all sides.  We sit in council and are happy and content to forget politics and these people want to help to remedy the grievances of those who are left.  We in County Meath can get proper evidence to see that justice is done.  That is the type of men who should get the evidence, the officers and men who knew the men concerned in the past.</P>
    <P>It is very hard to ask a man who cannot write his name, a poor country gám as he is called, to come up to Dublin. He hardly knows his way to Griffith Barracks and when he gets there he is asked to wait at the gate shivering.  He stumbles at the first question and flops at the second.  He goes home and waits for two or three days and then he is told that the Act does not apply to him whereas if he could bring these men up with him to give evidence, evidence on oath, he would get his pension. A poor man is confronted by legal luminaries and you know what any poor devil is when he comes before legal luminaries, he is not what he would like to be.  If he wishes justice to be done the Minister will have to get this administered in such a way that surviving officers of the Old I.R.A. can give evidence.  If he cannot do this there is no use in calling those unfortunate people up before a board here because they are going to flounder. Those people do not remember the day and date they gave their service.  They are 50, 60 or 70 years of age now waiting to hop into their graves and are glad that that day is coming because they get little justice while they are living.  I hope that this is the last time we will have to stand in this House to ask for justice.  The first Government failed, the second Government failed and I hope that the third Government which is a combination of all the brains in the country will not fail.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised at the Minister's statement that the greater portion of the money which will probably be spent as a result of this Pensions <Col N="673" /> Bill will go to men who had never applied under any previous Act.  If that is the case, it seems to me that they must be all generals.  From my experience, I think the Minister need not be so worried about the number of men who could apply and qualify and who have never applied under any other Pensions Act.  This country is full of heroes, generals who did everything, whose reputations in their own districts are magnificent as soldiers, but who will not take the chance of going before a pensions board which would investigate their claims.  The Minister need not be worried about those at all.</P>
      <P>I would not intervene in this debate were it not for some statements that were made by some advocates of the I.R.A. claims.  An attack was made here on the brigade committees which were formed to try to help with the administration of the 1934 Act.  That Act could not be administered if those brigade committees were not set up. The men of those committees collated records, they collected evidence, they gave evidence before the board, without prejudice against those who were their friends or those who were their enemies.  Those brigade committees were formed in true democratic fashion, as a result of the calling of conventions publicly, where delegates were appointed by each company and where the men finally selected were the choice of those with whom they served during the period of hostilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do say, Sir, that the 1934 Act could not have been administered without the help of those men.  I have had to certify specifically for one brigade and in special cases for many brigades; and I have no objection to those cases for which I gave evidence being held in the open, and I have not the shadow of an objection to the presenting by the Minister to any applicant of any evidence that has been given by me in any of those cases.  And what I say can be said also on behalf of every certifying officer whom I know.  I think it was Deputy Colley who said that men who had parted in 1922 forgot any enmities that might have remained in 1934 and, irrespective of the side they took in 1922, gave straightforward and <Col N="674" /> fair evidence in regard to any particular applicant.</P>
    <P>I do not see how the Minister is going to extend the area of successful applicants if there is not some change in the administration.  At one particular time during the period when the 1934 Act was being administered, there was a demand for a brigade record and I know one brigade which supplied that record.  I wonder how many more did so.  I suggest that no Pensions Act can be properly applied without the submission of a brigade record by every brigade.  I do hold that where any success attended the efforts of a brigade in 1920 or 1921, a good deal of the success depended on the battalion commandants and on company captains; and in a brigade area where, during every week from September, 1920 to July 11th, 1921, a major attack was made on the British, then surely in that brigade area the company captains and the battalion commandants were entitled to be regarded as on active service?  I think that there might be some reference, by whatever administrative committee is set up, to some words at least spoken in this House in regard to the question of administration and the records of men and the records of the brigades.  I have listened to one Deputy talking about a man who did not qualify for a pension although he was 1,000 yards away from an ambush with a shotgun.  He was like Mr. Dooley, 3,000 miles behind the guns and wishing to God he was 3,000 more.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite possible that a man unused to cross-examination, unused to debate, might make a foolish statement which would be in line with that comment; and if it were not for the certifying officers who tried to correct those statements, irrespective of what the man's political opinions were and what theirs were, there would be far fewer getting pensions to-day.  I do not think it would be helpful to have cases heard in the open. I have not a shadow of objection to their being held so, but I think the <Col N="675" /> persons most embarrassed by the open confession would be the particular applicant himself and not so much the certifying officers.  Whatever the results of this Pensions Bill may be, I hope that no Deputy on any side of the House will be getting up here and asking for the names and addresses of the poor devils who were successful in getting pensions.  I cannot see the Minister telling the Referee or the administration board how they shall decide.  I do not think any Minister of any Government here would like to do that.  We have, in the Land Acts, Section 6 of the 1933 Act specifically taking out of the hands of the Minister any authority to do certain things.  In the same way in this Act, as in all the Pensions Acts, the Minister must give away any authority of administration or decision.  If he did not do so, it would be quite dishonest and there would be no use in blaming the Minister afterwards for the success or otherwise of the Act.</P>
      <P>I disagree also with the statement made in relation to the composition of the board, that it should be composed merely of members of the I.R.A., men who had service and knowledge of the I.R.A.  I think it would be wise also to have on that board men who are by their experience capable of interpreting legislation and familiar with legislation because, if they are not there, certainly, as one I.R.A. man, I would not like to be a member of the board.  I know what would happen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. B. Maguire Mr. B. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is welcomed by every part of the House, which indicates a feeling that it is a necessary attempt to apply the elements of justice to the various applicants who were unsuccessful, under previous Acts, in sustaining claims before the various boards that had been set up.  There has been a great deal of discontent amongst the general public who recognised that many people who were well known to have played their part in the war periods were refused pensions while others in the same locality received some reward.  That feeling of discontent has been manifest in many ways and indicates that the general public advocate the general <Col N="676" /> application of justice.  Where they see injustice in operation, no matter what the authority or administration may be, they show resentment.  Therefore, the present Bill is welcomed by all. Various hopes are held out that it will to a large extent remedy the existing faults.</P>
      <P>Personally, I feel the approach is very narrow.  I believe that the Minister has done serious injury to this Bill as an instrument by which successful results would ultimately be attained by indicating, as his estimate of the cost, £50,000 approximately, and, as his estimate of the number of successful applicants, approximately 2,000.  That would indicate to the board that is to be set up the manner in which the Minister intends them to interpret the Bill.  That is a great mistake.  I do not think the Minister had any right whatever to prescribe the limits.  That statement will be interpreted by the board as the manner in which they are to administer the Act.  I cannot see that the Minister had any right to make that statement.  I am sure he went through the files and read the various applications that had already been before the various boards with a view to arriving at an estimate of the number who could sustain a claim under the new Bill.  We must, therefore, assume that it is intended that the new Act will be interpreted on the same basis as previous Acts had been interpreted, and that border-line cases, to which the ex-Minister referred, will be brought within its scope.  He indicated that there were some 2,000 or 3,000 border-line cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that be the purpose of this Bill, it is a hopeless effort and it would have been better if it had never been introduced. If there is to be a limit prescribed by the Minister to the number of people who may succeed and the amount of expense involved, then the whole thing is largely a farce.  It would have been much better if the Minister or the Government had decided to deal with the applicants on the basis of their applications already before the various boards and decide once and for all that that number of border-line cases would be given some reward or other.  Personally, I am convinced <Col N="677" /> that the introductory statement by the Minister has injured the Bill in advance.  I would suggest that he should take the earliest opportunity of withdrawing that limitation.  No individual can determine who is entitled to a pension.  It is for the court or referee or whatever body is set up to decide who shall be entitled to a pension and who shall not.  If there is to be a long process over the next year or years and if it is the Minister's intention that about 2,000 people shall benefit, we can only assume that the purpose of this Bill is much the same as the purpose of previous Acts, that it is intended as political propaganda to hold the people in anticipation over a period of years and thereby to have influence over those people.  If that be the purpose, and it has that implication as it stands now, then it is a disgraceful piece of legislation.  There should be no attempt on the part of any Minister to determine in advance what the commission appointed by him should decide.</P>

    <Title>Private Deputies' Business - Derating of Agricultural Land&mdash;Motion.</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That in order to secure a more equitable system of financing local administration and to promote increased employment and production, Dáil Éireann is of opinion that agricultural land should be completely derated and, furthermore, that rates on houses and other property should be stabilised at a moderate and reasonable level.  &mdash;(Deputies Cogan and P. O'Reilly).</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>When speaking last week, I indicated that, in my opinion, the motion before the House comes at an opportune time.  From every portion of the land at the moment, we hear strong complaints about the increasing burden of rates.  I do not think that at any time for a long period have people generally been more alarmed about the position than they are at present.  I asked the Minister to-day if he could state in respect of the past ten years the average rate in the £ in all county council areas, in all county boroughs and in all urban districts and he gave me a complete list of figures which shows that, in the county council <Col N="679" /> areas, since 1941, rates have risen from 13/- in the £ to 23/-; in the urban districts, from 19/1 to 29/11; and in the county boroughs, from 22/5 to 30/4.  If we average these three figures, we find that the average rate for this State to-day is 27/9 in the £, as compared with 8/4 in 1932.</P>
      <P>While some Deputies may say that there have been many changes in the world since 1932 and perhaps in the extent of local services generally, it is significant to compare the average rate of 27/9 in the £ for the Twenty-Six Counties of the Irish Republic, with the average rate in the six excluded counties, which is 12/- in the £.  I have made inquiries with a view to finding out if there has been any substantial increase in the valuation of the Six County area and I have found that there has been only a very slight increase in the total valuation of the Six County area.</P>
      <P>It is true that there has been a substantial increase in the valuation of property other than land in the Six Counties, but the total poor law valuation of the Six County area has only slightly increased as compared with 1935.  As we know, agricultural land has been completely struck off the list of rateable valuations in that area, and thus we find that the figure of 12/- in the £ in the Six County area is a figure comparable with the figure of 27/9 in the Republic of Ireland.  I made investigations to find out what rates were payable in some centres on the other side of the water and I find that in Edinburgh, which is a very well run city, the rate is 8/6 in the £, while the rateable valuation has not very substantially increased as compared with the pre-war years.  We find, therefore, a rather extraordinary position arising here, a position which ought to be remedied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make it clear, as there seems to be some misunderstanding, that this motion is not only a motion to secure the derating of agricultural land but a motion to secure that a ceiling be fixed to rates on other rateable property.  I believe that the time has come when such a ceiling should be fixed, and, even if the House does not agree to the complete derating of <Col N="680" /> agricultural land, it should at least agree to the fixing of a statutory limit beyond which rates may not be increased. There are people who say that local authorities cannot keep down the rates.  They can, by the exercise of rigid economy, bring about various reductions.  We have to face the fact that all the efforts of local authorities to reduce the rate burden may be completely frustrated by measures taken by the Government to increase the liabilities of the local authorities and thereby force them to increase their rates.</P>
    <P>I want to establish, first, the important fact that rates have increased enormously and are still showing a tendency to increase.  I want to establish the fact that rates in this State are higher than in adjoining States and to establish the fact that the rate burden is an excessive and crushing one.  I will give a figure submitted to me by a farmer in this State, and in this connection I may mention that I have received hundreds of letters from ratepayers in urban and rural areas.  This farmer says that the rate he paid on his farm in 1914 was £27 and that the rate he is paying now in 1949 is £120 That is a typical instance of the manner in which rates have increased.</P>
    <P>There is also the very important consideration that the whole basis on which rates are assessed is entirely antiquated and inequitable.  As we know, the Griffith valuation was taken in 1852 and was based, so far as agricultural valuations were concerned, upon the value of the crops grown in that area.  A holding on which wheat was grown extensively in that year was valued at a very high figure, because in that year wheat commanded a high price.  The result is that there is great inequality as between valuations in one area and another.  In portions of my constituency, the valuations of some low-lying portions of land adjoining the sea coast are excessively high, probably because wheat was grown in these areas when the valuations were taken. I have a letter from a woman in County Limerick, and&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is quite <Col N="681" /> right when he suggests she is a widow, because the letter is written on mourning notepaper.  In this letter, she says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I have 28 Irish acres of wet land...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It may be in the Golden Vale, but it is apparently wet.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...and the valuation is £125 on the land.  There must be some mistake. I have appealed again and again, but I could not change the Griffith valuation.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is true&mdash;the Griffith valuation is fixed and unalterable and cannot be changed, so far as land is concerned.</P>
      <P>When we consider all those anomalies and injustices, surely we ought to realise that the time has come to face up to this problem in a bold and resolute way.  Since I came in to this House in 1938, I have in every Dáil of which I was a member, introduced a motion for the purpose of securing relief in the rates on agricultural land. In every Dáil that motion has been defeated. It has been defeated mainly by the votes of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

      <P>I want to make it clear that on the last occasion, when a motion similar to this was before the House, it was supported by members of the present Government.  I am in the rather difficult position that I do not know, unlike Deputy Allen who appears to be well-informed, what is the attitude of the Government to this motion.  For all I know, they may be accepting it as it is, or they may be accepting one of the amendments tabled to this motion.  An amendment has been tabled by the Clann na Talmhan Party which goes a considerable distance towards meeting the demands made in this motion and, so far as I know, it may be the decision of the Government to accept that amendment.  However, we have again got to wait and see.  All I can do now is to state the case in favour of the motion and to leave it to the wisdom of Deputies of all Parties to decide the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="682" /> As we know, this whole matter of valuations has been a vexed question in this country for a long time.  So far as the agricultural community is concerned it has been a particularly grave issue since agricultural land was first derated in Great Britain and in the Six Counties in 1928.  As we know, at that time a Derating Commission was set up by the then Government here, a commission composed mainly of professional men who, apparently, had their minds made up before they ever met that they were not going to hear the case put up for the derating of agricultural land.  Reading through the report of the commission, one is amazed, not so much at their stupidity as at their assumption that the people of this country were absolutely stupid.</P>
    <P>They stated that the fact that agricultural land was derated in Great Britain did not establish a case for derating here because the standard of wages in agriculture in Great Britain was much higher than here.  Was not that in itself an admission that the whole standard of living in agriculture here was lower than in Great Britain and, therefore, was not the case even more urgent for some relief to be given here?</P>
    <P>There are people, of course, who say that agriculture is now prosperous. There has been a lot of bellowing and blowing about the prosperity of agriculture but the hard fact remains that if you take the total net agricultural income, which is a little over £100,000,000 and divide it between the number of people engaged in agriculture, you find that the average income per person working in the industry is little more than £3 per week.  That does not indicate that there is such an enormous surplus wealth amongst the agricultural community and in order to show how unfair the present valuation system is towards the agricultural community you have got to make certain comparisons.  Take for example a small holding with a £20 valuation.  It is just barely able to support a family and during periods of depression I would say it is unable to do so.  Take a business house with the same poor law valuation, and you will find that it is capable of producing a substantial <Col N="683" /> income.  That is one comparision that should be of interest to the House.</P>
    <P>If you think that that is only an isolated case, take the total valuation of all agricultural property in this State and compare it with the total poor law valuation of all property in this State.  What do you find?  You find that the total rateable valuation of agricultural land and buildings is about 65 per cent. of the total valuation of all property in this State while the income of the agricultural section of the community is only one-third of the total income of all people in the State. Therefore, if valuations had any relation at all to income, the valuation of agricultural property should be not more than one-third of the total valuation of the country.  These are facts which cannot be questioned or disputed. They are facts which should be considered seriously by this House. This is not a House dominated by one Party, having a machined majority for all purposes.  It is a free assembly in which every Deputy can use his own judgment and intelligence to decide questions of this kind on their merits.</P>
    <P>I want now to dispel an illusion which seems to hover in the minds of some people in regard to the agricultural grant.  There are people who say that the agricultural grant is a subsidy to agriculture, that it is a gift given by the general taxpayer towards agricultural ratepayers as against all other ratepayers.</P>
    <P>Even in the last couple of weeks the Minister for Agriculture went down to my constituency, of all places in the world, and told the farmers that they were paying only two-fifths of their proper rate.  He overlooked the fact, of course, that the three-fifths rebate is extended only to the first £20 of valuation. He overlooked the fact that agricultural valuations are in many cases out of all proportion to what they should be.  He overlooked the fact that the agricultural grant was never instituted as a relief for agriculture but in order to meet the deficit caused by the wiping out of the landlords who formerly paid a substantial portion of the rates in rural Ireland.  I think that Deputies who are reasonable and fair <Col N="684" /> will admit that there is a case for the relief of rates on agricultural land. There is a case for fixing a ceiling beyond which the rates may not be increased on property and there is definitely need for a general review of the whole system on which rates are levied and assessed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hickey has asked a question as to where the money is to come from in order to finance this relief of rates on agricultural and other property. My answer to that question is to quote what happened back in 1928.  In 1928, when a demand for the relief of rates on agricultural land was made, the then Minister for Finance pointed out that it would cost £2,000,000 to wipe out the rates on agricultural land here as in the Six Counties and Great Britain and he asked:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where is that £2,000,000 to come from?  General taxation has already reached the point of £25,000,000 a year.  We cannot increase that amount.  We cannot find the additional £2,000,000 to relieve the rates without crushing the general taxpayer completely out of existence.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>But the fact remains and cannot be questioned that since 1928 the burden of general taxation has increased, not by £2,000,000, but by £50,000,000 and the agricultural community are still waiting for the small measure of relief which they begged for in 1928.</P>
    <P>We have the fact that every Party that was in opposition since 1928 has always pledged themselves, while in opposition, to derate agricultural land. Even the Minister for Agriculture at one time strongly advocated that agricultural land should be derated.  It is asked: where is the money to come from?  Is it not clear that £77,000,000 is an excessive expenditure for the whole country?  If we had £10,000,000 for rates levied, I suppose there is something in the region of £85,000,000 or £86,000,000 expended by the central Government and the local authorities. Surely there is need for some economy in that expenditure.  We have heard of efforts being made in other countries to introduce some measure of efficiency in Government Departments so as to cut down expenditure.  Even the British Government have been making <Col N="685" /> some attempt in that direction.  In other countries also various types of machinery have been set up to eliminate waste as far as possible and to cut down expenditure.</P>
    <P>I anticipate that if a reasonable effort is made to secure economies in all Government Departments and services it will be possible to effect a saving of £2,000,000 or £3,000,000 or perhaps £4,000,000 and that would be sufficient to provide the relief asked for in this motion.  Therefore it will not be a question of passing the burden on to some other section of the community. It will be simply a matter of applying the benefit of economies to the relief of direct taxation upon the ratepaying community.  It must be remembered that rates are an objectionable tax, particularly when they are excessive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>An amendment has been put down to this motion which seeks to fix a maximum of 7/6 in the £ for rates on agricultural land.  I think that is a reasonable approach to the problem and I welcome that amendment.  As I was saying, there is an urgent need for a reduction of this burden.  Some Deputies said agricultural workers and workers generally pay rates.  Of course they do pay rates and already they are beginning to feel that the burden is becoming excessive.  I was at a county council meeting yesterday when attention was drawn to that particular problem.  Therefore, I think, having regard to all the circumstances, <Col N="686" /> to the fact that there is no question of passing the burden on to some other section of the community, to the fact that this demand has been before the country for a long time and that the relief has been promised by every political Party when in opposition, with the exception I think of the Labour Party, it is time that these pledges should be honoured.</P>
      <P>I do not know what the attitude of the Government will be towards this motion, but I trust that they will take all the relevant facts into consideration and meet this demand in a just and equitable manner.  I have already indicated that, while people may say that the position of agriculture is much better than it was ten or 15 years ago when conditions were at their worst, there is no ground for assuming that the agricultural community generally are enjoying an excessive income.  Therefore I think that on that ground there will be no opposition to this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I conclude, I should like to stress the fact that I do not pretend that this motion, or even the acceptance of one or other of the amendments will settle this question.  There is need for a general review of the whole position under which rates are levied.  It is a source of astonishment to me that, while this particular woman in County Limerick is paying £128 a year on 28 acres of land, we have people owning ground rents on buildings in the centre of this city who are not called upon to pay any rates although they extract very high ground rents from these premises.  Therefore, I say there is need for a general review and an inquiry into this question. There is also need to bear in mind that, as I said a few minutes ago, rates press very heavily upon the community generally.  They are a direct tax upon the homes and the lands of our people. They are not an optional tax, a tax which can be evaded in any way, except a person is prepared to live on the side of the road like a travelling tinker.  Everybody who owns a home, whether large or small, is called upon to pay rates.  Therefore, it is urgently necessary that the rates should be fair and just.  It is the duty of a Government in any country, and particularly <Col N="687" /> in a country which claims to be a highly civilised and truly Christian country, to encourage as many people as possible to own their own homes in which to rear their families and to seek to improve their homes in every possible way.</P>
    <P>The position at the present time is that any person who carries out an improvement to his home, his premises, his out-offices or whatever it may be, is subject to an increase in his valuation and to an increased rate.  That is a continuation of the old landlord system under which the land agent drove through the country and, wherever he saw that a homestead had been improved, he immediately set down the name of the owner and in due course increased the rent.  We have the same situation perpetuated to-day where every improvement carried out by a citizen to his home makes him liable to an increase in his valuation and a consequent increase in the rates that he has to pay.  Therefore, I say that, from every point of view, there is need for the House to meet this motion in a fair and reasonable way, and I am hopeful that it will be accepted without a division.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOReilly" hpid="Mr. P. O'Reilly Mr. P. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion.  I do not propose to go into details but just to make a few points on the broad principles underlying the proposal.  In order to do so, I must resort to comparisions.  Very often, when that is done, there is resentment. Nevertheless, I submit it is the only way by which we can arrive at comparative values.  Agriculture bears this charge on its industry at the source, a charge that must be paid regardless of whether agriculture yields a profit to the agricultural producer or not.  The farming community is encouraged to produce chiefly cattle, pigs and poultry and their products for export. I cannot say they are compelled to do it, but, nevertheless, they are encouraged to do it.  It is taken that they will increase production to that point where there will be a surplus for export in order to make up the balance required to meet the payments for necessary imports.  But in exporting their farm produce they very often, <Col N="688" /> not alone have to meet the competition of the foreigner but, in the case of exports to Great Britain, they are faced with the competition of farmers who have derating both in Britain and across the Border.  Therefore, farmers here are at a great disadvantage. Industrial workers and those who run industrial concerns are protected up to the hilt against all competition.  This is done with a view to securing, first of all, profits for industry and, secondly, a good income and living conditions for the workers engaged in industry.  Why is it necessary to protect industry from reasonable competition and at the same time expose agriculture to unreasonable competition?  That is the comparison I make for the purpose of assessing comparative values.</P>
      <P>There is another point that can be said in favour of the manufacturer, the tradesman, artisan or even business man, that when you put any charge on him he can put it down as part of his costs of production and pass it on to the last man.  The last man, unfortunately, is the farmer who must produce for export.  He has no one else to shove it on to.  The foreigner will not pay it.  For instance, if any charges are increased on the blacksmith, he has only to put it on to the farmer in the charge he makes for a set of shoes for the farmer's horses or to the cost of repairing a plough.  Who will the farmer put it on to?  No one will pay for him.  Is that fair?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another comparison that I want to make as regards the unfair conditions that the agricultural producer labours under.  The levying of rates on land in rural Ireland in recent years tends to have no relation to the area from which the rates are collected. So far as the contributions of rates towards the building and construction of roads are concerned they have very little relation to the area from which the rates are collected.  We have long-distance travelling by cars, lorries and buses, but no one can say that the rates in any particular county are properly related to and are being expended on the roads, particularly when the roads are being used by people from all over the country and <Col N="689" /> also by foreigners.  In that case alone the rates are not being used for local purposes.</P>
    <P>Take, for instance, the third-class roads of the country.  I say without fear of contradiction that they are a disgrace.  The condition in which those roads are kept is a disgrace so far as the farmers living in backward areas of the country are concerned.  They have not a good road to their farms or to their homes.  Therefore, while the farmer has to pay rates to provide good roads for people in very much better circumstances than himself, he cannot have a good road to his own farm or home, and there is no prospect of any great improvement in that respect in the future.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to go any further except to make these few remarks and to commend this motion to the House. I would not regard its acceptance as a concession.  I regard it as a right.  It will not be a big advantage to the farmer or to the farming community generally. We all know that money can be found for any and every scheme unless one that will make any attempt to increases the income of or reduce the charges on the agricultural industry. We have often heard it said that the people in the North cannot be expected to come in with us unless the social services which they enjoy are equalled here, and that the income of workers here should at last be so good as to encourage Irish workers to come back from Great Britain.  Why on earth cannot the same conditions be given to those working in agriculture as everyone is quite happy to provide for those in industry?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.D. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the amendment to the motion standing in my name:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after the word &ldquo;That&rdquo; in the first line and substitute the words:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;having regard to the progressive increase in the rate demand and its <Col N="690" /> adverse effect on agricultural production, Dáil Éireann is of the opinion that the rates on agricultural land should be a fixed annual charge of not more than 7/6 in the £ on the valuation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In doing so I want to say that I cannot support the motion proposed by Deputy Cogan because I believe that complete derating might have an adverse effect on some of the agricultural community who are the principal producers of the natural wealth, and who would have to pay taxes in some other way.  I also feel that there is no use in asking for complete derating in this House, having regard to the fact that Fianna Fáil, when they were in Government, proved that they could not and would not support a policy of derating.  I think that a number of Deputies on this side of the House are not in favour of derating either.</P>
    <P>I think the amendment, which seeks to stabilise the rates at not more than 7/6 in the £, is a reasonable proposition to put before the House.  I think it is a proposition that should be supported by all Parties.  It is very important, at this stage, when local taxation has reached such a height, that some effort should be made to curb expenditure in that particular direction. We know that local authorities have been compelled by Ministers' edicts or mandatory orders to increase the rates. They have been compelled to do that, partly by legislation introduced by the last Administration and partly by instructions sent down within more recent times.  I believe that as long as Ministers can send down instructions to local authorities to increase rates and get the local people to find the money, they can afford to be very decent, whereas if they had to put up a case to their Minister for Finance, they probably would not be as generous as they are with the ratepayers' money.</P>
    <P>There is another reason why some ceiling should be put on the rates, and that is because Fianna Fáil, for political expediency, decided to give additional votes at the local elections and allow people who were not ratepayers to elect the county councils. The position now is that on the register <Col N="691" /> for the election of county councils the majority of those who have votes are non-ratepayers and it is possible at the moment to have a county council elected by non-ratepayers to spend the ratepayers' money.</P>

      <P>There is another reason why the rural community must feel worried and that is that in the near future everybody who employs two or three men will be compelled to pay an additional 7/- or 10/6 a week to provide for other services.  That will be an additional charge and it is something that the industry, to my mind, cannot afford.</P>
      <P>A good deal has been said about agriculture being prosperous.  Agriculture is reasonably prosperous at the moment, but we know what happened during the first post-war period.  Rates and taxes and all the other expenses that the agricultural community have to bear increased and, following that, everything the agricultural producer was producing went down in price. We have indications of that already. We know that the price of pigs is less to-day than it was last June.  We know there are other commodities falling in price.  We know the aim of every Government in the world is to cut down the cost of living, and cutting down the cost of living means giving the farmers less for the essential commodities they are producing and letting the producers of luxury goods get away with whatever they like.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that Deputy Corry has another amendment.  He must have been at an auction at one time.  I had my amendment on the paper for some weeks and Deputy Corry, being a very sound politician, decided to bid and <Col N="692" /> he put in an amendment asking that the rates be 6/- in the £.  My proposal is a serious one and a reasonable one and a sensible one.  It will not bear unduly on any section of the community and it will make those at the head of affairs act more cautiously in the spending of the ratepayers' money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephHallide" hpid="Mr. Halliden Mr. Halliden">

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the amendment standing in my name:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after the word &ldquo;That&rdquo; in the first line and substitute the words:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;having regard to the enormous increase in the rate demand and to the low prices of farm produce, Dáil Éireann is of opinion that the rates on agricultural land should be stabilised at not more than 6/- in the £ on the valuation.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am sure that in this matter we are only pushing the open door.  In the Parliamentary Debates of February 6th, 1946, there was a motion moved by Deputy Cogan&mdash;I must admire his courage and perseverance&mdash;and that motion was to this effect:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that in order to secure a more equitable distribution of the burden of local rates, and to promote increased employment on the land, legislation should be introduced providing for complete derating of the first £20 of the poor law valuation of each farm and the further total derating of each additional £15 of the poor law valuation in respect of each adult worker employed on the holding; and that the deficit be made good from the Exchequer.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That motion was proposed by Deputy Cogan and supported by Deputy Halliden.  When I turn over a few pages I come to the division list and I find&mdash;and this is what makes me say I am only pushing the open door&mdash;the name of the present Taoiseach, Mr. J. A. Costello, and also the name of the Minister for Lands, Mr. Blowick.  I am sure that they will realise that if <Col N="693" /> there was a necessity for derating when the rates were at that time, on a poor law valuation under £20, roughly 4/3 in the £, and they are now 11/-, there is far more necessity for derating to-day.</P>
    <P>Then Deputy Lehane comes along and complains.  It is rather amusing to hear him complain about the Managerial Acts and the bad Acts of Fianna Fáil.  I will read some of the reasons why I consider that those who call the tune should pay the piper.  I am very glad the Minister for Health is here.  The first document I am going to read is a letter from the Minister for Health to the South Cork Board of Public Assistance on 24/8/48.  When you hear of dictatorships it is as well to know the manner in which officials of local authorities are no longer the officials of those local authorities but are apparently the officials of the Department here.  Here is the first letter:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am directed by the Minister for Health to state that he has had under consideration proposals from local authorities for the payment of a bonus to meet the increased cost of living to officers and employees engaged on duties under the health services administered by such authorities.</P>
    <P>The Minister approves of the payment to officers and servants, other than agricultural workers in respect of whom he is the appropriate Minister, and whose remuneration (including emoluments) does not exceed £350 a year of a temporary bonus at the rates set out hereunder, where the local authority have indicated their willingness to provide the necessary funds.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then there is a long list which I will not inflict on the House because I do not think it would be fair to do so. That letter cost us £4,992 4s.</P>

      <P>The next letter from the Minister for Health is dated 27/11/48, another order in connection with female officers and servants.  That cost £2,970.  This is on a small area, one-third of the Cork County Council area.</P>
      <P>I come then to the Minister who is in charge of the Department of Local Government.  The Minister for that Department gave us a nice little lesson on the 18th December, 1948, when he sent us a letter stating:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I am directed by the Minister for Local Government that, following the decision to grant increases in the remuneration of civil servants, it is considered desirable to notify local authorities of the limits within which increases can be granted in the remuneration of their officers.  This notification, it should be understood, applies only to officers whose remuneration is subject to the sanction of the Minister for Local Government.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We have three Ministers now in the board of assistance.  The Minister for Local Government's excursion cost us £247.  The next round played by the Minister for Local Government was on the 30th April, 1949:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I am directed by the Minister for Local Government to refer to this Department's circular letter in regard to temporary increases in remuneration to certain classes of officers and to say that the sanction of the Minister may be presumed where the Manager, after consultation with the council, decides to grant temporary increases.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That cost us £563.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then, the Minister for Health decided that the Minister for Local Government was getting away with something and he went on the warpath again on the 3rd August, 1949.  He <Col N="695" /> sent down a letter on the question of the amount of bonus he had under consideration to be paid as from 1st November, 1948, to officers and servants of local authorities.  That was the third letter in regard to bonuses in a period of 12 months.  That letter cost us £2,712.  Not to be outdone, the Minister for Social Welfare then entered upon the scene.  On the 1st June, 1948, he sent us a letter in reference to previous correspondence in regard to the salaries of home assistance officers; this letter evidently was not the first shot in the locker.  That little excursion of his cost us £3,444.</P>
    <P>When the Minister for Local Government saw the Minister for Social Welfare getting away with that, he went on the warpath once more and at the end of August, 1949, he wrote about the superannuation allowances of certain officials and he said that all those who retired before 1st July, 1943, should have their allowances increased as from the current date.  He made a rather amazing statement.  He presumed legislation in this House because he went on to say that on the 13th ultimo &mdash;that would be in the previous July&mdash; the Dáil gave a First Reading to the Increases in Superannuation Bill, under which power was sought to enable increases to be given to pensioners of the State and pensioners of local authorities.  The letter further states: &ldquo;Although the Bill cannot be enacted before the Autumn, it has been decided that, in order to relieve hardship, increases in pensions can be granted in advance.&rdquo;  That only costs us £747 because this was the 8th August and the Bill had not been passed.  Briefly, that is a short summary of the history of one local authority.  The total amount of the advances that had to be made was £15,635.  That is something more than 1/- in the £ on the valuation in South Cork.  At the time when the Taoiseach considered that farmers should be derated on the first £20 of their valuation and on every £15 thereafter for every man they employed, the net expenditure in that area was £175,606.  It is now £260,143.  Surely, there is more need now to relieve the burdens on the farmers than there was <Col N="696" /> in 1946.  Surely, there is more need now for some kind of stabilisation so that the farmer may know what his commitments are likely to be.  I do not intend travelling over all the ground here, but I would like to point out that there has been no increase in the prices of agricultural produce since that £85,000 odd was clapped on to the backs of the ratepayers in South Cork. Deputy Lehane was very vocal up to 1947 on the uneconomic price of milk.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>That amendment was put down over a year ago when the rate was roughly 5/6 in the £.  The year it was put down rates had increased by a couple of shillings and I hit the medium between the two.  That was the sole reason I did it.  I considered that a farmer would be far better off if he knew exactly what his commitments were&mdash;if he knew definitely that, no matter which year it was, he would have so much in annuity to pay and so much in rates to pay instead of this jumping up of the rates year after year.  If a farmer succeeded in getting a grant amounting to £40 some years ago for the reconstruction of his house he now has a visit from two nice gentlemen and, in one case that I know of, the valuation on that house was increased from £3 a year to £9 15/- a year.  When you make that up at the present Cork rate of 25/- in the £, or thereabout, you know where you are.  The owner of that house has to pay roughly £11 4/- a year <i>in sæcula sæculorum</i> now for the £40 grant that he got in 1938 or 1939. As Deputy Cogan has said, it is bringing back exactly the position that tenants were in under the landlords&mdash; when you made an improvement in your holding your rent was increased. Apparently, if the farmer makes any improvement in his dwelling-house or out-offices the valuation is going to go up and he is going to pay through the nose for it.  It would not take long to collect, at the rate of £11 a year, the £40 grant he got from the terrible Fianna Fáil Government.  Whether or not it is an idea to prevent farmers from looking for farm reconstruction grants, or a grant for the improvement <Col N="699" /> of out-offices, I do not know, but every Deputy is aware of the number of complaints we have got in Cork County already.  The Government steps in now and sends down a new valuer.  That valuer comes along and says: &ldquo;You got a grant of £40 for reconstructing your house from the Fianna Fáil spendthrifts some years ago and you did so and so to the house.&rdquo; They go in with tapes and measures and measure the house.  They then come along and treble the valuation on that house.  Whether that is considered to be a fair position or not, I am drawing the attention of the responsible Minister to it now because I think it should stop.  I think it is unfair.</P>

He will give all the information about it because he is the man who made the complaint and, better still, it happened in his own case.  His valuation was trebled.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am moving an amendment for the stabilisation of rural rates.  I consider that when the Ministers who are responsible for the driving up of the rates have to shoulder the burden of the central authority they will be far more careful.  I, like Deputy Lehane, am not in favour of complete derating.  I think that the farmer should pay his share, but the burden that has been placed on the agricultural community&mdash;and I am not confining it to the present&mdash;is far too high. The figures in regard to the South Cork Board of Public Assistance expenditure were £149,000 in 1942; £175,000 in 1945-46; and for the last two years £260,000.  Those are the figures I would like the Minister to consider. To my mind the people of this country have to face up to the fact that in all human probability rates on agricultural land are going to go up again by 5/- to 10/- in the £ in the coming year.  There is no doubt about it and it is no good burking the fact.  The increases in salaries alone for the Cork Mental Hospital Committee will be between £32,000 and £37,000 a year. The position, I admit, will be covered by the provisions of Deputy Dr. Ryan's Health Act which is the only protection we have got at the present day against this gambling that has been going on, that is, competition between three Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In this House on 6th February, 1946, the Minister for Lands said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I was saying on the last occasion on which this motion was debated that the question of some kind of derating must be taken seriously into consideration in the very near future. <Col N="701" /> In most counties at present the estimates have been prepared and will be submitted to the various county councils. In every single case they show an increase in the rates.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If it was necessary in 1946 it is doubly necessary now.  On 1st February, 1946, the Minister for Lands stated in this House:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;No matter what Government speakers may say, the day is coming and coming soon, when something will have to be done in regard to the question of derating.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister had a vision that he would be in a position to enforce his demands for the farmers for whom he was speaking.  I suggest to him that he is in that position now.  I am seriously suggesting to the Minister that the time has arrived now for him to redeem the pledges he gave to the agricultural community in that statement.  I suggest that the time has arrived now for the Minister for Lands to go to the Taoiseach, who was of the same mind as himself on that happy occasion when they marched up arm in arm into the Lobby to vote for derating, and say to him: &ldquo;You come along with me now and give us that measure of derating we voted for in 1946; that the farmers are looking for and that I pledged myself to give.&rdquo;  The Minister for Lands would be in the happy position of redeeming one pledge and I would be in the happy position of having a very high opinion of him.  I have not a very bad opinion of him at present but if he does that it is another step.</P>

      <P>Deputy Halliden will have an opportunity before this is finished and Deputy Halliden can deal with how everybody voted on that occasion.  I suggest that this talk about prosperity among farmers&mdash;and we hear a lot of talk about it&mdash;is all moonshine. A lot of capital has been made here at times, particularly by people who are non-agriculturalists: &ldquo;Look at all the money the farmers have in the bank.&rdquo;  That is a very common practice among people here in the Dáil and elsewhere.  It has been thrown at us on previous derating motions.  Those people completely lose sight of the fact that any money a farmer has in the bank is not his own money at all.  It is the property of the sons and the daughters of the farmer who have been. working on that farm as unpaid labourers from the time they are 13 years of age generally until they are 40 or 45.  Whatever money was collected out of their unpaid labour is certainly their right and the farmer himself, to my mind, has no call whatever to it and no claim to it.  I am hoping that this motion will be seriously considered by the Cabinet and by the Ministers who, in their wholly irresponsible times, pledged themselves to this idea and voted for a bigger scheme of liberation than is contained in the motion or any of the amendments. Undoubtedly the complete derating of land up to the £20 valuation mark and the complete derating of each £15 afterwards for every able-bodied man working on the holding, is a far bigger measure of relief than the amendment proposed by Deputy Lehane or the amendment proposed by myself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I consider that, under those circumstances and in view of the largely increased burden that has fallen on the farmer since, when the Minister for Local Government gets up here to announce Government policy on this, he should tell us frankly that the Government has decided for either of the two amendments or for the motion itself.  If they baulk at giving us the motion itself, then either of the two amendments would do, as half a loaf is better than no bread.  Perhaps the knowledge that, when the rates are stabilised, any extra burden that they <Col N="703" /> cause on the rates by circulars of this description will have to be paid for by themselves, may have a deterring effect on their activities in that line.  I am anxious, as a farmer, to see some check on the placing of burdens of that kind, as undoubtedly it is going to become an unbearable burden on the farming community.  It is already almost an unbearable burden.</P>

      <P>If we had the pleasure of the Minister for Agriculture getting in here when he jumped up after Deputy O'Reilly sat down, I would have been perfectly satisfied to hear the Minister.  If the facts are succeeding in making Deputies over there shoulder their responsibility on this and in getting them to do their work, I am ready all the time to till the soil, to get this thing done.  I, Sir, am more than anxious to hear the views of, not the Minister for Agriculture, but the Minister for Local Government, who has responsibility on this matter.  I am more than anxious to hear his views and to hear from him the reasons why he put his portion of a burden of £15,000 down on one-third of Cork County this year.  I want to know why he went to the trouble of sending down to the local authorities in Cork, presuming legislation by this House, a Bill which had only passed the First Reading here.  Immediately <Col N="704" /> the First Reading was passed, he presumed that the Bill was going through and sent down an order which would place roughly £7,500 a year extra on the rates of Cork County.  These are serious matters, which we want dealt with by the responsible Minister.  We want to hear the Minister for Local Government on this, to know his views on it and the reasons for this increase.</P>
      <P>I have no intention of delaying the House.  I am sorry I delayed so long on it, but I had so many important matters to cover here.  I would like that we should get now, from the Minister or perhaps from the Minister for Lands or from the Taoiseach during the week, a statement on it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Corry, like the White Queen in <i>Through the Looking Glass,</i> believes in &ldquo;jam to-morrow and jam yesterday, but never jam to-day&rdquo;. Deputy Corry says&mdash;as reported in Vol. 99, col. 552, of the Official Debates&mdash; that 18 years ago he advocated derating, but on that particular day in 1946 he resolved to vote against it&mdash;yet now he is in favour of derating again!  The case is made that the rates are 22/7. The rates on agricultural land are 11/3¾d., taking the average struck on the land of the country as a whole.  I think the rates are too high.  I think they ought to be brought down and I am quite convinced that the people of this country are going to bring them down, in just the same way as they brought the taxes down&mdash;that is, they will put out the apostles of extravagance and then, having replaced present local administration by good administration with good county councillors, they will do as this Government did in taking the equivalent of £7,000,000 per annum off the taxes, while extending the scope of all public services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="705" /> Many believed that to be something beyond the capacity of the Government and I heard the Ministers who were sitting in this place two years ago declare that it was quite impossible to avoid the additional taxation that they then proposed, that it was quite impossible to extend the services further than they were already, and that all the additional taxes then proposed were necessary to service the existing services.  This Government, when it came into office, swept away £7,000,000 of that taxation and the services are still there.  It is the firm intention, when the local elections are held next year, to sweep out those who have run local taxation in many areas to extravagant heights and put in their places councillors who are prepared to do their duty, that is, to see that the rates levied are prudently paid out.</P>
    <P>There is in contemplation by the Minister for Local Government legislation to deal with local administration, which will be introduced into this House very shortly.  I believe that that legislation, combined with the kind of county councillors we are going to get, now that the rotten, corrupt political machine of Fianna Fáil has been destroyed in the country, will effectively reduce the rates in the right way.  If these remedies should fail, the resources of civilisation are not exhausted.</P>
    <P>Let us remember this, that I advocated derating again and again in this House when agriculture was not prosperous and when the farmers were well-nigh bankrupted by the rotten Government they had&mdash;but I do not think that the time is ripe for advocating it to-day.  We are in the position that the agricultural exports of this country in the year 1947 for nine months were £20,240,000 and in 1949, for the same nine months, they were £31,790,000&mdash;and they are still rising.  I can recall that in 1947 we had 579,000 acres of our land producing 1,463,000 barrels of wheat, while in 1949, 357,000 acres produced 2,400,000 barrels of wheat.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.D. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first time that I have been guilty of delaying the House on the Adjournment because I have a great deal of sympathy for the officials of the House.  It may seem to some Deputies that this is a small, frivolous matter.  I asked the Minister for Lands to-day whether he would state the reasons for the delay in carrying out the Minane Bridge reclamation scheme which had been before his Department for a very considerable time.  I got the following reply from the Minister:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;This work presents major engineering difficulties for which a final and adequate solution has not yet been approved.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am sure the House will forgive me when I tell them that this scheme has been before one or other Government Department since 1912 and has now become a very serious and acute problem.</P>
      <P>The position in this area is that the embankments that were put up years ago have been washed away by the incoming tides and the public road, the bridge, the parish Church are all in danger, of being undermined.  The position is so serious that some three or four years ago the Bishop of Cork volunteered to pay a certain sum to the Land Commission if they would undertake the work.  The county council, having regard to the serious effects it is having on bridges and roads in the area, also volunteered to pay a certain amount to the Land Commission if they would undertake this work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present Minister for Lands went down there and saw what was happening and agreed that it was an urgent problem and that the work should be undertaken immediately.  He said that to the residents there in my presence and in the presence of his officials. His predecessor, Deputy Moylan, went down there some years ago and he also told the people that he fully agreed that the matter required immediate attention.  This scheme would save valuable property.  It would save thousands of acres from being flooded and enable land that had <Col N="707" /> been flooded to be reclaimed.  While there are huge drainage schemes being carried out by other Departments&mdash;a £40,000,000 scheme under the Department of Agriculture and other drainage schemes under the Department of Local Government&mdash;this scheme for the Minane Bridge area has been hanging fire since 1912.</P>
    <P>Once upon a time when officials visited the area they met the parish priest, who said &ldquo;Are you from the Land Commission or the Board of Works, because I laugh when I hear of the Board of Works doing something but I howl when I hear of the Land Commission saying they are going to do something.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The position in this area is that a considerable amount of valuable land is going to waste.  The Church, bridges, roads and a number of houses are in immediate danger.  I want to know from the Minister what will be done.  I am not satisfied with the answer he has given us to-day.  I know the present Minister wants the work done.  I know the previous Minister wanted the work done.  I know the previous Minister did everything he could to get the work carried out, and I believe that is true also of the present Minister.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to tell us who or what is the fly in the ointment that is preventing this very important work from being carried out.  If it is a civil servant, cannot the Minister get rid of him?  If it is a bit of red tape, cannot the Minister cut that red tape?  If it requires legislation, why does not the Minister introduce the legislation to get rid of the official and the red tape? The position is extremely serious at the moment.  The people in the area feel that they have been played with by the Department over a number of years. It is particularly galling to them at the moment when they see places of much less importance being reclaimed and drained under other schemes.  They feel that it is a tragedy that they have been playing with Government Departments since 1912 and did not wait until the new drainage scheme was introduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Blowick)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to inform Deputy Lehane that it is neither red tape, an official nor lack of legislation that is the cause of what he alleges is delay.  I can quite understand Deputy Lehane's anxiety to have the job carried out.  I have seen this place and I am perfectly aware of the danger caused by the tide.  The erosion is coming perilously near some houses, the church, a bridge and a little village.</P>
      <P>The trouble there is that a barrage has to be erected right across what is really a mud flat.  There is no departmental delay.  Deputy Lehane has judged the situation very well when he says that I am anxious to get the job started.  I am.  There is no delay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Underlying a layer of sand, 18 to 20 inches deep, there is a depth of soft clay that would not provide a suitable foundation for the barrage that would be erected and that would have to stand up to the headwater that would come against it on the other side.  The engineers of the Department are doing their best to find a means of building an embankment strong enough to hold back the tide there but, so far, a similar problem has not arisen in any other part of the country from the experience of which they could benefit.  The site of the embankment or barrage and the erection of sluice gates forms a very risky problem.  The cost would run into at least £20,000.  Obviously, there is absolutely no use in erecting an embankment that might give way, on account of a bad foundation, perhaps the first time that a storm from the sea would pile up the tidal water higher than usual and put extra pressure on the embankment.  The foundation is really the cause of the trouble.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The repairing of the embankments along the river and restoring them to their former condition would, in my opinion, involve an expenditure that would not be justified.  If the Deputy and the people down there will have just a little patience, I have no doubt that some suitable method will be found of erecting an embankment there that will keep out the tide and be <Col N="709" /> strong enough to carry the sluice gates to hold back the river water until the tide goes down.</P>
    <P>There is no delay.  Borings have been made and further borings have to be carried out to ascertain exactly what is underneath and to find out if they can reach something solid on which a sound embankment can be built, an embankment which will not give way under pressure.  I want to assure the Deputy that I fully appreciate his anxiety, on behalf of his constituents, to get the work done.  That is the very laudable motive behind his raising the <Col N="710" /> question now.  There is, as I say, no undue delay, but I must sound this not of warning, that we must wait until we can be certain that we have got a suitable method of erecting an embankment, or that we have a foundation on which it can rest solidly.  I know that the Deputy would be the last person to ask me to spend £20,000 on something which might be torn away by the very first storm.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.45 p.m., until 3 p.m. on Thursday, 10th November, 1949.</P>
