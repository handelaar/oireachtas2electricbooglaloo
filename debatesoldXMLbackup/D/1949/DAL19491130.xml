    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state whether his attention has been drawn to Press reports alleging that Mr. Thomas Barry, Cork, stated at an anti-Partition meeting in the United States that the Irish Government has set aside £35,000,000 for the purchase of arms to be used in setting the problem of Partition, and whether he will make it clear that there is no foundation for such a statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the Press reports referred to in the Deputy's question.</P>
      <P>The statement attributed to Mr. Barry in those reports is entirely without foundation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder has the Taoiseach seen a statement of a somewhat similar nature published in this morning's papers to the effect that it is intended to arm 100,000 men here for a somewhat similar purpose, also made by Mr. Barry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that it is a pity that there is not £35,000,000 available for the settlement of the problem of Partition?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that a comment or a question?  In answer to Deputy O'Higgins, I have not seen the report he has referred to, but, equally with the other reports, it is entirely without foundation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not correct to say that Barry's statement, reported <Col N="1500" /> in the papers, was that if he had 35,000 volunteers he would settle the question of Partition?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the statement that I have seen.  The statement that I have seen is that £35,000,000 is available in this country to buy guns to fight for the Six Counties. That statement is entirely without foundation and one that might do us irreparable damage if it was not contradicted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether his attention has been directed to newspapers reports of a speech made by a Deputy in which criticism was made of the electoral system of proportional representation; and whether he will give an assurance that his Government will not seek leave to introduce any Bill to amend the Constitution in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen newspaper reports of the speech to which the Deputy evidently refers.</P>
      <P>The system of election of the members of Dáil Éireann by proportional representation, provided for in Article 16.2.5º of the Constitution, has the full support and approval of the Government, and I assure the Deputy that no action will be taken by the Government with a view to the amendment of the Constitution in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state in respect of the financial years 1948-49 and 1949-50 (1) estimated savings as a percentage of estimated national income; (2) estimated volume of private investment within the State; <Col N="1501" /> (3) estimated value of imports of capital goods; (4) estimated trade deficit; (5) estimated capital expenditure from American Loan Counterpart Fund; (6) estimated capital expenditure from other public funds; and (7) estimated foreign investment within the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Cosgrave)</NameTxt>
      <P>An inquiry is at present being made into national income, national expenditure and cognate matters, the results of which are expected to be available next year. The material which is in course of preparation will cover the subjects mentioned at (1), (2) and (6) of the Deputy's question.</P>
      <P>Imports of producers' capital goods ready for use in the calendar year 1948 amounted to £14,717,000.  It is estimated that the value of such imports during the financial year 1949-50 will be of the same order.</P>
      <P>The excess of imports over exports during the financial year 1948-49 was £80,966,000.  As regards the financial year 1949-50 the published trade statistics for the months of April to October inclusive show that the trade deficit for those seven months was £39,220,000.</P>
      <P>There was no expenditure from the American Loan Counterpart Fund in the financial year 1948-49.  Expenditure from the fund in the financial year 1949-50 is estimated at £2,250,000.</P>
      <P>The only particulars available as to foreign investment within the State are the estimates which appear at items 5 and 9 of the statement of the balance of international payments for the year 1948 which was published in the June, 1949, issue of the <i>Irish Trade Journal and Statistical Bulletin.</i></P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state the number of pickled sheep pelts exported to England during September, 1949, and who exported them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>There were no exports of pickled sheep pelts to England in the month of September, 1949.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary <Col N="1502" /> Secretary be surprised to learn that from three sources in Great Britain confidential reports have been issued, which I have seen, and copies of which I can produce, stating that exports for the seven months ending July to Great Britain were 24,283 skins; in August 1949, 1,500 dozen or 18,000 skins, and in September, 1949, 3,500 dozen or 42,000 skins went out?  While that is so the position in my town is that workers are being let go daily for the want of these skins.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the Deputy is under a misapprehension as to the difference between pelts and fleshes and grains which are pelts subjected to a certain process.  In the month of September 13,680 fleshes and grains were exported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that I have a good knowledge of this and that I am not under any misapprehension.  If the Parliamentary Secretary believes that that number of pelts was available I would suggest that he get the question examined.  If he does he will find that that number of heavies would not be available in three or four years, not to speak of a couple of months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinOSullivan" hpid="Mr. M. O'Sulllivan Mr. M. O'Sulllivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sulllivan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will state in respect of each county the additional annual amounts payable as a result of the Social Welfare Act, 1948, to old age pensioners and recipients of non-contributory pensions under the Widows' and Orphans' Pension Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Norton) William Norton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The weekly value of all pensions in payment under the Old Age Pensions Acts at 30th September, 1949, was £132,815, as against £95,911 (including cash supplements) at the end of September, 1948.  This represents an increase of £36,904 per week, or £1,919,008 per year of 52 weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1503" /> Statistics, by counties, as to numbers and rates of old age pensions are compiled only once in each year, as at the last Friday in December.  The latest figures now available for such pensions, by counties, are those for Friday, 31st December,1948, which was the last Friday before the amendments introduced by the Social Welfare Act, 1948, came into effect.  Data for these statistics have to be obtained from 171 social welfare officers throughout the country, and then analysed and collated at headquarters.  As the work of compiling the returns for Friday, 30th December, 1949, is so close at hand I trust the Deputy will agree to await the information they will reveal.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that as a result of the Social Welfare Act, 1948, an additional amount of £501,083 will be paid to non-contributory pensioners under the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Acts during the current year.</P>
    <P>The estimated additional amounts to be paid in each county borough and county are set out in a statement which, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to have circulated with the Official Report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if, in view of the fact that the statement made by him on the 26th May, 1948, in which he said that whatever changes in conditions of service or salary were introduced, the teachers would be quite clear with regard to what these were by September, 1949, so <Col N="1507" /> that there would be no lag in any change that would then take place (Official Reports, Volume 110, column 2238), clearly implied that any reviewed salary scales would become operative as from September, 1949, and was so understood by the teachers, he will revise his expressed intention of making the revised scales operative as from April, 1950, so as to implement the above undertaking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>My statement of the 26th May, 1948, has not been correctly interpreted.  The text of the paragraph referred to shows that I was expressing what I visualised at the time as the probable trend of events and that there was nothing in what I said which could be regarded in the nature of an undertaking.  September, 1949, was not mentioned by me as a date from which revised salary scales might be introduced and there was, therefore, no question of implementation as is suggested.</P>
      <P>In point of fact, however, a committee to examine and report on teachers' salaries was set up in January, 1949.  This, of course, was not the permanent arbitration body which I earlier had in mind, since events have not advanced sufficiently to allow of its establishment.</P>
      <P>The Government's proposals, which were formulated after full consideration of the committee's recommendations, were made known in September last as I had hoped they would be. In response to the teachers' representations, and as the ultimate concession which can be made in the matter, the Government have now indicated their willingness to introduce the revised scheme from the 1st January, 1950, as instead of from the 1st April, 1950, as originally proposed.  Payment cannot, however, be made until after we have entered on the new financial year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs whether his attention has been drawn to Press reports that countries represented on the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation have agreed to withdraw import restrictions on at least 50 per cent. of their private trade; whether any such agreement has been entered into by the Irish Government; and, if so, whether he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Minister for External Affairs (Mr. MacBride) Seán MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. MacBride)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am indebted to the Deputy for asking this question, as there has been a considerable amount of misunderstanding concerning the purport and effect of the recent Organisation for European Economic Co-operation decision regarding quantitative restrictions.  The Council of the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation decided on the 2nd November, 1949, that member countries should adopt as an objective the removal of quantitative restrictions before 15th December, 1949, at latest, on at least 50 per cent. of their total imports on private account from the other member countries as a group, in the respective fields of food and feeding-stuffs, raw materials and manufactured goods, counted separately. This decision was the result of studies <Col N="1510" /> carried out by the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation during the preceding five months with a view to freeing and developing trade between the participating countries.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, most European countries, immediately after the recent war, imposed very severe restrictions on the import of goods. These restrictions were, in practically all cases, alleged to be inspired by balance of payments and currency considerations.  A position not infrequently developed wherein some commodities, which were in short supply in one country were kept out by quantitative restrictions for balance of payments or currency reasons, while the same commodities were in abundant supply in another country; as a result, economic rehabi was retarded in the country where the commodities were in short supply, while economic difficulties and unemployment resulted in countries where the commodities were in abundant supply.</P>
      <P>It is important to bear in mind that these restrictions had nothing to do with tariffs, and were distinct, and in addition to quantitative restrictions existing pre-war for protective purposes.  The Organisation for European Economic Co-operation came to the conclusion last June that there was little hope of further developing trade between the participating countries unless these restrictions were relaxed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In arriving at this decision, the organisation had in mind that the soundness of the internal economy of every country depends to a greater or lesser degree on the possibilities open to such country of finding markets for its total production and so maintaining full employment.  It had also in mind that imports by one participating country from another might replace imports from other sources, e.g., the dollar area, with which the balance of payments position is especially difficult. The fact, on the other hand, that the participating countries had concluded between themselves an agreement designed to avoid a loss of gold or dollars for any of them by reason of its trade with the others meant that the main cause of these restrictions was removed.  Such an agreement, known <Col N="1511" /> as the Intra-European Payments and Compensations Agreement, was first made in October, 1948, in respect of the year July, 1948, to June, 1949, and the principles of a more satisfactory agreement of the same kind were approved last June.  In those circumstances, the organisation came to the conclusion that each participating country enforcing quantitative restrictions for balance of payments or currency reasons should, as far as possible, relax them in favour of other participants.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Deputy will agree that our experience of the system of quantitative restrictions enforced by various countries since the war suggests that the decision of the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation was a sound one.  We in Ireland have had very considerable difficulties in recent years about securing admission for our exports to a number of European countries.  I am referring here to obstacles placed by Governments to the import from this country of goods which businessmen and consumers in other countries needed and were prepared to purchase.  I need not cite examples, although I am sure that the restrictions placed by the British Government on the import of books and publications from this country will immediately occur to the minds of the Deputy and of other members of the House.  I, therefore, speaking on behalf of the Government, welcomed this decision and declared that my only regret was that the decision did not go further and was, in particular, limited to imports on private account, As the Deputy knows, most of our exports go to the British market and the British Government applies the system of bulk purchasing more than any other Government in Western Europe. It is estimated that over half of Britain's total imports from Ireland are bulk purchased through British Government agencies.</P>
    <P>As regards our own position in relation to this decision, I may state that it does not affect us directly.  We and one or two other participating countries (particularly Switzerland) have not enforced quantitative restrictions <Col N="1512" /> of the kind with which we are immediately concerned.  Apart from a few quantitative restrictions imposed for protective purposes, which even in the most extreme case would hardly affect more than 4 per cent. of our total import trade at the present time, there is no restriction on imports here. with the exception of such controls as arise from exchange control, which is directed solely to ensuring that the expenditure of foreign currencies is kept within reasonable limits.  In particular, this country has at no time imposed restrictions for balances of payments reasons which, as already indicated, were the main alleged cause of the restrictions so prevalent in European countries since the war.</P>

I am aware, however, that as a result of a reduction last week in the export price for rabbits, the price being paid to trappers by exporters is not now as attractive as it was.  The price of rabbits on the British market depends entirely on supply and demand and, as Australian rabbits, of which there are very large supplies are most in demand, the price paid for Irish rabbits has been considerably reduced.

For the purposes of that scheme the Electricity Supply Board do not consider each county separately as a unit when considering the order in which areas will be selected for development.  The board have divided the country into ten districts with administrative headquarters at Athlone, Cork, Dublin, Dundalk, Galway, Limerick, Portlaoighise, Sligo, Tralee and Waterford, <Col N="1527" /> and none of these districts conforms to a county boundary or to county boundaries.

      <P>the question of preparing proposals under the Local Authorities (Works) Act is a matter for each local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Five schemes under the Act have already been approved for execution by the Mallow Urban District Council. Two of these are in progress.  The <Col N="1533" /> others are held up through shortage of labour.  A scheme submitted by the county council and located in this area is at present awaiting the outcome of negotiations which are in progress with the owners of affected property. One scheme has been submitted for Kanturk, but the work cannot be undertaken at present owing to the high level of the river involved in the work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. Browne) Noel C. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. Browne)</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the first measures which I took upon assuming office was to impress upon local authorities the necessity for improving the conditions of nurses in their employment.  I addressed a circular to local authorities on the 11th June, 1948, urging them to (a) introduce a 96-hour fortnight; (b) provide proper accommodation in the nurses' homes; (c) fix off-duty hours so as to <Col N="1534" /> permit nurses wherever possible to attend local entertainments; and (d) provide suitable indoor and outdoor recreational facilities.</P>
      <P>A further circular was issued to local authorities on 12th October, 1948, regarding the delay in implementing the 96-hour fortnight.</P>
      <P>The salaries payable to nurses employed in local authority hospitals have been improved during the past two years and I am examining the possibility of further improvements.</P>
      <P>My functions extend only to nurses in the employment of local authorities. I have no functions in relation to nurses employed in private hospitals or nursing homes but, as I stated in reply to a Dáil question addressed to me by Deputy Dr. Maguire on the 18th March last, I would welcome any steps which the authorities of such hospitals may take to improve the conditions of service of their nurses where such improvements might be considered necessary.</P>
      <P>I do not consider that it is necessary for me to introduce legislation for the purpose suggested by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The representations made for a revision of the remuneration of public health nurses in Dublin have been examined and my views on the matter have been conveyed to representatives of the Irish Nurses' Organisation whom I received in deputations in September, 1948, and in March last, and in subsequent correspondence with the Irish Local Government Officials' Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I explained to the nurses' representatives that the granting of salary increases to one category of nurses would necessitate a revision of all nursing salary scales in the local authority services and I informed them <Col N="1535" /> that in the event of contemplated changes in the Dublin City public health nursing services which might result in an addition to the duties and responsibilities of these nurses the question of a revision of their salary scales would be considered.</P>
    <P>Since 1939 the salary scale of £175-£5- £200 per annum payable at that time to these nurses has been increased to a scale of £257-£10-£307 per annum.  They also receive a uniform allowance of £15 per annum.  In addition, since May, 1948, they are paid a temporary allowance of 11/- per week to meet the increased cost of living.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will state (a) the capital available from the Hospitals' Trust Fund for the hospitalisation and health schemes; (b) the current income from the fund; (c) the amount of capital earmarked for construction and improvements likely to be commenced during the next ten years, distinguishing between funds earmarked wholly for tuberculosis treatment and for other projects; and (d) the amount of income earmarked for (i) improvements, and (ii) other purposes, for the current financial years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>(a) The amount available in the Hospitals' Trust Fund was £9.493,152 9s. od. on 31st October, 1949, the latest date for which a figure is available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b) The income available from investments <Col N="1542" /> by the Hospitals' Trust Board, the body charged with the responsibility of managing the Hospitals' Trust Fund, amounted to £345,938 14s. od. in the year 1948.</P>
    <P>(c) I have already indicated that I have approved a large-scale constructional programme of hospital and cognate building works for completion in the seven years ending in 1955.  The settlement of a programme for the ensuing years has not yet been gone into.  The seven years' short-term programme was estimated to cost £17,500,000, of which about £13,750,000 would be made good by grants from the fund; but, as I indicated in a reply to a recent question, the cost is likely to be higher than this amount.  On the basis of an estimate of £17,500,000, the amount to be spent on tuberculosis works would be about £4,250,000 and on other works about £13,250,000.  Of these sums, approximately £4,250,000 would be by way of grants for tuberculosis works, and approximately £9,500,000 would be spent on grants for other works.</P>
    <P>I should mention that the Hospitals' Trust Fund as it stands is not specifically earmarked in whole or in part for any of the various purposes on which it may be expended.</P>
    <P>(d) As in the case of the fund itself, the income from investments is not specifically earmarked for either improvements or other purposes.</P>

This is a huge amount of money and the House will, I am sure, expect me to give a full statement of the reasons why such a sum is now required.  The financial position of the company has been examined very closely by the senior officers of my Department and of the Department of Finance.</P>

    <P>Taking the first item, namely, debenture interest, £770,000.  This figure is made up of £561,000 which fell due during the year 1948 and the first half of 1949, and which the Exchequer has already paid under guarantee given in accordance with Section 18 of the Transport Act, 1944.  The balance of £209,000 is required to meet debenture interest which will fall due on the 15th January next.</P>
    <P>The second item&mdash;£857,000 to meet working losses, includes the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>£66,000 now due to the Revenue Commissioners for income-tax under Schedule D and a further £33,000 which will become due before the 31st March next, making a total of £99,000 for income-tax.</P>
    <P>£306,000 due to the trustees of the Wages Pension Fund and the Salaried Staff Pension Fund.  This figure includes not only the company's contributions to these pension funds but also the contributions which the company collected from the employees and salaried officers, and which were not handed over to the trustees.  In simple words, the company, while not paying its own share of the contributions to the pension funds, spent the moneys which had been deducted from wages and salaries and is now obliged to make good the payments to the funds. The moneys due represent payments which should have been made to the funds during the years 1945, '46, '47, '48 and '49.</P>
    <P>£160,000 which will have to be paid in advance on 1st January next as motor taxation.</P>
    <P>These three, namely, income-tax, pension fund contributions and motor taxation, account for £565,000 out of the £857,000 required to meet working losses.  The balance of £292,000 might be regarded as the ordinary excess of expenditure over revenue, and covers not only the calendar year of 1949, but <Col N="1546" /> also the period from the 1st January next up to the 31st March next.</P>
    <P>The third item&mdash;which is the largest &mdash;and that is £2,464,000, is required to meet payments of a capital nature which have been made or which will have to be made before the 31st March next.  This figure includes the following: provided during this year on new omnibuses, £504,000; new lorries, £200,000; renewal of permanent way, £189,000; new wagons, £35,000; making in all £928,000.  Included also is a figure of £352,000 which will be required between 1st January next and 31st March, 1950, for further expenditure of the same nature.  This brings the figure up to £1,280,000.</P>
    <P>The balance of the sum required for capital expenditure, namely, £1,184,000, includes capital expenditure on work of the nature of new premises at Store Street; new chassis shop and tool room; new diesel electric locomotives; new diesel electric freighters, etc., which had been undertaken and which had reached a stage where it would not have been economical to suspend the work.</P>
    <P>It includes also payments made to architects, engineers, quantity surveyors, etc., in connection with such projects as: Proposed hotel at Glengarriff, proposed reconstruction of Kingsbridge Terminus, proposed new central railway station at Amiens Street, and several other proposals which fortunately were never proceeded with but which, however, involved the company in expenses which constituted a large part of the £149,000 paid to architects, engineers, etc. mentioned in my reply on the Second Reading of the Transport Bill.</P>
    <P>I might say that bad as the position is, it could have been very much worse. On the eve of the publication of the Milne Report I had to bring pressure to bear on the company to cancel an order which had been placed for 93 locomotive boilers at a cost of over £250,000.  I had practically to order the company not to proceed with a contract for new shops at Broadstone for which tenders had been accepted and which would have cost nearly £1,000,000.  This further expenditure <Col N="1547" /> of £1,250,000 was being undertaken at a time when the company, according to its own report, was losing money at the rate of £5,000 per day.</P>
    <P>The House will observe that except for providing for the completion of such constructional work as it would be uneconomical to suspend, the present capital expenditure, and that provided for next year, is mainly for the provision of transport vehicles, such as buses, lorries, carriages and wagons, and permanent way which, it is hoped, will be revenue-producing assets.</P>
    <P>Deputies will expect me to give some indication of what the prospects for the future of Córas Iompair Éireann are.  In so far as capital expenditure is concerned, I can assure the House that no capital works will be undertaken except in so far as they are essential to the maintenance of the undertaking or are of an unquestionably remunerative nature.</P>
    <P>The question of operating losses continues to be a source of very serious concern.  Even though rates and fares have been increased by varying amounts, the latest estimate available to me is that, after allowing for depreciation and the payment of debenture interest, revenue in 1949 will fall short of expenditure by £1,078,000.  I need hardly say that this is most disquieting even though it represents an improvement of about £346,000 on 1948.</P>
    <P>I should say that the company have been fortunate in securing in a consultative capacity the services of several transport experts and with their aid and advice there is every reason to believe that services can be so improved that they will attract back to the undertaking much of the traffic which should rightly belong to it.  The company has sufficient rolling stock and staff to handle much more traffic than it is getting at present.  A good share of this traffic is being carried by the 20,000 odd commercial vehicles which are not owned by the company.  If additional traffic could be found this would materially improve the position and assist the efforts to eliminate losses.  The level of rates and fares will be kept under constant review by the new board but it is <Col N="1548" /> generally recognised that increases beyond a certain level have the effect of diverting traffic away from the public transport system.</P>
    <P>The company's wages bill represents approximately 65 per cent. of its gross receipts.  Compared with pre-war, there has been an increase in the number of workers employed in the undertaking from 17,000 to nearly 21,000.  In so far as wages are concerned, the hands of the new board will be tied to the extent that wage disputes are settled by the railway conciliation machinery or by the Labour Court.  The decision has already been taken by the Government that there will be no dismissals on grounds of redundancy.  There is, undoubtedly, redundancy in certain branches of railway employment.  Sir James Milne estimated this at 5 per cent. and said that a saving of £300,000 per annum could be obtained by retrenchments.  This redundancy will, of course, work itself out in time through normal wastage, but the process is slow and in many cases transfers of redundant workers from one type of work to another may not be practicable.  The prices of fuel, rails, sleepers, and the other materials required by a transport company have increased by varying amounts&mdash;in some cases by as much as 300 per cent.  In many cases supplies are restricted and alternative sources are not available.</P>
    <P>I think it is clear that only by attracting additional traffic to its rail and road services and by economies in operation can improvement in the company's financial situation be achieved.</P>
    <P>I feel also that it is my duty to warn the House that spectacular changes in the financial situation of Córas Iompair Éireann cannot be expected overnight. Improvement will be gradual, and I propose to make in the annual Estimates provision which I confidently hope will be a progressively diminishing one, for such losses as are expected to occur during the first years of the new board.</P>
    <P>That is the explanation I have to offer to the House in asking it to vote this huge sum, over £4,000,000.  I can <Col N="1549" /> assure the House that it is with regret and reluctance that I have come to ask it for such a huge amount.  The situation is as I have outlined it.  The commitments are there and they have to be paid.  There is no way of getting the money except from this House.  I accordingly move the Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement which the Minister so hastily read was not merely an inadequate explanation of the need for this Estimate but, in so far as we could follow it, it was completely dishonest.  The Minister is, in fact, proposing to ask the taxpayer to provide a subsidy for the new Transport Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>And he represents that subsidy as a liquidation of losses incurred by the old company.  Dishonest is the only word I can use to describe it.  The Minister spoke about commitments.  There is no obligation, so far as legislation is concerned, on this House to vote, in respect of any payment made by the Minister for Finance on foot of the guarantee given by him in accordance with the provisions of the 1944 Act, a sum in excess of £360,000.  Is that not correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has the wrong brief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case we must deal with the matter more fully.  The obligation upon the Minister for Finance is set out in Section 18 of the Transport Act of 1944.  That is an obligation to make good the interest on the guaranteed debentures, if the company is unable to do so out of its revenue.  The only amount advanced by the Minister for Finance, on foot of that guarantee, up to the 31st March last, was £360,000, which represents the debenture interest which fell due in 1948.  Prior to 1948 there was no advance.  The moneys advanced by the Minister for Finance under the provisions of that section are repayable by the company.  If they are not repaid within 12 months, then the Minister is obliged to come to the House and to ask the House to vote the money.  But, even if the House votes the money, the liability to repay <Col N="1550" /> the amount advanced remains upon the company.</P>
      <P>The only amount advanced up to 31st March, 1949, and, therefore, the only amount that has to be repaid in this year&mdash;it may not even have to be repaid in this year under the provisions of the 1944 Act&mdash;out of voted moneys, is £360,000.  Is that not correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>No, and the Deputy knows that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if we could get this matter clarified in another way?  The Minister has said, as I understand his interjection, that the Minister for Finance advanced, on foot of his guarantee to Córas Iompair Éireann, prior to 31st March last, an amount in excess of £360,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said the Deputy is wrong, as he usually is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder could we have the attendance of the Minister for Finance in connection with this matter?  Under the Act of 1944 the Minister for Finance is obliged to lay upon the Table a statement prior to the 31st March of each year, setting forth the amount he has advanced on foot of his guarantee to Córas Iompair Éireann.  He laid such a statement on the Table of the House in March of this year and in that statement he set forth particulars of the advance of £360,000 to Córas Iompair Éireann in respect of debenture interest, the interest upon certain debentures payable last year.  He declared that he advanced no other sums.  In the previous year, 1948, he laid a similar statement concerning 1947, in which he said he made no advance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as this House is aware, from the statements given to it officially by the Minister for Finance, what I have said is correct.  The total amount advanced to 31st March, 1949, on foot of the guarantee given by the Minister for Finance, was £360,000.  Any other advances made to the company have been made since and without the knowledge of the Dáil.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce says that is not <Col N="1551" /> correct.  I am sure, if he looks into this matter before he replies to the debate, he will find his interjection was misleading and wrong, just as his original statement was misleading.</P>
    <P>If an advance was made by the Minister for Finance in 1948 in respect of debenture interest, then undoubtedly after 12 months the House must be asked by him to make good the advance out of voted moneys.  The obligation on the House under legislation is, therefore, to vote £360,000.  It is presented instead with a bill for £4,000,000.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated that the amount which the Estimate provides is to be explained, as to £561,347, by advances made in respect of interest due upon debentures.</P>
    <P>As I have pointed out&mdash;and I want to repeat it&mdash;£360,000, and only £360,000, was advanced prior to the 31st March this year.  The balance has been advanced since, and advanced evidently in advance of the need for it. The House is being asked to repay it 12 months in advance of the date fixed under statute.  The implication of the Minister's remarks was that the losses incurred by Córas Iompair Éireann arose before he became Minister.</P>

In respect of that year and in respect of the previous year the taxpayer had not to be called upon to make good the interest.</P>

      <P>I take it the Minister accepts the Milne Report, at any rate, as to the facts set out.  I take it he will not contest the accuracy of the facts and he certainly implied, in the course of his speech on the Second Reading, that he was accepting the Milne Report recommendations in financial matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to the end of 1947 Córas Iompair Éireann had, according to its own published accounts, not merely met all charges on its revenue, including the appropriations to the pensions trust fund, not merely its debenture interests, but had also paid out in dividends to the common stockholders over the period of three years in which it was in existence a sum of approximately £250,000.  At the end of 1947, which was, as the House knows, a rather disastrous year for it because of the long period during which train services were stopped because there was no coal and the long period during which the bus services were stopped because of a strike, the company ended that year with a debit balance in its profit and loss account of £812,000.  But Sir James Milne had one criticism, and only one, to offer as to the manner in which the finances of Córas Iompair Éireann had been administered up to that date.  He said they had made excessive appropriations to depreciation; in other words, Córas Iompair Éireann, following a conservative financial policy, had charged against revenue expenditures upon the renewal and maintenance of its assets, which, in Sir James Milne's opinion, should have been charged to capital; and he recommended that, not merely should the company in future make smaller appropriations from revenue to depreciation but that the <Col N="1553" /> change should be applied retrospectively and that the company's balance sheets for each of the years of its existence should be reconstructed upon the basis of the lower allocation to depreciation which he recommended.  Does the Minister agree with that recommendation?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Deputy would not agree with a British expert.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I get some information from the Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Plenty of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>May I assume from the reference which he made to the Milne Report in the course of the discussion on the Second Reading that he agrees with that recommendation, that the company will in future act in accordance with it and that the reconstruction of the balance sheet, which Sir James Milne recommended, will in fact be implemented?  Let us however, in view of the Ministerial silence, proceed on the assumption that the Minister has accepted it and let us find out what the position of the company was, according to Sir James Milne, on 31st December, 1947.  Paragraph 103 of the Milne Report reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The proposals to revise the basis of depreciation should be made retrospective to 1st January, 1945, and a reconstruction of the balance sheet carried out accordingly as at 1st January, 1948.  The effect will be to convert the debit balance of £811,901 on profit and loss account at 31st December, 1947, into a credit balance of approximately £75,000.</P>
      <P>The company's auditors have been consulted and see no objection in principle to these proposals.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far, therefore, as the company showed a debit balance on its profit and loss account at 31st December, 1947, it was due, as Sir James Milne pointed out, to the appropriations to depreciation which he regarded as excessive; and, if his recommendations were adopted and if the balance sheet were reconstructed retrospectively in accordance with them, the position of <Col N="1554" /> Córas Iompair Éireann, at the date of the change of Government at the close of the financial year, 1947, was that, having paid all its debenture interest, having paid all the charges properly chargeable to its revenue, having allocated £150,000 in each of two years and £100,000 in the third year to the pensions trust fund, having provided £250,000 in interest upon common stock, it had a credit balance in its profit and loss account of £75,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that the reason why they went to you for permission to increase their rates and fares in order to bring in an additional £1,000,000?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has referred to that.  In the year 1947 the company entered into new agreements with the trade unions catering for its workers providing for higher wages.  Those higher wages in 1947 cost the company about £600,000, but obviously in the course of a full year they would cost the company a great deal more and the company realised that in 1948, faced with these substantial increases in its wages bill and faced also with other increased costs, mainly due to the higher price prevailing for coal, even with the same revenue as in 1947, or even with the increase in revenue which might be anticipated in 1948 since the experiences of 1947&mdash;the stoppage due to the coal shortage and the omnibus stoppage due to the trade dispute&mdash; were not likely to be repeated, they would make in 1948 a loss unless they were permitted to increase their charges; and so they came to the present Minister and asked for permission to increase their charges.  They were refused that permission.</P>

He refused them the increase in fares which they needed to offset the higher charges they inevitably had to encounter during the year and so they made a loss, as they <Col N="1556" /> informed the Minister they would make a loss.  And so, because they made that loss, the Minister for Finance, at the end of the year 1948, had to give the company the £360,000 necessary to pay the debenture interest due that year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the refusal of the Minister to grant increased fares in 1948, the Minister for Finance had to pay the company the amount required to meet the debenture interest, and the taxpayer has had to make it good.  That was the first time the company had to come to the Minister to call for a payment under his guarantee.  They had to do so because of the action of the present Minister. There might have been some dispute in 1948 as to whether the company could not have balanced its accounts otherwise than by increasing its fares, but when, later in the year, Sir James Milne investigated the affairs of the company, he recommended that increased fares were necessary.  Even then the Minister did not consent.  He waited three months, during which time the company's losses were piling up, before he screwed up his courage to the point of sanctioning an increase in fares somewhat less in its effect upon gross revenue than Sir James Milne recommended.  If the Minister had dealt with this matter in a realistic way and in an honest way, if he had come to this House and said that obviously public transport in this country is entering into difficulties which may make it hard to balance revenue and expenditure in the future &mdash;just as public transport is in England or America or France or most other countries&mdash;and had discussed the matter frankly with the Dáil, he would have got from the Dáil, I am sure, a reasonable response&mdash;even from those Deputies who got elected to this House because they pledged themselves to reduce transport fares when they came here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to the 31st March this year, however, it is quite clear that the total amount advanced to Córas Iompair Éireann, on foot of the guarantee of debenture interest, was £360,000.  The total amount which the Dáil can reasonably be asked to provide now to the Exchequer in recoupment of the amount so advanced is limited to £360,000.  Where does the balance of this £4,000,000 come from?  There were, <Col N="1558" /> we are told, working losses which were incurred in 1948.  We are dealing with a company now that, subject to the reconstruction of the balance sheet, as recommended by Sir James Milne, had, on the 31st December, 1947, a credit balance in its profit and loss account of £75,000.  We find it, at the end of 1948, after one year of the Minister's sabotaging tactics, with a debit balance in excess of £1,000,000.</P>

I want to say that there is no authority for that statement other than the Minister's word; that, so far as the Dáil has access to the published declarations of the views and intentions of the former chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann or of the former directors of Córas Iompair Éireann, that statement is untrue.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Of course&rdquo;, Mr. Reynolds said, &ldquo;economies can and will be effected but they should not be brought about by a reduction in the present standard of maintenance of the permanent way, rolling stock and equipment.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be glad.  I think it would be a good idea to get it on the record.  The view of the directors of the company, that is, the representatives of the common stockholders elected by them, was also conveyed to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in that month, March, 1948.  It is set out in paragraph 496 of the Milne Report.  It reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The measures which the company considered should be taken to remedy its financial situation were communicated by the chairman to the Minister for Industry and Commerce in March, 1948, as follows:&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&mdash;they put this first in their recommendations&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&mdash;(a) Rehabilitation of the permanent way to enable increased speeds to be run in safety.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>So far as the views of the chairman are known, they are contained in that letter published by him much later than the Minister received it.  So far as the views of the board of the company are known, they are set out in that paragraph of the Milne Report.  The Minister said they said to him in private that they wanted to reduce expenditure on the permanent way, involving the dismissal of 2,500 men.  I do not believe it.</P>

However, the company in 1948 because of the Minister's blunder had a deficit and because the year ended with a deficit the taxpayers are to be called upon to pay the debenture interest.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is another question.  I am prepared to discuss it.  I think it is generally known that my views on a financial issue of that kind are fairly conservative and I find myself in considerable sympathy with the comment upon that proposal made by Mr. Reynolds and published by him in the newspapers.  I am taking it, however, that the Minister accepts it and agrees with it and that the recommendation is going to be carried through.  That is the basis from which we have to start. There was a financial loss in 1948 and, therefore, an obligation to provide £360,000 in respect of debenture interest.  But where does the balance of the £4,000,000 come from?  Did the Minister make it clear, that in this year of 1949, which is not yet over, he has made available for Córas Iompair Éireann capital sums on guaranteed debentures in excess of £1,000,000 and he is proposing now to make available by way of grant&mdash;or, at any rate, out of voted moneys to be repaid this year, next year, some time, never&mdash;another £2,500,000.  He asks the Dáil also to recoup a loss in working which he thinks will be about £800,000 and, in addition, to provide, in advance, debenture interest payable next year. For what purpose?  To ensure that this new board will start off on 1st April with a clean sheet, that it will not be required to take over the liabilities which arose out of the past working of the company, so that it will have provided, free of charge at the taxpayers' expense, the capital expenditure, or a large part of the capital expenditure which the old company undertook.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister explain this situation a little further?  He mentioned in the course of the debate on Second Reading that there was £1,500,000 debentures due for redemption next year.  When were they issued?  Not up to 31st March&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>They were due for redemption in January.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>When were they issued? Is any part of this sum to be devoted <Col N="1562" /> to the redemption of these debentures? To what extent do we have to vote £1,500,000 because the Minister was not able to proceed with the Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Bill became law before 1st January as originally intended, would not the redemption of capital stock of that kind be a proper purpose for which new transport stock could be issued?  Is that not so?  In any case, why is the Dáil being asked to vote the money?  Even the present company, unless something has happened of which the Dáil does not know, had at the end of its last financial year £3,000,000 unissued debentures. Is that not correct?  It was authorised by the 1944 Act to raise new capital with the consent of the Minister for Finance and subject to his guarantee, to the extent of £6,000,000.  Up to the end of December, 1947, only £1,350,000 of that new capital had been raised. On that date, or the date on which the present Minister took office, the company still had the power, subject to the consent of the Minister for Finance, to raise new capital to the extent of £4,725,000 under the terms of the 1944 Act.  In 1948 there was a further issue of £1,600,000 on October 18th of that year, but that still left the position at the date of the Milne Report, that the company had the right to raise new capital on guaranteed debentures to the extent of £3,000,000.  Has it that right now? Has that money been squandered under the Minister's direction&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I came down to tell you that that Bill, if passed into law, would rob you.  To-day we are faced with a bill for £4,500,000, resulting from this maladministration of the Fianna Fáil Government.  Now we have to meet this £4,500,000 which has been frittered away in the most violent fashion, but we are not going to let it rob you.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>&ldquo;£4,500,000 frittered away by Fianna Fáil.&rdquo;  Up to the end of 1948 the only money advanced out of the National Exchequer to Córas Iompair Éireann in respect of the State guarantee was the £360,000 required to pay the debenture interest falling due in that year.  The Minister denied that.  If his denial is correct, is not the Minister for Finance chargeable with having submitted a false return to the Dáil, because the return which is available in the Library says that up to the 31st March, 1949, the total amount advanced was £360,000?  Therefore, in so far as this £4,000,000 represents money advanced to repay losses, it must be losses incurred in this year. But of course we know it is not money required to replace losses.  It is money required to provide a hidden subsidy for the new transport board so that the Minister can come in here next year and say: &ldquo;This board is doing very well.  We do not have to vote money this year,&rdquo; and the only reason why they will not have to vote money next year is because he is voting it this year and voting it this year because he can represent it as a political heritage from Fianna Fáil when, as we know, it was due to his own bungling in 1948 and 1949, his inability to get his Bill through the Dáil in time and his desire to provide a nest egg in advance for the board he hopes to establish on 1st April, 1950.  Why are we voting it now? Why is the taxpayer being asked to vote now debenture interest payable next April?  Will somebody answer that question?  There is no legal obligation on the taxpayer to pay it now.  If the company at the end of the financial year in December is unable to provide money to pay debenture interest, then the Minister for Finance has to advance it out of the Central <Col N="1566" /> Fund.  When he has advanced it out of the Central Fund, then Córas Iompair Éireann is bound by law to repay it within 12 months, that is to say, before 1st January, 1951.  If they fail to repay it before 1st January, 1951, then within 12 months of that date, sometime in 1951, the Minister is obliged to come to the House to ask for its replacement out of voted money. Why is money due in 1951 being voted now except to serve a political purpose which the Minister has in view of blackening the reputation of the board which managed the old company and making it easier for the new board to show an attractive financial position during its first or second year of office which will elapse before the Minister has to face the country at a general election?  Because of these dishonest political considerations the Dáil is being asked on behalf of the taxpayer to vote £4,000,000.  If the Deputies do it, they are neglecting their duty to the people who send them here because it is voting £4,000,000, not for any losses incurred by Córas Iompair Éireann&mdash; not losses to that extent&mdash;but merely to provide a political argument for the Minister and to set the stage for a general election campaign to be run some time next year or the year after.</P>

      <P>The majority of the taxpayers who gave authority in 1944 to Deputy de Valera and his expert transport officer, Deputy Lemass, now know that they will have to meet this bill to clear up the mess created by the establishment of a transport dictatorship, because that is what it was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>It was created under the Act of 1944.  It is ridiculous for Deputy Lemass to refer here to the views of the board.  There was no board in the proper sense.  They were office boys, yes-men, who had the right to come to a meeting if they thought fit and draw their fees.  But, if the chairman took a different view from what they had the courage to express, if they had the courage to express it, the chairman's word went.  Nobody knows that better than Deputy Lemass, because he was <Col N="1567" /> the godfather of the section of the Act of 1944 which created that dictatorship and put into that position, as Sir James Milne properly describes it&mdash;at least he was told it&mdash;a certain man for reasons of expediency.</P>
      <P>However, there is a bigger issue involved in this than the quibble which Deputy Lemass has been trying to carry on here to-day.  There is the question of whether Deputy Lemass and Deputy de Valera believe or ever believed that the railway system should be or has to be the foundation for a sound economic transport system.  There is evidence on the records of this House, certainly on the records of the company, that the brains trust set up under the 1944 Act set out deliberately, from the 1st January, 1945, to destroy the railways by prejudicing public opinion against the use of the railways as part of our transport system.  I wonder will Deputy de Valera, if he takes part in this debate, recognise and realise, as he must have done during the emergency, how essential it is that we should have railway transport here or will he again take the risk of having to rely on outside concerns to supply us with the increasing quantity of fuel that would be required to run a road transport service as against the railways system?</P>
      <P>The railway system of this country kept the life of the nation going during the emergency.  There is nobody&mdash; Deputy de Valera or anybody else&mdash; who can say that we will not require the same kind of system in another emergency, if such a thing takes place during our lifetime.  I assert that the brains trust put in charge of the transport system under the Act of 1944 set out deliberately to destroy the railways.  There is evidence of that even in the letter which Deputy Lemass refused to read, the letter of the 13th March addressed to the present Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>

He went on to elaborate on the extent of his proposals, or some of them, at any rate, in a letter which he sent to the Minister on 13th March.  Deputy Lemass, in spite of the knowledge he has and the contents of that letter, asserts here across the floor of the House, to people who of course do not know whether what he is saying is true or not, that there would be no railway men dismissed under the proposals submitted by the former chairman of the company.  I shall quote a portion of the letter addressed to the present Minister on 13th March, in which he had the brass neck to propose the elimination of 861 miles of track of Córas Iompair Éireann.  Here is the letter.  I shall read the essential portion of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am reading from a letter which was quoted by the present Minister for Industry and Commerce in this House on the 3rd of November last. The reference is Volume 118 of the Dáil Debates, column 507.  It is worth repeating this for the purpose of getting it in the Deputy's head:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The company has 861 miles of branch lines&mdash;all single track.  With few exceptions these lines never made a profit and, with the development of road transport, are all now losing and must continue to lose heavily unless excessive rates and fares are charged for the small volume of traffic offering.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Maintenance of these lines has been in arrears for years and, with numerous speed restrictions on every one of them, they have, by a process of patching, been kept in a state of repair consistent only with the minimum requirements of safety.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>A certificate of safety is published every year in the company's report from its engineer.  The letter goes on:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;To put them in order would need <Col N="1569" /> an expenditure of £3,250,000 spread over five years.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Will Deputy Lemass or Deputy de Valera say who gave that figure? It was not an Irish engineer employed by Córas Iompair Éireann. As far as I know it was drafted by a man with an elastic imagination who knew nothing about the railway side of a transport system.  Who gave that figure or for what purpose was it quoted?  The letter continues:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It would be in the nature of capital expenditure as normal maintenance would continue to be necessary and under no circumstances could it be justified.</P>
    <P>These lines are unnecessary in the railway system and the areas which they serve can adequately be catered for by omnibus and lorry.  The closing of them should not in any way place the districts in question at a disadvantage.  Objections will, undoubtedly, be raised by interested parties but they can have no foundation except a mistaken notion of loss of prestige or an unjustifiable fear that loss of the branch railways will be a commercial disadvantage.  These branches are an unnecessary burden and should be systematically eliminated&rdquo;&mdash;that is a good word&mdash;&ldquo;as road vehicles become available.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Does Deputy Lemass seriously suggest to any sensible Deputy, no matter what side of the House he sits on, that if that proposal of the late chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann, made on the 13th of March, was carried out that there was not going to be consequential unemployment on the railways as a result of it?</P>

      <P>At any rate, I hope that I have disposed of that argument if it was meant as a serious one&mdash;that is that there would be no unemployment following the closing of 861 miles of branch lines proposed by the late chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann who was the nominee of Deputy Lemass.</P>
      <P>I want now to refer to the speech made by the present Minister for Industry and Commerce when he was concluding the Second Reading debate on the Transport Bill of 1949.  Speaking at column 501, the Minister made the position clear on behalf of the Government and on behalf of Deputies on this side who support him and will support when he said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;This country cannot do without <Col N="1571" /> a railway system and must have a railway system.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the alternative to the proposals that were put forward to the Minister for Industry and Commerce on the 13th of March by the late chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann.  Of course, one could say that, if you wiped out all the branch lines, the railways would still survive, just as if you cut branches off a tree the tree will survive.  Anybody, however, who knows anything about a transport system knows perfectly well that the branch lines are of considerable feeding value to the main trunk lines.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>You should be over here.  I think you are on the wrong side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already indicated that the policy of the nominee of Deputy Lemass, who has retired from the chairmanship of Córas Iompair Éireann, was to close the branch lines. There need be no further argument about that.  The late chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann went further in his efforts to prejudice the minds of the travelling public against the use of the railways.  He abolished, in a unilateral fashion as far as I know, the wellknown and suitable system of through passenger rates and fares which had hitherto obtained.  Before he did that, one could book, at considerable advantage, from Cork to London, and get a through service by rail and steamer without having to change at Kingsbridge.  The same happened if you booked from London to Cork.  You could get a through service and an efficient service.  The late chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann abolished that in a unilateral and in a silly fashion. That was done to prejudice the travelling public against the railways.  I am quite certain that he did that with the approval of Deputy Lemass.  Since that change was made, the scenes that are to be witnessed on Saturday mornings are simply disgraceful.  One can see thousands of our fellow-citizens coming back here with their wives and children for a holiday.  On a Saturday morning they are put into an out-of-date railway passenger coach at Dún <Col N="1572" /> Laoghaire, and when they come to Westland Row they are fired out of it.  They have to make their own arrangements to get across the city. They have to do that in all kinds of weather, whether they are bound for Galway or Cork or for some other part of the country.  Is that a system which could be called a reasonable and efficient one to cater for the needs of the travelling public?  Is there a Minister of Transport in any country in the world who would defend a system of that sort?</P>
      <P>In addition to the inconvenience which those people suffer as a result of that, they are put to considerable additional expense.  When they get out at Westland Row they have to go to Transport House and rebook.  Everybody knows that rebooking means, in effect, a 20 per cent. addition on single fares.  That is the state of affairs that was produced by the abolition of the through passenger service.  I assert again that it was done for the purpose of prejudicing the travelling public against the railway system.  We all know that that happened, and although it may appear to be a minor matter it is one of considerable inconvenience so far as the travelling public are concerned.  They are the people to be provided for in the Transport Bill that was recently introduced, either under the Bill or under the 1944 Act or by any same Minister whose job it is to cater in an efficient way for the needs of the travelling public.</P>
      <P>He proceeded to wipe out the dining rooms and refreshment rooms, particularly at junction stations.  The people in cold winter weather, who had to wait for connecting trains at places like Ballybrophy and Portarlington, had to ramble around and could not get even a cup of tea.  Was that done for any other purpose than to injure the railway system, of which he was the head?  I hope the Minister will give us the reasons for such actions, because we may be sure Deputy Lemass will not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What was the reason for handing over control of the refreshment rooms and the hotels to a foreign company? <Col N="1573" /> It would be interesting to hear that, in view of the abuse that is hurled across the House about foreign experts coming in.  There were more foreigners brought in under the régime of the late chairman than there were brought in at any period since the railways were established.  The hotel section, the only section of the railways that was paying approximately 10 per cent. on its capital, was handed over.  I will read out some figures for Deputy Lemass, though he must know something about this.  He can give the reasons if he wants to and, if he does not want to, I advice the Minister to tell us.  This is part of the great mess created when the Deputy was a Minister.</P>
    <P>Why did they hand over the old Great Southern hotels to a foreign company?  They were the best managed hotels in the country.  The profit up to 31st December, 1948, according to the company's balance sheet, was £70,000 more than in the previous year.  The receipts had gone up from £254,207 to £324,684.  Deputy Lemass, Deputy de Valera and other Deputies had experience of hotels at Parknasilla and elsewhere, and they know they were just as well managed as the best hotels in Switzerland or other continental countries.  What was the necessity for handing over the only section of the railways that was paying in 1948 to a foreign company?  Was it done for the purpose of prejudicing the public against the new régime?</P>
    <P>I have travelled by rail to my constituency ever since I became a Deputy. It is most inconvenient and expensive for me, because there is no railway system operating on a Sunday to any part of my constituency.  As a constant traveller on trains, I do not see any improvement in the dining cars, in the catering side of Córas Iompair Éireann since it was handed over by the late chairman to a famous London firm, with the full approval of Deputy Lemass.</P>
    <P>Will Deputy Lemass tell us why the pre-war proposal for the modernisation of accommodation for travellers from Dún Laoghaire to Dublin was not <Col N="1574" /> proceeded with?  Certain proposals were submitted in pre-war days, with the approval of Government Departments, but they were rejected by the late chairman.  I know well what I am talking about.  Conferences were held for a year or so prior to 1939.  Government Departments&mdash;Industry and Commerce and the Board of Works&mdash;Córas Iompair Éireann, the Great Northern and the London, Midland and Scottish were represented at these conferences. A scheme was hammered out and a recommendation made that all would be a party to the modernisation of the transport system that brings travellers to this country from Britain and back again.  There were to be new ships, a new pier was to be provided by the Board of Works, and a new railway station at Dún Laoghaire was to be provided by Córas Iompair Éireann. Then came the most important thing of all&mdash;and Deputy Lemass referred to this.  People who can claim from long experience to be transport experts suggested, as part of the proposals, that Amiens Street should be the central station for the City of Dublin.  If these recommendations had been seriously considered by Deputy Lemass, when he was a Minister, I believe he would have had a far better, a more efficient and more up to date system of transport for travellers between this country and Great Britain.  He could have avoided people being pitched out of trains at Westland Row and told to go how they liked to their destinations.</P>
    <P>I understand that Amiens Street can provide more accommodation for rolling stock and more places of storage than any other Dublin station.  If that scheme was carried out in pre-war days it would mean that travellers could go from the pier to Cork without having to go back into Kingsbridge and they would save an hour on the run from Dún Laoghaire to Cork or Cobh. That would be a very desirable improvement on the conditions that prevailed along that route.  You would be able to run all the trains from Dún Laoghaire pier to Amiens Street and trains could start North, South, East or West without passengers being forced to change from their carriages. <Col N="1575" /> Conditions would then be the same as in continental countries.</P>

      <P>In regard to many proposals for which the taxpayers will have to pay dearly, the late chairman took no steps to consult any of his railway or other transport advisers.  He consulted outsiders, whoever they were. These people were well paid for the <Col N="1576" /> bad information they gave him.  Some of the information was very silly, but it will be costly for the taxpayers. Those who voted for the dictatorship set up under the 1944 Act cannot growl so much, because they gave a free hand to the Fianna Fáil Government to do these things.  Is it not laughable to hear Deputy Lemass talk about the board that managed the company? Does he not know perfectly well that they did not manage the company? They were not allowed to decide anything.  When we were discussing the News Agency Bill, to my surprise&mdash;a pleasant one I must admit&mdash;Deputy Lemass confronted the Minister for External Affairs with the statement that he knew personally, speaking from his own knowledge as late Minister for Industry and Commerce, that there were dozens of unselfish business men in this country who were willing to give and did give their time free and who did not claim any directors' fees from the companies of which they were directors until the companies concerned were put on a profit-making basis.  I would like to hear from the Minister for Industry and Commerce what fees were drawn by the directors of Córas Iompair Éireann&mdash;the directors that had no power&mdash;considering that the company got itself into this bankrupt condition.  I do not blame the directors because they had no power.  They may have had the power to talk at board meetings and to have a lunch after the meeting, but they certainly had no power to do anything effective. It was news to me to hear that there were so many unselfish industrialists in this country prepared to give their time free in the companies set up by Deputy Lemass when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is plenty of evidence on record to prove, and Deputy Lemass has the evidence himself, that the late chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann made a grave mistake in refusing, for reasons known only to himself, to consult his experts before he decided to go ahead with these projects the cost of which are included in the big bill the Minister is now presenting to the House.  If the late chairman had wanted the cooperation of the staff with whom he <Col N="1577" /> was associated, particularly on the railway side, I think he should have made it his business to see them and discuss matters with them.  I think he should have evinced some evidence of his desire to see that they were fairly treated.  I can assure Deputy Lemass and all my other hearers that there were senior officials with 40 years' service in the company who never were permitted to speak to the chairman or the general manager. When they made representations, as they were entitled to do, for additional remuneration to meet the increases in the cost of living during the emergency, the chairman refused to see them.</P>

      <P>The failure of the chairman to do what was reasonable and just is to some extent one of the causes for the increased bill that we have before us this evening.  Deputy Lemass was the grandfather of the Wages Standstill Order.  Nobody could get an increase of 1d. or a 1/- or £1 in his wages or salary without the approval of the then Minister responsible for the operation and administration of that Order.  I can give you particulars of at least 55 senior officials of Córas Iompair Éireann who never got so much as 1d. increase, notwithstanding the responsibility of their positions, during the whole of the emergency period.  But Deputy Lemass had no hesitation, even though he has denied this, in giving the chairman of the company an increase of £1,500 per year on the £5,000 he had sanctioned for him when he took up office in 1945.</P>

Was <Col N="1578" /> that proper treatment of these officials by the late chairman?  These men had to carry heavy responsibilities.  Deputy Lemass knows just as well as anybody else that it was the men in the senior clerical positions at headquarters and down the country who carried heavy responsibilities.</P>

The failure of the late chairman, nominated by Deputy Lemass and by the Government of Fianna Fáil, to treat his staff in a proper way or to consult them before taking some of the silly decisions that are now costing us so much, has helped to add considerably to this bill to which Deputy Lemass takes such exception.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lemass made many remarkable statements during the Second Reading of the Transport Bill. Among other things he said&mdash;and I take it he was re-echoing the advice of the late chairman and those who think as he did&mdash;that:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I am not at all sure that the whole error in railway organisation in this country, right from the beginning, has been the employment of British railway managers to operate Irish railway undertakings or companies.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Sir James Milne in his report refers to that in another way.  He says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The co-ordination of the rail and road activities of the company has presented many difficulties and no decision has yet been reached as to the ultimate organisation of the various departments.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There is some relationship between these two statements.  There is the statement made to Sir James Milne by an executive officer of Córas Iompair Éireann, three years after Mr. Reynolds had taken office.  He goes on to make an even more serious statement:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Considerable difficulty has been experienced in finding suitable personnel for the higher positions and a number of new appointments have been made on grounds of expediency rather than as part of a planned reorganisation.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I say that anybody who required three years, and apparently the late chairman did, to come to that conclusion wasted that three years&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;at £5,000 a year for portion of the period and £6,000 a year for another portion of it.  The transport <Col N="1580" /> expert, if it is right for me to use the word expert in such a connection, who could not provide a proper organisation under the Act of 1945 inside a period of three years should certainly look for some other job.  Deputy Lemass will be interested to know, and this matter was raised by Deputy Lehane here, that while that report was being drafted by Sir James Milne, including the paragraph to which I have just drawn attention stating that appointments had to be made on grounds of expediency, an advertisement appeared under the name of the traffic manager of Córas Iompair Éireann, with the approval of the general manager and chairman, in a paper called <i>Modern Transport.</i> I am going to quote from <i>Modern Transport</i>, dated 16th October, 1948&mdash; a paper that is not in circulation amongst Irish railway men.  There was no copy of it in circulation amongst Irish railway men.  The quotation is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Manager for furniture removals&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think they should have taken some other things away besides furniture&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;and storage department, also road freight operators to control fleets of 50 to 100 vehicles.  Applicants should state age, experience, salary expected and give particulars of types of vehicles and traffic operated.  Apply immediately to Traffic Manager, Córas Iompair Éireann, Kingsbridge Station, Dublin.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why did the ex-chairman or his advisers not make that public in an Irish paper?  There were many competent men associated with the road transport industry in this country who would be entitled to apply.  I am quoting that as a typical example of the people who object to the appointment of British railway managers and, yet, who have gone out of their way, since the coming into operation of the Act of 1945, to bring over people from the other side and put them over the heads of men who were trained in the school of experience.  These men who were trained in the school of experience were not seen by the ex-chairman <Col N="1581" /> or by the general manager or other executive officers.  How, therefore, could they know they were competent for the vacancies available?  If there was any question of expediency in the making of some appointments, it was undoubtedly associated very closely with political expediency.  There is not a shadow of a doubt about that and the majority of the railway men believe that.</P>
    <P>I am not going to blame Deputy Lemass, as ex-Minister for Industry and Commerce, for everything which was done wrong by Córas Iompair Éireann.  I know it is impossible for any Minister of any Government&mdash;with the responsibilities attached to the huge Department that they are in control of, the Department of Industry and Commerce&mdash;to devote any reasonable period of their daily activities in the Department to the running of the transport system.  There should be no necessity for it, if experienced men or men who knew their jobs were put into these jobs.  What is an expert?  An expert is a fellow who has learned his job in the school of experience.  I do not know whether the Minister for Industry and Commerce follows the line of his predecessor and of the previous Government who believed, apparently, that the most competent people in the country were those who were lucky enough to get the certificate of a chartered accountant.  A chartered accountant is an essential part of a big business concern, but I know from experience that he could not tell you anything about the operating of a transport system.  He could work out everything on a sheet of paper, as directed by his directors, and figures, I am sure, quite correctly.  But if the same gentleman were put to do the operating side of a transport job, he would smother himself doing the work as he put it on paper.  There is a practical way of doing things, different from the way mapped out by a man with an expert knowledge of figures. Deputy Lemass would not send down Deputy Derrig or Deputy Little to take charge of the British and Irish boat and run her down the river this evening to Liverpool.  I imagine that if he did do so&mdash;although they are very <Col N="1582" /> experienced in the legal and in the educational line&mdash;there would be many collisions between the North Wall and the Pigeon House.  An expert, as I say, is a man trained in the school of experience.  Deputy Lemass would, I am sure, privately admit that, in respect of work which was being done during the emergency period on the county council bogs throughout the country, it was well known that the road ganger knew much more and was a much better man at his job than the junior engineer who came out of the university with his degree.</P>

Córas Iompair Éireann has been destroyed by a team of experts.

      <P>I submit to the ruling of the Chair and I shall not now proceed further along those lines.  Deputy Lemass talked very loudly this evening and worked himself into a state of excitement because he said we have been asked here this evening to pass an Estimate which, in his opinion, is unnecessary.  He went so far as to say, when he commenced his speech, that the statement made by the Minister was completely dishonest.  I can understand very well why Deputy Lemass wants to get off the rails and why he went off the rails in connection with this discussion and got himself involved in a delicate discussion on the necessity for the redemption of debentures, and so forth.  What Deputy Lemass will have to do here in this House, and he has not done it this evening, and in the country&mdash;and some of us will make him do it when we see him down the country&mdash;is to tell this House and the people of the country the reason for the creation of such a mess in the transport and railway system of this country that the taxpayers have to foot the huge bill of £4,091,000 to clear it up.

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that that is the way it sounded to me and that is the way it sounded to many Deputies in this House, and that many Deputies, and not alone Deputies on this side of the House, will agree with my statement.  An attempt has been made to make the case to-day that this bill for £4,091,000 is a bill presented to the people and presented to them because of the manner in which the present Minister administered this particular section of the affairs of his Department.  That attempt has been made. It is an impudent attempt and one that must fail.</P>
      <P>Every single citizen of this country who examines this problem honestly knows perfectly well that the reason that bill is presented to the people to-day is because a policy was pursued not by the present Minister but by his predecessor in office&mdash;a policy of incompetence, of muddling and of refusal to be guided by advice, expert or otherwise.  To attempt to suggest that the <i>raison d'être</i> for this Estimate lies in the activities of the present Minister during the last 12 months is, to my mind, an assertion which can only be characterised as impudent and as one that will not be accepted for a second by any thinking person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the very nature of things, the debate on this Supplementary Estimate partakes of the character of an inquest, and Deputy Davin covered most of the details of the career of the deceased.  There are just one or two matters to which I thought Deputy Davin might refer which he neglected to mention and which I think it is no harm to mention in the House.  One of the reasons why we have this bill presented to the House, one of the reasons why the operating losses are so high, is the fact that, pursuing that policy of refusal to listen to any sort of advice, Córas Iompair Éireann operated for the period of, I think, three years without the assistance of a chief mechanical engineer.  One of the reasons why we are presented with this bill to-day is that the destinies of <Col N="1585" /> Córas Iompair Éireann were controlled by the Minister through a nominee who was so intolerant of any type of criticism, who was so intolerant and independent of any expression of opinion by other people, that when the workers were forced to have recourse to the strike weapon in 1947, he told the representatives of a newspaper in London&mdash;where he then was concluding an agreement with London hoteliers to sell them certain rights on Irish railways&mdash;that he knew nothing of any strike in Córas Iompair Éireann.  It was that mentality and the operation of that mentality in our transport services, that left them in the condition which necessitates our facing this Bill here to-day.</P>
    <P>Of course there was an attempt to prejudice the people against the railway system generally and against rail transport generally.  I challenge Deputy Lemass to deny that his nominee did express the view, and, if allowed to continue, would have carried it into effect, that rail transport west of the Shannon should cease.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not what the Minister charges.  The Minister charges the reverse.  He charges that he spent too much on the railways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite capable of speaking for myself.  I am speaking for Clann na Poblachta and for Deputy Con Lehane.  I am not affected by anything the Minister said.  There are no &ldquo;yes men&rdquo; in this Party.  I make that statement, and I challenge contradiction on it, that that was the long term view, that that was the end to be aimed at.  I think it is a good thing for the country that that point of view has gone by the board.  I think it is a good thing that there has been a little bit of sanity brought into our approach to this problem.  If the salutary effect of a bill of these dimensions is lost on Deputy Lemass, I do not think it will be lost on the people.  I think they will realise the condition of affairs that this Supplementary Estimate discloses, a condition of affairs the responsibility for which they are able to fix.  I think that is something that even Deputy Lemass's eloquence <Col N="1586" /> will not be able to explain away to the people.</P>
      <P>I described the debate on this Estimate as being in the nature of an inquest.  I do not think that inquests should be protracted.  I am not going to protract it further but I should like information on this point&mdash;I do not know whether the information has been sought already.  Is the £10,500 compensation which is to be paid to the late chairman included in this Estimate?  Because if it is and Deputy Lemass has the effrontery to adopt a critical rôle of the Minister's administration of this section of his Department's affairs, then I should like to compliment the Deputy on having achieved &ldquo;tops&rdquo; in impudence and effrontery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has been asked if he accepts the recommendations of the Milne Report in connection with the new reorganisation of national transport.  I notice that in paragraph 487, it is suggested that if the company is unable to meet losses from its own resources, the Government should be empowered to finance it by temporary advances at a low rate of interest, either directly or by means of a Government guarantee of principal and interest on moneys borrowed from outside sources.  It has been pointed out if the company goes to the Minister and the Government and asks them to honour the obligations which the State has undertaken in connection with the payment of interest on debentures, that commitment has to be honoured. I fail to understand why the Minister should go further than he is bound to go legally in the provision of moneys to provide for operating losses, why he should not have followed the suggestion made by the Milne Report that such advances should be made on a temporary basis.  If the House is to retain control over the expenditure of the large sums of money which will necessarily be involved in all this transport reorganisation, then I think we should take a most conservative attitude and assure ourselves that we are not paying out money except where it is absolutely necessary and that, as far as possible, if we have to make the taxpayer liable for the interest, <Col N="1587" /> the operating losses or any other charge, in so far as it is humanly possible, we should see to it that the company will be made to recoup the expenditure to which the House has agreed.</P>
      <P>There is also the question of the reconstruction of the balance sheet.  I do not know why the Minister should persistently interrupt Deputy Lemass when he is making the reasonable point that, if the balance sheet of Córas Iompair Éireann from 1945 is to be readjusted on the basis of the Milne Report recommendations, then it gives a different picture of the situation.  It certainly does not bear out the grossly exaggerated statements made that the present Administration were handed over a bankrupt concern.  If the suggestion is that the concern was made bankrupt by something the previous Minister for Industry and Commerce did, then I think it does not require very much examination to show that that is not the position.  As I pointed out in the Second Reading debate on the Transport Bill, the Minister for Industry and Commerce of the time took steps to bring in the valuable Dublin omnibus traffic into the general national pool and, to that extent, he certainly helped to keep the railways going and, quite possibly, their situation would have been very much worse than it has been if that measure had not been passed into law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know why Deputy Davin argues, when the Ministers whom he supports try to argue to the contrary, that this concern was completely bankrupt.  The Minister for Finance suggested that it was unfortunate that they had to keep bolstering the finances of Córas Iompair Éireann, but now we are asked, as well as meeting the particular losses and charges which the country is being asked to meet in this Estimate, to undertake commitments for the future which no one can accurately estimate.  I do not know why Deputy Davin closes his eyes to the situation which the Milne Report in its concluding paragraphs referred to&mdash;that the principal causes that existed in 1939 for the grave financial difficulties of the railway were (1) road competition; (2) increases in wages and <Col N="1588" /> improvements in conditions of employment; (3) the burden of unremunerative lines.  That was the finding, as summarised by the Milne Report, of their predecessors who examined this question in 1939&mdash;the Tribunal of Inquiry on Public Transport.  The Milne Report goes on to discuss the position between 1939 and 1944 when it says there was some improvement in the financial position of the company. It goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The net receipts from the railway, which had been £250,000 in 1938, were maintained at a figure of approximately £350,000 during the whole period with the exception of the year 1942.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It goes on to refer to a rise in the total net revenue from £351,000 in 1938 to £789,000 in 1944, an increase of more than double.</P>
    <P>The report goes on to refer to the shortage of coal, the restriction on rail services during the emergency period, and the expansion of the road services. It says that wages and fuel costs rose but the receipts were maintained at a level sufficient to keep pace with this rise.  It goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The year of the incorporation of Córas Iompair Éireann saw the end of the war.  During 1946 and 1947 the financial difficulties of the new company were increased by cessation of services as a result of two major labour disputes and the fuel crisis.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Therefore, I think the position is not attributable to the action of any human factors.  It is attributable to the general circumstances of the war emergency during which the railways, if they had sufficient coal, would have enjoyed even more comparative prosperity than they did enjoy.  But, immediately after the war period, when road transport and, particularly, the private operator came on the road, the competition which had reduced the railways to such a parlous condition long before the war again came along and was very gravely accentuated, with the result that the losses of the undertaking so far as the railway side was concerned became very serious.</P>
    <P>I was referring to this question of <Col N="1589" /> the reconstruction of the balance sheet. By the way, I do not know why Deputy Davin should have such a grievance against the former chairman.  I think that, if one were examining the chairman's record from the point of view of the employment he gave, one might question, having regard to the circumstances and the fact that the State guarantee operated to make it a matter of interest to the taxpayer, whether he was not perhaps overgenerous in some matters.</P>
    <P>According to the report, the actual salaries and wages bill of the company at the rate ruling in November, 1948, is estimated at £6,500,000, as compared with £4,000,000 paid in the year 1945, an increase of £2,500,000.  If you take £4,000,000 as 100, that will mean an increase of 62½ per cent., of which £1,600,000 is the result of improved rates of pay and conditions of service and £900,000 is due to an increase in staff establishments.  According to my reading of this report, the number of employees increased from 17,000 to 21,000.  If that increase was justifiable on the ground that there was plenty of work for them to do, well and good. But it certainly does not seem to bear out the attack made on the chairman that he wanted to get rid of railway staffs.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lemass has given an explanation of that.  If Deputy Davin was a member of the board and was going to the Minister of a new Government for financial aid, I am sure that he would not be behindhand in using the weapon that, if the concern was not able to carry on with Government assistance, there would be no alternative except to let some of the staff go.  After all, if a concern is not able to pay its wages, in what other way can it carry on?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to paragraph 161 of this report, the former chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann was also extravagant in the means he provided for depreciation on renewals of wasting assets.  I have not the good fortune to know the chairman.  I am not interested in any <Col N="1590" /> way in the gentleman personally, but I think that, for the purpose of getting a proper picture of the situation, we have to bear in mind that it was stated in the discussions when the 1944 Act was going through the House by no less a person than the present Minister for Finance who had gained experience of this problem not only by virtue of his ministerial office, but as has already been pointed out in the House, as an advocate in the courts dealing with railway cases, that one of the great reasons for the decline of the railways was that, in his view, moneys which ought to have been set aside for replacement and renewals and for keeping the permanent way and the rolling stock in particular, at a proper level and in a proper state of efficiency, was put aside to pay dividends, and that that was one of the reasons why the concern found itself in such a bad way.  According to this report, the total amount provided for depreciation or the renewal of wasting assets was £933,000 in 1945, £632,000 in 1946 and £758,000 in 1947.  This report argues that the amounts were more than sufficient and that some amount ought to be taken off each year over a period of years.  We must assume that would be the normal way, but we have to have regard to the fact that, in the words of this report itself,</P>
    <P>&ldquo;the rolling stock and the property of the company had run down very greatly, particularly during the war years.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We all know that it was not in a fit position to carry out satisfactorily the tasks that we had entrusted to it then. It is stated in paragraph 495:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;a very large part of the wasting rail and road assets taken over by the new company in 1945 were overdue for replacement.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If they were overdue for replacement in 1945 they must be in a very bad state indeed, in 1949.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There was a heavy accumulation of repair work due to the general shortage of material.  Since 1945, it has been much easier to obtain replacements of road vehicles and materials for their repair than in the case of railway assets, and this <Col N="1591" /> has led to a further expansion of the road facilities already increased by the Great Southern Railways during the war.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Having regard to the situation with which the chairman and the board were then faced in regard to the deterioration of these assets which had been going for so many years, it surely was not easy to come to the conclusion that the largest possible amount ought to be set aside for depreciation, and that, in fact, the renewals so far as capital was concerned should be charged against current revenue.  Whether that was according to the principles of conservative railway accounting, I think there was ample justification for it, having regard to the particular circumstances of Córas Iompair Éireann. If the Milne Report is right, and that more than sufficient was allowed for depreciation, a lesser amount ought to be sufficient to calculate over a period of years.  The balance sheet, as Deputy Lemass pointed out, might be readjusted accordingly.  This is not a Fianna Fáil recommendation or a Lemass recommendation.  It is a recommendation made by the Milne Report in paragraph 165:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;These proposals for a revision of the basis of provision for depreciation in the company's accounts should be made retroactive and a reconstruction of the balance sheet carried out as at 1st January, 1948.  Adjustment of the capital values of the assets and the release of the Renewal Fund would enable the company to convert the adverse balance of £811,901 on profit and loss account at 31st December, 1947, into a credit balance of approximately £75,000.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think the House has already asked for information as to what the policy was going to be in future regarding the economies and the long-term recommendations made in the Milne Report.  If the taxpayers are to be asked to meet this very heavy expenditure, it is only right that they should have some guarantee that, in the future, the necessity for such an Estimate as this will not occur.  We ought to be told that something definite is in mind as <Col N="1592" /> to what measures are necessary to secure additional traffic or to bring economies, or both.</P>
    <P>We know, as has been pointed out here, that the new board will scarcely be in a position to undertake the necessary decisions.  They will scarcely be in a position on their own initiative to make the necessary decisions if they feel that Government policy is antagonistic, or that they are not in line with the general conduct of affairs which the Minister would prescribe or the instructions which he would give. We know that the board appointed by the Government is a new board, and that it is scarcely likely to make itself unpopular by carrying out any drastic changes or by treading on people's corns.  It is much easier to come here and look for the money in the knowledge that it is going to be unpopular here for any particular Deputy or Party to get up and say that so and so should be done on the grounds of economy if the position which the undertaking has reached by virtue of the serious decline in revenue on the railway side in particular is to be compassed.</P>
    <P>The Minister was asked in the House as to what was being done or what was the Government's feeling with regard to the recommendations made in paragraphs 476 and 477 and as to the steps that might be taken to improve the company's financial position.  It is true that, after a period of time, the Minister gave permission to the company to increase its charges, and so an additional income of about £600,000 was brought about.  The Milne Report foresaw a further increase of perhaps another £400,000 or some increase in traffic.  It would be interesting to know&mdash;they have given no indication&mdash; as to how they thought themselves the increase might come about.  Perhaps it depended, to some extent, on the restrictive recommendations which they made further on.  In any case, the general picture they gave was this:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On the assumption that the volume of traffic in future years is the same as that estimated for the year 1948 and the costs, including £250,000 as the cost in a full year of wage awards made during 1948, <Col N="1593" /> remain at the present level, the deficiency of net revenue, after providing for liquidation of goodwill but before payment of debenture interest, would be approximately £850,000.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The assumption was that even if traffic does not decline and if costs remain at their present level without any increase, before debenture interest is dealt with the loss will be in the neighbourhood of £850,000.  I think that it will be easy to establish, when the Money Resolution for the Bill comes along, that if allowance is made for operating losses or for debenture interest, that figure is bound to be in the neighbourhood of £1,000,000 a year, if it is not greater.</P>
    <P>That only envisages the present position.  It does not envisage future capital commitments.  The report stated that very heavy capital expenditure would be necessary, perhaps up to £10,500,000, of which £7,750,000 would have to be expended on the railways. It is quite clear that, in the future, we are very likely, unless the situation brightens in a way that the Minister apparently does not foresee, to face difficulties.  He was careful to warn us, in his opening statement, that we are not likely, even in spite of this huge expenditure which the country is called upon to meet, to have anything very attractive for a period of some years.</P>
    <P>If the situation improves, however, and if the Dáil can have some assurance that steps will be taken by way of doing something more vigorous, using more initiative in the recovery of traffic, we will all be very glad.  If the Dáil can be assured that the position is likely to alter and the State will not be called upon to meet these charges after a reasonable period, that will be regarded as satisfactory.  At the moment, however, my feeling is that these charges are likely to continue.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davin complained of dictatorship, but it must be clear to him that by reason of the continuing decline of receipts on the railway side of the concern and the way the competition of motor transport has affected the railways, only drastic steps could right that situation.  We have not got any <Col N="1594" /> information from the Minister as to what the Government's policy will be in the long term in that regard.</P>
    <P>We are in the position now that we have 2,000 miles of railways which have to be maintained and which some board or other will have to try to make pay. In the future they will not be the responsibility of the stockholders, but they will be the responsibility of the State.  As Deputy Larkin pointed out, the stockholders will draw their interest and dividends.  They will not, it is quite true, control the company or interfere in its management, but it is the taxpayer who will be called upon to meet the bill when it is presented.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that the country is now suffering for its failure to do its duty in 1944.  In that year we had what I consider to be the greatest public racket that any of us have experience of.  At that time the railway system, under its then management, was bankrupt and about that time statements were made by the then chairman and the then Minister for Industry and Commerce that the position was parlous.  As a result, there was quite an exchange of railway stock and railway shares and, when the exchange had taken place, there was a Government guarantee to shareholders and a very considerable number of people in the country at that time made well out of that racket. In our 27 years of Government, that was the greatest racket that was ever perpetrated on the people.</P>
      <P>When the 1944 Act was introduced and passed by this House, it made it possible for the racketeers to rake in a huge fortune.  This was done under certain false pretences to the community.  People were told that if the Bill was passed and Córas Iompair Éireann established in the way the then Minister said it should be established, it would be a paying concern and that, although there was provision for the Government guarantee, that guarantee might not be called upon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At that time the people were fooled, and because they were fooled they have to pay through the nose now.  If this House had been doing its duty in 1944 and if the people of the country <Col N="1595" /> had been alive to the real situation confronting them, Córas Iompair Éireann, as it was to be known, would have been nationalised then and the shareholders would have been bought out at what would have been a fair price for their useless stocks and shares.  Instead of that we had this Government guarantee, and that guarantee is going to be carried on and is carried on into the new legislation, placing as it does, a millstone around the necks of the taxpayers of the country.</P>
    <P>But the chickens have come home to roost.  Those who perpetrated this hideous fraud five years ago on the people generally are now reaping the benefits.  This bill for £4,091,000 must shock the whole community and it is the community which must foot the bill.  They must foot it because their business was done incompetently five years ago, and because their business has been done inefficiently and incompetently ever since in relation to the management and control of Córas Iompair Éireann.  Somebody should express some sympathy with the unfortunate taxpayers.  I express my sympathy with them because they deserve sympathy.  There should be no reason why, in these bad times, they should have this heavy bill for £4,091,000 imposed upon them.  The only excuse for it is the incompetence and inefficiency of those who managed this concern for the last five years.</P>
    <P>We were told in 1944 that when these new experts, as Deputy Davin describes them, were called in everything in the garden would be lovely. What do we find to-day?  We find that they did not appear to be concerned with transport as a public utility, but they appeared to set themselves to the task of destroying rail transport by making it unpopular and thereby abolishing the assets of the company. Reference was made to the closing of the hotels.  In addition to that this company sold all the houses it owned in the City of Dublin for the accommodation of its own workers.  I asked the Minister recently how many houses had been sold, for what sum they were sold and to whom they were sold.  The Minister <Col N="1596" /> replied that he was precluded from giving me that information.  I am sorry the House did not get that information.  I have been told that these houses were sold for £150 each.  That is the sort of administration they had in Córas Iompair Éireann.  These houses were sold for a song.  I think the Minister should reconsider the answer he gave me and make the information I asked for then available to the public.  I think it is a serious matter that the company should have sold their property to private landlords because these landlords refuse to do what Córas Iompair Éireann did.  They will not put the premises in repair.  They have increased the rents.  Surely there was no necessity for that step.  To me it is just one further example of the maladministration of Córas Iompair Éireann for which we now have to take responsibility in shouldering the burden of putting through this Estimate of £4,091,000 to pay the expenses incurred and certain capital charges.</P>
    <P>In the Minister's statement to-day&mdash; and no one has adverted to this&mdash;he referred to the fact that under the wages pensions fund the company for a period of years has not paid into that fund its own contribution.  Not only that, but the contributions paid by the workers have been embezzled by the company.  If that had happened anywhere else the men who did it would be above in Mountjoy or Maryborough.</P>

I say that was a criminal action and I hold that it should involve the charging, trial and conviction of the people concerned.  If we have one law for embezzlers outside Córas Iompair Éireann, we should have the same law for embezzlers inside it.  Why was that done?  It is shocking that these moneys should have been used for the particular purpose for which they have been used.  It is shocking that the Dáil should now hear about it for the first time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This bill includes £99,000 for income-tax.  The company owes £66,000 income-tax at the moment and by the 31st March next it will owe an additional £33,000.  The amount that will have to be paid to the wages pensions fund is in the region of £306,000.  Motor taxation is in the region of £160,000. If this money is not paid the buses and the lorries of the company dare not run. On that point, may I mention that it has been discovered in Córas Iompair Éireann, that approximately 100 vehicles which only work for a short period in the year are taxed for the whole year?  The private citizens who <Col N="1598" /> have to foot this bill could not afford to do that with their own private cars. They could not afford the luxury of taxing their cars for the full year while only using them for a couple of weeks in the summer.  But Córas Iompair Éireann could do it and we shall have to pay.  I am not going to deal with capital expenditure.  They are items of capital expenditure that have been spent.</P>

      <P>But he preferred to work it in the way he did.  However, we have to face up to it.  Deputy C. Lehane referred to this as an inquest. It is an inquest to some extent.  At the same time, we ought to avail ourselves of the opportunity to advance some suggestions that may be helpful to the Minister in dealing with this problem in future.  Our railway stations are a disgrace and a scandal.  If you look at them at the moment, they have the appearance of an 1840 workhouse.  These stations will have to be brightened up.  They will have to be made attractive.  Our rolling stock, our carriages, will have to be made attractive.  Our engines will have to be speeded up.  In other words, there must be, in so far as it can be provided, luxury for the travelling public &mdash;luxury in the railway stations, luxury in the carriages.  There must be a place where you can get a cup of tea, <Col N="1600" /> or a glass of whiskey even at the increased price.</P>
      <P>Might I say, too, to the Minister that he has still the golden opportunity of providing the grandest and most up-to-date station of all for our travelling passengers, that is, the central bus station in Store Street?</P>

      <P>Let me put it in a general way.  An effort will have to be made to make Córas Iompair Éireann pay its way.  Even with that effort, capital expenditure will be required.  State support will be necessary for a period of years.  There is no doubt about it.  We all must face it. The taxpayers and the Dáil must face the fact that the Minister will be bringing in Estimates not of this size but he will be bringing in Estimates for a number of years to come.  Let that money be wisely spent in providing decent conditions of comfort for the travelling public.</P>
      <P>However, in addition, every effort must be made to make Córas Iompair Éireann self-supporting.  The only way Córas Iompair Éireann can be made self-supporting, in my view, is to deal with the competition to Córas Iompair Éireann by the private lorries.  That is not a popular thing, I take it, but it is necessary that it should be said.  I am sure that the Minister or one of the Minister's colleagues, probably in the next Budget, may be dealing with that.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I regret very much that the necessity has arisen for the introduction of an Estimate such as this.  It will come as a shock to the public, just as it has come as a shock to the Deputies of the Dáil.  But this shock has been what we might term delayed shock and has been due to incompetence and inefficiency over a number of years.  Let us hope that the new steps that are to be taken will eliminate incompetency and inefficiency.  If it does that, it will reduce the load the taxpayer will have to bear and, as one person who likes to sympathise with the taxpayer, I hope, in his interests, that that will be the position in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not any intention of speaking in this debate until I heard Deputy Cowan's contribution. One would think, listening to him, that a lot of people have forgotten what happened in 1944, 1945, 1946 and 1947. Deputy Cowan must not have had much experience of travelling by railway at all.  Any of the Deputies who had to travel any distance in 1946 and 1947 will remember very well that the railways, due to lack of fuel, were only running once or twice a week on the main line.  Deputies had to come up on the night mail.  They had to leave Cork at 8.45 p.m. and arrive in Dublin at 9 o'clock the following morning. That was because of the type of fuel which was available.  Everybody knows that railway staffs were retained during that period.  I am sure that there would have been a fine outcry if an attempt were made to economise by cutting down staffs at that time.  I am glad to say that Córas Iompair Éireann did not resort to that expedient, even though many other concerns were compelled to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy also said that we should have bought up shares for a couple of &ldquo;bob&rdquo;, their value at the time.  So far as my knowledge goes, the value of stockholders' shares was reduced at one time from £100 to £10, which was a pretty good cut.  I think that is as much as they should have been asked to bear.  We all know that we had a big bus strike during that period which cost Córas Iompair Éireann a large amount of money.  We know, too, that wages were increased for Córas Iompair Éireann as well as for everybody else, and that when this Government came into power they refused the company permission to increase fares when Córas Iompair Éireann asked them to do so.  I think anybody with any common-sense will agree that it was impossible for any concern, no matter what it was, to pay increased costs for everything while it was not allowed to increase its charges.  That was evidently done to make the position of Córas Iompair Éireann appear worse than it was when this Government took over.  We were told that there would be no increase in bus fares, rail fares or anything <Col N="1603" /> else, but after allowing Córas Iompair Éireann to get into a far worse position than it was at the beginning of 1948, it was agreed that the fares should be raised.</P>
    <P>I think that if people like Deputy Cowan, who had not much experience of travelling up and down the country during the emergency, will look back on the terrible conditions in which the railway service was carried on during those years, they will agree that it was marvellous that it was able to exist at all, because everybody knows that whether the railway is doing good business or bad business it has to maintain its staffs at the various stations.  For a considerable time we had no passenger trains at all.  We had only a coach on the night goods or the night mail, and one had to spend 12 or 14 hours in travelling from Cork to Dublin and the same period on the return journey.  Surely no one could expect that any railway could pay under these conditions.  I would ask Deputies opposite to remember these points and to remember that were it not that the company was eventually allowed to increase its fares it might have got into a far worse condition than that in which it is at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDesmondLehane" hpid="Mr. P.D. Lehane Mr. P.D. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.D. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>I think everybody in the country was very disturbed at the alarming Supplementary Estimate that has been introduced this evening.  I do not think there is much use in blaming one Party or another for it.  It is a bill that must be faced by the already overburdened taxpayers.  I would suggest to the Minister that Córas Iompair Éireann have never gone out of their way to facilitate the public or to attract business. They have proved themselves absolute dictators and people with whom it is impossible to deal.  I have known cases in County Cork where farmers came along to railway stations at five minutes past 5 in the evening and their stock or their produce would not be accepted by the railway.  That has been the attitude of the railway company, whether it was the Great Southern Railways or Córas Iompair <Col N="1604" /> Éireann, during all these years.  Even though they might have changed their name considerably, the policy and the attitude of the company remained the same during all that time.  They are doing nothing to facilitate the public travelling on the railways in County Cork, particularly in West Cork.  So far as I can see, they are doing their best to prevent people from using the railway stations and to divert them on to the road services.  Anybody can travel under first-class conditions on a bus to the same destination as he can travel first-class by train, and he will do so in a very much shorter space of time at considerably less money.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cowan has advocated the abolition of privately owned lorries.  I think that the private lorry owners are giving very definite and useful services to the people.  They are able to pay their way and they have not to come to the Dáil to ask the taxpayers to subsidise them to the extent of £4,000,000.  They are able to carry on their business efficiently on their own resources.  I think it would be wrong for the Minister because he has to deal with a bankrupt company, to try to put people out of business who are doing a very fine national service and who are a definite national asset, particularly in rural areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of the speeches of Deputy Davin and Deputy Cowan about half an hour ago, it was sought to lay blame for the present position of the transport system on the enactment of the 1944 Act.  I think that anybody who will examine the transport problem of the country, particularly in reference to the railways, must admit that there was a transport problem in existence long before the enactment of the 1944 Act.  The two Deputies to whom I referred in particular did their best to create the impression that it was the enactment of that Act, the administration of the late Minister for Industry and Commerce and what they termed the maladministration of the former chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann, that were responsible for the necessity of having to introduce an Estimate of £4,000,000 odd this evening.  I would invite these <Col N="1605" /> Deputies to throw their minds back a couple of years and to remember the conditions that then prevailed.  I certainly cannot throw mine back very far but I know of my own knowledge, that as far back as 1924, an Act was introduced by the Cumann na nGaedheal Government with the object of overcoming the grave transport problem which even then existed.  It was sought to overcome that problem by amalgamating several companies into what we then knew as the Great Southern Railways Company.  The root cause of the problem was the development of road transport and there is no use in suggesting that the former chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann or the present or past Minister for Industry and Commerce, is responsible for the advent of motor transport in this country.  On the other hand, no one would suggest that motor transport should be banished because, if it were banished, the railway problem would be ended.</P>
      <P>In 1932, on the accession of the Fianna Fáil Government, there was a very serious problem, and a glance at the figures as to the receipts of the Great Southern Railways at that time would be most enlightening.  In 1925, the receipts from the passenger services of the Great Southern Railways amounted to £1,500,000.  In 1933, the receipts had dropped by almost 100 per cent to £794,000.  There is the kernel of the problem.  Fianna Fáil faced the problem in 1933 when they brought in one of their railway Acts.  They found that even the receipts from passenger transport of the Great Southern Railways had dropped by almost 100 per cent.  Then take the transport of merchandise and live stock.  In 1925, the receipts from the transport of merchandise and live stock amounted to £2,273,669, whereas by 1932 they had dropped to £1,697,404.  Therefore, you had not to wait until 1944, 1945 or 1943 to realise that there was a serious situation facing the people in charge of the administration of railways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one examines the situation with an open and fair mind one knows that Córas Iompair Éireann or any other railway company are common carriers bound to accept any traffic in the form of merchandise that is offered to them <Col N="1606" /> to carry.  They cannot do what licensed hauliers do and pick and choose between economic and uneconomic traffic. Nobody would try to impose on the private haulier the burden of uneconomic traffic.  If that were done, the Minister would be able to find a remedy, in part at any rate, for the present-day problem.  But, if anyone suggested or tried to enforce such a proposition, I would be one of his greatest protagonists.  I think it is unfair for people like Deputy Davin to misrepresent the problem by trying to blame people who tried honestly to remedy the situation.  I maintain that the situation was remedied to an extent, so far as the economic conditions of the country would allow at the time.</P>
    <P>The receipts from passenger transport had increased from £794,000 in 1933 to £844,000 in 1938 and the receipts from the carriage of live stock and merchandise had increased from £1,697,000 in 1932 to £1,856,000 in 1938. That in itself proves that the then Minister for Industry and Commerce was succeeding to some extent in arresting the decay of the railway system.  Everybody knows that motor transport, both from the point of view of private registered cars and goods vehicles has increased considerably in these years.  Despite that increase, the last Administration were able to maintain and increase the revenue from these essential rail services.  From 1925 to 1938 private motor cars registered in the Twenty-Six Counties increased from 16,000 to 48,500.  That is an alarming increase and each new motor car registered meant so many passengers less for the railways.  Goods vehicles increased from 4,500 in 1925 to 10,400 in 1938.  In spite of that increase, the Great Southern Railways were able to increase their revenue from the transport of goods.  It is ludicrous to suggest that the people who were responsible for the administration of transport were not able to grapple with the problem.  In spite of this alarming increase, Great Southern Railways were able to increase their receipts.  I have not the figures at the moment of the increase in road vehicles from 1938 to 1948, but I would not be <Col N="1607" /> surprised to hear that they were almost doubled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>More than doubled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not reasonable to assume that the transport problem in the past two or three years has more than doubled in its seriousness? Nobody should try to deny that there is a serious problem or try to put the blame on the shoulders of one, two or a dozen individuals.  You might as well accuse Henry Ford of creating the transport problem, although he probably was as responsible for it as anybody else.</P>
      <P>Deputy Davin suggested by reference to reports that Deputy Lemass's policy was to do away with the railway system as much as he could.  I am sure Deputy Davin was in the House when Deputy Lemass, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, introduced the 1944 Act and heard him say, as reported in column 1796, Volume 93, of the Official Reports:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Our experience during the war years clearly demonstrated that the railways remain the backbone of our transport system and it is the Government's view that no transport policy is sound unless it makes ample provision for the maintenance of these services.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That was the spirit in which the 1944 Act was introduced and that is the spirit in which I know Fianna Fáil would approach the transport problem.  Nobody need impress on me the necessity for the maintenance of the railway services, particularly during emergency years.  If war comes again, which God forbid, it is obvious that it will be almost impossible to get fuel oil and petrol for motor vehicles.  It would mean that motor cars would be practically off the road and we would have to fall back again on the railways for the transport of passengers and merchandise.  Therefore, it must be the policy of any sane Government to maintain the railway services as the backbone of our railway system.  In spite of what Deputies Davin and C. Lehane said, it was the policy of the last Government and it will continue to be their policy while in opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1608" /> Deputy C. Lehane, in trying to put the blame on the shoulders of Deputy Lemass, made no effort to examine for what purpose this £4,000,000 is needed. Neither did Deputy Davin make any serious attempt to inquire as to the purpose for which this sum is now to be provided.  It is obviously to be provided to meet a situation which has arisen as a result of the Minister's policy in not meeting certain demands by Córas Iompair Éireann.  I also seriously suggest that the Minister is trying to anticipate certain charges that would normally come for payment from the Central Fund in the course of the next few months or year in the hope that, when his new board is set up, as a result of voting this money now the new board will not be required to call on the Government for any substantial sums for a reasonable period while they are in office.  The Minister can come before the House and say: &ldquo;The new board do not require as much as I had to provide as a result of the maladministration of the last Government&rdquo; and, like the boy who pulled out a plum, go to the company and say &ldquo;What a good boy am I&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lynch and Deputy McGrath were not in this House in 1944 when we were told by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce that we were going to have an extended transport system.  We were to have grand carriages, lovely buses and cheaper fares, but what happened?  In the middle of the night, after the Government was defeated by one vote, the country was plunged into a general election on the Transport Bill.  The present position is no mystery to the people of the country at all.  After 1948, Deputy Byrne had a question down about bus fares being increased.  The present Minister for Industry and Commerce said that the House and the country would have to be told that we had a bankrupt transport company, and that there was not a penny to pay the workers in Córas Iompair Éireann.  The Minister had then to go to the Minister for Finance and get £500,000 to pay the wages of these men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1609" /> No one on this side of the House is a bit concerned about the present position, because they know how the country was placed by the ex-Minister for Industry and Commerce.  We all know that people were appointed to positions in Córas Iompair Éireann who knew nothing about the business. They were friends and relations with big salaries.  The former chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann said that he wanted to make the people road-minded.  He did not want the railways at all.  We had all classes of big lorries with trailers going to the fairs and markets and carrying the live stock which heretofore were carried on the railways.  The loading banks at the railway stations for horses, cattle and sheep were left lying idle, and instead the horses, cattle and sheep were taken on the double-decker lorries.</P>
    <P>We want to see the railways maintained because they give more employment than vehicles on the road.  No country can do without railways.  A bus carrying 32 passengers can be run by two men.  We all know that these buses have been competing with the railways and in many cases are running alongside the railway lines.  I would have no objection to buses on routes which are not served by the railways. I do not want to see the buses competing with the railways.  That was the policy of the Fianna Fáil Government and Party.  When Deputy MacEoin was sitting on the opposite side of the House he told the then Minister for Industry and Commerce what would happen when we were discussing the 1944 Transport Bill.  On the first of these Bills, the Government was defeated.  The Taoiseach then went up to the Park in the middle of the night and had the Dáil dissolved when the country was asleep.  According to the present Minister, when the new chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann was appointed, there was not a penny in the Kingsbridge to pay anyone.</P>

      <P>I have not very much to say on this Estimate, except to remark that I think it would be a pity, on such an important subject as the transport of the country, to allow an undue amount of political bias, or to have statements made that were unduly biased politically.  I am quite sure of this, that it will be fairly hard in future to get a manager to run a transport system in this country.  The Minister, too, will be fairly careful about adventuring on a transport system.  Has not our problem here been created entirely by a more modern invention in the case of transport?  Is not that the whole difficulty?  Undoubtedly, the people can maintain an economic railway system if they want to do so, but the fact is that they have not done so.  It is now a question of trying to see how we can induce them to support the railways.  Most of us here remember when we had several railway companies in the country: the Midland Great Western, the Great Northern, the Great Southern and the Dublin, Wick-low and Wexford Railway.  I saw all those companies in competition with one another.  The Great Northern was in competition with the Great Western and carried on a fight in regard to freights.  That, mind you, was at a time when these railway companies were paying, but still they were in competition.</P>

      <P>I am stating facts. Therefore, what Deputy Davin says is not true, that the late manager was responsible for the present position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, the railway company kept on and maintained what was an old system, a system which was undoubtedly <Col N="1611" /> foreign to the majority of the people.  It was never what you would call popular, either.  We all remember what happened away back in 1925, 1926 and 1927 when the lorries and the buses began to make their appearance on the roads.  The lorries and the buses were privately owned.  They gave what might be called a personal service.  During that period these lorries and buses got a grip on the people.  After a time, the buses became dangerous due to over-competition between them.  Attempts were made to relieve that position and to maintain some sort of balance.  What I believe we are faced with now is the entire elimination of private lorries and, in fact, the entire elimination of motor transport on the roads.  Can we do that?  Have we liberty for all those systems here?  I do not believe we have.  If we were quite serious and honest about putting the railways into the position they were in and getting the people to support them, we would have to pass legislation to eliminate all other competition.  I think that is the only way.</P>
    <P>The statement is made that the railway company, in 1947, had a deficit. It may have had but, according to what I am told and what I have read, that balance sheet, if it had been produced in a different form, would not have shown any such deficit.  I know, and I suppose the Minister knows, that many of these balance sheets are capable of manipulation.</P>

      <P>If that is the case, and I believe it is, it would call for some attention.  I believe the position is that up to 1947 the railway company was economic and able to meet its liabilities.  The money must have been there anyway, and I think that cannot be denied.  What happens?  The Minister refused to sanction an increase in wages and there was a strike.  Is not that the case?  There was a definite refusal to sanction an increase of wages.  What sort of business is the railway business?  They have not any assets and they have no credit.  I do not think they have any assets.  They <Col N="1612" /> may have some rolling stock and some lorries.  They have big long lines with a bit of land attached and a few railway stations that are really worth little.  They have no liquid security so far as I can see and, therefore, it was incumbent on the Government to come to the relief of the railway company and allow them to increase their fares in order to meet the wages after they had been increased.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the Minister should have a good deal to say about this thing and that point should be clearly explained.  The only way the railway company had of getting extra money was by sanction from the Minister and then they could get it from the banks or elsewhere-whatever way they have of borrowing.  The railway company is a very defenceless system so far as borrowing is concerned because it has no assets.</P>

      <P>A lot of nonsense is talked in that way.  It was run as best it could be run.  They ran it for dividends, the same as you work for your salary.  I am not a believer in that type of talk.  I hope the Minister will try to lift this very important question over the level of mere politics. It is not very much advantage to the people who are faced with this bill to be told that the Coalition or Fianna Fáil scored.  We should look at it in a totally different light.  It is a very important question, one which should be handled in this House without any political fear, favour or affection and without looking for political credit.  It should be regarded as a national issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot live without a transport system.  There are no people who suffer more from a bad transport system than the farmers.  Up to the present, whatever this Government may do, Córas Iompair Éireann as a system did not give the necessary services.  They were limited to time. Farmers and others engaged in the breeding of pure-bred stock had the greatest difficulty and, generally, they were forced to have their own lorries. If they had not their own lorries they were forced to hire private lorries. <Col N="1613" /> Córas Iompair Éireann will have to drop the old ideas and give a more personal service to the community.  I hope the Minister, whatever control he may have over the system, will eradicate the old ideas and see that the people are given the services they want.  Then there will be no further need for legislation here.</P>

      <P>I think it is unfortunate that the transport difficulties we are trying to solve should be made the butt of Party politics.  That mistake was made, with disastrous consequences to the country, over the land annuities and, if it is not too late now, I hope a similar mistake will be avoided in this instance.</P>
      <P>It should be obvious that the development of road transport in every country has hit the railways.  There was one remark made by Deputy Davin to which I would like to refer.  He said the previous Administration had a bias against the railways.  We can disprove that, or we can prove, in any event, that there was a still stronger bias against the railways in the earlier Administration.  Deputy Davin was then a member of this House and railway administration was a subject proper for discussion in the House. Hereafter, I understand, it will not be when this Bill goes through.  I would like to quote part of the speech made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce when he was introducing the Transport Bill in 1944.  In column 1796 of Volume 93, Parliamentary Debates, he is reported:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The Government believes, as its earlier legislation demonstrated and as many public statements by members of the Government have emphasised, that the maintenance of our railway services, now and in the future, is the kernel of our transport problem.  Our experience during the war years has clearly demonstrated that the railways remain the backbone of our transport system, and it is the Government's view that no <Col N="1614" /> transport policy is sound unless it makes ample provision for the maintenance of the main-line railway services.  To make provision for that purpose, the only practicable method is to secure for them sufficient traffic to permit of their profitable operation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is not any bias in that against railways.  Here is something from the Milne Report, page 18, paragraph 33:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The most efficient and economical transport system would be one under which all forms of transport are employed to the greatest national advantage in meeting the requirements of users at the lowest possible cost.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is not any bias there in favour of the railways.  Deputy Davin based his case on the branch lines.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I read what the previous chairman suggested on 13th March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Davin referred to the treatment of the branch lines as the ground on which he based his charge of a bias against the railways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is trying to prove that two wrongs make a right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put this forward for the consideration of the Deputy concerned, that if the closing of the branch lines indicates a bias against the railways, surely the Deputy should hold <i>a fortiori</i> that the closing of main lines indicates a still stronger bias against the railways.  Take what was done by the Administration there before Fianna Fáil came in.  Deputy Davin was a member of the House at the time when the railway administration undertook the closing of 170 miles of line on the old Midland Great Western Railway.  That is still closed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On this question of railway bias, I do not think there is anything to choose when making political capital out of what has happened to our railways under our two Governments.  I think one should approach this matter from the point of view of the hard economic facts of the actual position. On the question of politics, it seems to me that a more serious charge could <Col N="1615" /> perhaps be laid against the present Government inasmuch as it refused to permit any increase in rates and fares until after six months had elapsed and the losses had been increased still further.  I think that is much more serious than what has happened to the branch lines.  It was interesting to hear Deputy Davin say that he uses the railways although they are inconvenient for his purposes.  I know other Deputies who have had the same experience.  Not only that, but they undertook in my constituency to establish road services which had the result of finishing the railways altogether.  On the board of directors of that company there were two T.Ds.  They were not Fianna Fáil T.Ds.  The less said on this question of bias the better, particularly since the charges cannot be proved.  If we approach the problem from the point of view of economic facts we shall avoid unnecessary recrimination.  In so far as the Minister will make an honest attempt to solve the problem of our railways, he will have the backing of this Party, but only on condition that he drops this imputation of blame to Fianna Fáil because of the unsuccessful running of our railways.  That charge cannot be substantiated.</P>

I could give examples of the sort of honesty, of the sort of straightforwardness, of the sort of truthfulness which we have experienced, not only in respect of this matter that is now before us but in respect of many others.  The Deputy is talking about personal abuse.  He objected that my statement was brief. It was a purely factual statement, giving the facts and figures of the situation&mdash;figures which have been prepared by the accountants in Córas Iompair Éireann and by the officers of my Department&mdash;and scrutinised by the officers of my Department and by the officers of the Department of Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those figures are made up of the sums that are absolutely essential to <Col N="1620" /> enable this concern to pay its way to the 31st March next.  Deputy Lemass's way, of course, of paying the debts of this company is to borrow more.  That is a well-known way, of course.  The Deputy's case is that you improve your financial position by going deeper into debt or you improve your financial position by changing or borrowing from one person to another.  The Deputy told me that all I need come for to the House now is £360,000.  That statement was made to this House and expected by Deputy Lemass to be taken seriously.  A sum of £306,000 alone is required to set right the position in relation to the two pension funds.</P>

Does Deputy Lemass or Deputy de Valera or anybody over there with any knowledge and experience of government seriously suggest to this House that I could go to the Department of Finance, and the Minister for Finance, and get not only the money which was required, the absolute minimum that was required, to pay the debts that must be paid but that the Department of Finance were so generous that they insisted on giving me more than was required?  If that was Deputy Lemass's experience of the Department of Finance in his day, it certainly has not been my experience&mdash;and very properly so.  The Department of Finance will test and sift every figure over and over again before they will agree to it. The Deputy, of course, is sore and his Party is sore because this rather sordid, unfortunate story has been exposed.  It had to be exposed and it has to be set right.  So far as I am concerned, and so far as this Government is concerned, my way of facing up to difficulties and to obstacles and obstructions is not to ignore them, not to imagine to myself that they are not there, not to postpone them.</P>

      <Col N="1621" /> The Deputy, and his colleague, Deputy Derrig, and some of his back benchers, are completely wedded to the Milne report.  They are delighted with it.

Deputy Lemass, who denounces as British experts the people who prepared that report, can quote it or attempt to quote it against me when it suits his book; the devil quoting Scripture.  The Deputy quotes that to try and assert that Córas Iompair Éireann did not lose money in 1947.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say 1947.  I said that at the end of 1947, at the end of three years, according to the Milne recommendation it had £75,000 to credit in the profit and loss account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me remind the Deputy of what he said on the first day he sat on those benches opposite.  I quote from column 59 of the Official Report of the 18th February, 1948:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I saw statements made by some of the Coalition Deputies during the election to the effect that the railways were making vast profits for their private shareholders.  The railway system of Córas Iompair Éireann last year lost £1,000,000.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is what Deputy Lemass said on 18th February, 1948.  Deputy Lemass knows that if he had not agreed to allow Córas Iompair Éireann in 1947 to increase their rates and their bus fares that that loss would have been £2,000,000.  Does the Deputy deny that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I went into the Department of Industry and Commerce on 18th February, 1948.  Within a week or so, I think, the Chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann saw me in connection with the application which reached the Department on 20th February.  He was then able to tell me that their estimated losses for 1948 would be £1,250,000.  Actually they were over £1,420,000.  Deputy Lemass compares losses or tries to compare <Col N="1622" /> 1947-48 with 1949.  They had not begun to pay for some of the white elephants in 1947.  The moneys which we are now seeking I have set out here&mdash;notwithstanding what Deputy Lemass has said &mdash;in the clearest possible way.  I have broken down the figures to show what is for working losses, what is for debenture interest, what is for capital and what is for repayment of debentures.  I have broken down the capital to show what was in respect of capital commitments entered into this year&mdash; and practically all of them were in respect of buses, lorries, wagons, carriages, rails, sleepers, plates and so forth; in other words, in respect of commodities which it is absolutely essential to get if this transport system is ever to be made pay.</P>
    <P>But the other half of the big sum for capital expenditure is in respect of projects which were entered upon before I came in here and none of which were essential to the efficiency and economic running of a transport system, and not one of which would enable it to earn an extra shilling.  Remember, this transport system that we are told about now did not build a railway carriage since 1937.  Remember that, notwithstanding the millions, with all those grandiose schemes they have, they were not investing any of that money and had not gone to the distance of investing that money in anything that was going to be remunerative and was going to enable them to earn revenue&mdash;except five super diesel electric engines for a cost of £80,000 each and 90 or 93 locomotive boilers which were not required.  Remember, further, and do not forget it, because it marks the mentality of the people who were in charge of Córas Iompair Éireann, that as late as October, 1948&mdash;four months after informing me that they had not the money to pay the interest on the debentures that were due, and within three weeks of coming to inform me that they had not the money to pay the wages of the men &mdash;they were embarking on a scheme at the Broadstone at an estimated cost of £927,000.</P>
    <P>When that was brought to my notice, knowing the financial position in which they were, having being informed by them of that, knowing that their own <Col N="1623" /> estimate was that they were going to lose between £4,000 and £5,000 per day for the whole of 1948, I, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, requested them to defer starting that work at the Broadstone until such time, at least, as we got the report from Sir James Milne, and I was informed that they regretted they could not see their way to accede to my request.  They regretted !  They were embarking on an expenditure of £1,000,000 at a time when they did not know where they were going to get the next week's wages.  Then I am supposed to sit here and listen to Deputy Lemass lecturing, denouncing and suggesting that of course nobody is right except himself.  This is the gentleman, the head of the Party organ which yesterday had the brazen effrontery to publish a long leading article about Córas Iompair Éireann which they headed &ldquo;Muddling Through.&rdquo;  If ever a greater muddler cursed this country than the Deputy responsible for that and for the charges made here this evening, I have not heard of him and I hope I shall never hear of him.</P>
    <P>The Deputy and his colleagues have only one line of attack.  That is that they should be allowed to say what they like, that they should be allowed to attack whom they like and that nobody should be allowed to hit back. The Deputies opposite, because of their weight of numbers, were able to assert that and they took full advantage of it for a long number of years. I have a statement there.  Every word of it will be on record, every figure of it will be on record.  That is not a statement made at a crossroads or in the columns of a political organ.  It is a statement made here in Leinster House, a statement containing figures, every one of which has been checked by responsible officers of this State, every figure of which was put before me, not one figure of which was put there by myself or by my colleague the Minister for Finance.  Deputy Lemass knows that.  He knew that when he suggested that these figures were deliberately cooked for political purposes by either myself or the Minister for Finance or both of us.  He knew the statement he was making was untrue. <Col N="1624" /> Of course the Deputy is never more brazen and never further from the truth than when he is conscious of having a bad case and when the ground under his feet is not very firm.</P>
    <P>There are many other points that could be dealt with and they probably will be dealt with.  The Deputy's colleagues appealed to me to have this matter of the national transport system dealt with, if possible, without any Party prejudice or Party bitterness, without any attempt on one side to score off the other and having regard only to the fact that this is a national service.  Deputy Lemass and his colleagues were so readily agreeable to enter into the spirit of that appeal that when a suggestion was made from the Ceann Comhairle's office to enable the business of the Committee Stage of this Bill to be got through more expeditiously and to give Deputies a better chance of doing it in a clear lucid way, that Government amendments should be taken first and that when they were disposed of the Bill should be reprinted with whatever Government amendments the House agreed to insert, so that Deputies could see it in its then form and decide whether they would move other amendments, Deputy Lemass would not agree to that suggestion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true.  It is a complete misrepresentation.  The only question that was put to me was whether it would save time and I said that I thought it would not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is untrue, I readily apologise to the Deputy.  I do that with all sincerity and I regret having made the statement but I asked the Parliamentary Secretary to my Department to get into touch with Deputy Lemass and to put the suggestion to him as I thought it might save time, though in one way it might not. I was informed that the Deputy would not agree to the suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>It would save time in one sense but not in another.  It would certainly lead to a much clearer discussion <Col N="1625" /> on the Committee Stage.  I am not concerned one way or the other but if what I have said is denied by the Deputy, I accept his denial.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I put the other question to the Deputy.  He answered one and he sidesteps the other.  The Deputy can have it his own way.  I regret more than I can say that it is necessary to come to the House for this huge sum and I agree entirely with Deputy Cowan that the taxpayer is deserving of our sympathy.  I was only hoping that the Deputy might have spared a little bit of sympathy for me because I think I am entitled to it, not to the abuse which I got from Deputy Lemass but to a bit of sympathy also.  In any case whoever is responsible for the present position&mdash; Deputy Lemass again in his organ described it as &ldquo;the mess&rdquo; over Córas Iompair Éireann&mdash;it has got to be put right.  When any body is in financial difficulties, whether it be a large corporation, a limited company or an individual, the first essential to help it or to put it right is to clear off its debts and let it start on an even keel.  The suggestion was made&mdash;not a word of truth of course in it; the person who made the suggestion did not believe one word of it himself&mdash;that in this £4,000,000 there is a camouflaged subsidy for the new board.  That is entirely untrue.  The suggestion was also made that I was doing this deliberately so that I would not have to come to the House for a subsidy. That is untrue.  I stated quite clearly when I was introducing the Estimate that I could not hold out any hope of any spectacular improvement overnight. <Col N="1626" />  I said I believed, and I do believe, that there can be and will be a gradual improvement in the service. But I also stated that, in my opinion, it will be necessary for the Minister for Industry and Commerce, whoever he may be, for some years to come to this House annually and make provision in the Estimate for a certain sum for Córas Iompair Éireann.  I hope the sum will be a small one and that it will be a diminishing one.</P>
      <P>I want to put it to Deputies on all sides of the House, on my own side as well as on the far side, that this does disclose a serious position and that it ought to shock them into a sense of reality.  I hope it will get Deputies to realise that you cannot insist, on the one hand, on shackling and restricting, in relation to its services, its charges, wages, pensions and redundancy and everything else, a public transport service and at the same time say that it must work efficiently and economically. Still less can you do that if, side by side with insisting on shackling, tying and restricting in every way a national transport service, you are going to insist, as Deputies on all sides of the House are insisting, that its competitors must be absolutely free to work where they like, when they like, whatever hours they like, pay whatever wages they like, operate over any routes they like, carry any merchandise which they themselves may select and refuse to carry any merchandise which they do not select.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying the Deputy is in favour of it, but he knows as well as I do that that is the point of view held by people inside and outside of this House.  I hope Deputies will face up to the reality of the situation.  If Deputies want to attempt to reconcile what I think cannot be reconciled as I have outlined it, then I cannot stop them.  I would prefer if we could have debated this Supplementary Estimate in a different way and in a different atmosphere.  I did not import any heat into the debate.  As I say, the statement was a factual one containing the facts and the figures. <Col N="1627" /> There is not a figure that should not be there or a figure omitted that should be there.  These are sums of money which I am advised are required to meet the various commitments outlined there up to the 31st March next.  If I have any regret, it is that the big sum I am asking the House to vote will not carry us beyond the 31st March next.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is whether at a certain point the Minister concludes the debate or not.  I am perfectly certain that the records of the House will show that, after the Minister had been called on and the Chair said he was concluding the debate, the present Minister for Finance demanded as a right, under the Standing Orders, that he be allowed to speak as there was no limit to the number of times a Deputy might speak in Committee.  He claimed that he could speak after the Minister and that the Minister could speak again if he wanted.</P>

      <P>The Minister moved an Estimate for a certain amount and Deputies offered themselves from various sides of the House.  They were allowed to speak. I do not know why Deputy Lemass protested against the Minister being called upon to conclude.  He did not offer himself to speak.  If Deputy Lemass had offered himself to speak at that time, I would have allowed him. The Chair must bring the matter to finality some time.  When nobody offered himself to speak, the Chair came to the conclusion that no Deputy desired to speak and I called on the Minister to conclude.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is to say, that that £2,500,000 is not to meet losses or to pay debenture interest, is not to meet any purpose except capital expenditure by the company.  Why is that money required for capital purposes being advanced from the Exchequer?  Why is it not being provided in the way prescribed by law, by the issue of guaranteed debentures under the old Act, or by the issue of transport stock under the new Bill?</P>
      <P>Why is the taxpayer being asked to provide the money required to meet losses?  Why is the money that is required for capital purposes going to be expended on capital assets?  Is there any reason why that money is being advanced out of the Vote?  Secondly, is any part of that capital advance of £2,500,000, which is by far the greater part of this Estimate, required to redeem the debentures already issued, before the 1st April next?  Thirdly, will the Minister explain how it is that the amount required to pay debenture interest&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;exceeds the amount set out in the statement laid on the Table of the House by the Minister for Finance?  As regards that debenture interest, when under the law must the Dáil vote it?  Am I right in assuming that it must not vote it before 1951?  Lastly, is the Minister's estimate of working losses, as he described them, being prepared on the basis of the appropriations for depreciation practised previously by the company or recommended by the Milne Report? Are these questions relevant to the Estimate, or has the Minister answered them already?</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Cosgrave)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to continue for another year the powers conferred on the Government by the Supplies and Services Act, 1946. There has been a considerable improvement in the conditions which necessitated the passing of the 1946 Act, and it has been found possible in the intervening period, and during the past 12 months, to discontinue many emergency controls.  Conditions have not yet, however, improved to an extent which would justify the Government in abandoning the powers conferred by the 1946 Act.  The Government are conscious of the undesirability of maintaining these special powers for any longer period than is absolutely necessary and consideration has been given to the possibility of introducing special legislation to provide specifically for controls which seem likely to be required for some time ahead.</P>
      <P>One instance which I may mention is the foreign exchange control.  The need for a control of that kind is obvious in circumstances where our currency is not freely convertible into other currencies.  So long as our foreign exchange resources are limited&mdash;particularly as regards the well-known hard currency areas&mdash;it is necessary to have control to ensure that the best use is made of these resources for the general good of the community.  No system of exchange control can function effectively unless it is comprehensive, because experience has shown that any gaps or weaknesses are quickly discovered and lead to the loss or misuse of foreign exchange which could otherwise have been applied to nationally necessary purposes.  The preparation of legislation about exchange control which would replace the transient powers derived from the Supplies and Services (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1946, is a rather complicated matter and its introduction has not yet been possible.  The exchange control must, however, continue to be operated and the Government and the Minister for Finance must have power to amend or extend the existing Orders to deal with changes in the situation according as they arise.  For this reason alone, even if there were no other emergency controls in operation, it would be necessary to maintain for the present the powers conferred by the Supplies and Services (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1946.</P>
      <P>In fact, although the supply position has improved, there are other emergency controls which it would not be practical to abolish at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The supply position in the case of tea, sugar, flour and bread is quite satisfactory and, if there were no other <Col N="1635" /> factor to be taken into account, would permit of the derationing of these commodities.</P>
    <P>The prices of all these commodities have risen very sharply because of conditions created by the recent war and so that the full impact of these increases will not fall on consumers, very heavy subsidies are paid from the Exchequer; the total bill for which is from £9,000,000 to £10,000,000 in the current financial year.  All these commodities were rationed during or immediately after the war on account of scarcity and, though scarcity no longer obtains, it is reasonable that the burden on the taxpayer for subsidies should be restricted.  The burden can only be so restricted by the maintenance of rationing and so that no hardships will be inflicted on consumers, especially those in the lower wage groups, the Government have fixed the scales of the rations on a generous basis.  The abolition of rationing would involve either the removal of subsidies or the extension of them to cover the full consumption.  Such an extension would involve a very substantial increase in expenditure and the Government have decided that the taxpayer should not be required to subsidise consumption above the ration levels; but supplies of flour, tea, and sugar have been made available outside the rations at special prices for those who wish to purchase them.</P>
    <P>In the case of petrol, supplies are also adequate but it has been considered undesirable as yet to abolish rationing.  Deputies will be aware that there is dollar expenditure involved in obtaining our requirements of petrol and, because of the foreign exchange position, it continues to be necessary to regulate the distribution.  The rationing arrangements have been modified very much during the past year and I do not think it can be said that the rationing occasions users any inconvenience worth talking about.  A further simplification of rationing will take effect from the 1st January next. It has been the practice, as Deputies are aware, to issue quarterly books of petrol coupons.  For the period beginning on the 1st January, books of <Col N="1636" /> coupons will be available which will contain coupons for each of the four quarters of the year and these books will be used as far as possible to replace the quarterly books now issued. This modification will have the advantage of facilitating consumers and, at the same time, reducing administrative expenses.</P>
    <P>The ration of butter was increased during the year to 8 ozs. per head per week, and production for the current year was the highest for a long time past and no difficulty is anticipated in maintaining the ration at its present level.</P>
    <P>Another control which it has been necessary to retain and which it will possibly be necessary to continue for some time at least is the building control.  The main limiting factor in building operations at present is shortage of skilled labour.  Without a control of some kind there is obviously danger that essential building projects would be held up through a diversion of skilled labour to non-essential work. The same consideration applies though in a less degree to building materials; for example, the cement factories are unable to meet all demands and although there is no control over the distribution of cement as such the building control has the effect indirectly of assuring supplies for essential projects.  The operation of the control of building was modified during the year by the removal of local authority and subsidy houses from the scope of the control.</P>
    <P>Another control which it is necessary to retain is that of exports.  There have been substantial modifications of the scope of this control during the past year according as the supply position of different commodities has improved.  But the stage has not been reached at which the power to control exports can be completely abandoned. Deputies will appreciate that this is a type of control in which a high degree of flexibility is desirable.  Situations can develop quite suddenly which give rise to shortages or danger of shortage and it is highly desirable that powers should be available to meet them. Deputies are aware that the permitted <Col N="1637" /> export of controlled goods is allowed. So far as the Government is concerned, there is no objection to the export of certain goods so long as the goods which are being sent out are removed from export control.  It is, however, obvious from the extent to which parcels are being exported that, if the export controls were altogether removed, we would run the risk of shortages at home in the case of goods which are not yet in plentiful supply.  In case there are any doubts about the matter, I think it is well to say that no person, unless he has received an export licence, is entitled to send out any goods subject to export control.  I want to make it clear also that every step possible will be taken to ensure that no breaches of the regulations occur.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the overall improvement in supplies, there is still a seller's market in a number of commodities and that market will continue to be there so long as demand is in excess of supply.  The maintenance of price control is, therefore, necessary in one form or another.  The powers which are given in regard to price control by the 1946 Act have the advantage of enabling frequent adjustments of maximum price control to be made according as the supply position requires such adjustments to be made in the interests of consumers.  It is true that a strong case can be made for acquiring powers of price control by permanent legislation, but until the Government has a longer experience of the conditions obtaining and when supplies become more plentiful, it has not been considered desirable to introduce any permanent legislation.</P>
    <P>While it is necessary to seek approval of the Dáil for the retention of the powers conferred by the 1946 Act, it has been and will continue to be the policy of the Government to abandon emergency controls as soon as they can be abandoned.  It is the practice to review the operation of each control periodically with a view to seeing whether it can be abandoned or, if not, whether it can be modified.  A special survey was made at my instance during the course of the year of the emergency controls still in operation in order to make sure that the periodical reviews had been effective. <Col N="1638" />  An indication of the extent to which the policy of removing or relaxing controls has been pursued may be gathered from the fact that the rationing schemes for soap and margarine were abolished; non-subsidised flour of 75 per cent. extraction was made available and flour and bread confectionery made from it were removed from rationing; control of the distribution of kerosene and fuel oil was also abolished; the arrangements for the rationing of petrol substantially modified; restrictions on the use of bread and flour with meals in restaurants were removed; and, as I have already mentioned, local authority and subsidy houses were omitted from building control; the rationing of cocoa Order was revoked; restrictions on a number of other commodities were also revoked or modified.  The list of goods removed from export licensing control is too long to read to the House, but I may say that it covers no less than 75 groups of articles.  In the case of tea, it became necessary during the year to modify the rationing arrangements so as to ensure that there would be no loss of subsidy.  Tea and sugar were made available for sale outside the rations, but not at the subsidised prices.  A concession was also made which allowed new entrants to the retail tea and sugar trade to obtain licences.  Facilities are also available for the licensing of new wholesalers in these commodities.</P>
    <P>Prices Orders which were in existence in respect of a number of commodities, including such things as oatmeal, canned fish, rice, maize meal, paper, footwear and timber, were revoked.  It is also the intention, as Deputies are aware, to remove the control on the purchase of timber from 31st March next.  In addition, the number of Emergency Powers Orders still in force has been brought up to date and a list will shortly be on sale for the public at the Stationery Office.  The list is too long for me to read to the House.  It deals with a variety of Orders too complicated to mention now, but if Deputies have any specific questions to ask I shall give them the information they require when replying.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary knows that we have given very careful consideration to the question as to whether this Bill should or should not receive an unopposed passage.  If we have come tentatively to the conclusion that we can assent to the enactment of the Bill for another year, it must not be taken from that that we are not completely dissatisfied with the failure of the Government to transfer into more permanent legislation whatever remains of these emergency powers which it desires to have continued.  The Supplies and Services Act stemmed from the Emergency Powers Act passed at the beginning of the war.  That Act conferred powers upon the Government to take measures by way of Government decree or Ministerial Order to do various things, including the provision and control of supplies and services essential to the life of the community.  The Supplies and Services Act, itself, confines the power which it gives the Government in relation to supplies to commodities which are essential to the life of the community.  Many of the Orders made under this Act by the Minister and the Government may relate to commodities worthy of that description but very many of them do not.  It could be argued that it is an abuse of the powers conferred upon the Government by this Act to use it for controlling the supplies or controlling the prices of commodities which are, in no sense of the term, essential to the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had hoped in 1947 to secure the enactment of legislation which would have gone a long way, if not the whole way, towards putting price control upon a permanent and more satisfactory basis than it is now under temporary legislation.  That Bill had not been enacted when the change of Government took place and the incoming Government has done nothing to alter the present position of the law in regard to price control.  They are still continuing to exercise the control under the Supplies and Services Act&mdash; an emergency Act which is expressed to give them powers only in relation to essential commodities.  I think it is more than time the Government took action to dispense with these emergency powers in relation to price control <Col N="1640" /> and other matters.  I put price control first because it is a subject upon which we have had debates in the past. It is a subject upon which the members now forming the Government frequently expressed themselves, when they were in opposition, for the purpose of urging the need for new legislation&mdash;legislation of a permanent kind which would take some of the arbitrary powers which the Minister now possesses from his hands and give them to some other authority.  Not merely has the legislation which was partially enacted in 1947 not been proceeded with, but nothing has been done.  At the end of two years of Coalition Government the Parliamentary Secretary asks for a renewal of these emergency powers upon the ground that they are still necessary.  Price control powers are still necessary but they do not have to be obtained and obtained under this Act.  If the Minister or the Government would exert themselves they could produce here and I think should produce before this time next year, proposals for permanent legislation because it is to be assumed that we will require here in our circumstances some machinery for price control permanently.</P>
    <P>I do not agree that the necessity for maintaining exchange control alone justifies the continuation of the Supplies and Services Act.  I cannot see that there is any difficulty in transferring to another temporary Bill the provisions of the Supplies and Services Act relating to that matter nor would the doing of it in any way diminish the powers now possessed by the Government or interfere with their flexibility. I want, therefore, to emphasise that if we agree to the enactment of this Bill and the continuation of the Supplies and Services Act for another year it is in the expectation that before this time next year effective action will have to be taken to enact whatever permanent legislation is required to continue these powers into the future or to dispense with whatever other controls which are not to be maintained on a permanent basis.  In that connection, it is perhaps appropriate on this Bill to ask the Government for a declaration of their intentions concerning the duration of the emergency in the legal sense.  As <Col N="1641" /> the Deputies know, the powers which the Government exercised during the war, the extra constitutional powers, were effective because the House passed a resolution under the appropriate Article of the Constitution after the commencement of hostilities in Europe.  That resolution has never been revoked.  I think it is true to say that none of the legislation now in operation and no Act of the Government in recent years depends for its validity upon that resolution.  If there is any reason why the state of emergency should be still kept officially in existence, we should be informed of it. If there is no reason for keeping that state of emergency in official existence then the necessary resolution should be produced to the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I want also to express considerable dissatisfaction with the way in which the powers of price regulation conferred upon the Government by the Supplies and Services Act were used during the past year.  So far as I can make out, from a study of the numerous Orders made a new and rather interesting technique is being applied. When prices are falling, in any event, the Minister makes a new Order fixing a lower maximum price for the goods concerned.</P>
    <P>When prices are rising, in any event, he withdraws control altogether. Deputies will have seen that happen only quite recently in regard to the price of whiskey.  The Minister revoked his powers to control the price of whiskey and the price went up.  They saw it happen earlier in relation to bacon.  There was a price control Order in existence.  It was revoked and the price went up although, apparently, the Parliamentary Secretary has no official information in regard to that.  I saw it happen in regard to footwear. There was a price control Order in existence; it was revoked and the price went up.  I saw it happen in regard to biscuits.  Every time, apparently, it seems inevitable that the Minister, if he keeps the powers of control, will have to sanction a higher price and take the public odium of doing so, he revokes the power and lets the price go as it likes.  In that way, most of the Orders which are being kept in force relate only to commodities the <Col N="1642" /> prices of which are relatively stable or likely to fall.</P>
    <P>Whenever we hear nowadays that some additional commodity is going to be released from price control we know the price is going to be put up.  When useful action could be taken to prevent prices rising, there have been instances where the Minister failed to act.  I mention the case of eggs.  I am interested in the decision of the Minister not to attempt to control the price of eggs during the recent period of scarcity.  I may confess to the Dáil that during many years when I was Minister I had frequent arguments with my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, during periods of egg scarcity, as to whether it was desirable to control prices or not.</P>
    <P>There could be a point of view expressed, naturally the point of view of everyone concerned with the interests of agricultural producers, that prices should not be controlled, that the effect of control would be to accentuate scarcity and that as the period of scarcity was in each year of limited duration, the market should be allowed to regulate itself.  It was contended that even if prices did rise, the effect would be to increase the flow of supplies to the market.  Against that was the view which I advanced, a view which I think was ultimately accepted practically on every occasion by the Government, that it was very problematical if the absence of control would increase supplies in a period of genuine scarcity and that there was an advantage to the consumer in keeping control in operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is precisely the point.  The Parliamentary Secretary is contending that because we controlled the price they went under the <Col N="1643" /> counter, in other words supplies tended to disappear from the market.  Our experience this year has shown that that clearly is unsound because eggs were not controlled in price, prices rose very high and still there was a scarcity.  Why did the price rise?  It rose because during the period of scarcity wholesalers who were in the trade competed with one another in order to get supplies for themselves and to maintain the flow to their customers.  If the Government had acted at the right time by imposing control, then the scarcity would have been no more severe than it was and the price would have been less.</P>

At no time during the war, did the price of eggs rise to as high a figure as this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask for a better explanation than we have been given as to why rationing has been maintained for many commodities?  Everybody knows that petrol rationing is a farce.  Is that not correct?  Every Deputy knows that petrol rationing is ridiculous at the present time.  There is no motor-car owner in the country who has not got coupons to spare. Why, then, is the Department going to the expense and the trouble of maintaining an elaborate organisation to dole out petrol coupons when there is enough petrol to enable supplies to be made freely available?  I understand from the Parliamentary Secretary that we are rationing petrol now merely to keep the machinery of rationing in working order, that he foresees the possibility, not next year but at some future time, of petrol having to be rationed on a more restricted basis and that against that possibility we have this elaborate organisation unnecessarily at the present time.  Did I understand the Parliamentary Secretary to say that we are going to have a full <Col N="1645" /> year's coupons in one book next year? Is it going to convenience any motor-car user to take that round with him every time he uses his car?  If there is a more sensible reason for rationing petrol at present, what is it?  It seems to me that for some reason the Parliamentary Secretary is not being frank with the Dáil concerning petrol rationing.</P>

      <P>Against the contingency that at some time petrol will become scarce again we keep rationing in operation now.  I can see the administrative mind at work there&mdash;more anxious to avoid the trouble of having to recreate the rationing organisation in a hurry at some later date rather than effect economies now.  I am quite sure that the officers of the Department of Industry and Commerce who are now occupied with this farcical business of petrol rationing could be put to far more useful purposes.  Why are we rationing bread, tea, sugar, butter?  There is no scarcity of these commodities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is again necessary to refer here to the provisions of the Act under which that rationing has been maintained. Ministers were given power to control supplies of these commodities if they were scarce and if it was essential to the life of the community that that control should be exercised.  We know there is enough bread, tea, sugar and butter available to enable rationing to be abolished but it is not being abolished for a financial reason, because the Government has inaugurated this differential price system under which some portion of available commodities are subsidised in price and the balance is available for those who can afford to pay a much higher price.  That may be a good policy or a bad policy.  I do not want to argue that at the moment, but I do say that the implementation of that policy under the Supplies and Services Act is an abuse of the Act. <Col N="1646" /> If the Government wish to perpetuate that policy, then there is an obligation on them to come to the Dáil with specific proposals for legislation designed to achieve it.</P>
    <P>I dislike this system of differential prices.  It is not necessary to maintain rationing just because prices are subsidised.  The prices of some of these commodities were subsidised before they were rationed.  The price of butter was, in fact, subject to Government control both in regard to sales at home and abroad, to levies and to subsidies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The production, which is a different thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite practicable to abolish the rationing of these commodities and still subsidise them.  The subsidy to the bread prices is affected by regulating the price of wheat and the whole of the available supplies of imported wheat are canalised through Grain Importers, Limited, a Government operation by which the subsidy can be made up.  The same applies to sugar and to butter and at present it applies to tea, although personally I have a desire to see a restoration of the situation in which tea would be again available as it was before the war in varying quantities at varying prices.  The present system necessitates the bulking of all tea and its sale at a uniform price or prices.  I think also that, if we are to make further progress in our efforts to direct the trade in tea from the countries of origin to this country, to eliminate as we tried to do in the years immediately after the war reliance upon the British tea market, then we must speed up the restoration of the tea trade to what con be described as normal conditions, conditions approximating to those that existed before the war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no reason why we should ration bread except for this purpose of making available supplies of a theoretically better quality at a higher price&mdash;double the price, in fact&mdash;to those who need it.  That scheme has, however, been largely a failure.  The public demand for that type of bread is nil and most of the larger bakeries are not using the unsubsidised flour. It has, however, been imposed compulsorily <Col N="1647" /> upon the confectionery trade, with the effect of increasing confectionery costs and reducing the consumption of flour confectionery.  I wonder what the relation of the saving in the subsidy is to the cost of administering the bread ration, and whether there has been a gain to the Exchequer to the extent asserted by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>In the case of sugar, not merely is there free sale at a higher price above the ration, but a completely uneconomic price is being charged to manufacturers of sugar confectionery.  They are being taxed in the price of sugar for the purpose of reducing the cost of the subsidy.  The effect of that tax has been, not merely to increase the price of jams and other forms of sugar confectionery, but seriously to interfere with the possibility of developing an export trade in these commodities, a possibility which did exist, at any rate, a short time ago, although I cannot say from personal knowledge whether it exists now.</P>
    <P>The same is true of butter.  We must assume that there is enough butter to enable butter rationing to be done away with, because the Minister for Agriculture was promising early this year that before it ended we would be exporting butter.  Why then is butter rationing still continued?  The powers conferred on the Government by the Supplies and Services Act were not intended to be used for the purpose of controlling these commodities on any other grounds except scarcity and the importance of that control to the life of the community.</P>
    <P>It may be necessary, but I am becoming increasingly doubtful of the utility of maintaining control over building activities.  That system of control now in operation was inaugurated in the Department of Industry and Commerce in my time and was designed to concentrate the available supplies of materials and the available skilled labour upon the production of houses by local authorities or houses of the kind to which the Housing Acts applied.  I know that criticism was expressed at the fact that, in the early stages of that control, licences were <Col N="1648" /> given fairly freely for the building of houses of a better type or for other forms of building activities.  I think it is no harm to mention here that the reason why that policy was followed&mdash; it was explained in a White Paper issued to the Dáil&mdash;was that after the war, when building activity again became possible on an enlarged scale, it was found that the private builder was able to swing into action a lot more speedily than the local authority.  That is easy enough to understand.  The private builder was largely responsible to no one but himself and he based his plans upon his knowledge of his own capacity, financial or otherwise.  The local authority had to proceed in accordance with the routine procedure of getting the necessary sanction for the expenditure and the plans it proposed to implement.  It did happen, therefore, that during the first year of control the output of houses by local authorities did not much exceed half the total production that year.  If we had attempted to use the power of control to restrict the production of a better type of houses by the speculative builder or private enterprise at a time when the local authorities were not ready to start, the effect would have been to have forced into unemployment and, therefore, into emigration a considerable proportion of the existing labour supply.  We, therefore, deemed it good policy to keep up the maximum activity in the building trade, hoping by that means to retain in the country the building workers who were here and to attract back those who emigrated during the war so that, when the local authorities were ready to carry out activities on a full scale, they would be facilitated in every way.</P>
    <P>Despite statements which have been made to the contrary, I want to assert that at no time from the commencement of control over building activities did any local authority ever fail to secure by return of post the necessary licence to commence operations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have explained what I think is the reason.  A local authority, <Col N="1649" /> in order to start building, has to go through various proceedings before it can clear the site, prepare plans, and before the plans are finally approved of and the final arrangements fixed up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am saying is that if we had not allowed speculative building activity to begin at that period the local authorities could not have absorbed the labour because they were not ready, and the risk was that those unemployed building workers would have to emigrate in greater numbers. By keeping the activity at full pitch, we were able to say, and did say, to the local authorities: &ldquo;Expand your activities at the maximum rate and be sure of this, that as you expand, we will limit other activities so as to ensure that you will be fully facilitated.&rdquo;  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>When dealing with this matter last week I gave to the House a statement made by the Parliamentary Secretary.  The statement was that he told his constituents down in Galway that between £15,000 and £20,000 was going to be taken off the backs of the ratepayers because he was going to do all the boreens in the country that connected any two roads through the Board of Works under a 100 per cent. grant.  The Parliamentary Secretary demanded that I should give him the quotation.  Unfortunately, I did not have it with me then, but I told him I would have it before I finished on <Col N="1650" /> this motion.  I now want to carry out my promise.  I am quoting from the <i>Irish Press</i> of Tuesday, April 20th, 1948:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Mr. Donnellan stated that between £15,000 and £20,000 would be saved to the ratepayers in each county this year for work in making new roads and connecting public roads.  The cost of making such roads would be paid from the Board of Works, provided the county councils undertook their maintenance.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That statement was given by me in the Dáil on July 2, 1948.  Therefore, if it was not correct the Parliamentary Secretary had a pretty long period in which to correct it.  Acting on that statement, £78,000 worth of work on those roads was prepared by the engineers to the Cork County Council. The list of works was sent up to the Board of Works.  Last week, when I asked the engineers how many of those roads had been done, they told me not one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear now that those roads will have to be done under the rural improvement schemes.  That is all the more reason why I and other <Col N="1651" /> rural Deputies should support this motion when we find that the Parliamentary Secretary's guarantee on this is not to be relied on.  If we can get the contribution increased from 75 per cent. to 90 per cent. under the motion, even if we have to pay 10 per cent. extra in the case of these roads, we will be saving 15 per cent. on them. There will be that difference of 10 per cent. between the 90 per cent. and the 100 per cent. spoken of by the Parliamentary Secretary.  That is why I am in favour of the motion.</P>
      <P>When I was speaking here last week I did not know then that the Parliamentary Secretary had completely ratted from, or had completely forgotten, the speech he made to his constituents in Galway.  Therefore, I said last week that those roads, on account of the Parliamentary Secretary's guarantee, would not come under these rural improvement schemes.  Now I find I was mistaken because when I consulted the county surveyor I discovered what had happened.  Therefore, I have to come back and say that when we are not getting the 100 per cent. grant, that is all the more reason why we should support this motion for a 90 per cent. grant.  When speaking here last week I gave instances of the position of people living on cul-de-sac roads.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion is clearly a demand to the Government to increase the contribution towards rural improvement schemes.  The motion, however, does not suggest that the scope of those schemes should be extended to embrace other roads of a certain type.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to go into the matter too closely.  In view of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's statement I will have to see that the people in my native county are getting the advantage from these rural improvement schemes which embrace all cul-de-sac roads.  When Deputy Smith was introducing a Bill in this House one of the principal reasons he gave for the necessity of it was these cul-de-sac roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I dealt with all that exhaustively <Col N="1652" /> last week.  I certainly consider that the people living on those cul-de-sac roads are the most deserving section of our community.  They pay for the maintenance and upkeep of roads for other people and get nothing for themselves.  I know that there is only a certain time allowed for the consideration of this motion, and hence I do not want to delay the House longer.  I got up mainly for the purpose of giving the quotation which was asked for.  In conclusion, I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will give way to the very fair and modest demand which the motion makes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support this motion.  However, I do not think a very good case could be made for increasing the grant to 90 per cent. in every case, as in many instances the applicant should be in a position to contribute 25 per cent. under the existing scheme. There are, to my knowledge, many small farmers in West Cork who are not in a position to contribute the 25 per cent., and I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that the scheme be amended so as to give the Office of Public Works authority to step up the Government contribution in any case where they are satisfied that the applicant is not in a financial position to meet the present contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I was glad when this motion was put down to consider the question of the contribution towards rural improvement schemes, because I have great sympathy with anyone occupying the position of the Parliamentary Secretary in developing a scheme and in making it a success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think the question of whether the grant should be increased from 75 to 90 per cent. can be separated from the general problem of dealing with cul-de-sac roads.  I think a lot of people are not aware that the total length of non-public roads is some 20,000 to 30,000 miles, compared with 50,000 of public roads.  Their condition, taken as a whole, is very bad indeed, except in areas where there is such a volume of special employment schemes grants that all these non-public roads get repaired. <Col N="1653" /> When you have a problem involving thousands of miles of roads, it seems to me the time has come to re-examine the whole question of the administration of road repair and consider whether these roads could not be brought into a general system of road repair.  During the period of the last Government, a Deputy put down a resolution calling on the Government to amend legislation so that local authorities would be responsible for all these roads.</P>
    <P>I happened to take part in the debate as Parliamentary Secretary and I pointed out the enormous financial responsibility.  I pointed out also that at that time it was urgently necessary to restore the main and county roads to their pre-war condition and that money could not be found so easily to deal with the non-public roads.  I did at the time say we could not postpone that question for ever; that we could not postpone the question whether we were to deal with the repair of these cul-de-sac roads by a series of piecemeal methods, none of them satisfactory and none of them securing continuous repair and improvement. These are roads which, as Deputy Corry says, are of great importance to the small farmers.</P>
    <P>In actual fact, as anyone knows who hears about the prices at which farms are sold, the value of land and the buildings associated with them decreases very much the further down a holding is from a properly repaired county road.  As every Deputy knows, it is often hard to get any price at all for a farm which has thoroughly bad and defective communications.</P>
    <P>So far as the link roads are concerned, I would like to hear the Parliamentary Secretary describe the present position and to give the House some idea of the conditions under which the Board of Works gives a 100 per cent. grant.  I think a lot of county councils are not aware that, under certain conditions, if they take over a link road after it has been repaired by the Board of Works on the basis of a 100 per cent. grant, that that grant will be forthcoming.  I think quite a lot of work could be done under <Col N="1654" /> that head if the facts were made known on a wider basis.</P>
    <P>So far as cul-de-sac roads are concerned, there are three methods of repairing them.  It is possible to get a bog development grant for repairing a road mostly concerned with the removal of turf; but there are roads where there is a marginal case for a bog development grant and a very good case for a grant under another head.  Because of the existence of this triple method of getting grants, roads very often fail to get a grant and perhaps cannot get it because there is not sufficient unemployment in the area.</P>
    <P>Then we have the special employment schemes grant based upon the degree of unemployment in an electoral division.  Leaving politics aside for the moment, there is no question that emigration has taken place on such a scale that in many areas where there are small farms and where the people could use these grants, there are not enough unemployed in the electoral division to qualify for the grants.  If the Parliamentary Secretary chooses to deny that for political reasons, let us keep the question on another basis and say that the people in the area do not register and, as a result, the work does not get done.  There are areas where there were considerable numbers of unemployed and for which very large grants were forthcoming, but the number registered in January each year has gone down to such a point that there is now no money to repair such roads.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>That has nothing to do with rural improvements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The people will not go in for rural improvements schemes in that area because they are not accustomed or because they are too poor and they may expect to get a grant from the special employment schemes office.  One of the difficulties of getting roads repaired is that there are any number of marginal areas where, because there are special employment schemes grants, people will not go in for rural improvements schemes as they always hope they will get a grant. Equally, there are areas where there are not enough unemployed, where the <Col N="1655" /> farms are small and where they will not get a special employment schemes grant.</P>
      <P>There is the well-known difficulty of the failure to get people to contribute to a rural improvements scheme and there is the difficulty of getting small farmers to give their contributions even though if they work on the scheme they will earn more than the contributions. I wish the Parliamentary Secretary would advertise in some way what people could earn if they took part in the work.  If a man gives 25 per cent. of the cost of a scheme, he gets 35 per cent.</P>
      <P>In the ordinary case in the repair of a road he gets back the contribution and something more as well, and if he has a horse and cart he gets even more still.  A lot of people do not know that and do not take part in these schemes.  There are three types of grant for dealing with the cul-de-sac roads, none of which is entirely satisfactory and these roads become worse and worse in relation to the condition of the public roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present Government stresses the importance of repairing the county roads.  They are also giving some grants towards the repair and restoration of main roads.  Generally speaking, since about 1930 the condition of the public roads has greatly improved in comparison with the condition of these boreens and culs-de-sac.  I do not know whether the adoption of this motion would solve the problem.  If the Government contributes 90 per cent. of the cost it might as well contribute the whole cost and it might as well save all the administrative difficulty of increasing the rural improvements schemes grant by basing it on the comparative need of each area and arranging to give so much money in accordance with that need.  The Government might as well give the 100 per cent. and save itself all the administrative work and the drawing-up of estimates.  I would like to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary whether he considers that the administrative complications involved in estimation and contribution would be offset by such a method.  I would like to hear from him what the saving would <Col N="1656" /> be to the State as between 90 per cent. and 100 per cent.  It seems to me that the 10 per cent. would not be worth it.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary if the time is not opportune to ask all the Departments concerned to consider in conference the future of these roads.  The emergency has passed.  Materials are fully available.  The problem arises as to whether or not the transport of the country contributes sufficient by way of taxation towards the upkeep of our roads.  It would be very useful if the Parliamentary Secretary would form a committee to examine how far a rationalised system could be evolved to take over the 20,000 miles of non-public roads, a proportion which is remarkably high compared with the total mileage of the country.  The problem cannot be long deferred.  We, at least, had the excuse that we were repairing the damage done during the emergency. The Parliamentary Secretary no longer has that excuse.  He should put his mind to the task of consulting with the other Departments involved in a effort to rationalise this problem of the repair of non-public roads.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think my colleague, Deputy Murphy, has possibly hit upon what is the most sensible approach to this problem.  I sympathise with the proposer of the motion, but I am not too sure that he has found the solution. The rural improvements scheme is not an ideal one.  One of its peculiar defects is that the 25 per cent. contribution is levied irrespective of circumstances.  We are all aware that there are certain sections of the farming community who benefit under this scheme who could quite easily pay a much bigger contribution than 25 per cent.  We all know, too, that the people in the congested areas do not benefit to the same extent.  While the scheme is all right in theory it defeats itself in practice.  As Deputy Childers said, it is possible for a man to earn back more than he pays by way of contribution.  When a man is in very needy circumstances, it is no answer to his economic problem that he can earn that back by way of wages because his budget still shows a nil return.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1657" /> I think Deputy Murphy has taken the right line, but I would press the Parliamentary Secretary a little further.  I think the whole scheme should be recast to enable the Parliamentary Secretary to give a full and complete grant where circumstances justify it.  I suggest that most of the money and the scheme should be diverted into the congested areas.  I commend to the House the spirit that actuated this motion, but I think that what looks to be a simple solution may, in fact, prove a difficult one.  I think it would be better if the Parliamentary Secretary adopted the policy that in areas such as he and I represent there should be discretion to give the full grant.  In that way at least we would give to the people in these areas a transitory livelihood which might induce those people we so badly need at home to remain at home.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think all Deputies must agree that there is a substantial case for this motion.  A 75 per cent. grant may look generous on the face of it but we must remember that the people who have these unsatisfactory roads leading to their homes are amongst the poorest sections of the community.  To them a contribution of 25 per cent. is a very substantial sum.  I do not think Deputy Collins' solution of the problem is the best one.  Subdividing the country into areas and giving certain privileges to certain districts would lead to civil war.  I do not think there is any county in which there are not any poor.  We are told that the poor are always with us.  There are poor people in every rural area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While you might, for example, pick out what is described as agriculturally prosperous counties and say that they should be excluded from the full benefit of this scheme, I think it would be possible for any conscientious Deputy to lead the Parliamentary Secretary or the officials of his Department to certain definite cases in those particular areas that are as much in need of assistance as any in the most impoverished areas in the country.  I have come across, in County Wicklow, accommodation roadways, leading to farmers' houses in the mountain areas, <Col N="1658" /> which are simply terrible.  One wonders how the people ever have the fortitude to live under the circumstances under which they live&mdash;roads perhaps one or two or even three miles long which are little more than rough tracks in the mountain.  I have even come across one particular case in which the farmer or the two farmers living on that particular laneway have to travel more than half a mile to the road, along the bed of a stream, that is, the laneway is both a stream and a laneway at the same time.  Apparently nothing can be done about it without very considerable expense, much more than the people concerned would be able to undertake.</P>
    <P>I think there is a great deal to be said for the proposal that a certain amount of discretion should be given to the Parliamentary Secretary and his officials in regard to this matter.  A 75 per cent. grant may be adequate in many cases but I think the Department should be given discretion in certain cases to raise the grant to as high as 90 per cent.  As these particular roadways are bordering on the property of the people concerned, I do not think it would be altogether fair to demand a 100 per cent. grant, particularly as people have the opportunity of earning back a portion of their contribution.  I think that in certain areas the proportion contributed by the State could be increased.  I have often wondered&mdash; and I think the problem arises more in County Wicklow than in any other county&mdash;whether it is possible to apply this scheme to laneways occupied or used by only one ratepayer.  It might be regarded as being unnecessary to give assistance in the case of laneways leading to only one house and affecting only one person but, in some portions of County Wicklow, such laneways may be of very considerable length.  Owing to the rough and hilly nature of the county, holdings may be very large and yet the livelihood derived therefrom may be very small.  Therefore I should like if, in certain cases, it could be found possible to apply this scheme to work of that kind.</P>
    <P>I think this motion commends itself to the support and sympathy of every Deputy on every side of this House and that the Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="1659" /> should have no difficulty in accepting it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilbride" hpid="Mr. Gilbride Mr. Gilbride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilbride</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to say a few words in approval of this motion although I do not believe that this motion will solve the difficulty.  The rural improvements scheme was a very good scheme but it had two very serious faults (1) the people in poor areas were not able to subscribe, and (2) a crank could hold up the whole scheme.</P>
      <P>This motion is not going to remedy that difficulty&mdash;even the 90 per cent.&mdash; if one man on one of these lands objects, because this motion is not going to compel him to let the rest of the people avail of that grant.  The whole trouble with this is the 1925 Act. I never could understand the mentality of the people who stopped the county councils from repairing these roads for these poor people on the hillsides, while these people had to pay rates to keep the roads of the rest of the country.  Section 25 of the Act of 1925 for the first time debarred councils from doing these, what I call, very useful works.  Until that section is amended or done away with there is not much use in attacking the problem in any other way.</P>
      <P>This motion is, in itself, an improvement.  However, it is not going to solve the difficulty while you have people who will object to their neighbours getting roads made and while you debar county councils from carrying out these useful bits of work, and maintenance, particularly.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to set his mind to it, as he has been asked to do by Deputy Childers, and to go into this whole question.  In the meantime, this motion is an improvement and is, therefore, worthy of support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this motion, like the other Deputies here, not that I believe that it is going to be the solution to the problems that moved Deputy Commons to put it down but because I believe that it will bring to a head in the special employment schemes office this whole question of the repair of cul-de-sac roads and accommodation roads, and also the cleaning of drains in rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1660" /> Deputy Childers, I think, made the most useful contribution that I have heard so far in this debate.  I am glad that he asked other Deputies to keep this matter above Party politics.  I intend to follow in his footsteps as far as that is concerned.  Therefore, anything that I have to say on this particular debate will not, I hope, be taken as a crack at the previous Administration, in any circumstances. There are three ways of tackling the problems mentioned here&mdash;the repair of cul-de-sac roads and the cleaning of drains.  We have, first of all, the minor employment relief scheme, which is a full grant scheme.  We have the bog development scheme, which is, also, a full grant scheme.  We have, too, the rural improvements scheme.</P>
    <P>So far as I understand these three schemes the position is somewhat as follows.  The minor employment relief scheme operates where there is a registered number of unemployed.  The snag commences when we have to decide how many registered unemployed are necessary before a scheme takes place or is operated in the area. I get back, weekly, from the special employment schemes office a letter of regret telling me that &ldquo;Owing to the fact that there is not a number of registered unemployed in the area we regret the work you recommend cannot be undertaken&rdquo;.  Sometimes I am informed, in some periods, that it is necessary to have 12 unemployed in the particular townland.  That number varies another year to 16 and it may even be less.  On what system do the special employment schemes office base their figures?  Is it a fact, say, that in a particular year when it is necessary to have 12 unemployed to undertake a scheme, if there are ten registered unemployed in the area a minor relief scheme cannot be undertaken?</P>
    <P>Then there is the bog development scheme.  When a Deputy fails to get a particular work done under the minor relief scheme he tries to see if it is possible to have that work undertaken as a bog development scheme, especially if turf is being taken out on that particular road.  The answer he gets this time from the Department is also &ldquo;I regret&rdquo;, and the reason for the regret <Col N="1661" /> is that the cost of the work in question is too much when the amount of turf produced is taken into consideration. For sheer farce I think it is hard to beat that.  That is, at any rate, why that particular scheme was turned down.</P>
    <P>There is a third and last method of doing that particular work and that is by means of a rural improvements scheme.  I think a rural improvements scheme where 25 per cent. of the cost&mdash; often less, often only 15 per cent. of the cost&mdash;is asked from the local people is a useful scheme but when in one townland a full grant is given under a scheme and when in the village beside it people are asked to contribute 25 per cent., naturally word goes round that the boys in such and such a village two miles away got a full grant, and the people who have to pay 25 per cent. of the cost see no reason why they should not get a full grant also.  It is alleged in that case that some local fellow was able to exercise a political pull and that he got a full grant for the scheme in the favoured village.</P>
    <P>That is the whole thing in a nutshell. I am not making any Party capital out of it, and the reason I am supporting this motion is to clear up this trouble. I think Deputy Gilbride made a very useful suggestion in that regard.  That suggestion would be of immense value if it were followed in my own constituency where, as I have already pointed out, 120 miles of cul-de-sac roads that in former years were repaired by the county council are now taken off the repair list.  The point is that these roads have been repaired every three years for the past 25 years by the county council, but because an auditor comes down from Dublin and decides that the county council should not have done these roads in the past, they are now knocked off the repair list and the people must have recourse to a rural improvements scheme.</P>
    <P>I can picture the state of mind of people in a village where a road has been repaired every three years as far back as they can remember, and now they are suddenly told that this road should not have been repaired by the county council and that in future they will have to contribute to the repair <Col N="1662" /> of it.  There is a solution to that problem and it lies to a great extent in the hands of the Parliamentary Secretary.  I know that the county council &mdash;I am speaking for the county council, and I am sure other Deputies can bear me out&mdash;is quite prepared to spend money on the repair of these cul-de-sac roads.  A matter that is very often criticised in this House is this question of centralisation&mdash;looking to Dublin for everything we want.  We have a special employment schemes office in Dublin with quite a number of inspectors and an office staff attached to it.  These inspectors have to go very often to the West of Ireland to inspect a few schemes down there.  They come back to Dublin and may have to go down again.  That costs money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>He is not fit to settle the row; it is the poor unfortunate local T.D. who has to do that.  I want to emphasise the point made by Deputy Gilbride that these works, such as cleaning drains and the repair of cul-de-sac roads, should be one of the first duties undertaken by the county council.  They are charged with local administration and, above everything else, the repair of cul-de-sac roads and byroads is their job.  The main roads should be a charge on the central funds.  If we have agreement amongst all members of the county council that they are prepared to look after drains and cul-de-sac roads, why employ a big staff here in Dublin to send them all over the country to inspect these works?  Nobody knows better than the <Col N="1663" /> members of local authorities what schemes should be carried out and nobody has a better idea of the hardships that local people have to endure.  The people here in Dublin are not fit judges of these matters.</P>
      <P>Some Deputy recalled the old saying: &ldquo;The poor we shall always have with us&rdquo;.  While that may be applicable in many areas at present, I hope that we shall see conditions remedied to a great extent in the rural areas before many years have passed.  The case was made that similar facilities with regard to minor relief schemes on a full grant basis should be made available in all counties but I do not think that anybody can deny that the congested districts deserve more attention than other areas.  Those counties in which the congestion problem still exists deserve special attention.  They are a special problem in themselves and as such special arrangements should be made to deal with them.  They should get full grant schemes for works such as bog drains or roads.</P>
      <P>I said in the beginning that this motion in itself will not solve this problem.  Other Deputies have pointed out how a local crank, because he does not use as much of the road as his neighbour or because he may be too old to work on it, may hold up a scheme.  It may be that it is an old maid who is concerned who does not like to see her neighbour getting the advantage of something to which she feels she is more entitled.  That particular difficulty cannot be remedied under Deputy Commons' motion.  Cases like that could be dealt with of course if the same powers were made available in connection with special employment schemes as were made available under the Local Authorities (Works) Act but I think great care should be exercised before such powers are given in cases like these.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another point that I should like to mention seeing that we have got a certain amount of scope from the Leas-Cheann Comhairle on these matters.  Each year there is a list published of minor relief schemes and bog development schemes in the different counties.  This list is circulated so far as I know at the request of various <Col N="1664" /> Deputies.  I should like to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary what is the reason why that list is issued at all or publicised for the benefit of Deputies?  Is it because it is necessary at times that political capital has to be made out of different schemes that are sanctioned on the list?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will give us some information on that point when he is replying.  I should like to conclude by saying that if this motion goes through, I hope there will be no shortage of money for the schemes in question.  To my mind, there is always a danger when a motion like this goes through that the number of schemes sanctioned will not be increased; in other words, that there may be no increase in the particular grant each year for the special employment schemes and for the rural improvement schemes.  If it is carried out properly, I know that it will mean that a certain increase will have to be given in the rural improvement scheme grant.  But, when you take into consideration the benefit which these schemes are going to be in rural areas, the little extra money involved will be very small indeed and will be money well spent. As I said, this motion in itself is not a solution of the problem.  It is going to bring that problem to a head.  I hope it will mean that the various people concerned will put their heads together and plan out something on the line of giving authority to the different local authorities to undertake this work themselves and that a grant each year out of the Central Fund will be given to them to carry out this necessary work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFlynn" hpid="Mr. J. Flynn Mr. J. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this motion. Like other speakers, I believe that this grant should be increased.  In fact, I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to consider the advisability of giving a 100 per cent. grant if necessary to certain congested areas, of which there is a number in South Kerry.  I would go <Col N="1665" /> so far as to say that there are areas even in my county where a 75 per cent. grant would suffice.  In certain areas the people are better circumstanced and could afford to make a substantial contribution and I think that would be an equitable distribution.  I could make a case for areas where it should be 100 per cent. and where last year the special employment office went as far as they possibly could.  I give them full credit for that.  In Waterville and Cahirciveen they offered as much as 85 per cent. or 90 per cent., but unfortunately the people were not able to put up the other 10 per cent. out of their resources.  In that type of district I suggest a 100 per cent. grant.</P>
      <P>I further suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary should take over the carrying out of these schemes and have his own engineers in charge of that type of work.  In my opinion, it would be much better to have them worked on the same system as the minor relief schemes.  These rural improvement schemes are being carried out partly by the special employment schemes office and partly by the county councils. I understand that the county councils supervise them through their engineers and appoint people for carrying them through.  I maintain that the Parliamentary Secretary should have complete control and have his own engineers, as in the case of the minor relief schemes, rather than have the work divided in this way.</P>
      <P>A point was made about the cul-de-sac roads.  That is a new departure on the part of the Local Government Department.  I think that that matter should be examined both by the special employment schemes office and the Department of Local Government.  It is of vital importance to rural districts that these roads should be developed and repaired.  At present the Kerry County Council are debarred from expending any money on these roads. The result will be that they will deteriorate and great hardship will be caused to the people living on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have experience of this type of work and I appreciate the efforts of the special employment schemes office. Last year a number of farmers refused to contribute to the repair of one of <Col N="1666" /> these roads because the road was a cul-de-sac and they would not benefit as much as the others who were adjacent to the public road.  The special employment scheme office, however, facilitated the two farmers who were prepared to contribute and did that section of the road.  That, of course, was unsatisfactory, but I am quoting it to show that the officials in charge went as far as they possibly could to meet us.</P>
    <P>There are various anomalies in the whole system and I think that it is only by consultation between the Parliamentary Secretary and the Department of Local Government that we can make a success of this.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to consider having his own engineer in County Kerry.  I understand that the case put up by the Department of Finance was that it was cheaper to get the county engineer and the deputy surveyors to supervise minor relief schemes, turf development schemes and that sort of work.  Nevertheless, I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to consider having his own engineers in charge of that type of work and directly responsible to him, rather than have it piecemeal as it is at present.  The Board of Works carry out certain types of inspection work and the county council engineer comes along to do the other portion.  That is not satisfactory.  I ask him to adopt that system and to make it possible for one central authority to deal with the whole matter&mdash;to have his engineer with his staff under his direct control operating in Kerry, independent of the other engineers or anybody else.  We are all happy to support the motion, and I hope the Parliamentary Secretary can see his way to accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinOSullivan" hpid="Mr. M. O'Sullivan Mr. M. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to offer my congratulations to Deputy Commons for the very excellent case he made for the motion. It may seem strange that I, as a city representative, should intervene in this debate at all, but as it so happens I have a particular knowledge of the types of questions with which the motion deals.  I have also a close association with what may be described as the comparable work that is done here in the city.  It is true <Col N="1667" /> that, any time a public representative in the city or country intervenes to improve the living conditions of the people, his work is highly appreciated. I have found that to be so in the City of Dublin, that when a public representative intervenes to try and improve roadways, laneways, lighting and so on, his work is highly appreciated, and that by thousands of people who do not care one tittle what the colour of his politics are.  The position in rural Ireland is just the same.</P>
      <P>When this scheme was introduced it was a very desirable and commendable one.  It has now been in operation for a number of years and, as many of the speakers have suggested, the time would appear to have arrived for a recasting of it.  Deputy Gilbride made the point which interested me very much, that a scheme can be torpedoed if there is one individual living on a right of way who will not sign the form of assent.  That unfortunately is too true.  There is also, of course, a very invidious obligation placed on one individual living on that right of way.  He has to prepare the necessary memorial and subsequently to gather the funds that are needed to meet the cost of the scheme.  As Deputy Commons has said, it is quite possible that it may be suggested that he had a personal interest in doing so.  As I say, there is room for a recasting of the scheme.  I think a good example is to be found in the Local Authorities (Works) Act passed last year.  Under it, if there is an unwilling person of the kind referred to, and the scheme proposed is considered to be a desirable one in the interests of the whole community, then it is the community interest that is going to prevail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the contribution I rather gathered from Deputy Commons that he had certain misgivings as to what percentage he should put down. It appears to me that a solution might be found if you had a fixed percentage grant which could be made available for works of this kind, and above that a sliding scale, up to 100 per cent. in cases where the works proposed to be undertaken were held to merit a full-cost grant.  I simply rose to make these few suggestions in so far as they <Col N="1668" /> may help the mover of the motion who, as I have said, made an excellent case for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to say a few words in support of the motion. I understand that the expenditure under these schemes is roughly about £100,000 a year.  What the motion proposes is the expenditure of approximately an additional £15,000.  Now, after what we did here this evening when we voted away £4,091,000 without blinking an eye, I think that the amount asked for in the motion is very small.  If the mover of it had to go the length of asking 100 per cent. contribution I certainly would support him, because, again, the amount involved would not exceed £25,000 which was the amount that we made available recently under the News Agency Bill.</P>
      <P>I agree with what has been said about the unwilling person who might torpedo a scheme.  I have mentioned examples of that sort in the House on a number of occasions previously.  I strongly recommend to the Department that powers ought to be taken to deal with an objector who is unreasonable in his objection, and is thereby holding up a work that would be of benefit to a whole area.  I have met deputations on many occasions in regard to these works, and have found that the limitation on the grant that is available is preventing quite a number of useful schemes from being carried out. It is because of my personal experience of the demands made by people in many parts of the country that I am contributing these few words in support of this motion which has the general support of the community throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very nice to be in the Dáil and to hear all that has been said by Deputies from rural areas, and to see so many more of them trying to get in to speak on it.  I regret some of them will not be able to do so. I can hardly congratulate Deputy Martin O'Sullivan for saying that, as a city Deputy, he had not a terrible lot of interest in rural schemes, because I know, from what I have seen in my office, that he takes a very great interest in one rural constituency.  In the <Col N="1669" /> special employment schemes office we deal with three classes of schemes: There is first the minor employment schemes, in respect of which we give a full cost grant where there is a sufficient number of registered unemployed. Secondly, in the case of bog development schemes we also give a full cost grant where the case can be made that, by doing work either on a bog road or on a drain into a bog, the work will increase the production of turf or will be a big advantage to people who get their turf from that bog.  The third class is the rural improvement schemes that we are dealing with now.  Owing to the fact that many Deputies talked of the other two schemes, I am sure the Chair will bear with me while I state the position.  These schemes relate to roads, bog drains or drainage work of any description.  As I have said, in the case of minor employment schemes, they are undertaken only where there is a sufficient number of registered unemployed.  We can give a full cost grant on bog development schemes.  In the case of rural improvement schemes 75 per cent. is the minimum grant given.  We can give up to 100 per cent. and have done so in cases.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corry made the statement, when speaking here last week, that since this Government got into power not one full cost grant was given.  I assured him that there had been.  He said &ldquo;no&rdquo;, and that he knew in his own area that full cost grants had been given by the previous Government, but that none had been given since the present Government got into power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He asked, in column 1338, Volume 9, of the 23rd November, 1949, if, when replying, I would produce one case in which a 100 per cent. grant was given. I looked over the list of rural improvement schemes since they were started in the year 1943 and I find that from 1943 to the day I took over the Board of Works and the special employment schemes office, on the 24th February, 1948, that two full cost grants were given in County Cork, amounting to £620.  I also find that since 24th February, 1948, not two years since the present Government came into power, we gave four full cost grants, amounting <Col N="1670" /> to £2,743, to the county.  Surely democracy is a great thing, but when democracy inflicts on us, or at least a quota of the electorate in Cork, a Deputy to challenge us in this House and to make false statements of that description, thanks be to God we can live with democracy&mdash;I hope we ever will&mdash;but I hope to God that class of democracy will soon change in Cork.</P>
    <P>Of course, it is a grand thing to try to make out that I made certain statements I did not live up to.  Deputy Childers and some other Deputies asked what is the position, and suggested that some county councils did not exactly know the position.  They wanted to know the position so that full cost grants might be given.  Deputy Beegan, an intelligent Deputy, put a question down to me some time ago in regard to that matter.  I will quote the reply I gave him, in column 2256.  I said that under the existing procedure for the rural improvement schemes a grant can be made for the repair of any road which connects two county roads without requiring a contribution from the adjoining landholders, provided (1) that the link is sufficiently important as a public road; (2) the cost is not excessive in relation to its utility; (3) the work is not one which the county council would otherwise have done out of its own funds; (4) the county council, with the approval of the Minister for Local Government, undertake to maintain the road on completion.  I gave that reply to Deputy Beegan in the Dáil and any statements I made through the country in connection with it are definitely statements on that line.</P>
    <P>Now, a rural improvement scheme possesses many advantages that Deputies here do not seem to realise. First and foremost, we give preference of the work on that road to the people who contribute.  They will get the first preference if they are willing to work on that road.  They can earn their 25 per cent. contribution plus the 75 per cent. given to them by the State, making a road into their own village.  Not alone that, but we give them permission to appoint a ganger, one of their own, provided he is a suitable man. <Col N="1671" /> That looks all very well, but there are objections.  I am quite sure you all remember when, on my Estimate last year or the year before, I said I was not too well pleased with the scheme. Deputy Smith, I think it was, wanted to know what I would do and what changes I would make and would I let the House know.  Ever since I worried over things that could be done.  Very often when you have a scheme you will find some loophole and you may have to scrap the whole thing.  I pressed our people on different occasions to take advantage of this scheme and, even though I did so, I felt it was not a good scheme; I felt it was a rich man's scheme because the position was that you found two people in an area, probably people with £200 or £300 valuation, living a mile off the public road. According to the Act the State was bound to contribute 75 per cent. of the cost of making the road for those two people.  In other areas you found ten or 12 householders huddled together, people who did not qualify for a full cost grant and they were asked to contribute the same amount of money.  I thought that was very unfair.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not say that at all.  I thought it unfair because these poor people, in my opinion, were not able to contribute the 25 per cent.  I am asked now if it is my idea that the grant should be reduced.  No, it is not.  My idea is&mdash;and I think it was Deputy Seán Collins put it up&mdash; to recast the whole scheme and where there are areas where we find people who do not qualify for a full cost grant under the other schemes, we will get in some sliding scale so that in those cases we can give not alone 90 per cent. but 95 per cent or 100 per cent. where there is a necessity for it.  Deputy Lehane need not worry that there is going to be such a thing, so far as I am concerned at any rate, as a reduction of the 75 per cent. contribution.  That is the minimum and I want to make that plain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree with the motion tabled by Deputy Commons.  I do not agree <Col N="1672" /> that 90 per cent. should be paid throughout the country because I am sure the section of our people who are fairly well off are fully satisfied with the 75 per cent. they are getting.  If you go over the schemes for the past three years, as the directors and some of the officials have gone over them with me during the past few days, you will find that 80 per cent. of the cases that were not carried out were cases where you had the poorer sections of our people and where they were not able to do anything.  I have got Government consent in doing this.  Do not expect it will be done immediately, but I hope in the coming Estimates to deal with it.  I think it was Deputy McQuillan who raised a point about the money.  The Government have given me a guarantee that they will provide it in the direction to which I have referred.  Reference was made to the crank on the road.  I know that such people exist.  Very often there is a spleen between neighbours and one man will object to the work being done, even though it would be to his own ultimate advantage.  We hear a good deal about the rights of the individual here and elsewhere.  I think I can safely say that my particular little office will not be the first to interfere with those rights.  It may surprise Deputies to learn that only approximately 3 per cent. of the schemes fall through because the &ldquo;crank&rdquo; refuses to give way.  I think it would be a mistake to bring in any scheme with any element of compulsion behind it because we might only succeed in making bad blood worse.</P>
    <P>Deputy Commons made a good case, but I would ask him not to press me in this matter until such time as I have had an opportunity of recasting the present scheme.  I think the new scheme will be more in keeping with what he wants.  Deputy Childers referred to the link roads.  In that respect, I would refer him to the reply I gave to Deputy Beegan on that matter some time ago.  I think it was Deputy McQuillan who said that officials wasted time travelling around the country.  I can assure the Deputy that we do not send our officials down to County Roscommon, for instance, to do a particular road, then bring <Col N="1673" /> them back to Dublin and send them down again the week after to do some other road.  The schemes are put forward and the area covered by the schemes is inspected by our officials. They then report to headquarters. They estimate the cost of the work. As a general rule, when that estimate is made out, it is found that the people are not able to pay.  In that way I believe time is wasted, but under the new arrangements I do not think that loss will occur in the future.</P>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan also asked why the lists are issued.  The lists are issued because Deputies ask for them and they are entitled to get them.  If they make political capital out of them, that is their own look out.  He also said that the people in Dublin are not fit judges as to what work should be carried out.  Actually all our men come from the rural areas or live in them.  May I add that I know personally the engineers send in very fair reports.  I have had an opportunity of looking up some of the schemes I lodged when I was a Deputy.  Where the schemes submitted were not carried out, I found there was a very sound reason for that.  I have no hesitation in saying that the officials give honest reports on all these schemes.</P>

      <P>On a point of explanation, the Parliamentary Secretary has more or less implied that I made a personal attack on the staff of his Department.  This is the second or third occasion upon which the Parliamentary Secretary has made that statement.  At no time have I made any personal attack on the officials of his Department.  What I did say was that men resident here in Dublin are not the proper judges as to what work should be done in rural areas under the rural improvements, minor relief and bog development schemes. The people actually working and living in the locality are better equipped to judge in that respect than are those living in urban areas.  I am not attacking any official now, but I stand over that statement.</P>

We have taken over some counties already and it is our intention to take over the remaining counties as quickly as possible and, in time, our men will carry out these works all over the country.</P>
      <P>I appeal to Deputy Commons to withdraw his suggestion with regard to the 90 per cent.  We might as well pay the full cost for the sake of the extra 10 per cent.  It would be more satisfactory.  If the people in any area are too poor to do these works or contribute towards the cost of them, it is our intention to bear the full 100 per cent. cost.  In areas where they can contribute, the contribution will be on a <i>pro rata</i> basis.  I think it would be unfair if those who can contribute, say, 25 per cent. of the cost, were to get a grant of 90 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>A very few weeks ago the Minister for Health, in person, signed a contract for certain works to be carried out on the site of the proposed Dublin regional sanatorium. The Minister has refused to disclose to the Dáil and to the public the precise contract sum to be paid in respect of these works.  He has indicated, however, that it is in the neighbourhood of £100,000.  It is of first importance to keep in mind, in connection with this matter, one terrific fact.  The money for this contract, whether it be for £100,000 or £200,000, will not be provided by a Vote of the Oireachtas but will be taken from a fund, a trust fund, a public fund, which is under the absolute control of the Minister himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1675" /> Where the establishment of a sanatorium is concerned, the Minister's, as perhaps Deputies know, power of disposal over this fund is absolute.  The law provides that if the Minister directs the Hospitals Trust Board to provide moneys for the establishment of a sanatorium the board must comply with his direction.  It cannot, under the law, do otherwise.  No matter how ill-judged it may deem it, it cannot question the Minister's direction.  It cannot appeal to the Government or to the Oireachtas or to the public to have it varied in any way.  The Hospitals Trust Board must do what the Minister directs it to do.  Moreover, expenditure from the Hospitals Trust Fund is not subject to examination by the Comptroller and Auditor-General&mdash;a great safeguard which the public have that public moneys will not be misused or embezzled or in any way put to any dishonest or corrupt purpose.  Neither the Comptroller and Auditor-General nor any other officer of the Oireachtas, nor even of the State, has power to say whether the expenditure which the Minister directs shall be defrayed out of the Hospitals Trust Fund has been honestly incurred or not.  Not even the courts can investigate a question of this kind.  In fact, there would seem to be no machinery to check or control any misfeasance or malfeasance that a careless or dishonest Minister might be guilty of&mdash;except one thing, to which I shall refer in due course.  Thus, if he were so minded, a dishonest Minister, by specially favouring his friends in a matter of contracts, could misuse the Hospitals Trust moneys.  If, instead of being meticulously careful to ensure that due value was given for expenditure, he were to place contracts with high tenderers instead of with tenderers who would do the work well for a lower tender, he could mulct the Hospitals Trust Fund with absolute impunity.</P>
    <P>There is but one safeguard against such rank dishonesty or stupid carelessness and that is the readiness of the individual who is the Minister in charge of the funds for the time being to give to Deputies, and through them to the public, the fullest information regarding any transaction involving the <Col N="1676" /> moneys of the fund to which he has been a party.  Hitherto, that safeguard has been an effective one.  Hitherto, no Minister has refused to answer any question addressed to him in relation to any action of his which involved expenditure from the fund.  The present Minister is the first to break that salutary and essential rule.</P>
    <P>The question which I addressed to the Minister for Health last Wednesday should have been easy to answer. It asked for no more information than should have been readily available to me.  Any man of prudence, signing a contract for £1,000&mdash;let alone £100,000 &mdash;would have satisfied himself in advance in regard to every one of the points which were raised in that question.  In regard to the question, let me say that, so far as I have been able to learn, the firm concerned in this contract is a firm of high standing and reputation.  I did not know its name when I put down the question nor was the question inspired by any other desire than to ascertain whether the Minister was the rubber stamp which he held himself out to be to Deputy Bartley&mdash;the automation signing on the dotted line when his technical officers told him to do so&mdash;or whether he was, in fact, the effective head of his Department; whether, in short, he was the dead-head and the dummy, as he has professed himself to be in this House, or an active director bringing an independent intelligence to bear on the proposals submitted to him for decision by the civil servants whom he is supposed to lead and inspire and control.</P>
    <P>I gather that the Minister, with a humility that is generally found in greater men, desires to number himself with the dead-heads and the dummies and, for that reason, wished to shuffle out of the responsibility which is constitutionally his.  That is the great and momentous issue which the Minister's evasive and misleading reply to my question has raised.  It was because of the attitude which the Minister took up in that regard that I felt it imperative in the public interest to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  To my mind, the Minister's proclaimed position in regard to this matter overshadows every other aspect of it.  The <Col N="1677" /> Minister, under the Constitution, is responsible to Dáil Éireann for everything that he does in his Department and for everything that every officer of his does in that Department.</P>
    <P>Yet, what was the purport of the Minister's reply to my question but to try to shift the burden of his constitutional responsibilities from his own shoulders to those of his officers, his servants and his subordinates?  The people who are supposed to do what he tells them to do are the people who, he proclaimed, compel him to do what they tell him to do.  &ldquo;My technical advisers,&rdquo; he said&mdash;and the reference is column 1213, Volume 118 of the Official Report of the Dáil Debates&mdash;&ldquo;made a certain recommendation to me and I acted upon that recommendation&rdquo;.  Did ever a Minister in this House utter such a preposterous excuse?  If I have done wrong, he said, in effect, it was those wicked persons, my technical officers, who made me do it.  I am not saying&mdash;and I want to be emphatic about this&mdash; that the Minister has done wrong in signing this contract.  He has given me no information which would lead me to come to that conclusion.  Neither has he given any information to the public, which is the one safeguard they have that, in the case of a Minister vested with such absolute control as the present Minister enjoys, that position will not be abused by whoever may happen to be, for the time being, the occupant of this office.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be taken either as suggesting that the Minister is a person who would do wrong.  I am putting the position to him in this personal way so that he may realise, once and for all, the injury which I believe he has done to the public interest by the attitude which he took up in framing that reply to my question.  I do not say that the Minister, let me repeat has done wrong, but let the Minister know, if he has done wrong, the Constitution will not permit him to hide behind his officers and neither will the country.  The Constitution does not say that public servants, whether they be technical advisers or administrators, are responsible to <Col N="1678" /> Dáil Éireann for the acts of the Minister.  It says, on the contrary, quite the opposite.  It says that the Minister is responsible to the Dáil and the country for the acts of his officers. The country did not elect the technical advisers, behind whose broad backs the Minister tries to shelter, to this House.  The majority in this House did not make any one of the Minister's technical advisers Minister for Health. The country elected the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There are other aspects of the Minister's reply that I also regard as being very reprehensible and to which I wish to refer.  His reply was not only evasive, not only a refusal to give that full information which, as I have shown, is the only safeguard that the public have that the Hospitals Trust Fund will be honestly and rightfully used; it was grossly misleading and it wound up with a piece of gratuitous and calculated impertinence.  Here I should like to emphasise also that I do not believe that the Minister's advisers, either technical or administrative, were responsible for all the features of that reply, certainly not for those of them to which I am going to refer.  They smacked too much of the beggar on horesback to have been provided by a public servant who had a right conception of what is due by him to the Oireachtas and the elected representatives of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister stated that it is not the practice to disclose the precise amount of any tender.  Has the Minister ever read <i>The Irish Builder</i> or any other reputable journal which caters for engineers, architects or other persons engaged in constructional work?  Did he ever read the <i>Irish Times</i> in the <Col N="1679" /> days when that paper used to feature reports of contracts and tendered prices, or did he ever read the local Press?  Does not everybody know that contract prices are frequently published?  Is there a member of a local authority who is not aware of the fact that if he asks his county manager to give him information in relation to any business of that local authority involving a contract, that the county manager is bound to give it in full to any member of that council and, if necessary, to have it published in the public Press?</P>
    <P>Yet the Minister tells us that it is not the practice to disclose tenders. Does not everybody know that, so far from its being advisable to keep contract prices secret, it is, on the contrary, highly desirable that they should be published so as to ensure that the contracts are honestly placed? What other means have the public to ensure that a tender, which would give them the best value for their money, has been accepted, except this, that if a person has put in a lower tender than that which has been accepted, he can challenge the acceptance of the higher tender and put the person responsible for accepting that higher tender on proof to show that he has acted in good faith and in the best interests of the persons who will have to pay when the work is finished?</P>
    <P>With regard to the other information for which I asked, the Minister states that it may be obtained in the Companies Registration Office.  I am aware of that.  I did not ask this information for my own use.  I have nothing to gain privately by securing it.  I asked it for the public benefit and so that the public might be assured that at least there was an Opposition alert to prevent any abuses growing up in a matter of this kind.  It is information which is readily available to the Minister.  It is information which is relevant to the question which I have been discussing.  It is information which the Government has in its possession and it relates to a contract which the Government or the Minister has placed.  It is information which concerns the conduct of the Minister in his public office.  It is information <Col N="1680" /> for which, as a Deputy of Dáil Éireann, I had a right to ask and was entitled to ask.  When in discharge of what I consider to be my public duty I did ask for it, these circumstances should have been present to the mind of the Minister and however difficult it may have been for him to recognise his obligations under the Constitution, he should have discharged his responsibility and given me the information I asked for in my question.</P>

      <P>May I say how much I admire the tremendous éclat, the attitude of doubt, the façade of uncertainty which Deputy MacEntee has brought into a rather simple and very uncomplicated question?  It is satisfying to know that Deputy MacEntee is at last taking a real interest in matters such as the building of sanatoria.  I am sure the House will agree with me that his conversion to an interest in the needs of institutions and the expeditious provision of institutions such as sanatoria is very long overdue and is a very salutary conversion for which, to a certain extent, I hope I may claim a little credit.</P>
      <P>There were a number of points raised by the Deputy which I shall treat as serious points for his benefit and the benefit of the House.  I am fully aware of my responsibilities to this House.  I am acutely aware of my responsibilities to the people who elected me to this House and placed me in this very privileged position. I am particularly aware of my responsibilities to those amongst them who may be sick.  Consequently, I have felt that my primary responsibility was to alleviate the conditions of those people and to attempt, to the best of my ability, to overcome the very serious and considerable arrears which had been left to me to a large extent by the Deputy who has just spoken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most important consideration is, of course, the provision of beds in the minimum of time.  This has been the dominating consideration in my control of the Department of Health to date, because I know that in the provision of bed accommodation, time certainly may mean health and, in many cases, may even mean lives.  Consequently, <Col N="1681" /> my attitude in relation to contracts and the placing of tenders has been and will be, as long as I am Minister, not that of the bureaucrat or a mind entwined and entangled in what is commonly called red tape, but to attempt to give the Government Departments and the men who work in these Departments an opportunity to show that they can compete with any private individual or private firm in the carrying out of any work. Therefore, in the placing of contracts, the considerations which I bear in mind are to get a first-class quality job done in the minimum of time. These two points entail certain considerations.  First of all, I do not necessarily award the contract to the lowest tenderer.  Neither do I award the contract to what is ostensibly, from the point of view of weeks stated, the fastest tender.  The considerations which are borne in mind by my advisers when presenting a case to me for each particular contractor are: the reputation of that contractor in my Department or any of the other Departments of State of any other large firms, the availability of equipment, the quality and quantity of equipment, the financial stability of the company, the resources of that company generally, and, of course, the cost of the particular job.  All these points are weighed carefully. The case for and against each contractor is put to me by my advisers. I consider the points raised by them and, if I am satisfied that the points raised by them are reasonable and sound, then I accept the recommendation which they make in relation to the placing of the contract, as I have done in this case.</P>
    <P>I cannot pretend that, in relation to matters generally in my Department, I invariably accept the recommendation of my advisers, nor, of course, do I give any guarantee that I will do it in the future.  In this particular case I did accept their recommendation.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEntee has asked a number of questions and was extremely indignant because information was not supplied in relation to the points raised.  If the Deputy had been a newcomer to this House, it might have been reasonable for him to say that I <Col N="1682" /> was acting outside precedent.  There are precedents for the attitude which I have adopted, precedents accepted on this side of the House and by the members of Deputy MacEntee's own Party when they were the Government. These precedents were established by the present President, Mr. Seán T. O'Kelly, when he was Minister for Finance, Deputy Moylan when he was Minister for Lands, and Deputy Traynor when he was Minister for Defence when questions and matters such as this relating to contracts and the size of them arose.  Deputy MacEntee made the point that I would not disclose this information and, by my action, was attempting to conceal it.  It is outside my power to conceal this information.  As I pointed out, that information is readily available to him or any other Deputy in the company's office.</P>
    <P>This company is an Irish company, as it happens.  The majority of the shares are held by Irish nationals.  It is a very reputable company, as the Deputy has pointed out, and from the financial point of view has carried out one contract which was twice as large as the one it is carrying out at present.  This is a purely civil engineering job and any works which the company has carried out were largely civil engineering works.  I am quite satisfied with the reputation which it holds and also as to its financial stability.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I accepted in this case the advice of my advisers.  In the last two years we have had a very hard and testing time in my Department during which I have had every opportunity of considering the qualities of those men&mdash;the engineers, the architects and the administrative staff&mdash;and I am quite satisfied as a result of my experience of them that the advice which they have tendered to me is excellent advice and it is advice over which I am prepared to stand.  Of course, I am in no way attempting to hide myself behind the broad shoulders of my technical officers.  In this case and in all cases I make the final decision.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Thursday, December 1st.</P>
