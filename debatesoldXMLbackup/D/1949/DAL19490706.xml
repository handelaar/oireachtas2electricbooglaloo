      <P>asked the Minister for Lands whether he is aware that the Land Commission have served notice of their intention to vest the holdings in the tenants in the area around Lissananny, Kilconley, County Galway, Ref. A. and R. (Revesting) 26168/49, although most of the holdings there are still uneconomic; and, if so, whether he will state if such revesting will in any way debar those tenants from receiving additions in the event of the Land Commission acquiring and subdividing some of the large tracts of land in their parish.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands whether he is aware that vesting orders have been issued by the Land Commission on the tenants on the Charles T. O'Rourke estate, Clonberne, County Galway, and that the tenants have objected on the grounds that the necessary improvements have not been carried out as regards proper fencing and the making of a bog road into Clonberne bog which was only lock-spitted; and, if so, whether he will direct the Land Commission to have the necessary improvements carried out before proceeding further with the vesting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The Land Commission vested about 60 allotments on the estate in December, 1948, and received <Col N="176" /> no objections within the statutory period notified.  The improvements sanctioned for lands have been carried out.</P>
      <P>The bog in question has not yet been allotted.  It is usual for the Land Commission to carry out certain improvements on bogs prior to allotment.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he will now state (i) the total quantity of oats purchased under the Department's oats purchasing scheme; (ii) the quantity resold by merchants; (iii) the quantity still on the merchants' hands and the prospects of having this balance cleared off before the next season.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether he is aware that considerable inconvenience is being caused to the farmers and milk producers in the Droumclough, Coomleigh, Gurthnacouley and surrounding townlands because of the distance they reside from a creamery; and, if so, whether he will take steps to provide a travelling creamery for this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  Without more information than is at present available it is not possible to say whether the operation of a travelling creamery in the area referred to by the Deputy would be economically practicable, but if he will be good enough to let me have particulars of the number of milk producers concerned, the quantity of milk available, and the distance from each producer's holding to the nearest cream-separating station, I will have the matter investigated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pending examination of the matter, <Col N="177" /> I would urge that advantage be taken of the concession granted by the Government under the Carriage of Milk Order, 1949, which up to the end of September enables milk to be transported for reward by a local haulier even though he may not have a general merchandise licence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>A proposal was made in 1946 for the erection of a new district hospital in Athlone.  Owing to the volume of very urgent works included in the short-term hospital building programme and in consideration of the fact that there are a number of wellequipped hospitals convenient to Athlone, that is Mullingar (84 beds), Tullamore (75 beds), Roscommon (98 beds) as well as the proposed new hospital at Longford (88 beds) and the proposed extension to Portiuncula Hospital (100 beds), I felt obliged to ask the local authority to defer for the present the planning of this hospital and to seek a solution of the immediate problem by way of the modernisation of the present district hospital in which an up-to-date maternity unit had recently been provided.  This request was made on the 30th March last. Reminders were sent on the 12th of May and the 3rd of June and it was only on 22nd June that I received the local authority's proposals along these lines.  I hope to be able to convey my approval to them as soon as they have been examined in my Department.</P>

      <P>Last evening I was referring to the policy of the Minister's Department in according sanction before a matter concerning increases in the remuneration of their staffs had been considered by local authorities.  I referred to all the talk about democratic institutions and a democratic system of local government and all the talk about the amendment of the County Management Act.  I mentioned the action taken by the Minister and his colleagues in other Departments&mdash; the Department of Local Government, for instance&mdash;in according prior sanction to increases in remuneration&mdash; whether these were desirable or not is a different matter&mdash;and putting a pistol to the heads of local authorities to provide these moneys.</P>
      <P>I want to know now what power the Minister has for doing this.  It is all right if there is a proposal to have the remuneration of employees of local authorities on the same basis all over the country; if that is the effort that is being made by the Department, and if that is explained to local authorities, it is quite all right; but it is most unjust and irregular that a communication will issue from the Minister's Department to a local authority telling the employees of that authority that if the money is put up by a county council or an urban council the Minister will be prepared to sanction it.</P>
      <P>That system was never in operation before.  We are told that local authorities have the power of the purse, that they determine whether certain money will be paid.  Of course, they should have that power, but this effort by this so-called Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Cowan would be at home in the courts, all right.  This Minister has a so-called democratic view on matters of local administration. We hope when the County Management Act is being amended <Col N="185" /> that that policy will be defended.  The powers that local authorities have, instead of being increased, are being filched from them by the Department every day in the week.  For some time past the Minister's Department has been engaged in arranging the country into regions and setting out the regions where each local authority must send its patients and where its hospital accommodation must be provided. I want to protest against that. The local authorities were not consulted prior to this plan being drawn up.  No member of a local authority knew anything about this plan.  It is true that the county managers were brought up to the Department and told about the plan.</P>
      <P>Wexford has always had good service from the Dublin hospitals for its patients.  Under this regional plan Wexford will be put in the south-eastern region.  There is no objection to sending patients to institutions within that region but Wexford local authority believes that it should be freely entitled to send its patients to any institution it thinks fit.  They take a rather strong view on that matter. They think the Minister should not determine to what outside institution any local authority should send its patients.  Regimentation looks very well on paper but it does not always work out so well in practice.  Suppose an effort was made to direct our tubercular patients into an institution in, say, County Kilkenny.  Actually we do not object to that, but we can see grave difficulties arising.  There is no public transport between Wexford and Kilkenny. Some of those patients may spend very long periods in hospital and it will not be possible for their relatives and friends to visit them because there is no public transport.  As far as Dublin is concerned Wexford is well served with public transport.  There are four services daily and it is possible to visit the city and return the same day.  Apparently the views of local authorities count for nothing these days.  They count for nothing with the Minister for Health.  In all the correspondence received from him a dictatorial attitude is adopted.  The elected representatives have no voice.  They are not permitted to give an opinion.</P>

      <P>It just happens that I am a member of a local authority as well as being a member of this House. If a local authority has no representative in this House, their view will not be heard in any place.  Generally, local authorities have sound views on these matters.  They must take a long-term view because all sections of their people are affected.  The Minister's policy in creating that region will affect the poorer sections of the people in my county at any rate.  Public transport is an important item for consideration in relation to the planning of hospitals. Hospitalisation itself must be a long-term policy.  Possibly there may be some additions to public transport in the future in the line of providing extra buses if the roads are suitable for transport.  Possible that situation may not arise and, if there is no public transport, it will not be possible for the relatives and friends to visit patients in the hospitals.  I think the Minister himself has admitted that it is important that patients should receive visits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of his opening statement the Minister gave the House an outline of his proposals for spending the moneys available in the Hospitals' Trust Fund over the next seven years. He gave a limited number of institutions which he proposes to have built. I would point out to the Minister that there are records in his Department showing that, prior to the emergency or some time during the emergency, many local authorities had schemes for the partial improvement of existing hospitals or the building of new ones. They had entered into commitments with the Department and had got agreement as to whether they would improve the existing hospitals or build new ones.  The Minister thinks fit to ignore all that.  Irrespective of what was done in the past, he is now allocating these funds as he thinks fit.  I suggest to him that he has a considerable responsibility for the commitments <Col N="187" /> of his predecessor.  If an arrangement had been entered into whereby a mental hospital or a local county council, or otherwise, would receive a grant on a certain basis in order to carry out certain improvements, the present Minister is in honour bound to provide that grant.</P>
    <P>Things seem to have changed very considerably.  I know one local authority which proposed some years ago to install a central heating plant, sanitation and other much needed improvements in a mental hospital.  Now they have been told that they will receive only half the proposed grant. The Minister will have to mend his hand very considerably if he wishes to retain the support of the local authorities and their staffs in implementing his public health scheme.  Local authorities have their officers on the spot to advise them as to whatever improvements are necessary.  They are in a better position to judge what is needed than is the Minister or his Department.  I suggest to the Minister that he should honour the commitments entered into by his predecessor in every single respect.  It is all very fine to have a lot of cheap publicity for allocating £10,000,000.  At the present rate of spending that £10,000,000 will not be spent for many years.  With the personnel and materials available it would not be possible to spend it.  It would be a much sounder policy to allow the local authorities to go ahead with the schemes they have on hands for the improvement of their existing institutions and the Minister should make available the grants that were promised by his predecessor for that purpose.  He has the moral responsibility for carrying out the arrangement which was made with local authorities in the past.</P>
    <P>We should like to hear from the Minister also what is his Department's policy in the matter of providing moneys for the voluntary hospitals. Commitments were made to the voluntary hospitals in this country in the past, very far-reaching commitments, and it was agreed that they were entitled to a fair proportion of the Hospitals' Trust Fund.  They have <Col N="188" /> plans ready for very much needed improvements of their hospitals in this city, Cork and other cities.  They are entitled to their proportion of the Hospitals' Trust Fund.  The House does not know, nor have the voluntary hospitals been made aware, of what the Minister's policy may be in the matter of paying the deficits of these hospitals or whether any proportion of this money is to be earmarked for the payment of these annual deficits.  The voluntary hospitals have been told nothing of what the Minister's policy is or will be in the near future in the matter of providing funds for the large capital expenditure that the voluntary hospitals are anxious to undertake. Are we to have any statement from the Minister as to what money in the Hospitals' Trust Fund is to be earmarked for the building of local authority hospitals or public hospitals, or is any portion going to be given to the voluntary hospitals for the improvement of these institutions?  If all the money in the Hospitals' Trust Fund is to be allocated to building how does the Minister propose in future to provide for the deficits of the voluntary hospitals?</P>
    <P>These are matters of long-term policy upon which the country would like to be informed.  The voluntary hospitals have played, and are still playing, a very important part in the health services of the community.  I take it that it is the policy still to maintain them as voluntary hospitals and, in order to maintain them, some fund or other must pay these deficits annually.  In answer to a question on the 21st June from Deputy McCann the Minister told us that there was £10,250,000 roughly in the Hospitals' Trust Fund, that £9,750,000 of that was invested bringing an annual income of almost £309,000 and that the deficit of the voluntary hospitals this year was estimated to be about £400,000.  Things, I agree, have reached a serious stage when there is almost £500,000 of a deficit annually on the running of the voluntary hospitals, seeing that it will take £11,000,000 or £12,000,000 invested to provide a fund to pay these deficits.  That is a matter that is more than serious and one that needs careful consideration. The Minister has taken it on himself <Col N="189" /> to allocate all these funds.  I am sure he is aware that it was never claimed that all these funds belonged to the local authority hospitals.  It was always agreed, although there was nothing set out in law, that a good portion of them should be allocated for the building and maintenance of voluntary hospitals. Any radical change of policy in that direction may have serious repercussions on the revenue from the sweepstakes. An early statement from the Minister as to what his policy is to be in that direction is awaited and it is all-important that it should be made.</P>
    <P>We are told&mdash;we heard it here in this House yesterday from the former Minister&mdash;that some of these funds are being spent lightly.  In a neighbouring county, a private house was purchased by the Minister at £10,000, or authority was given to purchase it at £10,000. We are also told that the estimated value of that building was about a couple of thousand pounds.  We hope that a lot of this money will not be spent in that direction.  There are a good many ugly rumours going around about this particular purchase.  If half the rumours are true, the transaction savours very much of a word we heard a little about in this House in the last year or two&mdash;the word &ldquo;corruption.&rdquo; I am sure that if the Minister's colleagues were on this side of the House they would be demanding sworn inquiries. According to what the public say, there is much matter for public inquiry.  If the Minister has any statement to make when he is replying to this debate I should like him to do so, in order to satisfy the public at large that the moneys that were paid for this particular residence in County Wicklow &mdash;it is well known and it was mentioned by the Minister's predecessor here yesterday&mdash;were well spent.  I should like him to tell the House and the country that there was nothing underhand or undesirable in this whole transaction, that there was no corruption or anything savouring of corruption in that purchase.  We should be glad to hear that from the Minister. We are not making a charge from this side of the House, but we should like to hear the Minister's view on it.  We should also like to know whether he considers, or the Department considers, <Col N="190" /> that the total amount paid for that residence was not exorbitant, that it was not, as has been said, and as is being said, about four times its value.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is rather fortunate inasmuch as his Department is not one that could be to any great extent approached from a Party standpoint.  There have been, of course, some comparisons drawn between the Minister and his predecessor. Personally I do not think such comparisons are either necessary or desirable.</P>
      <P>Every fair-minded person will agree that the Minister has made a tremendous effort to get the work of his Department well under way.  Every fair-minded person will also agree that the Minister's predecessor, during the short time he was Minister for Health, did make a very significant effort in connection with the work of his Department and did approach the problems of that Department with a very considerable amount of zeal.</P>
      <P>I would regard the main functions of a Minister for Health as being, first, to prolong human life; and, secondly, to alleviate human suffering.  So far as the prolongation of human life is concerned, an instance was brought to my notice in the past week which may seem to be depressing, but only to members of this House.  A gentleman in County Carlow lived to be over 100 years.  He was approached to give his reasons for his long span of existence on this earth and he promptly replied that it was due to hard work and no politics.  I am sure that would be bad news for Deputies.  We can only hope that, perhaps, the old gentleman's mind was beginning to fail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that in regard to the first and most important function of the Minister, to preserve and improve the health of our people, there is no question more important than diet.  It has been said that many people dig their graves with their teeth.  That is, perhaps, a silly occupation for intelligent people, yet it may be true. There is no doubt, however, that what is known as malnutrition exists on a very wide scale throughout all sections of the community.  There is no doubt <Col N="191" /> that deficiencies in diet prevail, not only amongst the very poor, where it is understandable, but amongst people who are not so poor.  I firmly believe that in this country the consumption of wholesome foods, and particularly wholesome home-grown foods, is not encouraged to the extent which is necessary and desirable.</P>
    <P>Somebody has said that the three greatest destroyers of human life are the bottle, the frying pan and the teapot.  By the bottle I mean, of course, excessive use of intoxicating liquor.  By the frying pan I mean too much fried foods of all kinds.  Lastly, there is the excessive consumption of tea.  I do not know how true that definition may be, but I would say that there are three foodstuffs which the people of this country do not use to the extent which is absolutely necessary and desirable.  The first is oaten porridge, a home-grown food.  Last year we farmers were chasing the Minister &mdash;we chased him out of the country&mdash; looking for a price for our oats, while the majority of the people practically do not use oats as a food at all. That is an extraordinary state of affairs, yet it is true.  Then, of course, there is the need for an increased consumption of home-grown vegetables. We do not use a sufficient quantity of vegetables in our food to sustain health and to provide for all the needs of the human body.  Lastly, of course, there is the all-important food&mdash;milk&mdash; which, I think, is not used in sufficient quantities, particularly by children and mothers.</P>
    <P>In this connection, I wonder would it fall to the Minister's Department to do something to encourage the use of these very necessary foods.  I wonder would it be possible for the Minister or his Department to organise, say, an ideal food exhibition, setting out the ideal types of food for our people, the foods which are both economic and desirable when cooked in the most palatable and attractive way.  There is no use in saying to people that they must use more of a certain type of vegetables if those vegetables, when prepared, are unpalatable, or that they must use more porridge, if it is not properly prepared and cooked.  One <Col N="192" /> has only to visit the hotels in this city to see the different ways in which porridge is cooked.  In one hotel you will get porridge which is so palatable that you are inclined to call for a second helping.  In another, you will get a sort of mixture that is nothing more than scalded oats.  I do not know whether the suggestion I have made of a food exhibition setting forth the best types of food could be carried out. Publicity and propaganda in this respect might do a good deal to encourage, first of all, good cooking and, secondly, increase the consumption of those very essential home-grown foods. Most people will acknowledge that deficiencies in diet are mainly responsible for various ailments of children and of adults also.  Whatever steps the Minister may take, I think there is need for publicity and propaganda in regard to diet.</P>
    <P>There are very considerable sections of our people whose income is so low that they cannot completely solve this problem for themselves.  Owing to inadequate housing accommodation and inadequate cooking appliances, they may not be able to provide themselves with what is the best possible diet or they may not have the money to purchase the necessary foods.  Nevertheless, a great deal can be done, because the best foods for our people are by no means the most expensive foods. The first essential unit in any organiation to fight disease is a well run and well organised dispensary district in charge of a competent and properly treated medical officer.  I quite agree with all Deputies who have said that our dispensary buildings and equipment to a large extent are antiquated and inadequate.  That is particularly true in the rural areas.  Something very drastic must be done to improve dispensary buildings and the equipment in them.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter which strikes me in regard to our dispensary service, that is, that apart from medical work, the amount of clerical work thrown upon the dispensary doctor is excessive.  There is a considerable amount of work such as keeping accounts, filling forms, compiling registers, which in the ordinary course of events, doctors should not have to <Col N="193" /> perform.  At any rate, that work should be simplified to the greatest possible extent and whatever method can be found to simplify account keeping should be instituted.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which might receive attention.  Dispensary doctors are called upon to compound and supply the various medicines which they prescribe.  I have often wondered if it would not be a more efficient method to have that work contracted out to the local chemists who, perhaps, are better equipped to discharge that function.  In that case, the dispensary doctor would prescribe and the prescription would be taken by the applicant to the local chemist where he would receive the medicine free, as at the dispensary.  I do not know if that would add to the cost, but it would certainly be more expeditious and possibly more efficient, and it would save a good deal of crowding up of dispensaries with jars, bottles and all the equipment which is necessary for the compounding and storing of medicines.</P>
    <P>A great deal has been said about the necessity for extending free medical treatment to all sections of our people.  I quite agree that the problem of ensuring that no person shall suffer from lack of medical treatment because of a lack of means must be met.  At the same time, no one would like the entire population of this country to be absolutely dependent upon a medical service which would be of the same nature as the Civil Service. No one would like our entire medical profession to become a branch of the Civil Service.  There must always remain to a very considerable degree medical and hospital treatment for which people will pay a reasonable fee.  The question arises what, in the circumstances, it would be reasonable to expect.  People below a certain income level and, in the case of farmers, below a certain valuation, should receive medical and hospital treatment free or almost free.  People above those levels but below certain other levels might receive medical and hospital treatment partly free; perhaps they would pay 50 per cent. of the cost.  People on the higher income <Col N="194" /> levels would pay, perhaps, almost the entire cost.</P>
    <P>Such a system could be devised to meet the situation, but there ought to be a definite limit so that everybody will know exactly where he stands.  As Deputies and members of county councils know, there was a certain amount of uncertainty as to the people to whom free treatment should be afforded and as to those who should be required to contribute.  As we know, much of the time of local representatives is occupied in dealing with this problem. The limits of income and valuation should be very clearly and definitely stated.  Those under a certain limit should be entitled to free treatment if they require it, and those over that and up to another limit should receive 50 per cent. free treatment, and those over that again, perhaps, should pay the full amount.  That is something which ought to be cleared up definitely and as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>As I say, I do not quite agree that everybody should receive absolutely free medical treatment or that everybody should be absolutely dependent upon the Minister for Health for the state of his health.  Some time ago I was listening to the B.B.C., when somebody in a very melancholy voice said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If the Conservative Party get in we may have to give back our hair and our teeth,&rdquo;</P>
    <P>thereby indicating that there was a general association over there of the people's health requirements with a particular Party.  That idea should not be allowed to develop here.  I do not think that we would be a very independent, democratic country if everybody were dependent on the Minister for Health for his hair, teeth, glasses, and so on.</P>
    <P>As far as the provision of suitable institutional treatment and institutional accommodation is concerned, the Minister deserves to be congratulated on having made a very far-reaching, all-out drive to secure an increase in the number of hospital beds for tubercular patients.  Somebody in opposition to the Government asked were these hospital beds all new beds. It does not matter so much whether they are all new or not.  The important <Col N="195" /> thing is that they were provided. In the county in which I am a member of the local authority, last year we had only ten beds for tubercular patients. As a result of reorganisation and readjustment proposed by the Minister, we will now have 50 additional beds. Those beds are not new beds, but they were made available through a little bit of organisation and readjustment as between the county and the adjoining county.  That is the kind of work that a Minister for Health can do and should do, and it is the kind of work that the present Minister for Health is doing.</P>
    <P>In this matter of hospitalisation, I happen to be actively associated, not with one county, but with two.  In the County of Carlow&mdash;I am a member of the county council&mdash;a fight has been going on there for many years for a decent general hospital. In the pre-war period there was a great difference of opinion amongst the members of the then board of health as to where the hospital should be built.  There were various disputes in regard to plans, and in one way or another the whole matter of providing a hospital was delayed until the outbreak of war.  Since then a proposal has been made to link up County Carlow and County Kildare and establish a regional hospital for the two counties.  The unfortunate thing, however, is that if one looks at the map one will find that the Counties Carlow and Kildare represent a very long, narrow strip of territory, stretching almost from the City of Dublin to the County Waterford, and so it is hardly the kind of area which one would contemplate for a regional hospital. While Carlow was quite willing to fall in with the views of the Minister and to provide, as far as possible, for a regional hospital, the County Kildare has apparently refused to co-operate. The proposal of the Minister was that the south end of Kildare would go with Carlow and that this would ensure that a proper hospital would be provided for that area.  That does not seem to be possible now unless the Minister can bring pressure to bear on the County Kildare to fall in with that very <Col N="196" /> sensible arrangement.  I know that Deputy Allen would not tolerate any pressure being brought to bear on any county, so that if we are to recognise the sovereign independence of each county, I suppose Carlow will have to be content with a hospital suitable only for that small county.</P>
    <P>On this question, I am not so much opposed to small district hospitals as some Deputies.  I am not so enthusiastic as some Deputies seem to be for large-sized regional hospitals.  I believe that the smaller hospital can serve the needs of the people quite efficiently, a hospital at any rate which is capable of providing for one resident surgeon. I think that in many areas throughout the country, such as Carlow or such as East Wicklow, a 60-bed or 70-bed hospital could be provided with a resident surgeon.  We are frequently told that, owing to modern means of transport, there should be no difficulty in conveying patients over long distances to a regional hospital.  The same argument could be used in the reverse way, namely, that there does not seem to be any reason why, with modern means of transport, one specialist should not be able to attend two or three of the smaller hospitals.</P>
    <P>There is one point, however, which I think must be strongly stressed, and that is that, whatever decision is taken in regard to the erection of hospitals, county boundaries, to a certain extent, must be overlooked.  It is necessary, first of all, that a decent hospital should be provided in a fair-sized town so that it will be able to provide for the needs of a big centre of population and, secondly, provide the amenities which are essential to a first-class decent hospital. The town of Carlow happens to be on the corner of the county.  There does not seem to be any reason why a ten-mile radius, adjoining the county, should not be served by that hospital. That seems to be logical and reasonable.</P>
    <P>I am not only a member of the Carlow County Council, but I am also a representative for the County Wicklow.  I am, therefore, very deeply interested in the question of hospitalisation in County Wicklow.  We have, in West Wicklow, a small district <Col N="197" /> hospital which has rendered very efficient service to the people of that area over a very considerable period. It is a matter of first priority in County Wicklow that that hospital be enlarged and improved.  Plans for its enlargement and improvement have been under consideration for a very long period.  I think that the local representatives in Wicklow, and in other counties, are getting tired of all this eternal planning, of maps being drawn and of plans and sketches being sent down with engineers and architects following each other, revising those plans from year to year and changing and altering them.  Everything is being done on paper, but nothing is being done in actual fact. We have in Baltinglass a small hospital. It was formerly the fever annexe to the old Baltinglass workhouse.  The engineers and architects have been planning extensions on paper for a long period of years.  I think that the Minister should insist on his Department, and on all concerned, getting down to the work of providing the necessary accommodation that is required there.  When the Baltinglass hospital has been completed, there is no reason why the work of providing a decent hospital in Wicklow should not proceed as rapidly as possible.  It is not the mortar, the cement or the steel that is going to provide the hospital treatment for the people, but rather a well-trained staff with doctors and surgeons.  They are the backbone of any hospital service, and they must be given reasonable accommodation and reasonable facilities.  Nothing more should be asked and nothing more is required.</P>
    <P>A lot has been said about the county homes.  I think that the Minister has visited many of them.  I am not sure if he visited the county home in Wicklow. It is a well-run institution.  As far as Carlow is concerned, the patients in the county home are housed in an old military hospital.  It was probably built by the British away back about 1798 or maybe later.  It is being made to serve the needs of the poor, the aged and the infirm.  It is not a suitable building for the purpose. The only redeeming feature about the <Col N="198" /> whole institution is the magnificent service which is given there by the nursing staff, the members of a religious order, who are in charge.</P>
    <P>I think the great reform which is needed in regard to county homes is a breaking up of those institutions into their component parts.  It is wrong at the present time to crowd into one institution different types of patients or inmates.  There is a great need for a suitable home for the aged and infirm.  Such a home should not be too large and it should be confined to that particular type of person.  There is no sense in crowding together the aged and infirm, mentally defective children and maternity cases.  These are the types of people who are at the moment being catered for in the county homes.  The breaking up of those institutions is a very necessary step in getting away from the old tradition of the workhouse, where poor and destitute persons were crowded in regardless of age or sex or the particular type of affliction from which they suffered.  It does not solve the problem of the county home merely to change its name from workhouse to county home or to christen it with the name of some saint.  The only solution is to start out now and let us have for the aged and infirm a separate type of institution.</P>
    <P>I am inclined to agree with Deputy Dr. Ryan, the ex-Minister, when he said that a good many of the people who are housed in mental and county homes could be catered for in their own homes if some assistance were given to their relatives.  We have heard of what was described as the three-tier home&mdash; that is, the home in which there are three generations.  Some people may say that it is highly undesirable that the grandfather should live with his children and grandchildren.  I do not think there is anything radically wrong in that, or that there is anything unnatural about such a proposition, if the necessary provision is made for the accommodation of the separate families, the older and the younger generations.  If some of the money spent on county homes were devoted to providing additional rooms in houses throughout the country for old people <Col N="199" /> it might, perhaps, meet the problem better than by resorting to the county home.</P>
    <P>Again, it might be desirable to provide something like colonies of small dwellings for aged people who have not near relatives or who may have no relatives at all.  Those old people could have the comfort and privacy of a little home of their own and they could have the supervision and the assistance normally provided in an institution.  There is one thing I will ask the Minister not to do, and that is not to build new county homes on the model of existing institutions.  He should break new ground in that particular direction.</P>
    <P>In addition to the old people I have mentioned who will be found in those county homes, there are such types as mentally defective or physically defective children.  The problem of those children is one which urgently needs attention.  It would be no harm if some Deputy were to pay a tribute to the institutions which are in existence for the care of such children.  It would be no harm if somebody would pay a tribute to the splendid work done mainly by nursing sisters, religious orders, in those homes.  Perhaps there is nothing more depressing to anyone who is not upheld by a strong faith and by hope and charity than the care of children who are physically or mentally defective.  It is really very depressing, yet there are people who, without pay or reward, devote their lives to the care of those children.  I think this House would be lacking in its duty if a tribute were not paid to the splendid institutions which look after those children.  Those institutions are inadequate to provide for all our needs.  They have to be enlarged or new homes may have to be provided.</P>
    <P>The solution of this matter will not be found in the provision of new county homes or the enlargement of existing ones.  It is a specialised work which people who have made this a life study must undertake.  A great deal has been done by those people.  I will instance the Deaf and Dumb Institution at Cabra and the admirable <Col N="200" /> training that is given children there. Those in charge of that institution equip the children, notwithstanding their physical defects, so as to enable them to make a living in the world. In the same way, mentally defective children can receive a great deal of help and assistance in fighting the battle of life.  I do not think the atmosphere of any county home is a suitable place to provide that training.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister last week a question about the provision of dental treatment in our rural areas.  I am particularly concerned with the dental treatment of children.  In most counties they have a dental surgeon whose duty it is to attend to the treatment of dispensary cases and of children who have been inspected in the schools and who are found to require dental treatment, but in the rural areas there is no equipment for the provision of that service.  Last week I suggested that something in the nature of a mobile unit should be provided for the dental surgeon so that he could travel from place to place with his equipment and provide an efficient service.  I did not know at that time but I have since discovered that there is a type of trailer manufactured for the provision of dental treatment.  The trailer is equipped with a dental chair, an electric drill, pliers and other instruments that a dentist uses and this can be hauled behind any fairly large-size car. The advantage of such a travelling unit can be easily understood.  A number of children in rural schools are bound to have defective teeth.  With such a travelling unit the visiting dental surgeon would have his equipment available just the same as in the surgeries in the cities and towns.  Advantage should be taken of that system in every county.  I do not know how much the Minister can do in this matter.  It might fall to him merely to advise, if Deputy Allen prefers the county councils should adopt the scheme.  It might also fall to him to provide the necessary capital for the purchase of these travelling units.  One person who brought this to my notice commented on the fact that the lack of proper equipment defeated the whole purpose of dental inspection in the schools because the children were <Col N="201" /> more or less frightened since the dental surgeon could not do his work as efficiently as he might do it in his own surgery.</P>
    <P>I may have mentioned some depressing things in the course of this discussion. I would like to close upon a brighter note.  When the Minister has done as much as possible to improve the health of our people, he might then consider the desirability of brightening up our hospital morgues. I do not see any reason why these places should present such an appearance of bleak austerity.  It would surely not be an insurmountable obstacle to provide a few flowers to brighten these places.</P>

      <P>I take it that 40 or 50 years ago we had roughly the same amount of sickness as we have to-day. Perhaps we had a bit more then.  There is, however, one very noticeable change.  People who fall ill to-day are quite willing to go to hospital.  I think that is a very good sign.  In County Meath I meet almost as many people looking for beds in hospitals as I do asking for houses.  We have no hospital in Meath and we depend on Dublin to supply our needs.  I notice, too, that those who can pay for hospital accommodation are provided with beds far more rapidly than are those who cannot pay.  I think the Minister might make some inquiry into that.</P>
      <P>I would urge upon the Minister to ensure more co-operation between the different Departments which formerly made up the Department of Local Government and Public Health.  At the present time there seems to be a lack of co-operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I came across a case recently where an agricultural labourer was struck down with tuberculosis.  He was a married man with a wife and three or four young children.  If it were not for the assistance of neighbours in maintaining the wife and children for about three weeks or a month they would have died of starvation.  The husband was removed as quickly as possible.  He got excellent treatment.  But whoever is responsible for paying this tuberculosis allowance must have forgotten all about it and I had the greatest trouble before the money was forthcoming. <Col N="202" /> The tuberculosis allowance was sent direct to the husband in the hospital.  The national health insurance came along later with their particular contribution.  The wife lived about 16 miles from the hospital. Luckily some neighbours looked after the children while she visited the hospital to get the money from the husband.  I asked to have all the money included in the one cheque, even if it was sent to the hospital. One week no cheque came at all.  Evidently the cashier must have overlooked it.  I think all that must be due to a lack of co-operation. I think there should be no great difficulty in bringing about that co-operation.  The anxiety suffered by this woman is certainly not conducive to health, particularly as one of the children happens to be slightly affected also.  The local dispensary doctor supplied the cod liver oil.  It seems that cod liver oil is extremely efficacious and ranks almost as a food. I am sure the Minister is unaware that these difficulties arise.  I do not know who is at fault.  I only came across one case myself, but the possibility is that there are others.</P>
    <P>I take it the free milk scheme is now in operation.  Milk is one of the most important foods we have.  There was difficulty at one time in getting the farmers to supply milk in small quantities because it was troublesome. They dreaded the visit of inspectors. I take it they need not worry about inspectors in the future if we are to accept what the Minister for Agriculture has said.  Meath supplies a great deal of milk to the City of Dublin and the dairy proprietors there do not want to be bothered in the morning with people coming for two or three pints of milk each.  But the free milk scheme must be developed because it is very essential as far as tubercular patients are concerned.  I understand cream is excellent for tubercular patients.  I understand that it did a great deal of good, so I hope the Minister will take whatever steps he possibly can to see that farmers are induced in every way to supply this milk if it is required in a district.  In the rural districts a very large mileage would have to be covered to procure <Col N="203" /> milk if a neighbouring farmer is not willing to supply it.</P>
    <P>I think from what has been said that it is fairly obvious that we have not sufficient hospital accommodation, and a very big task lies ahead if we are to provide these hospitals.  I mentioned that County Meath has to depend on the City of Dublin for hospital accommodation.  There is one hospital in Navan and the county infirmary, and the patients there are all paying patients.  I think the Minister would be well advised to consider the erection of a cottage hospital in Kells and another in Trim.  It would not cost very much more than it is costing at present in providing transport for patients who have to come to Dublin.  If that idea were developed, the local doctors would be able to help.  Medical treatment would be localised and it would ease the situation that exists in Navan and Dublin, while it would also lead to much more rapid treatment for patients.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which the last speaker referred is one to which I should also like to call attention.  We have made efforts to secure medical treatment and aid for a section of the community, but we have left a large section of the farming community without any assistance whatever.  I refer to farmers with holdings of a valuation of £25 each or thereabouts. They dread the idea of having to go to hospital or of having to call in a medical officer.  It is true that many medical officers sacrifice a good deal to give them attention, understanding what their circumstances are.  I should like to pay a tribute to the many medical officers who have done that, but I wonder if an effort could be made to provide medical assistance and benefits for such people?  There is a large amount of illness amongst that section of the population which is due entirely to lack of proper medical attention.  Many of these people refuse to send for a doctor.  Naturally, their pride prevents them for looking for any assistance from medical officers. They do not want to ask the medical officer to come to see them because they know they cannot pay for such <Col N="204" /> assistance and they do not want to owe the money.  The situation demands that some steps be taken to relieve the position of these people.  The position of the ordinary agricultural labourer throughout the country, on the other hands, has improved immensely.  Very often the actual cash in the form of remuneration going into the labourer's cottage is infinitely more than goes into the average 25-acre farmstead.  I think it is time that that matter should be considered in view of the comparisons which have been made.</P>
    <P>I should also like to call the Minister's attention&mdash;he is not directly responsible for it but it is a matter of co-operation&mdash;to the housing question and to ask him to urge the Minister for Local Government, with all his might and power, to increase the building of cottages.  I think some consideration should also be given to the repair of cottages throughout the country.</P>

      <P>I think there should be a certain amount of co-operation between them.  I am sure that the question of proper water supplies would come under the Department of Health. I do not know what is the position of other counties but in County Meath, in some cases, the position of the water supply is calamitous.  In the last three or four weeks there is hardly any water at all in some districts.  In the ordinary course of events the question of water supplies presents a very difficult problem.</P>

      <P>I shall try another one&mdash;the question of fumigation and disinfection.  Would that not be a matter for Health?  I saw some efforts made in that direction and I must say that they were certainly childish.  Two men came along on bicycles to disinfect a house out of which a tubercular patient was to be taken.  The patient had spent his time in the kitchen as he was not able to go upstairs.  Every single room in the house was disinfected except the kitchen.  I do not know why.  I asked the county medical officer of health why and he said he would make inquiries about it.  That is three months ago and I have heard nothing about it since.  I am not a medical man nor am I a veterinary surgeon and I do not know very much about it, but I think they should have disinfected the whole house.  In fact, if we could afford it, some of these houses should be burned down.</P>
      <P>I cannot deal with water and I cannot deal with food, but what about the public-houses?</P>

      <P>If we cannot deal with them we may blot out public health.  Take occasions when there are football matches here in Dublin on Sundays.  I am not talking now about the country; I am talking about Dublin. Many of these public-houses are dirty concerns.  The glasses are washed in the same bucket of water from start to finish.  All sorts of people are going in and out.  Many of these places are dirty concerns in themselves and I hope the Minister will take some steps to see that the bottles in which stout and beer are put are kept clean and, secondly, that the glasses get a reasonable washing.  I think an enormous amount of disease is spread in that way.  These conditions are mainly applicable to Dublin because the population in rural districts is very small and I am sure the publicans there do <Col N="206" /> everything possible they can to wash the glasses.</P>
      <P>We are in somewhat of a quandary here because the co-ordination of which I spoke in the early stages is absent.  I hope the Minister will do all he can to see that such co-ordination as is possible is made effective because, as far as I know, the county councils of every county are most enthusiastic. The ratepayers are agreeable to spend all the money they can afford on public health.  All we want is a reasonable lead and let the Minister be sure, above all things, that he does not confuse the ratepayers and the county councils as much as we have been confused here this evening.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>When speaking on this Estimate last year I mentioned that the greatest help sufferers from tuberculosis got was the benefits brought in under the Fianna Fáil Health Act.  I pointed out to the Minister at that time that people would be in a position to avail of sanatorium treatment, on account of these benefits, who were unable to do so before as they could not afford to give up their work and leave their families neglected.  So far as the position in Cork is concerned, the Minister is aware that there is a bigger demand than ever for beds in sanatoria, despite the efforts of the Minister and the co-operation he got from the local bodies in providing him with Mallow hospital and now with Skibbereen, Macroom and Kinsale hospitals.  It is a very good thing to get these people away from their homes and to isolate away from their families so as to lessen the spread of infection.  It shows that the Minister means well so far as the treatment of tuberculosis is concerned. There is, however, something or somebody holding up the schemes or the plans that were prepared before the Minister came into office, and which he appeared to think were neglected before he took office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the proposed regional sanatorium in Sarsfield's Court in April, 1948, the Minister sneered at the fact that the Fianna Fáil Government had let the site for that institution for grazing and said that such a thing <Col N="207" /> would not happen under him.  But that site was advertised for grazing on the 1st December last and was advertised again, as Deputy Corry told us, in yesterday's <i>Cork Examiner.</i>  I should like if the Minister would make some definite statement about this Sarsfield's Court project, whether it is intended to go ahead with it or not. He will excuse my saying so, but I think he was very sarcastic in his statement about his predecessors with regard to that institution and ridiculed them for the delay.  Yet, 17 months have now passed and, so far as the people of Cork can see, there is no advance being made in connection with that proposal.  I understand there is no water supply there.  We do not know who is responsible.  No administrative body has been appointed, so far as I know, to look after that institution when it is set up.  We do not know whether it will be taken over by the Joints Sanatorium Committee or a committee on which there will be members from outside counties which it is supposed to serve.  There is no local responsibility for the delay in connection with the plans or anything else.  Nothing has been sent down to anybody about it.  The planning and the building of that institution have been left to the people in Dublin.  We all have experience of what they are, both under the last Government and under this Government. I should like if the Minister would tell us whether this institution will be completed in five years or ten years or 15 years.  So far as we in Cork can see, nothing has been done about this matter, or other matters that I shall refer to later.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will agree with me that the local authorities in Cork have given him every co-operation.  I will say that the Minister has met us in connection with most of the schemes we have put up there.  So far as the money to be contributed by the State is concerned, we have come to an agreement.  Still I think there must be some hold up.  I should like to know who is responsible and why these schemes are not being proceeded with.</P>
    <P>There was a suggestion put up to the <Col N="208" /> Minister about a new fever hospital in Cork.  The foundations for that building were laid a long time ago and the position is that the construction of it could go ahead very rapidly.  The people of Cork are very anxious to do anything that is desirable in connection with that.  At a meeting of the Cork Corporation last night it was agreed that if the Minister wants that institution, when finished, as a temporary sanatorium until such time as the building at Sarsfield's Court is completed the hospital should be handed over for that purpose so that the Minister will have some decent hospital until the other is available.  When that report comes up to the Minister, I ask him to see that there will be no more delay, because this is a building in connection with which all preliminary work has been done and the construction of it could go right ahead.  I ask him to see that the officials of his Department will not hold that up or put it in cold storage.</P>
    <P>In Mallow the Minister has got a very fine modern hospital which the people of North Cork handed over to him for five years.  Owing to delay, however, in sanctioning certain alterations which are necessary, 30 or 40 beds in that institution have to be used by the staff. If the provision for accommodation for the staff had been sanctioned, there would have been 30 or 40 more beds available for patients in that hospital.</P>
    <P>The Minister is also aware of the delays in the Department in connection with the regional hospital.  I do not know what is holding up that matter. Any proposal sent down to the South Cork Board of Assistance in connection with that hospital is dealt with promptly.  I do not know why it is not going ahead.  The Minister knows that there is a pressing need for the maternity portion of that hospital and I appeal to him to see that it is gone ahead with.</P>
    <P>During the West Cork election, the Minister was reported in one of the papers as having stated that 64,000 people died from tuberculosis during the 16 years Fianna Fáil were in office. I appeal to the Minister to give up the idea of trying to sling dirt at the people <Col N="209" /> who were in office before him.  The people who were in charge of health matters under previous Governments did their work.  They had many difficulties which the Minister had not to face.  We had the economic war and the European war, but the people then in office did their best.</P>
    <P>I took the trouble last week to go down to the library and I have got whatever returns were available as regards deaths from tuberculosis.  I find that in 1924 there were 3,692 deaths from tuberculosis of the respiratory system.  In 1938 that was reduced to 2,498.  It increased again during the war years, but in 1946 it was down to 2,585.  So that the Minister must give some credit to the people who went before him.  He had a health Act already framed and had only just to implement it when he came in.  Sites had been obtained for the regional hospitals and regional sanatoria, and I think he would be better advised to appreciate the people that did so much to build up the State, even though they did not do all that we would all desire. The conditions under which they carried on should be considered and it would be better not to try to discredit everybody else and to try to create the impression, &ldquo;I am the greatest of them all.&rdquo;  It is a happy knack of some of the people running the Government to create the impression, &ldquo;There is none so good as I am.&rdquo;  I consider that everybody did his best for the people who are sick and it was only gradually that things were improving.  There is no doubt that they were improving. What we are disappointed about is that the Minister is not carrying out the plans that we had ready as quickly as we would like.  I believe it would be the Minister's desire to do it, but by now I am sure he sees all the difficulties that the people before him had to face.</P>
    <P>Last year Deputy Con Lehane spoke about building a hospital in two months.  Waving wands will not build hospitals.  Waving wands will not get the people in the Department to stir themselves.  As I have said, I was on many deputations to the Minister and I found him always willing to co-operate with us as far as possible and I do believe that he meant to help us <Col N="210" /> in every way, as far as Cork is concerned. He recently told me that there was £2,000,000 provided for hospitalisation in Cork, but that is no good if it is not going to be spent.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Allen, I was alarmed at the Minister's statement about voluntary hospitals.  Last week he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is obvious that with so large a capital programme depending on Hospitals' Trust Fund moneys, some ceiling must be put on the amount of recoupment in respect of deficits, and I have been in touch with the Hospitals' Commission about the matter. I hope to be in a position to make recommendations to the voluntary hospitals concerned in the near future.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would point out to the Minister that many of the voluntary hospitals had money invested for endowment and other special purposes and I appealed to them to spend those investments, because in letters from the Department they were told that they would get no money for any capital expenditure until they had their investments spent. But, from what I can see now, the people that were opposed to me were wiser than I was when they said: &ldquo;We have no guarantee that Governments are going to carry on recouping deficits&rdquo;, notwithstanding the fact that in circulars from the Department those people were told they need not be dependent on the interests of their investments to pay their deficits, that the Hospitals' Trust would pay their deficits.  I think it is a very serious state of affairs if we are not in a position to recoup the voluntary hospitals in respect of their deficits.</P>
    <P>The voluntary hospitals that I know in Cork are doing wonderful work. In my opinion they are ideal.  They make the people that can do so pay. They deal with national health patients and they deal with people who are unable to pay and they never force people to go into debt to pay off their hospital bills, as the local authority hospitals very often do.  They do not send the home assistance officer to investigate their means when they say they cannot pay.  They depend on <Col N="211" /> some reputable citizen who will state their case for them and they generally are very favourable to the patient. If hospitals like those, which are ideally situated, in the centre of the City of Cork and other cities, are not going to be maintained and we say we are not in a position to pay their deficits, how are we going to maintain the big hospitals that we are talking about building?  Surely it is much more important to keep the hospitals on when they are doing such good work, as is acknowledged by every Minister, and to see that they are maintained rather than to build other hospitals.  The voluntary hospitals get contributions from the local authorities. They get a certain amount of their painting and repair work done by the corporation and county council. They get a certain number of paying patients.  If institutions like these are to be allowed to run down, I do not know what is the use in talking about all these proposed hospitals.  How are we going to maintain the big hospitals? I impress on the Minister the importance of seeing that the voluntary hospitals are maintained.  The voluntary hospitals have to go to a lot of trouble to satisfy the Hospitals' Trust before their deficits are paid.  They have to supply a budget at the commencement of every year and they have to submit their accounts monthly, as far as I know, and all the headings are very carefully considered.  The institution which I am connected with has been complimented time and again about the efficient way it is run.  It would be a terrible pity that institutions like these should be unprovided for while we are talking about building big hospitals.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which I would like to draw the Minister's attention. On a few occasions this year we have received circulars advising the corporation and the other bodies that they could increase the salaries of their medical officers of health and their assistant medical officers of health but, on a couple of occasions, when the local authorities recommended increases for medical officers of health they were not sanctioned by the Department and it appears to me that instead of giving <Col N="212" /> more power to the local authority the idea is to take it away.  It is certainly transferring it to the Minister.  We had a case where the Cork Sanatorium Committee recommended an increase of £200 a year for the resident medical superintendent and the assistant resident medical superintendent due to the fact that they were responsible for Mallow as well as Heatherside and due to the efficient way they were doing their work.  The recommendation has been turned down twice by the Minister's Department and it has been sent back again.  We had a case in the corporation where the Minister authorised an increase for the medical officer of health and an assistant medical officer of health and refused sanction in the case of another assistant medical officer of health.</P>
    <P>The corporation last night decided to send that back again to the Minister. The corporation and the manager are quite satisfied that the duties of that doctor are equally as important as those of the other people. People are beginning to think that, because a recommendation comes from below, it will not be sanctioned, but if it comes from above then the people below are supposed to agree to it.  I would ask the Minister to look into the couple of cases that I have mentioned.  I am afraid that it will help to destroy the interest of local people in the work of committees if recommendations such as these, which they made after giving them serious consideration, are turned down.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Reilly, a little while ago, tried to talk about food.  I do not know whether I should be in order in talking about milk or not.  The position with regard to milk in Cork at the present time is this: that the supplies which we are getting must be injurious to the health of children. Several of the milk suppliers only deliver milk once a day.  From a return which was before us last night, there are 18 suppliers who only deliver milk once a day and these have no cooling apparatus, with the result that the milk gets sour and children will not drink it.  I am sure that if they did drink it, it would not be good for their <Col N="213" /> health.  I would ask the Minister to do something about that.  The Minister for Agriculture and himself ought to have some power to deal with that.  If they cannot compel people to deliver milk twice a day, and I believe they cannot, they should at least see that those people would not get permits to come in with a supply to the city, because I know there are plenty of people who, if they got the permits, would be anxious to deliver twice a day.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which my attention was drawn recently.  It arose out of the death of a girl.  Her father went around to at least six doctors' houses and failed to get a doctor to attend his child.  I know it is very hard to expect doctors, after putting in a hard day's work, to go out again at night and have their night's sleep disturbed when they know that they will have to face another hard day's work on the following day.  My suggestion to meet that situation is that the Minister should see that some arrangement is made to have a skeleton nightly medical service in big cities.  I know that a case occurred in Dublin some years ago where a doctor's services could not be obtained at night.  It was reported in the newspapers. On this matter I am not speaking solely about public assistance cases.  I know plenty of people who have money, and the fact is that they cannot get a doctor at night.  This is such a serious matter that some arrangement should be made whereby a certain number of doctors would be available for night calls.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan referred to the work of voluntary communities.  I think it is only right that I should refer to the members of a community that we have in Cork who do a great amount of good.  I do not believe they get any help from the State or from any other source.  They have to depend for their support on charity.  I refer to the Little Sisters of the Assumption.  The members of that community visit the houses of the poor when members of the family are ill.  They attend to whoever is ill, and if there are any children in the house they look after them in the morning and send them off <Col N="214" /> to school.  They also look after the mother if she is sick.  In return for what they do, they will not even take a drink of water in the house.  I do not know whether the Minister can do anything for them or not.  All I do know is that the people of Cork appreciate their services.  I thought it right to refer to what the members of that community do since Deputy Cogan mentioned the matter of voluntary services by communities.</P>
    <P>Some time ago I was on a deputation to the Minister from the South Cork Board of Assistance when we discussed with him the question of radio-therapy. That is about three months ago.  The Minister told us that he would have a report from a cancer specialist within a fortnight and asked us to defer the matter until then.  Since then we have heard nothing about it.  I do not know whether he has got the report or not. We are very anxious that something should be done about this and I would ask him to look into it.</P>
    <P>I would also ask him, no matter who is responsible for all the plans, that he should go ahead at once with those that have been agreed to before any more are suggested.  There is no use in having plans on paper for more new clinics and dispensaries.  I think that we should go ahead with the plans that have already been thrashed out and agreed to and make a start somewhere. As I said last year, it would be far better to see more bricks and mortar being used than all this paper splash with nothing being done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend, in the course of my remarks, to refer to the contribution that was made by Deputy Dr. Ryan concerning the appointment of a publicity officer by the Minister.  In the hope that the Deputy will find it convenient to attend the House later, I propose to defer my remarks on that matter for a little while.  Deputy McGrath gave the Minister advice in rather crude terms.  It was rather surprising that it should have come from the Opposition.  The advice was to the effect that the Minister should desist from slinging dirt.  If Deputy McGrath were to address his remarks to some of his colleagues perhaps they would be more effective <Col N="215" /> and would be directed more correctly to them than to the Minister.  Deputy McGrath, however, made one constructive contribution which I suggest is worthy of consideration by the Minister. He referred to the difficulty which many of us have experienced of obtaining the services of a medical man at night when ordinary services are generally suspended.  It occurs to me that the Minister might direct his attention to large centres of population and suggest that in them there would be a voluntary organisation amongst medical men to have relays of doctors available during the night when, ordinarily, it is difficult to get a doctor. Very frequently the ordinary citizen spends hours chasing around from one doctor's house to another, only to find that a doctor is not available.  The doctors may be out on other cases or they may have legitimate business to attend to, or they may be&mdash;they are human and they are entitled to it&mdash; obtaining some necessary recreation to enable them to pursue their avocation the following day.</P>
      <P>If, however, it were generally known in a town&mdash;and most of our towns are not of such huge dimensions that it could not very quickly be noised abroad and understood by the inhabitants&mdash;that at certain hours certain doctors would be available, it would be very helpful to the community.  That may be a very small matter, but it would add immensely to the comfort of many citizens and it would also relieve doctors of harassing attempts to obtain their services when they may be very much in need of repose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears to me that matters such as that, matters requiring the co-operation of the medical profession among themselves to render better service to the community, lead to a consideration of the nationalisation of health services.  Under a system of nationalisation of health services, where the doctors would be relieved from the pressing necessity of seeking monetary gain on an individual basis, it would be very easy to work out such a suggestion as has been made in regard to night calls on doctors.  I am sure the Minister realises that, with the <Col N="216" /> advent of science and the development of a social consciousness in most nations, nationalisation of health services is bound to be developed in some form or other in this country.  He may have particular problems; he may have questions to be solved which are different from those naturally obtaining in other countries, but the broad principles of nationalisation of health services are bound to develop and the Minister might, I think, with benefit to us all, address himself to the question of publicising the advantages of a nationalised health service.  I do not know whether the Minister is in favour or otherwise of a nationalised health service.  He may be a fervent advocate of it or he may have his doubts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoderickJamesConnoll" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister may take pride in his work.  I had hopes that the debate on these Estimates would consist of commendations and encomiums generally on the Minister and his Department.  I thought, perhaps, we might all share the view of Deputy Cogan that health measures should not be related to political Parties.  Evidently, however, from the tenor of the remarks of some Deputies, <Col N="217" /> we are still in the position that, on a national scale, our health depends on our politics, because there was, to a considerable extent, reference to the political aspirations and beliefs of the Minister on this Estimate, though they were very vaguely related to the administration of his Department. However that may be, rather than make any reference of the nature which I intended and which aroused the ire of Deputy MacEntee last year, when I happened to make some favourable reference to the Minister, I might say that the best commendation that can be made of the Minister and his work is to note the absence of the very peculiar form of criticism that was evident last year.</P>
      <P>That type of ill-tempered and discourteous and ill-founded criticism seems to have disappeared and seems no longer to be the stock-in-trade of the Opposition.  There were, possibly, just vague remnants of that type of thought in some of the references in Deputy McGrath's speech, but last year, if you remember, the Minister was accused wrongly.  He was accused of creating in this country a national tuberculosis neurosis.  He was accused of having a political ramp or racket under the title of Tuberculosis Incorporated and his very sincere and keen desire to deal with this problem was, in the hands of these members of the Opposition&mdash;at least there was an attempt made&mdash;turned against him and turned against the Department which was carrying out his plan of campaign in reference to the prevention and the cure of tuberculosis.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoderickJamesConnoll" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very happy to say that the absence of it is the best indication that the Opposition's attitude to the Department of Health has changed.  I trust that we will hear no more of that attitude of mind, and the last reference I will make to it is that I trust there will not be any recurrence of it.  I mention it as a happy augury of a change of mind.  I think that change of mind has been produced because of the very solid work that has been put into this problem of treating <Col N="218" /> tuberculosis by means of the administrative measures the Minister has taken.  That is something we all applaud.</P>
      <P>There are other matters under this Estimate to which one could address one's attention.  There are specific matters which must be brought to the attention of the Minister.  Other Deputies have referred to them.  It is my wish to support what has been said in reference to some of them. Dispensaries come under the Minister's administration.  I think it is time that there was a survey of the conditions of these dispensaries and an examination into the conditions under which patients have to wait until they are attended by the dispensary doctor.  Some dispensaries are housed in the worst possible buildings. In my constituency some of them are situated in thatched shacks.  No provision is available for waiting patients.  There is no protection against weather.  If it rains they must suffer the rain; if it snows they must suffer the snow.  That condition is not the fault of the medical officer of health.  It is an inheritance.  These dispensaries have become a tradition. It is difficult because of that to overcome the inertia that exists.  Possibly the local authorities have become so accustomed to them that they cannot change the facilities or modify or improve these buildings.  I suggest the Minister should address himself to this problem.  A change of mind on the part of the local medical officers is essential.  More important still, that change of mind must be utilised to impress upon local authorities the absolute necessity for providing properly equipped dispensaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We may have magnificent hospitals, we may have very well equipped hospitals in the big centres of population. The rural areas are in a very backward state as far as health services are concerned. It is the rural areas which make up the depleted populations of the cities and towns.  Naturally there is a decline in the ranks in urban populations because of the unnaturally artificial atmosphere of city life.  For that reason we owe a certain debt to the people in the rural areas.  Sometimes <Col N="219" /> these people do not themselves recognise that debt.  They have become so accustomed to enduring these things they will themselves make no great effort to redress the balance.  I am sure the conditions of which I speak are not confined to my constituency.  I am sure they exist all over the country.  The provision of properly equipped dispensaries in the rural areas is a matter of primary importance to the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>Some of the district hospitals are in a deplorable state.  Some of them should be preserved by the Board of Works as ancient monuments so that future generations may see under what conditions their ancestors suffered.  If the nation survives at all, these will be a cause for amazement and wonder to those who come after us.  I drew the Minister's attention to one particular place.  He has taken note of that matter and the district concerned will have one of the new hospitals of which he has spoken.  Progress has certainly been made in that respect.  In the case to which I refer the people of the district call the local district hospital the &ldquo;slaughter house&rdquo;.  That is the reputation it has.  I trust that reputation will shortly be only a bad memory when the new hospital comes into operation.</P>
    <P>In regard to these hospitals I would like to stress the lack of any proper massage services.  People requiring massage in the rural areas must come to Dublin for it.  A workman injured in the course of his work may have to travel to Dublin once or twice a week to avail of the services of a qualified masseur.  That entails expense to the worker and loss of time from his employment. There is no scheme for recouping him for that.  Surely it ought to be possible to have a trained masseur attached to all these hospitals for the convenience of local residents. That should be a matter for consideration in the equipment of these new hospitals.</P>
    <P>With reference to the allowances under the infectious diseases maintenance regulations, there have been widespread complaints.  I have had a number of such complaints.  There have <Col N="220" /> even been complaints in regard to delay in deciding whether those suffering from certain diseases are eligible for consideration under these regulations. There has been undue delay in deciding the case and there has been, too, I think, delay that is not warranted in making payments.  There appears to be some laxity or lack of understanding of the regulations.  They are new, perhaps, to the machine; the usual official machine has not yet got into working order and that may account for all the complaints in relation to those who benefit under these regulations.  Whatever the reason, I certainly think that the question of the working of the Infectious Diseases (Maintenance) Regulations, 1948, requires to be inquired into.  The regulations may require overhauling.  The experience that has been acquired by the local authorities and the Department may now be sufficient to have the matter overhauled and to apply such lubrication to it as to ensure that it works more efficiently and quickly than it has in the past.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect of that to which I wish to draw the Minister's attention and to contrast it unfavourably with a similar type of Departmental handling of the case by another Department. I do not know whether the Minister is aware of this, whether it has reached his Department or whether it is a purely local matter, but in so far as it deals with the administration of the infectious diseases maintenance allowances, I think it is proper to bring it to his attention.  There is a specific case in which a certain young lady, a boot and shoe operative, applies, as she appears to be entitled to apply, under date May, 1949.  She receives a reply on the 24th May that her application has been carefully considered and the local authority regrets to inform her that she does not qualify for any of the allowances payable by the local council under the Infectious Diseases (Maintenance) Regulations, 1948.  So far so good.  There is a definite decision taken there by a local authority.  It is a decision with which the applicant, of course, is not in concord, the case being such that her trade union officials think she is well worthy of obtaining these allowances.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="221" /> She makes application to the council, inquiring on what grounds they have made the decision that they communicated to her.  Here is the crux of the matter.  They have a circular; it is not a letter that is specially sent to her; it is sent to any number of people who have the temerity to inquire why their applications have been turned down. This circular, dated the 28th March, is in the following terms:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In reply to your recent letter, regarding the council's decision on your application for an allowance under the above named regulations, I regret it would not be feasible for the council to enter into correspondence about the reasons which prompted the decision reached by them in any particular case.  All applications are dealt with in accordance with the provisions of Section 44 of the Health Act, 1947, and the regulations made thereunder.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that that is a very high-handed action.  I think it is an action that requires Ministerial and prompt intervention. Any citizen is entitled to obtain from any local council or Department of Local Government something more than a curt reference to the fact that the council is unable to enter into correspondence on the matter.  Surely the Minister will see to it that this attitude, in relation to sufferers from tuberculosis, is abandoned and abandoned very quickly. He knows himself of this own experience how distraught these people are, how mentally affected they are by attitudes observed towards them.  He knows the particular peculiarities of this disease and that local officials should consider these people's mental health as well as their material needs.  It appears that this girl is an orphan and has no relatives. She was a boot and shoe worker and her total income appears to be 18/- a week from national health insurance.  How they could justify the decision is beside the point.  I could argue on that but I do not intend to. I can argue on the attitude of mind which is evidenced by the circular and which, I think, requires very rapid <Col N="222" /> alteration or rectification by the Department and its local officials.</P>
    <P>There is also another matter to which I referred in the beginning and which, I think, might be dealt with now. Deputy Dr. Ryan had occasion to refer to certain aspects of the Minister's administration.  The references were, I think, unworthy of the Deputy, but they were such that I think any other Deputy, who is acquainted with the matter, should be loath to pass over or neglect them.  Deputy Dr. Ryan, according to a report of his speech in to-day's <i>Irish Press</i>, mentioned that an ex-candidate of Clann na Poblachta got the job of publicity officer of the Minister's Department. He seems to take exception to that. He seems to single out the political beliefs of the candidate for this office and suggests that there was some sort of personal or political preference by the Minister involved in this appointment. I think that we should be quite clear upon this matter.  We should distinguish between what might be called political preference and the spoils system.  The only question, I think, that should concern the members of this House, and particularly an ex-Minister, in reference to a matter like that is whether the qualifications of the applicant were sufficient, were of the standard required or not.  I do not believe that anyone in a case of this type should make reference to the political leanings or beliefs of the successful applicant.  The gentleman concerned, Mr. de Blacam, was a candidate of Clann na Poblachta.  He was a professional journalist with very high qualifications, sufficiently high to be a feature writer in the <i>Irish Press</i> and a member of the Fianna Fáil organisation while he was of the opinion that that organisation was advancing the national cause and doing what was best for the country. When he, in his judgment, thought right to disagree with the policy of the paper on which he served, he servered his connections with that political organisation of which it is the organ and he joined another organisation&mdash; Clann na Poblachta.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Chair understands it, certain references were made that a certain officer of a Minister's Department got an appointment because of his political opinions, and Deputy Connolly was quite entitled to refute that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoderickJamesConnoll" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>While the gentleman in question was in accord with the opinions of that paper, he was retained on its staff.  When he disagreed with them politically, they saw fit to remove him from the staff of that paper.  They did not consider that it was possible for him as a citizen to exercise his rights and join an organisation to which they were opposed.  Any member of the Opposition, or even the <i>Irish Press</i>, could not for a moment question his professional qualifications as one who is properly equipped to handle matters of publicity.  He has training that is of a first-class nature.  He is an author of standing.  He knows how to handle publicity.  On this basis alone he would be entitled to an appointment such as was made by the Minister in his Department.  That he was a member of Clann na Poblachta, of course, would be an additional recommendation to the Minister in his regard&mdash;there is no doubt about that. No one is so innocent in this House as to believe that Fianna Fáil, the present Government, or any other Government in this country will for a very long time forgive its enemies and forget its friends.  That is not the ordinary course of public life in this country. Other things being equal, any Minister will be inclined, of course, to appoint that person who is closest to him in political thought&mdash;naturally so.  What we have to concern ourselves with is whether he has the qualifications for the position.  If he has not the qualifications for the position, then the Ministerial appointment is open to doubt, it is open to criticism, and it is open to the strongest objection from members of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There can be no question whatsoever of the spoils system in this case.  In my submission, in a case where someone <Col N="224" /> is appointed to a position for which he has not the qualifications, where someone is promoted at a rate which is not merited by his record, whether in the Army, the Department of Justice, the Department of Health or anywhere else, then I think the House should call the matter to its attention and deal with it.  But where a man, as in this case, has every qualification that is required of a publicity officer, I do not think that his appointment by the Minister should be called in question.  I deprecate very strongly that this was done by Deputy Dr. Ryan.</P>
    <P>There may be some form and substance in his other charge in reference to the acquiring of some one and a half acres in connection with the Newcastle sanatorium.  Of that I know nothing at all.  But it would be well for the House that Deputy Dr. Ryan would be more precise about these charges that he makes in regard to the Department, instead of the method that he has of making a rhetorical question out of it and posing it on this side and the other.  That is a specious form of propaganda that should not be indulged in, particularly by an ex-Minister.  He said that this farm was the property of and ex-Clann na Poblachta candidate. He had been told so.  He said it was perhaps a coincidence, or was it?  This method of stating a case I think is to be deprecated.  It leads one to the belief that we have in this ex-Minister a dilly-dally-dickery-dock.  He will not state a case definitely.  He will not say he is of the opinion that there has been some malpractice in this case or that the Minister is guilty of something.  If he is not certain of the matter, I suggest that the matter should be left alone, that it should not be brought up and given the publicity that it has been given.  If there is anything definitely wrong, certainly he should bring it to the attention of the House, but I am not satisfied that there has been in this case.  Particularly, I am completely satisfied that it was erroneous in every way and wrong of Deputy Dr. Ryan to bring before the House the question of the appointment of a publicity officer to the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>Finally, Deputy Cogan wound up <Col N="225" /> fittingly enough with the question of the morgues.  I do not think that is of any great importance.  There is a matter which I should like to bring up and it is an important one.  It relates to the mental homes, as they are called, in this country.  Many people consider them to be the morgues of the living.  I should like the Minister to acquaint us as to the development and organisation, if there has been any, of the modern, up-to-date, scientific practices for the curing of mental disease which is altogether to prevalent in this country.  If the Minister would get the comparative figures of the incidence of mental disease in this country with others of a similar character, similar size and population, I think he would find that we are not very favourably situated, to put it in the mildest possible terms.</P>
    <P>As all who take the slightest interest in these matters know, there have been lately wonderful advances, even beyond the experimental stage, in the treatment of these cases and I harbour the suspicion that we are, as we are in many other aspects of the health services, regrettably behind.  I have received complaints that patients in some of these hospitals, who are not very seriously affected, who could be cured if some of the modern methods of treatment were practised on them, remain there without perhaps getting the benefit of such treatment until their case becomes more serious than it need necessarily have become.  It is for that reason that I wish to mention finally the case of these mental hospitals and to urge upon the Minister that the whole question of the inspection of these hospitals and the equipment of them with the best and most modern appliances and the organisation of services founded upon modern practices should be taken under consideration by his Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcCann" hpid="Mr. McCann Mr. McCann">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCann</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say I was touched by Deputy Connolly's solicitude to keep health and politics divorced.  I am afraid it is a very belated solicitude.  He and his colleagues should have thought about that before the previous general election and should have given credit where credit was due, as Deputy McGrath said.  He <Col N="226" /> castigated them for not doing so.  They should have given credit where credit was due.  They should have had regard to the very difficult transitional period through which the late Administration passed.</P>
      <P>I did not hear a word here to-day or during this debate&mdash;perhaps I will hear it yet from Deputy Alderman Alfred Byrne&mdash;about hospital accommodation in the city.  Before Fianna Fáil left office, at every available opportunity Deputies were jumping up from this side of the House like jacks-in-the-box criticising the Fianna Fáil Administration for not providing proper hospitals in the city.</P>
      <P>I put a question to the Minister in March of this year.  I asked him how many beds had been provided during the last 12 months, apart from beds for patients suffering from tuberculosis, and the Minister's reply was that 36 beds had been provided.  That is the position after all the promises that were made and after the allegations about Fianna Fáil's disregard for the health of the people of this city and of the country.  I am prepared, and always will be, to give credit where credit is due and I am prepared to give the Minister his measure of praise for what he is doing on behalf of the tuberculosis suffers in isolating them, if not doing more to prevent the disease. I do not think the Minister has given a performance worthy of the promises which were made before the general election in relation to hospitalisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On May 10th I asked the Minister a further question.  I asked him if he could state when building operations would commence on the St. Vincent's, St. Laurence's, The Coombe, Dublin Fever and Crumlin Children's Hospitals. The Dublin Fever Hospital, and the Crumlin Children's Hospital, the Minister informs us, will start this year.  He hopes it will start.  But he could give no date whatever in relation to St. Laurence's as to when building operations will commence.  I single out St. Laurence's because St. Laurence's is a State hospital.  There is rather an anomalous position in St. Laurence's, the old Richmond Hospital. It is a State hospital but it is <Col N="227" /> run by a voluntary staff.  Deputies who were in this House approximately eight years ago will remember when the St. Laurence's Hospital Bill was first introduced, and they will know also that the St. Laurence's Hospital Bill was shelved.  It was shelved because of the opposition from this side of the House at that time.  The Fine Gael Party opposed that Bill tooth and nail, and it was some three years later when, by agreement with the Fine Gael Party, it seemed, and others concerned, the Bill was reintroduced. If the St. Laurence's Hospital Bill had been allowed to go ahead at that time there would be a general hospital in this city that would at least relieve the congestion and alleviate the position that exists to-day.  The Minister must know, every medical officer must know, and every doctor in this House or outside it will tell you that there is not a bed to be got in this city.  I have known cases, as one of the Labour Deputies said, of people looking in the middle of the night, not for doctors, but for beds.  For my part I must say that the medical practitioners in this city, in the great majority of cases, will answer a call in the middle of the night.  There may be a minority who will not, but it is a very tiny minority. When there is urgent necessity to remove a patient to hospital they cannot find a bed.</P>

      <P>The plans were there and the Cabra site was purchased a few years ago.  Is that correct?  Were not the plans ready?  Now it seems that the exact number of beds which are to be provided in St. Laurence's Hospital cannot be agreed upon.  The first crux in the position years ago&mdash;and there might have been something in it from one point of view&mdash;was that the medical practitioners did not want to leave the old site, did not want to leave the old hospital in North Brunswick Street, did not want to go out to Cabra.  That is why the Bill was held up.  Then it was agreed that they would move and I think they got certain assurances&mdash;and I was prepared to assure them that I would do whatever was in my power to see that the two big hospitals were kept there, that the hospital in North Brunswick Street would be reserved for emergency cases and that the new hospital would be a general hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say it is a very poor performance that we have arrived at the stage, after practically 18 months of office, that there is not a bed to be got in this city except in St. Kevin's.  The Minister, if he knows Dublin at all, will know that there are people who will not go to St. Kevin's.  There are other people who will go to St. Kevin's, that is the old South Dublin Union, and will pay £4 4s. 0d. a week there because they know that they get the best of treatment and the best surgeons and physicians in that hospital and that not a word can be said about St. Kevin's Hospital, which is the most up to date <Col N="229" /> in many ways, but it has a stigma of the South Dublin Union, which is the old workhouse, and old Dubliners will not go to it.  That is why we have the position that the Dublin Corporation must pay £110,000 to the voluntary hospitals in respect of the treatment given by them to people who cannot afford to pay anything.</P>
    <P>I want to know when the Minister is going to see that some hospital building will be started in this city.  He has told us about his plans for 17 years, but I am not concerned about that.  I want to see some hospital building started. How is it going to be financed?  I think the Minister himself said last year that the Hospital Trust Fund is tied up.  It is.  In reply to a question of mine some time ago, he told me that there was £10,311,000 odd in that fund, and that the total amount invested was £9,733,000 odd.  He told me that the dividends from the investments amounted to in or about £308,649 odd, while the estimated deficits, in the case of the voluntary hospitals for 1948, were £420,000.  That latter figure is just £100,000 more than that portion of the fund which is invested producers.  Practically the bulk of the fund is invested. The difference between the £10,000,000 odd and the £9,783,000 is about £500,000.  How is the Minister going to finance his £17,000,000 programme out of a fund of £10,000,000 odd, almost all of which&mdash;£9,793,000&mdash;is invested? Is he going to lift all that money and put it into capital expenditure?  I think the expectation of the Minister is to get approximately £1,000,000 out of the sweepstakes fund each year.  Where is the Minister going to get the money to finance his programme of £17,000,000 over the next seven years?  If all that money is to be spent in the next seven years, where is he going to get the money to meet the deficits of the voluntary hospitals, and remember that every new hospital that is erected is going to mean and additional deficit?</P>

      <P>I do, but I want to know how the cost is going to be met. The Minister said recently that the <Col N="230" /> moneys were there, but that Fianna Fáil would not spend them.  I will not say that was a lie, because I have a certain amount of respect for the Minister.  I respect him more as a crusader than as a politician.  The Minister realised at this time last year that the money that is invested was there to produce the sums required to meet the deficits of the voluntary hospitals.  When all that money is gone on capital expenditure, where does the Minister expect to get money to meet the deficits of the voluntary hospitals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCann</NameTxt>
      <P>I want hospitals built and I want the Minister to start now. I suggest that the Minister for Finance is trying to evade his responsibility. It is the responsibility of the State to build the hospitals, to maintain them and, subsequently, to see that they are properly staffed and serviced.  The produce of the Hospitals' Trust Fund is required to meet the deficits of the voluntary hospitals.  I should like the Minister to answer my question as to how the building is going to be financed.  We, in the Dublin Corporation, are paying £110,000 a year in respect of necessitous persons.  Deputy M. J. O'Higgins is sitting behind the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcCann" hpid="Mr. McCann Mr. McCann">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCann</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not.  We think that this £110,000 should not be paid by the corporation, but that it should be paid by the State.  If the Deputy and his Party have sufficient weight to force that view elsewhere, that will be another £110,000, plus the cost of the maintenance of some of the institutions that will be built or of some of the tuberculosis beds that are being added at the moment, that will be available.  I think that the Minister should get a comprehensive statement from the Minister for Finance in respect of building.  I am certain that the same whisper has gone round to his Department that has gone elsewhere, <Col N="231" /> namely, to slow down on capital expenditure.  There can be no other reason why a start has not been made with the building of St. Laurence's Hospital.  That is only one case.  How many years is it since those in charge of St. Vincent's Hospital signified their intention of going to Elm Park and building there or since the authorities of the Coombe Hospital were engaged in discussions with the various Departments about their site?  I am not going to go into that in detail, but, to my knowledge, that has been going on for the past six years.</P>
      <P>With regard to the establishment of health clinics to replace the dispensary system, the Minister must know that his predecessor, Deputy Dr. Ryan, hoped to carry out a change of that sort.  It is quite true, as Deputy Connolly has said, that the present dispensary buildings are outmoded. The medical service at the dispensaries is good.  The patients get every attention, and they are supplied with medicines.  In fact, I think Deputy Dr. Ryan had gone so far that a White Paper was prepared.  At all events, the matter was brought to the notice of the Dublin Corporation in the shape of a communication&mdash;that the dispensaries were to be scrapped and that a number of health clinics were to be provided instead.  As a matter of fact, a number of sites were inspected.  The Dublin Board of Assistance authorities inspected a number of sites for health clinics.  Again, I would like to know who is going to build them.  Will the State meet the cost or will it fall on the local authority?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to hospital boards and committees of that character, I appealed to the Minister last year to give these boards and committees a greater measure of autonomy.  The experience of the members borders almost on frustration.  They come to decisions, send these decisions to the Department of Health and then find that they have to wait months and months for a reply.  In the case of one small institution with which I am concerned, we were actually surcharged by the auditor for the few coppers a weeks we spent on milk for the cat. <Col N="232" /> That is quite true.  It may seem a trivial matter but it illustrates what happens in the case of these boards and committees.  It is a terrible thing to say that you cannot employ a temporary assistant, whatever he may be, a clinical assistant or a clerk, without having to go down to the Department and, by the time sanction is given, the temporary assistant has gone&mdash;perhaps he has gone months before.  It has been my experience that, when sanction for the appointment of a temporary assistant reaches the committee or the board, the assistant has long since gone.  I would like the Minister to investigate that aspect.</P>
    <P>In the wider sense he and some of his colleagues are in favour of granting the fullest autonomy to local authorities. I do not say, from my experience on hospital boards, that they should not be granted the fullest autonomy. Our hospital boards are very well run and I would ask the Minister not to listen to what Deputy Connolly was trying to get in.  Leave the hospitals in the hands of the voluntary surgeons and physicians, leave them to the voluntary boards, because in the long run you get a better and a cheaper service.</P>
    <P>There was one matter that Deputy Connolly referred to, and that is rheumatism. Some people are inclined to smile when you mention rheumatism, but the Minister knows how serious the disease is.  From figures given to me recently by the Minister for Social Welfare, it is obvious there has been a substantial and continuous drain on the funds of the National Health Society for incapacitation due to rheumatism.  I have been associated with an organisation for the treatment of rheumatism since 1941.  That clinic has done a tremendous amount of work and I had hopes that it would expand. There is an arthritis unit in St. Kevin's Hospital.  I think the Minister will agree that the Dublin clinic is doing good work.</P>
    <P>There was an association set up to establish clinics throughout the country. I agree with Deputy Connolly that people should not have to come to Dublin, as they do from a great many <Col N="233" /> country places, to be treated for rheumatism.  There should be regional clinics.  That matter was discussed with a deputation by the last Minister and agreement was reached.  I think a survey was made of two counties in connection with the disease.  I would ask the Minister to investigate this matter and see if he can possibly get the rheumatism clinic scheme, the original scheme, under way.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a brief reference to athletics.  I believe the Minister has some responsibility in this connection and I know he was invited recently to a conference.  I will ask him to do everything that lies within his power to impress upon the Minister for Finance the vital necessity that exists for funds to be made available for athletics.</P>
    <P>I would also like to point to the desirability of providing more swimming pools to afford health-giving exercises for the citizens of Dublin, particularly the boys.</P>

      <P>I would not take up the time of the House by intervening were it not for the efforts made by my colleague, a member of the Opposition for the same constituency, to misrepresent the Minister outside the House.  I feel that his remarks require some kind of answer.  I want to refer, first of all, to the proposal to erect a sanatorium at Abbotstown.  Undoubtedly there has been, from the point of view of the public, a great delay in this matter.  As everyone knows, it was originally proposed by the previous Administration to build a sanatorium at Santry Court. Through lack of foresight the Department of Health was obliged to pull up its sticks at Santry Court, having spent <Col N="234" /> £60,000 of the ratepayers' money, and seek another site.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>It would seem that the Deputy knows more about Santry Court than those of us who represent the area.  However, that is the history of the matter and we are awaiting developments in relation to the proposed sanatorium at Abbotstown.  Deputy Burke has been telling the people that the proposal to erect the sanatorium at Abbotstown has been shelved.  I should like the Minister to indicate what stage the proposal has reached and how soon may we expect work to begin on this very necessary project.  I trust the plans, which must be in shape by now, will provide for even more bed accommodation than was envisaged at Santry Court.  I urge the Minister to do his utmost to get some tangible results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been repeated references here to the delays occasioned by red tape.  It would seem that no matter what Government is in power every Department is as near as can be to strangulation in the matter of red tape. I hope the Minister will try to cut it out as far as he can, particularly in relation to health matters.  We cannot afford to have trifling bureaucratic obstacles placed in the way of plans aimed at alleviating the sufferings of our people, especially in the drive to eradicate tuberculosis. Those of us who are associated with local authorities feel that it will be quite useless and that we are merely tinkering with the problem of tuberculosis in County Dublin until such time as we have sanatoria with bed accommodation for the constantly increasing number of cases coming to light.  Despite the efforts of the present Minister over the past 12 <Col N="235" /> months, resulting in the provision of a greater number of beds than has ever been provided before for these patients, we still have a large number awaiting beds.  I believe that is due to the fact that the efforts made by the Minister have brought to light cases of tuberculosis which would otherwise not have come to light at all. In his reply I urge upon the Minister that he should indicate to us what the position definitely is in regard to the regional sanatorium for Dublin and how soon may we expect work to commence upon it.</P>
    <P>With reference to the allowances paid under the infectious diseases regulations, principally to those suffering from tuberculosis, it seems to me that the amount provided is not entirely adequate.  It is certainly not sufficient to enable the sufferer to live in decent comfort and to recover full health ultimately.  If it is within the Minister's power, without having recourse to legislation, I would ask him to consider in special cases where there is hardship the granting of an increased rate of allowance.  One aspect of this matter has struck me as being both unfair and unjust.  There are people who have tuberculosis of the limbs.  I have one particular case in mind.  There may be thousands like it throughout the country.  The case to which I refer is that of a boy who contracted tuberculosis in his hip.  After a year or two the disease became dormant, but he is crippled as a result of it.  He has been told by his doctor that the disease may become active at any time.  He is now approaching manhood.  Under the regulations he is not qualified for an allowance.  I think the regulations should be widened to cover such cases.  Any person who is crippled as a result of tuberculosis should benefit under this otherwise excellent scheme.</P>
    <P>I want to refer briefly to a matter which has been mentioned already.  The conditions of workers employed in hospitals is most unsatisfactory.  In Crooksling sanatorium the workers are very dissatisfied with their conditions and hours of work.  I think it is essential that complete satisfaction should <Col N="236" /> be achieved where hospital workers are concerned.  They should be satisfied with their wages, their working conditions and their hours.  That should be a fundamental principle governing the running of any hospital. Recently in another part of the country there was a stoppage of work because the workers were dissatisfied with their conditions.  From my experience of such workers over a relatively long period of time I think we would have many more instances of that, undesirable as it is, were it not for the fact that these workers have a certain sympathy for the people whom they tend.  The conditions under which they work leaves much to be desired.  In Crooksling there are girls who are away from their homes for 14 hours on some days of the week.  Admittedly, they work a 48-hour week.  They work from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. on three days of the week and on the other days they work from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m.  Theoretically, they work a 48-hour week but the time they are off is of no use to them because they are away from home for so long on the days on which they work from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.  I would like the Minister to look into that matter to see if he can adjust the working hours for the benefit of the workers in order to achieve a greater measure of contentment amongst them.  I am sure he will agree that it is vitally essential that these workers should be satisfied with both their hours and their conditions.</P>
    <P>Much has been said during the debate about dispensaries.  In County Dublin we have as great need for dispensaries as they have in other parts of the country.  So far as dispensaries are concerned, the position does need review.  We have areas which are relatively large centres of population on the fringe of the city where there are either very inadequate dispensaries or no dispensaries at all.  I would ask the Minister to give that matter his attention.  Santry, which is on the outskirts of the city, is badly in need of a dispensary.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like the Minister to tell us what is being done in connection with cancer research and in connection with the cure or treatment <Col N="237" /> of that disease.  It has been said that more people die of cancer than of any other disease.  Are students being sent to study in cancer research centres abroad?  There are such centres in existence.  Perhaps the Minister will give us some information on that matter when he is replying.  I think the medical profession has not yet found a complete answer to this terrible scourge, but, at the same time, methods of relieving the cruel sufferings of those who contract this disease have been found.  Perhaps the Minister would indicate how far we have progressed in that direction and what hope we can hold out in the future in connection with the treatment of cancer.</P>

      <P>Ní mian liom-sa ach beagán a rá ar an meastachán so, mar tá cuid mhaith cainte déanta ag teachtaí cheana féin ar cheist seo na sláinte.  Ní hiona é sin, dar ndóigh, mar níl ceist eile le plé níos tábhachtaí ná ceist na sláinte.

Is iad na rudaí is mó atá le cur san áireamh maidir le dea-shláinte, ná tithe maithe a bheith ag daoine, bia maith agus mar sin de.</P>
      <P>Reference has already been made to many matters in this debate and I do not propose to keep the House very much longer.  Deputies have alluded to the incidence of cancer and tuberculosis. We see from the figures the Minister has given us that the toll which cancer takes from the people each year is greater than that levied by tuberculosis.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Provisional figures show that the number of deaths from cancer was 3,985; the total number of deaths from all forms of tuberculosis is estimated at 3,017.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be seen, therefore, that cancer is the disease which takes the greatest toll of our people.  I do not know <Col N="238" /> whether it can be said that measures have yet been found to combat that particular disease although I believe that if it is taken in its incipient stages, it can be cured.  What surprises me is that, while a very widespread campaign of publicity and propaganda is being carried out to combat tuberculosisand rightly so&mdash;we do not hear much about the disease of cancer.  I think that there should be a lot more publicity given to it and that medical officers up and down the country should be advised to be on the alert for the symptoms of that disease because, as I have said, it appears that if sufferers from cancer are given proper radium treatment in the early stages, something can be done for them.  I do not, of course, pose as being any authority on this; I am only a layman but I have known and heard of cases where cancer set in and I have been told that if these cases were attended to in time before the disease took root, it could be more or less cured.</P>
    <P>I see that the death rate from diphtheria has fallen very much for the past few years.  That is a welcome sign and it is, no doubt, due to the more widespread immunisation carried out nowadays.  I understand that a person has to be immunised three times before it can be said that there is real immunisation from the fatal consequences of the disease.  I should like to suggest to the Minister that he might consider the advisability of bringing compulsion to bear on this question of immunisation against diphtheria.  There is no compulsion at present.  I know, of course, that immunisation is carried out more widely now than in former years, but, at the same time, since there is no compulsion, it is only to be expected that several people will go without immunisation.  I understand that when a person gets immunised three times against diphtheria the possibility of death from the disease is very remote indeed, so that I think that the advisability of compelling immunisation of children under a certain age should be considered.  I think there is a better case to be made for compulsion in that regard than there is, say, for compulsion in regard to <Col N="239" /> vaccination against smallpox.  However, it is a matter that the medical authorities should consider, and I think it is worth considering.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter to which I should like to refer.  I asked a question of the Minister on the 30th June in connection with the use of fuel in public institutions all over the country. The question was as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To ask the Minister how many local authorities have acceded to the request to use turf instead of coal in the institutions under their control.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister replied by saying:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The type of fuel used in local authority institutions is primarily a matter for the local authority concerned. The information required is not available in my Department.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I agree that the type of fuel used in these local authority institutions is a matter for their own discretion.  Still I have to throw my mind back to more than a year ago when the Government announced, through the Government Information Bureau, that they were issuing instructions to local authorities all over the country to use turf instead of coal as much as possible.  That, of course, was a laudable thing to do, because the use of turf, which is our native fuel, should get every encouragement. But it is very strange that, while the Government did take those steps to ensure that turf would be used as fuel in the public institutions, they made no effort afterwards to find out whether it was being done or not.  One would imagine that when they thought the question important enough to be announced through the Government Information Bureau they would take some steps afterwards to find out in how many cases their instructions were being carried out.  If I were the managing director of a business concern and I gave certain instructions to agents of mine down the country to do certain things, I would at least try to ascertain afterwards whether those things were being done or not.  I was surprised to find from the Minister's reply that no steps had been taken by the Government to find out in how <Col N="240" /> many institutions all over the country turf was being used instead of coal. The importance of that is quite obvious.  The hand won turf schemes were closed down over a year ago.</P>

      <P>Not at all.  It was always the policy of our Government to encourage the hand-won turf industry. What I am concerned about now is the present Government's attitude towards this industry.  I was glad when they made the announcement that they were taking these steps to ensure that turf would be burned instead of coal in these institutions.  I am afraid, however, that since they have not made any move to find out whether that was being done all over the country there was no sincerity in what they were doing at the time because, as I said, if a person were sincere about any matter of this kind he would try to find out to what extent the thing was being done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one question affecting my own county, and that is the building of a nurses' home in Tralee.  I think the Minister knows something about that.  This nurses' home is very necessary and it is estimated to cost something like £40,000.  Unfortunately, it appears that the Minister or his Department are not prepared to give any financial assistance towards this project.  I do not know whether the matter has been finally considered; perhaps it has not.  I should like to hear from the Minister if there has been any change of heart as regards this project.  It would be very difficult for the local authority in Kerry to find that sum of money.  They would have either to get it from the rates or <Col N="241" /> borrow it, and I am afraid the rates in Kerry are already too high; they are actually 30/3 in the £.  Therefore, I do not think that the ratepayers of Kerry could be expected to bear much more taxation than they are bearing at present.  There are a few other matters I should like to speak about but I do not propose to do so as this debate has been so prolonged.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to say, in relation to the sanction which issues for the temporary appointment of officers of health, whether he puts in any condition that the vacancy prior to the permanent filling of the position will not be allowed to continue longer than is absolutely necessary. It seems to me that these temporary appointments are not good, either for the sick attending the dispensaries concerned or for the persons appointed.  I ask him to say whether he can use his position as Minister to ensure that the permanent appointments will be made as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>Some time ago I asked the Minister to give me statistics as to the number of cases dealt with in County Galway under the maintenance regulations in connection with infectious diseases and he told me that there was no information on the matter in his Department. I wonder would the Minister consider having his Department supplied with these statistics from the various counties. I would also ask him to use his good offices, if it is not already the practice, with the Department of Local Government to see that some priority will be given in the matter of water supplies to districts where fever has broken out on a number of occasions because of a lack of water. We have a number of these in the West Galway constituency, and I do not think that in fixing priority any regard is had to the fact that in some of these districts fever has been endemic. I am sure the Minister will appreciate more than the Minister for Local Government the necessity for seeing that some priority is given to these districts.</P>

Ní thugann an Roinn airecheart dó agus ní dóigh liom go dtugann na húdaráis áitiúla sáith aire dhó ach an oireadh.  Molaim don Aire dul i gcomhairle le Aire an Oideachais.  Ní fheicimse aon bhealach níos fearr ná na scoileanna, go mór mór na scoileanna sa bhFíor-Ghaeltacht, le buntáistí na scéime seo a chur in iúl do na cailíní a mbaineann sé leo. Scaití, ní thagann na cailíní sin ar an eolas i dtaobh na scéime ach de thairbhe seachráin anuraidh, bhí mé féin ag tiomáint gluaisteain ar an mbóthar agus stop ceathrar cailíní mé a bhí ag iarraidh suíochán mar bhí sé ag báisteach.  Thosaíomar ag caint í nGaeilige agus bhíodar ar tí an scoil fhágáil agus chuir mé ceist ortha faoi chéard a bhí ar intinn acu a dhéanamh nuair d'fágaidís an scoil.  Ní raibh aon tuairim acu.  Chuir mé ceist orthu i dtaobh scéim seo na banaltrachta agus bhí duine den cheathrar sásta chur isteach air agus tá an cailín sin anois ag tréineáil i mbliana.  Glacadh léi agus tá sí ag obair i bpríomh-ospidéal na Gaillimhe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Chuir sé iona orm nuair nach mbeadh an scéim sin ar eolas ag an gcailín sin gur go fánach mar sin ó dhuine a casadh léi ar an mbóthar a fuair sí é. Mar gheall air sin táim ag iarraidh ar <Col N="243" /> an Aire a iarraidh ar an Aire Oideachais forála na scéime sin a chrochadh i ngach scoil i riocht is go mbeadh eolas faoi ag gach cailín.</P>
    <P>Tá an iomarca de na cailíní ag dul anonn go Sasana agus dhéanfaidís banaltraí maithe dá bhfáighdís deis oiliúna in Eirinn.  Ós rud é go bhfuil mé ag cur síos ar an scéim, ba mhaith liom tagairt dó fhadhb amháin a thug mé féin faoi deara a bhaineas leis, is é sin go mbítear ró-dhian go minic ar na hiarrathóirí i dtaobh na scéime.  Tá a fhios agam cailíní ar diúltaíodh dóibh anseo in Eirinn-bhí locht ar a gcosa nó locht mar smorthú.  Chuaigh siad anonn go Sasana agus glacadh leo ar an bpointe agus bhíodar ina mbanaltraí an-mhaith.  Má tá siad sásta glacadh leo ins na príomh-ospidéil i Sasana, ní thuigim cén fá nach mbeadh siad feiliúnach in Eirinn.  Scéim an-mhaith do cailíní na Gaeltachta é agus iarraim ar an Aire níos mó spéise a chur ann agus níos mó airgid a chaitheamh leis freisin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>While everybody is satisfied with the Minister's efforts regarding tuberculosis, there are a couple of matters that strike me as not getting sufficient attention, matters to which the Minister might be able to get the various people responsible to pay a little more attention.  Day after day people sell second-hand clothing, which in some cases is the clothing of a tubercular patient, without having that clothing disinfected.  Steps should be taken immediately to see that necessary disinfection of articles of clothing is carried out.  I would also ask the Minister to see that more attention is paid to the disinfection of houses. Occasionally a house in which a tubercular patient lived is vacated and may be handed over to another tenant without the matter being brought to the attention of the county medical officer of health and no disinfection is carried out.  These two matters should get early and serious attention from the Minister's Department and if the Minister has not already at his disposal ways and means of dealing with it he should take immediate steps to acquire them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, everybody is satisfied <Col N="244" /> with the progress the Minister is making in his tuberculosis drive but I do not feel satisfied that sufficient is being done in connection with cancer.  I can only judge the case as an ordinary layman but I consider that cancer is practically as serious in this country at present as tuberculosis and I would like to hear from the Minister what steps are being taken to see what can be done to deal with cancer in the same way as we are trying to deal with tuberculosis.</P>
    <P>On the question of tuberculosis, we, in the County Galway, made available to the Minister a branch of our mental hospital in Castlerea.  We did that on a guarantee from the Minister that, by doing so, we would be none the worse off.  We did it very reluctantly because we erected the building at Castlerea only when we were quite satisfied that the accommodation for mental hospital patients at Ballinasloe was insufficient. The Minister told us of his arrangements for transferring some of the patients at Castlerea to Sligo, Mullingar and Castlebar.  As I have said, he told us that, by giving him Castlerea, we would be none the worse off financially. As a matter of fact, we find that we are, because last year the maintenance costs of the patients that were transferred were very much higher per head than the maintenance costs of our patients in Ballinasloe.  In addition, we had to raise a loan of £46,000 to meet the maintenance costs of these patients transferred to other hospitals. We had to do that for 12 months without getting a fraction from the Minister.  I understand now that we will not be recouped the interest charges that are due on the loan of £46,000.  I think the Minister should do something to meet that and so help to relieve the heavy burdens which are falling on our mental hospital authority. Everybody knows that the rates are soaring.  That loan is still there and the interest charges on it have to be met.  I think that is a bit of a hardship on us.  As I say, we went out of our way to facilitate him.  Therefore, he should see that no hardship would fall on us.</P>
    <P>There is another point I want to bring to the Minister's notice.  It is <Col N="245" /> in connection with the housing of tubercular patients.  I have in mind a family living in a small house.  One of the members, say, is a tubercular case and, of course, mixes with the other members of the family.  The family may make an effort to get an additional room to the house.  As things are at present, they cannot get that done because the Minister for Health is not responsible for housing. That is the responsibility of the Minister for Local Government.  First of all the county medical officer of health has to do something.  In fact, the position is that so many different interests have to be consulted that nothing is done to provide the additional room that is so badly needed.  I had some correspondence with the Minister in connection with this and, seemingly, he does not know what should be done either.  My view is that there should be more co-operation between the Departments of Health and of Local Government for the housing of people such as I speak of.  The problem is an urgent one and should be dealt with at the earliest moment by the Minister.  If additional legislation is required, then I suggest to the Minister that he should bring it forward immediately so that we may be able to get ahead with that particular type of work.</P>
    <P>I have not much complaint to make in that respect so far as our county is concerned.  Perhaps the reason is that we have one of the best county medical officers of health in this country or probably in Europe.  He is a man who works very hard.  Everyone who is interested in public affairs in the County Galway is aware that he works about 14 hours a day.  He is also the superintendent of Galway sanatorium.  Recently, the Galway County Council were prepared to give him some additional remuneration for that particular post, but I think the Minister for Local Government turned down the proposal.  The members of the Galway County Council, and every public representative in the county, know the value of the services which this officer renders.  I sincerely hope, in view of what I have said and of the value of the services which are being rendered by this officer, that if any <Col N="246" /> recommendation is made on the lines which I have outlined to the Minister, he will not turn it down, but that, on the other hand, he will give it favourable consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few matters that I want to bring to the Minister's notice.  Some of them have been mentioned already so it is not necessary for me to labour them too much.  I want, first of all, to direct his attention to the number of mentally defective children who are awaiting admission to some institution where they can get treatment.  I understand there is a huge waiting list in the case of all these establishments.  Sometimes there is a waiting period of two years and, as I say, it is almost impossible to get a child into one of them.  It is a great hardship on parents that they cannot be given a definite date for the admission of their child.  I suggest to the Minister, for his consideration, that every possible step should be taken to increase the accommodation in these institutions which provide treatment for those mentally defective children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a lot said about hospitals and about conditions for nurses. I do not think that matter can be stressed too strongly.  I do not think that we shall ever get suitable girls to enter the nursing profession unless we give them good conditions.  It is not merely a question of pay but rather of working conditions, opportunities for promotion and good recreation facilities.  Now on this matter, in view of what I am about to say, I run the risk of being branded as a Red, or of something in that line, by Deputies on the Opposition Benches.  I am of the opinion that nursing sisters, that is to say, nuns, do a great work in these institutions.  They are first-class nurses and I have not a word to say against them.  At the same time I believe that lay sisters should have the same opportunity for promotion in all our hospitals.  The only way that can be done is by segregating, or separating, the nursing staffs.  I would suggest, for example, that the nursing orders should be responsible for certain hospitals, and that in other hospitals the staff should be a lay staff.  If that <Col N="247" /> were done, there would be a steppingstone to promotion for the lay staff. A girl would go in as a probationer, she could rise to be a sister and eventually a matron.  Under the present system, in the case of several hospitals, there is not that possibility of promotion because once a girl qualifies as a nurse she has to stick at that for the rest of her life.  That is not an incentive to a girl who is really interested in that profession.  The Minister should take a strong line in that connection, and there can be no question of criticism.  Deputy Brennan, of the Fianna Fáil Party, said there was an insult offered to the nursing sisters. There is no such thing as an insult offered to them.  They have rendered sterling service, and will always do so.</P>
    <P>I do not want to mention local matters too much, but there has been talk in my constituency for a long time about the Boyle hospital.  I think the Minister has heard a lot about it.  It is appalling when you consider the position in Boyle.  There is only one hospital in Roscommon, the county hospital, with approximately 96 beds, and it is situated in the most thinly populated part of the county.  In the course of questions to-day the Minister was asked about Athlone hospital and he mentioned that Roscommon was supposed to cater, at least in part, for the patients from the Athlone district. Everybody knows that Athlone is a very densely populated area and is one of the best industrial towns in the West.  If Roscommon hospital has to cater for patients from Athlone, I do not see what hope there is of getting the patients from the Boyle area treated.</P>
    <P>Boyle is situated 28 miles from Roscommon and it is approximately the same distance from Sligo.  There is a shack there-that is the only way I can describe it-that passes for a hospital.  Nobody would believe, unless he visited it, that it was a hospital. The roof is falling in-portion of it falls in on the patients day after day. There is no use in having recriminations across the floor of the House over this, because I believe the members of the Roscommon County <Col N="248" /> Council are all equally interested in getting a district or a cottage hospital in Boyle.  The members, including the Fianna Fáil members, have tried for years to get that done, but the co-operation was not there from the top.  Now they are co-operating with all the other Parties in order to urge the Minister to give sympathetic consideration to this question of a hospital in Boyle.</P>
    <P>It has reached the stage in Boyle when if, to-morrow morning, the people heard there was a hope held out that a hospital would be established or something would be done within the next couple of years, they would probably all die of shock and then, perhaps, there would be no need for a hospital at all.  I hope the Minister will give consideration to that matter, as well as to the hospital in Athlone, to which his attention was directed to-day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to mention a few points in connection with this Estimate, for the Minister's attention. I would like to ask him, first of all, how far he has gone in encouraging the appointment of nurses to dispensaries. It will be recalled that under the Health Act passed by the former Government arrangements could be made whereby a very highly trained nurse would be appointed to each dispensary in the country and she would be capable, not only of doing proper nursing work, but also of giving instruction in hygiene and so forth.  I understand it is very hard to get nurses of that kind.  They require a great deal of training and it is a long term proposition.  I should like to know what steps the Minister has taken and whether he is using the Jubilee Nursing Association or any similar association for consultative purposes, and particularly in connection with the training of such nurses.  It would seem to me that that would be one of the most vital matters relating to public health and these nurses could give tremendous assistance to dispensary doctors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, I would like to ask the Minister whether he desires to express any view on the nutritional survey of Dublin.  We are all aware there is a <Col N="249" /> very serious pocket of extreme poverty in the centre of Dublin of which we are all ashamed, although it was caused through no fault of the present or the last Government or the Government that first came into this country.  I and many other Deputies were more than delighted to read in that survey that out of the 500 families examined, including artisans, people of the middle classes and the very poor, the report showed that they virtually all were getting enough to eat in one way or another, either from State or voluntary assistance.</P>
    <P>The report then went on to say that the character of the food was inadequate, and it mentioned in particular two types of food, milk and protein.  The question of providing more milk is one for the Minister's attention.  The Minister for Agriculture, before the present drought, said we would have butter for export. An excellent thing to export, butter, but before we export all the surplus butter I think the Minister for Health should present a report to the Minister for Agriculture on the decline in milk consumption in Dublin, in spite of the very great increase that took place during the former Government's régime, and in spite of the increase which I believe again took place, irrespective of the increase of population, in the first year of the present Government's régime.  We all know that milk consumption has been increasing steadily in Dublin for years, even during the emergency, and even allowing for the increase in population. Nevertheless, the survey shows there is a lack of milk consumption among the poor.</P>
    <P>The Minister has the means of providing milk, either by way of subsidy or by way of altering the regulation under which free milk is given.  The way is open to him at no very great increase in cost.  He should seriously consider that matter.  So far as the protein is concerned, that is far more difficult, but the Minister might consider a change in the regulations governing the grants for free school meals so as to encourage the issue of soup or stew or meat with the school meal in places where it is not provided and <Col N="250" /> where only milk and buns are being provided.  It is quite evident the Minister has the responsibility for examining that report and he can deal with protein deficiency through the school meals and the milk deficiency from subsidy.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of finding out in what way canteens for workers can be encouraged so that in factories and other institutions workers who cannot go home can be sure of getting a square meal at a reasonable price. That is another way of covering the deficiency in the types of food consumed by very poor people in the central area of Dublin.</P>
    <P>I should also like the Minister to advert to the question of bath facilities in Dublin which are wilfully and disgracefully inadequate.  We heard references to swimming pools which are supposed to cost £1,000,000.  The figure struck me as quite fantastic but nevertheless bath, bathing and common laundry facilities are fearfully inadequate in the City of Dublin.  Although I know that there is a great burden placed upon the Minister in regard to the improvement of health services, it seems to me that is a vital matter.</P>
    <P>I would like also to ask the Minister what his plans are in relation to mass radiography in the rural areas and whether he envisages the provision of X-ray vans, how quickly they will be delivered and whether we can anticipate having a complete service for the whole country in mass radiography in a reasonably short period of time.  As a method of discovering tuberculosis in its early stages, as the Minister well knows, it cannot be equalled.  For the benefit of many people who wish to take preventive measures against tuberculosis I would like the Minister to tell us a little bit more about B.C.G. vaccine.</P>
    <P>At the opening of the B.C.G. vaccine clinic at St. Ultan's Hospital the Minister seemed to differ from one of the doctors during the course of the proceedings there.  The Minister seemed to think that the arrangements for the giving of B.C.G. vaccine were comparatively simple to carry out. He seemed to think that it could spread very quickly, whereas the <Col N="251" /> doctor seemed almost to correct the Minister.  Although the Press report was probably inadequate, it seemed to indicate that the matter was still under investigation and that, even though the vaccine had seemed successful in Sweden, both in England and Ireland people were extraordinarily conservative about its use.  I think the Minister should give the House a clear statement as to what his views are on the matter.  He should tell us whether he was being a bit optimistic on the occasion of the opening of the clinic. He should tell us if those are his real views and, if so, how soon may we expect to see the application of the B.C.G. vaccine here on the same scale as in Sweden where, I understand, they have the lowest proportion of tuberculosis of any country in the world.</P>
    <P>Lastly, what steps has the Minister taken to encourage psychiatric treatment in mental hospitals?  Under the former Government we were all aware that electric therapy and various other forms of treatment were encouraged. Yet, there are still some hospitals where the staff are inadequate to deal with that.  So far as I am aware the development of psychiatric treatment is not nearly complete in this country. In many places in America and England it is woefully inadequate.  One has the astonishing spectacle of mental hospitals in England and America operating under the most primitive conditions while, at the same time, there is psychiatric treatment developed on a considerable scale in other areas.  As the Minister knows this treatment is not in the least a matter of religious controversy. Already in the City of Dublin there are two psychiatrists who are trained doctors.  They are approved by their particular religious authority.  I happened to run into two cases the other day of comparatively young men who were imprisoned as a result of something that was quite evidently due to mental derangement.  Their families were broken up forever.  Had they been in any one of three countries in Europe, where the religion is the same as it is here, those young men would have been put under psychiatric observation <Col N="252" /> before they were sentenced by a court.  Their cases would have been heard <i>in camera.</i>  I know that it will take time to develop that system and I know properly qualified psychiatrists will have to be found.  I am not criticising the Minister for any tardiness. I merely want to hear his view on the prospective development of that treatment here on the most modern lines and under the approval of whatever religious authority is involved.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to draw the Minister's attention to the necessity for the immediate rearrangement of the dispensary areas.  I have already given an example in Irish.  I shall repeat it in English. I refer to the Coole dispensary area in County Westmeath.  Less than a a quarter of a mile from where I live in Castlepollard a number of new houses have been erected.  They are in the Coole electrol area.  About a dozen families are housed there.  When they require a doctor they have to go four miles down to Coole.  When they require a midwife they have to go 12 miles to Ratoath.  I understand that the Department has for a long time been contemplating the rearrangement of these areas but nothing has been done.  The sooner something is done the better.  I am sure there are other examples like this all over the country. Westmeath County Council contemplate erecting at least 20 more houses alongside the 12 that are already there. The people who are housed in these new houses will suffer the same inconvenience. <Col N="253" /> Although they will be within a stone's throw of where they lived before these houses were erected, they will pass into the Coole dispensary district and they will have to go four miles for a doctor and 12 miles for a nurse.  This arrangement goes back 30 years or more.  It is a very lopsided one.  Probably there are parallels for it all over the country.  In this particular instance a long strip of country was taken on the north side from Finneagh, cut north-west by Castlepollard, down through Coole and along to Athlone on the Longford border-a long L-shaped piece of territory.  The provision of facilities for those needing the services of a dispensary doctor and a midwife was not considered at all.  A dispensary district is created within the county by the cutting away of a portion in County Cavan on one side and in County Longford on the other.</P>
    <P>The next point with which I wish to deal is that of hospitalisation in County Westmeath.  As far as the county council is concerned they are prepared to play their part in the extension of the present county hospital, the building of a new hospital in Athlone and the building of a new fever hospital. Plans for these are in the hands of the Department for a considerable time.  I urge the Minister to go ahead with them because these hospitals are very urgently required.  I have drawn attention to the fact on previous occasions that when the new hospitals were built out of moneys provided by the Hospitals' Trust the Department were too conservative in their plans. We had a terrific fight at the time to get the number of beds we have in Mullingar.  Yet, they are not enough. People from the north of the county have to go to Athlone.  Athlone is not a surgical hospital.  The cost of transport is very severe on the county.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the extension of Coole Orthopædic Hospital. Without any intimate or technical knowledge, I would say that Coole Orthopadic Hospital gives some of the best results in these islands. Everybody in my county and the adjoining county has seen the results. Patients stretched there for years at a time, with broken limbs and readjusted <Col N="254" /> limbs, come forth to earn their livelihood in the factories in Athlone and various other places.  Their restoration to perfect health carries its own tribute to the sisters in charge, to the surgeons who operate there and to the medical and nursing staff.  Of course, the Department deserve their meed of praise wherever they come in, first of all for placing adequate funds at the disposal of the hospital and secondly for taking an interest in it.  How far they come in, I am not in a position to state but it is a work of great national importance.  I believe orthopaedic surgery is being considered on an area basis at present but that does not take from the work that is being done in Coole, where so many youngsters have been treated successfully. I know of cases from the North of Ireland that had been sent down and paid for there although the parents could ill afford to pay for them.  Notwithstanding the fact that similar treatment was available in the North, they preferred the treatment given in Coole.  Full planning and the building of a complete establishment in Coole is therefore very desirable and urgent.</P>
    <P>On the question of dispensaries which has been under consideration for some considerable time, it is very desirable where possible that the county council should own the dispensary building and that it should be brought up to date.  In my own town the dispensary is a rented house.  It has been improved somewhat but there is room for greater improvement, for better waiting facilities and heating facilities.  There are other towns in the area where similar improvements could be brought about.</P>
    <P>On the question of boarded-out children, I do not know what the position exactly is.  The county councils have increased the fees paid to foster parents for boarded-out children but there seems to be a lot of regimentation and a good deal of red tape about this whole question.  I am only repeating what has been said in this House before and what practically everybody knows, in stating that foster parents provide the best means of rearing the boarded out child.  No matter how good an institution may be&mdash;and this system of <Col N="255" /> institutions has been tried out everywhere all over the world&mdash;it has more or less proved a failure.  Unless the children have the care of foster parents, they lack the home touch which is so essential to their successful upbringing. Yet we find that rules are laid down that a child cannot be boarded-out half a mile from a town, such as I live in, with a population of 435 or 436, no matter how clean the house may be or how desirable the parents.  At the same time, one sees advertisements in the newspapers looking for foster parents and offering certain allowances. Then the red tape comes in and says that certain persons cannot take a foster child because they live within half a mile of Castlepollard.  One would think it was Dublin City you were dealing with.  The Minister should look into this whole question, have it examined, and set out a more liberal and human approach to the whole matter.</P>
    <P>I know that the home for unmarried mothers in my area does splendid work. It is a national asset, in contrast to the workhouses we knew long ago, but there are a number of children there and they are a problem for those in charge of the institution.  Those in charge of the institution with whom I am in touch tell me that it would be a great help if the children could be boarded out.  If they are allowed to grow up in the institution you cannot get the same results as if they were placed under the care of foster parents. I bring this matter to the attention of the Minister and suggest to him a better solution might be found for it than has been so far provided.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to ask for every encouragement for the Red Cross all over the country, particularly the junior Red Cross.  It is a new organisation in this country.  It came with the emergency but the training that has been given to its members in various places throughout the country has saved many cases from going to hospital.  Immense work has been done in Kilbeggan by the teacher there with the junior Red Cross, teaching first aid and many things connected with home cleanliness and matters of that kind. If that work were encouraged and extended, the number of hospital beds we <Col N="256" /> require might be considerably less.  As I said before it is a new movement in this country and I appeal to the Minister to give it every support and encouragement, particularly to the junior Red Cross.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasCarter1921" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Kennedy has just referred to the position in regard to unmarried mothers.  There is a place provided in Castlepollard for these people but the ratepaying public object to paying as much as is demanded in Castlepollard.  I have already been speaking to the Minister about the hospital in County Longford which is probably the worst in Europe.  We have good nurses and a good surgeon there but the Minister saw what the building itself was like.  We have an institution there known as the county home which is the old workhouse really.  Many old people go in there and they are well looked after by a splendid staff under extraordinary conditions.  We are not able to do very much with it in the way of reconstructing it or improving it unless we get a grant.  A grant will have to be given if we are to attempt anything of that kind.  We have a number of other projects to attend to.  We have a new hospital to build and, of course, ours is one of the three smallest counties in Ireland but the other counties are much better circumstanced than we are.  I heard Deputy McQuillan speak about Athlone.  Some time ago there was a movement on foot to build a new hospital in Athlone.  It was thought that the military would build a hospital there and that it would take a certain number of the surplus patients, that it was not altogether to be a military hospital. Probably the Minister may be able to tell us something about that.  I had the pleasure of meeting the Minister when he went to Longford.  He said somewhere afterwards in an interview that the conditions there were the worst in Ireland or the worst he ever saw.  I hope that he will give us something to improve these conditions and that he will approach the Minister for Finance in the matter.  I am sure that he will do the best he can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mrs. Rice spoke yesterday evening on the question of our nurses. All our young girls who want to be <Col N="257" /> nurses are going to England to be trained.  Is there no possibility of providing for the training of nurses in two or three hospitals here?  Small farmers and labourers have come to me and asked me to make representations on behalf of their daughters who want to be trained as nurses.  I was told that nothing can be done until 1952 and that even then they will have to pay a fee of 50 guineas.  To my mind, that is a shocking state of affairs.  In England our young girls, when they are being trained as nurses, get £100 a year.  The result is that we shall lose the services of these girls as they will not come back here where the conditions are very different from what they are in England.  I believe the Minister is making an honest endeavour to do the best he can and I believe that everybody will co-operate with him.  I have been for a long time connected with boards of health and other public bodies and during that time I saw some shocking conditions in some of those old hospitals.  I ask the Minister to do the best he can and I believe that he will.  What is wanted is more money for improving these institutions.</P>

      <P>As a member of the newly constituted Dublin Board of Assistance, I want to say to the Minister and to one of his predecessors, Deputy MacEntee, who is here now, that they have every reason to congratulate themselves on the work that is being done by the director and staff in St. Kevin's Hospital.  Those of us who are on the board have spent many Mondays inspecting the various institutions under the control of the board. Everywhere we went we saw nothing but the very best of service and absolute efficiency and cleanliness.  I think I can safely say that St. Kevin's Hospital is now second to none in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the Cancer Consultative Council sent a report to the Minister very recently but that he can barely have had time to do more than glance over the report.  Therefore I shall not waste time discussing any of the questions that may be raised in the report.  I would, however, ask the Minister to go into that report and <Col N="258" /> bring his recommendations before the House as soon as he possibly can.  I have some knowledge of the work of the City of Dublin Skin and Cancer Hospital in Hume Street, as the Dublin Corporation did me the honour of appointing me their representative on the board of that hospital.  I know that they have done very wonderful work in that hospital in recent years considering the great handicaps under which they are labouring.  Pending the report of the Cancer Consultative Council some of their plans for improvements and extensions have been held up.  For that reason I appeal to the Minister to bring in his proposals as soon as he can.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister proposes to spend £10,000 more this year on propaganda than was spent last year. Everyone will agree that, to a very large extent, ill health is caused through a lack of knowledge of preventive measures, if I might put it that way.  I think every penny that will be spent under that heading will be very well spent.  I understand that hygiene is taught in some girls' schools.  I urge very strongly that hygiene should be one of the compulsory subjects in all the schools, both girls' and boys'.  I think the Minister might also consult with the Minister for Education with a view to having first-aid taught in the schools.  The recent heat-wave has called attention to certain dangers arising in connection with our seaside places.  I have been told that allowing the children of Dublin workers to go to Merrion, Bray, Portmarnock and other places and expose themselves to the sun all day without even a hat is very dangerous.  The Minister might consider putting up warning notices in the buses and other places in connection with that matter.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of talk about the conditions of employment of our nurses.  I congratulate the Minister on his approach to the problem of the nurses and on the manner in which he has met their representatives, particularly the representatives of the Irish Nurses' Organisation, during the last 18 months.  He has been very sympathetic to the views they have put forward.  I think the House is to be congratulated on having a Minister for <Col N="259" /> Health who is so approachable and so sympathetic to the views of the nurses' representatives.  Incidentally, a word of congratulation is due to the Irish Nurses' Organisation for the work they have done in the last few years.  They have succeeded in getting the conditions of employment of nurses improved.  I have, however, not hesitated to tell them, and I think the House will agree with me, that so long as they refuse to swallow their pride and register as a trade union they will not get as far as they otherwise would.</P>

      <P>The French have a proverb that the more a thing changes the more it remains the same thing, and that is well exemplified by the first item in sub-head A of the Estimate. The item to which I refer is the provision to be made this year for the salary of the Minister for Health.  In 1948/49 the provision for the item was £2,125.  In this year, 1949/50, it is £2,125 also.  Last year, of course, when the volume of Estimates, with the provision for the Minister's salary in it, appeared, we were told that the Estimate had been prepared by the Fianna Fáil Minister for Health.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well, I will pass from it.  I will pass, however, to consider another matter.  The Minister in the course of his opening speech&mdash; column 1801&mdash;gave a long list of hospitals which it is hoped to see started this year:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The new fever hospital at Dublin; the Limerick regional hospital; Galway regional sanatorium and Galway regional hospital; the proposed major extension at Portiuncula Hospital, Ballinasloe; the new county hospital at Manorhamilton; the children's hospital at Crumlin and the new hospital at Gurranebraher, Cork.  Site works in connection with some of these works <Col N="262" /> have been completed.  Others are in progress and it is hoped to commence the site works of the two remaining regional sanatoria at Dublin and Cork by the end of the year.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Let me deal with the minor aspect of this first.  He says: &ldquo;It is hoped to commence the site works of the two remaining regional sanatoria at Cork and Dublin by the end of the year.&rdquo;  No doubt it is because the Minister hopes to commence the site works at Cork that in yesterday's <i>Cork Examiner</i> an advertisement appeared letting that site for grazing purposes.  Those of us who remember the Minister's earlier ebullitions when he talked about &ldquo;old men&rdquo; and recall his later ebullitions about &ldquo;quislings&rdquo; will remember that when he went to Cork, about this time last year, he unveiled what he suggested was a very stark skeleton in the cupboard of his predecessor.  He said that one of the things that confronted him was the fact that it was proposed to let the site of the Cork Sanatorium for grazing purposes, but that, of course, with him&mdash;like the strong man that he is&mdash;things were going to be different from henceforward, and that work on the hospital would be begun instanter.  It was not very long before the Minister had to eat his words.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.  The Deputy should quote me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is not purporting to quote.  As far as I know, he gave a paraphrase of what the Minister is supposed to have said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite prepared to accept the Minister's disclaimer that he did not say that, but I do say that what he did say carried that implication. However, before that year was out, the Cork lands were let for grazing.  This year, 12 months later, they have been again advertised as being available for letting for grazing purposes. Presumably they will be let on the ordinary 12 months' take, so that, so far as the Cork Sanatorium is concerned, the Minister is either entering into an undertaking in relation to the grazing rights which he does not intend to fulfil or else he has misled the <Col N="263" /> House in saying that work would be begun on the site of the Cork Sanatorium by the end of the year.</P>
      <P>Let me get back to this list of hospitals. Is there a single one of these proposals, a single one of these undertakings, that was initiated by the Minister?  The new fever hospital at Dublin, Limerick Regional Hospital, Galway Regional Sanatorium, Galway Regional Hospital, the new County Hospital at Manorhamilton, the children's hospital at Crumlin and the new hospital at Gurranebraher, in Cork&mdash;is there a single one of these hospitals, for which the Minister has been claiming credit, that was initiated by him as a new project?  There is not a single one of them.  On every one of them years of essential preliminary work, essential work which it takes years to do, has been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">

      <P>Deputy Lehane has interrupted me.  I will deal with Deputy Lehane later when I come to refer to something which was said to-day in reply to a question which was put down by him.  I will say at this stage, however, that whenever Clann na Poblachta or the Government have an undesirable political infant to get rid of, they farm it out to Deputy Lehane.  He becomes their political baby farmer and the thing disappears.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was asking the question if there was a single one of these works that had been initiated by the present Minister or by the administration to which he belongs.  Take the children's hospital at Crumlin.  The decision to proceed with that hospital was taken during the war and a great deal of time and care was given to the preparation of plans for that hospital by the committee of doctors and others which was appointed to plan the undertaking. Those plans were subjected to a great deal of review because it was felt that, having regard to the district which it was to serve, and the need for a great expansion in the hospital facilities for <Col N="264" /> treating children here in Dublin, this hospital should be a model of its kind, and it is going to be a model of its kind.  But if it is, and if it is going to be erected, the credit for it rests with those gentlemen who gave voluntary service for almost eight years in order to ensure that in the working class area of Crumlin there would be a children's hospital the equal of any in the world. You cannot do that without the expenditure of a great deal of time and a great deal of thought.  When I was Minister for Local Government and Public Health and when the Department was divided and the Department of Public Health set up, I know that Deputy Dr. Ryan was, like myself, very concerned at the delay.  However, we had at least this justification: that during the period of the war years it would have been quite impossible to undertake the actual construction of a hospital of that magnitude.  So the intervening time was occupied in securing the site, in developing the site and preparing the plans and specifications. We are told now, 16 months or so after the Minister has been in office with all the preliminary work done for him, with everything cut and dried and ready to his hand, that it is hoped to see it started this year, this children's hospital of which the children of Deputy Lehane's constituency are in such great need.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>After all, so far as Deputy Lehane was concerned, he was only interested during that time in the price of a pint.  Which of these other schemes has been initiated by the present Minister for Health?  Can he point to any new project which could be accurately described as a child of his own brain, his own conception or his own idea?  Perhaps the Minister is modest.  He might not like to answer. There are, however, two.  The first one is that by which he evicted the children of the non-Catholic parents who were being trained as teachers from the school which had been provided for them in the Park and sent them down to a dilapidated and tumble-down hotel miles outside Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one thing he initiated.  He may have been justified. It is true that the question was raised before as to whether it would be well to ask the authorities who then controlled that institution and for whom it had been provided to surrender it to the State in order that it might be converted into a tuberculosis hospital. There was, however, some unwillingness on the part of those responsible for the general educational policy of the country to put a minority in the Twenty-Six Counties under such coercion as would be represented by a <Col N="266" /> request from the responsible Minister of the day to surrender their property, a coercion made all the stronger by basing it upon the humanitarian grounds that the building was required in order to establish a sanatorium.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>This question was mooted and considered.  It was gathered that there might be some reluctance to give up the premises but, if the thing were pressed, it might be conceded.  Then, realising that perhaps it would be unfair to ask the minority to refuse an approach of that sort, it was decided&mdash;and I am glad for the sake of the reputation of this people that we have never tried to coerce a minority&mdash;that, as the school had been built for the express purpose of providing for the training of teachers for the children of the Protestant population of this State, they would be left in the enjoyment of those facilities undisturbed.  I do not think we have anything to be ashamed of in taking that view, because the children of the minority are as dear to those who are true republicans&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is another work in addition to that I have mentioned which has undoubtedly been initiated by the present Minister.  The Minister once used to practise a little amateur journalism. That was in his salad days when he thought £2,125 was much too large a salary for a Minister.</P>

      <P>It does in this way, that the journal did enshrine one dictum of Dr. Noel Browne of Newcastle Sanatorium&mdash;it alleged that the Fianna Fáil Government had a purely materialistic attitude towards a number of questions.  Some years ago the Government of the day, anxious to commemorate the sacrifice of those who had died here in Dublin during the War of Independence, secured from the trustees of the Rotunda Gardens the grant of a very valuable site upon which it was proposed to erect&mdash;and upon which there would be standing to-day if the war had not intervened&mdash; a memorial to commemorate those who died so heroically during that struggle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody, I think, will contest that the site was other than appropriate and fitting.  In the grounds of the Rotunda on the Saturday of Easter Week some of our noblest patriots, Tom Clarke among others, were condemned to spend a night.  The <Col N="268" /> Rotunda itself, apart from the hospital, is associated with two historic events, the foundation of the Irish Volunteers under Grattan and the foundation of the Irish Volunteers of 1914.  The place itself is surrounded by Parnell Square.  It stands upon one of the main thoroughfares and this proposed site confronts Charlemont House, a name which is not unknown in Irish history.  In the whole City of Dublin I doubt if there could be chosen a more appropriate site for a memorial such as that which was contemplated. It is a site in our main thoroughfare where strangers coming to this city would see that we are proud of our dead and that, if we had allowed Nelson's Pillar to remain as a reminder of the days that were gone, as a trophy, if you like, of victory, that it was not because we wished to do Nelson honour, but&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I know the sort of bleating we shall have from Deputy Lehane and some others about the plight of the poor.  Will anyone tell me that in the whole of the north city there was no other site to be had for the establishment of this health clinic except the site that had been given and was intended for the erection of a memorial to the men who died during the Black and Tan war?

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that I was going to deal with Deputy Lehane in due course.  What I had in mind was the fact that Deputy Lehane put down a question to-day which was intended to get the Minister out of his difficulty. <Col N="270" /> The question was raised here on another occasion.  The ventilation of this matter in this House had its public repercussions.  The feelings and conscience of those who had been members of the I.R.A. were shocked.  They could not believe that a Party which had described itself as an extreme Republican Party would permit one of its members to do this thing.  We know that the Minister's action in this regard has been a matter of grave and serious embarrassment to the Deputies of the Clann na Poblachta Party for the City of Dublin.  We know that it has been a cause of disaffection among their rank and file.  Therefore some way of palliating the outrage, some way of appeasing the Old Comrades' Association, the associations of ex-I.R.A. men and members of the Clann na Poblachta organisation had to be found.  So Deputy Lehane put down a question of which he apparently thought Deputy MacEntee had not taken notice.  Deputy Lehane put down a question, and the sole purpose of putting down that question was to try to soothe the disturbed rank and file by pretending that this erection would only be a temporary one.  It would only be a temporary erection!  This site was only to be disfigured by an unsightly temporary building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Was there no other place to erect a temporary building except in the Rotunda Gardens on the site of the proposed memorial to honour those who died during the Black and Tan war?  Could we not have found some other place to erect a temporary building elsewhere than on that particular spot?  When this matter was first raised and ventilated there was no question that the building to be erected would be a temporary one.  There was no question at all.  It was going to stand on that site as a permanent memorial to the present Minister for Health.  It may be, of course, that the Minister has a congenital repugnance to any reminder of the struggle for independence. It may be that he does not like the idea of memorials being erected to those who died fighting the Black and Tans.  He does not, apparently, take the same objection to memorials in relation to the civil war. He is, as a matter of fact, a member of <Col N="271" /> a Government which proposes to give precedence to memorials to those who died during the civil war.  I do not want to impugn their memory in any way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>But the men for whom this memorial was to be erected died before the civil war.  Why is it that, unless it is that this idea of a memorial was so obnoxious to the Minister for Health, nothing would do him but to grab that site and erect thereon a building which, if it would not prevent for ever the erection of the intended memorial, would at least defer it for a considerable number of years &mdash;perhaps until the comrades of the men who died during the Black and Tan war had gone to their graves? There is no justification whatever for what the Minister has done in regard to this matter.  The City of Dublin is not so poor in sites that some other site than this could not have been secured for the health clinic.</P>

      <P>I strongly advocate the provision of such clinics.  If the White Paper dealing with health services, which was circulated during the year 1947, is referred to it will be seen that this was one of the things we had in contemplation.  During the war years we tried to secure the equipment for clinics of this kind.  Fianna Fáil, therefore, does not object to the provision of a health clinic for children. On the contrary, it strongly supports it.  But we do certainly object to the erection of that clinic being used to prevent and defer the erection, as I have said, of a memorial to those who died fighting the Black and Tans.</P>

      <P>During the last year, the then Leader of the Minister's Party said that we were providing money for hotels and not for hospitals. The Minister according to his own admission has at present cut down on <Col N="272" /> hospitals.  The justification, of course, is that he has not the money.  Can one imagine what the Minister would write in <i>The Clann</i>, if by a miracle it were still in existence, if Fianna Fáil pleaded that it could not proceed with the hospitalisation of the country because it had not got the money?  I suppose we would be told that we had watched &ldquo;with bucolic indifference the slow rot and death of approximately so and so.&rdquo;  We would be told that we had said that luxury hotels were not suitable for the treatment of tuberculosis. We would be told that nearly three years ago a White Paper was published full of grandiose promises, etc.  We would be told all that.  An additional 18 months have passed since that article was written but nobody will see, I think, in this country improved dispensaries, thousands of beds, chest hospitals and allowances for dependents, except such allowances for dependents as were provided before the Minister took office under the Public Health Act of 1947, which was so bitterly opposed by the chief Party in the present Coalition.</P>
      <P>The Minister says he has not the money.  Well there was quite a substantial sum of money in the Hospitals' Trust Fund when I was in control of it. There was quite a substantial sum of money in the Hospitals' Trust Fund when Deputy Dr. Ryan was in control of it.  The yield from the sweepstakes has considerably increased since and there should be a great deal more money in the Hospitals' Trust Fund now than there was when Fianna Fáil left office.  We had proposals to spend that money and those proposals were cut in half by the Minister in his first pronouncement.  Now, I believe they have been further slashed and we are still without the thousands of beds for tubercular patients, still without the chest hospitals, without the children's hospital at Crumlin, without the Limerick Regional Hospital, the Galway Regional Hospital, the hospital at Ballinasloe and the new County Hospital at Manorhamilton.  This Minister of &ldquo;push and go&rdquo; may certainly have a great deal of push about him, and, when the country gets the chance, perhaps there will be a great deal of &ldquo;go&rdquo; about him too.</P>

      <P>There we are, plenty of money and no hospitals.  If, let me repeat again, the Minister for Health controls all the money in the Hospitals' Trust Fund, it might not be any harm at this stage for Deputies to ask themselves how does this Minister control and use the money in the Hospitals' Trust Fund, which he will not spend except in a very limited and restricted way, to provide the hospitals which he held were in such urgent need 18 months ago.</P>
      <P>Last night in this House a case was mentioned which, I think, throws a searchlight on the Minister's control of this Hospitals' Trust Fund.  It is a case, I think, which warrants more attention than has, as yet, been devoted to it, in fact it warrants the fullest possible inquiry and I will tell the House why.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present Minister for Health was formerly attached to the Newcastle Sanatorium.  All of us who are familiar with the conditions there, who had, by reason of our position, an opportunity of becoming familiar with these conditions, know very well that the accommodation for the staff and patients in Newcastle Sanatorium leaves much to be desired.  A great deal of attention had been devoted to the problem of supplementing the existing hospital buildings.  There <Col N="274" /> was a site adjacent to the hospital ground which it was thought would be very suitable indeed for a nurses' home.  Some people thought that the price which was being asked for it was excessive and the site, I understand now, has not been acquired.  A considerable distance from the hospital, however, there was a farm with a dwelling-house on it.  I understand that negotiations for the sale of this farm to a private individual had been virtually completed.  That particular sale, however, to a private individual was never completed.  On the contrary, that sale was broken and this dwelling-house with land attached was bought by the Newcastle Sanatorium at an enhanced price, at something more than the vendor had been willing to sell it to a private individual for, and three-fourths of this money, which cannot be spent on hospitals by the Minister, was provided out of moneys under his control.</P>
    <P>Who owned the farm?  During the last election a certain Clann na Poblachta candidate sprang into fame as the Russian jeweller.  He is a gentleman who, according to his speeches on public platforms, set up very high standards of public conduct.  As often happens, as a candidate he was very censorious about the public conduct of other people.  He made allegations affecting the honour and probity of Ministers in former Administrations. He alleged, for instance, that the former Minister for Industry and Commerce had gone down to open a factory in Cork and had been presented with a carpet.  Perhaps the carpet or rug was something that had been made there. Everybody will know that when a Minister or any public man or any private individual opens a public institution he is generally given&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I think the hospital cannot do less than that.  But, when we <Col N="276" /> come to consider the distance of this building from the hospital and the cost of the transport which is to be provided for the nurses, what justification was there for preferring this building one and a half miles from the hospital to a site adjacent to the hospital upon which it would have been as easily possible to erect a temporary building to provide temporary accommodation for the nurses as the Minister thinks it is possible to erect a temporary building on the site that was dedicated to those who died during the Black and Tan war?  It seems to me that, if you can erect a temporary clinic in the Rotunda Gardens, you can also erect temporary accommodation for the nurses on the site adjacent to the hospital.

      <P>He suggested that because the Department of Health had acquired for hospital purposes a school used by one denomination in this State for the training of teachers that was tantamount to coercion by the Department of Health and by the Minister of a non-Catholic minority in this country.  Deputy MacEntee knows as well as I do and as well as every Deputy in this House knows that that is nothing but poppycock, that it is something which has no basis or foundation in fact.  Nobody knows that better than Deputy MacEntee but he made that statement mischievously and <Col N="278" /> irresponsibly knowing at the same time that he was, as he has often done in the past, handing a weapon to the Warnocks and Basil Brookes, handing a weapon which could be used by every partitionist in order to bolster up their case for the division of this country.</P>

      <P>That is the statement made by Deputy MacEntee when he attempted to criticise the acquisition by the Department of Health of the former Coláiste Móibhí.  I do not propose to deal in detail with all the envenomed bitterness that Deputy MacEntee succeeded in emitting in approximately the one hour and ten minutes that he spoke.  Deputy MacEntee referred to the fact that the Department of Health has taken over for a temporary period the site for the proposed memorial to those in the Dublin area who gave their lives for the cause of an Irish Republic.  If Deputy MacEntee had been in this House attending to his business to-day at 3 o'clock he would have known that the Minister made it perfectly plain that that project was not abandoned, that that project was not put on any long finger&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We had a band able to play a tune effectively to send you marching home.  I think it is a pity that in the debate on the Department of Health it should be necessary for any of us to speak with heat or with bitterness.  Probably, of all the Estimates that come before this House it is the one which we should be able to approach in a calmer, saner manner and if I allowed myself to be led away by the attitude adopted by Deputy MacEntee, I do not want to pursue that line any further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to say to the Minister that I do not feel myself precluded from congratulating him on the work that he has done since he went into office by the fact that he is a member of the Clann na Poblachta Party.  I do not see why the fact that he is a member of that Party should preclude me from offering him those congratulations. I think the work done, particularly in the domain of thoracic surgery, since the Minister took over the portfolio <Col N="280" /> of the Department of Health will remain as a lasting memorial to the Minister.  Throughout the country there are thousands of people, sufferers from the dread scourge of tuberculosis, who bless quite sincerely the name of Dr. Noel Browne and people will not be influenced by the envenomed bitterness and the poisonous outpourings of Deputy MacEntee.</P>
    <P>I would like to remind the Minister of the work being done in Dundrum Mental Hospital and to commend that institution to the Minister for his sympathetic consideration in future.  I think there is a good deal of leeway to be made up there.  I am satisfied that a genuine effort is being made to make up that leeway but I will commend that institution to the Minister's sympathetic consideration.</P>
    <P>I think it does come, to an extent, within the scope of the Minister, as Minister for Health, to consider the question of athletics, and I would ask him at least to consult with the leaders of various athletic bodies in the country, with a view to setting up some sort of co-ordinating council with which his Department could deal.  I suggest that the Minister would serve a very useful purpose were he to call into consultation, say, representatives of the N.A.C.A. and the G.A.A. and to discuss with these bodies the setting up of some form of athletic council.</P>
    <P>Much has been said during the course of the debate about the wonderful plans that were awaiting the Minister when he took office.  The only comment I would like to make on that, in conclusion, is that there were a lot of paper plans when Dr. Noel Browne went into the Department of Health, but where there were paper plans 18 months ago there are now in many instances solid bricks and mortar.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. B. Maguire Mr. B. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of this debate we have listened to a discussion on hospitalisation, the treatment of disease and so on.  We have had such discussions over a number of years, but the outstanding fact is that with all the plans, energy and preparation drawn from the imagination of well-intentioned people, such as Ministers, officials, architects, county <Col N="281" /> councils and others, the patients who require treatment and are recommended for it, cannot get it.  We have not the necessary hospitals to receive and give them treatment.  No one doubts for a moment that the present Minister for Health is in any way insincere in his efforts.  In fairness, I must say that if there is one Minister in this Parliament whose name to-day would receive a general verdict of approval from the community, higher even than that of any of his predecessors, it is the present Minister.  No one doubts his sincerity.  Many even of his political opponents appreciate his generous efforts.  Despite all these wonderful efforts, I still feel paralysed for an explanation as to why we are still without the facilities that our patients require.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacEntee says there is ample money in the Hospitals' Trust Fund.  If so, why is there this continued shortage to meet the needful demands of the sick?  I am waiting to hear if the Minister has found an explanation for that.  Is the failure to provide the necessary facilities for the treatment of disease due to the emergency or the shortage of supplies of material and of labour?  If the money is there, then I think there should be a vast speeding up so as to justify all the nice and kindly things said about the treatment of disease and the provision of hospitals not only in this House but outside of it.  Why are the facilities not being provided?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have many counties calling for hospitals.  No doubt, some splendid ones have been built.  In many counties, some of which adjoin my own County of Leitrim, we still have instituations that are very primitive indeed, and that, in our present state of civilisation, could not be considered at all suitable for the accommodation or treatment of patients.  Indeed, some of them would not be held to be suitable even as garages or as stables for horses.  When we are faced with that situation, must we not say that there is a lot of emptiness in the fine phrases that we have heard expressed here by Ministers and others and by people interested in social welfare? One must sometimes feel that there is <Col N="282" /> a lot of emptiness in these fine phrases and sentiments.</P>
    <P>Is there money available to build hospitals and provide for the necessary needs of our suffering patients?  I very often get letters from people about patients suffering from tuberculosis. They have been recommended for treatment by their doctor and yet we find that there is no place to receive them. In other cases you hear of large families living in very small homes, some of the members of which may be suffering from tuberculosis.  Yet nothing can be done to remove those patients and so prevent them from spreading the disease.  One would think, from all the propaganda we have to listen to, that the things that are happening daily in this age could only have occurred 50 years ago.  Yet, they are happening day after day and there appears to be no prospect of an immediate remedy for them.</P>
    <P>Instead of listening to a debate in which emphasis would be laid on doing something immediately to remedy the present state of things, we have listened to one which was two-thirds political.  We have one Party flying at the other, with no desire or plan to go ahead with developments so far as the essential things are concerned.  We have one Party saying that the other was, politically, misguiding or misleading the people, that it was almost misappropriating public funds to its own advantage rather than endeavouring to help the sick poor.  If there is one thing that will condemn democracy and that will lead to chaos in this country it is this political bitterness, this bigotry in political Parties as against every other national interest.  That is what will destroy the State and destroy democracy.  I would like to see something done quickly to provide all the facilities that are required for the sick and for the poor.  I am sure that I do not feel any more strongly on that than any other member of the House.</P>
    <P>If something is not done quickly to build hospitals in every county and to deal with disease, then many of the patients who are awaiting treatment will have passed away before some of the big plans contemplated are put into operation.  Could not something practical <Col N="283" /> be done immediately?  In the case of tuberculosis could not chalets be provided for the accommodation of patients and for their treatment pending the provision of some of the big hospitals which are contemplated? Advice and treatment might also be provided for patients by local nurses. As I say if something is not done immediately great numbers of people who are in need of treatment to-day will have passed away before some of the great plans that are contemplated are put into operation.  Let us stop all this hypocrisy and start and do something.  Talking politics is not going to be any remedy.  There is a moral obligation on us to deal with these matters in an urgent way.  We are dealing here with life and death, and I say that it is immoral for us to be talking politics and obstructing the provision of immediate facilities for the treatment of patients who are in urgent need of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt that Deputy Maguire is sincere in his expression of condemnation of the sort of political antagonism that goes on in this House, but what he fails to comprehend is where that emanated from. If he gives a little study to the type of slanderous propaganda which brought about the change in Government, he will see there the reason for the type of discussion which takes place in this House.  Naturally, members of this Party must refute the kind of suggestions that are not only being made here, but that were made during the election which brought about the change of Government.  I suggest that is the only reason why there is anything that could be described as being in the nature of political suggestions in the discussion on this Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thoroughly agree that this Estimate should be discussed, as far as it is humanly possible to discuss anything here, in a non-political atmosphere.  For that reason I shall try to confine the remarks which I have to make to the Estimate proper.  In his opening statement the Minister gave us some statistics which went to prove that the health situation in this country is improving. <Col N="284" /> I feel sure that the Minister will not suggest that that improvement was brought about in the short period in which he has been in office.  That improvement could only have been brought about as a result of careful attention to details in regard to the Department of Health on the part of his predecessors.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied that the figures have reached the stage at which we would like to see them.  I am sure the Minister would like to see them considerably reduced.  As we all know, the figures are still a long way above those of other countries in Europe and until we can bring them to the same level we will not have achieved anything in the nature of success.</P>
    <P>I know we cannot discuss housing on this Estimate.  We have discussed it pretty fully on the Estimate for the Department of Local Government.  In the course of that discussion I mentioned the dire necessity for houses and the only reason I am mentioning it now is to suggest to the Minister that he will use&mdash;and I know he will&mdash;his influence with the Government to see that our housing conditions will be improved as far as it is humanly possible to have them improved, because prevention as we all know is very much better than curing.</P>
    <P>As a layman I cannot suggest the reason for the expansion of tuberculosis in this country as compared with other countries.  It can in some circumstances be ascribed to housing conditions and in other circumstances it can be ascribed to malnutrition.  The extraordinary thing is that it is not confined to the families of poor people; it apparently reaches out to all sorts of families, even families in very good circumstances, and it is therefore questionable if we can say exactly how it originates.  The only thing is that when it is there we must deal with it to the best of our ability.</P>
    <P>I have had complaints from people, mainly women, who have had to attend the dispensary in Charles Street.  The complaints consist in the main of the conditions which exist here.  I have been told that the accommodation is very limited, especially in view of the large numbers of people who are compelled <Col N="285" /> to attend.  I understand there is a kind of communal room in which they have to divest themselves of their clothing and, having done so, they are then liable to catch the draughts which run through the room as a result of the doors opening and closing.  Quite a large number of people are compelled to divest themselves of clothing at the same time, which means that a considerable period elapses while they are in that state.  I should like the Minister to have this matter investigated. It is quite possible that it is all due to the limitations of the building.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lehane referred to athletics. I saw recently where the Minister eulogised, at some function or other, the value of athletics from the point of view of health.  I would like him to interest himself in order to see that the grant made by the last Government&mdash; I think it was a grant of something like £25,000&mdash;for the provision of cinder tracks where young men could go out in the evenings and train, will be renewed.  We all know the building up of human bodies is one of the best possible preventives of disease.  Therefore, it is desirable that some provision should be made available for the benefit of the youth of the country.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of athletics to which I would like to refer and that is the desirability of greater facilities in this city for swimming.  So far as I am aware there is only the one swimming bath in the city which is available to the general public. Recently I read a blue book issued by the British Parliament on the subject of swimming facilities.</P>
    <P>I must confess I was appalled when I read the analysis of samples of water taken from these baths at the end of the day.  I cannot say at the moment whether the particular baths were equipped with a proper filtration plant. I know that the baths in the city here are not equipped with any filtration plant.  Because of that, people are swimming from early morning till late at night in water which is not changed throughout the entire day.  I understand these baths are treated with chlorine.  Nevertheless, I am conscious of the fact that at the end of the day the water must be impregnated with <Col N="286" /> exudations from the human body.  I do not believe that can add anything to the health of our people who utilise these baths.  Possibly a proper filtration plant could be installed.  I think it is most desirable that the Minister should interest himself in this particular matter.  Vast quantities of bacteria must be present in this contaminated water.  We all know that water is one of the sources by which typhoid is transmitted.  The number of deaths from typhoid at the present time are not very great.  Possibly they could be reduced still further and I think the Minister should interest himself in this particular aspect of public health.</P>
    <P>I was rather pleased recently to find the Minister for Local Government referring to the necessity for interesting young girls in housekeeping and cooking. A properly cooked meal is one of the most desirable attributes of married life.  I think a great deal of the malnutrition which exists is not due so much to lack of food as to the manner in which the food is prepared and cooked.  This food is a costly item for the poorer families and it is most essential that young girls should be trained in the proper preparation and cooking of food.  I would like the Minister to do something in relation to these particular matters.  So far as health generally is concerned, we shall play our part as far as possible in giving any help we can to improve the health of our people.</P>

Níl aon airgead a tugadh ó shoin sa nGaeltacht, le mo linn-sa ar chuma ar bith, a raibh toradh chomh maith air is bhí ar an airgead sin ná a chruthaigh chomh maith is ab fhiú é a chaitheamh mar go bhfuil cruthaithe gur theastaigh sé go géar, agus i dteannta sin faghann an t-othar agus an t-easlán togha na haire ann agus is iomú duine a bhí tréith-lag ag dul ann dó a tháinig as amach ina dhuine láidir folláin.

Le haghaidh na mbocht atá siad ann agus tá cruthaithe acu a fheabhas a dhéanann siad a gcuid oibre mar tá gnaoi na ndaoine orthu. Má thograíonn duine aon phighinn a thabhairt dóibh ar son a gcumainn&mdash;ní ar a son féin&mdash;glactar leis, ach ní bítear dá iarraidh.  Tugtar beagán dóibh ach is maith a bhíos an mórán tuillte acu.  Déantar bailiú dhóibh ó am go ham agus tugann daoine ón Ard-Easboc anuas síntiús dóibh.

      <P>Much that could be said in this debate would take a very great amount of time.  A good deal has been said already and I do not propose to deal with the subject generally but I should like to deal with a few points that have been mentioned already.  The first matter is the question of athletics which has been mentioned by Deputy Traynor.  From the health point of view, we may regard athletics as physical training, and proper organisation and a proper attitude in regard to this activity for the young, serves a twofold function. It makes for healthy bodies and for morale as well.  It makes for national morale and hence the Minister for Health should pay considerable attention to those organised societies amongst us, such as the G.A.A. and others, who cater for athletics and who organise them.  Particularly he should give attention to the well-being of those who take part in these games. I would say further that the Minister, in whatever relations he has with schools, the Department of Education and other places where young people are engaged in activities of this nature, should pay particular attention to the proper development of athletics, not only from the point of view of sound physical health but also from the point of view of developing a sound morale. It would be very easy to expand on that but I think I have said sufficient to indicate the point I wish to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It does strike one that, in regard to athletics, there are certain matters in which the Minister could actively intervene, or if not intervene, at least take an interest.  The provision of swimming baths and facilities in the way of proper accommodation for games, has already been mentioned and the Minister, having some responsibility for the health of the people, should be interested in athletic activities as a means of developing the physique of <Col N="290" /> our young people and of helping to safeguard their health.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the athletic problem.  I have already mentioned the moral aspect but there is also what one might call the mental or moral health of the nation.  The question of national morale is, to some extent, bound up with the health of the people.  We have seen how, before the last war, the morale of many countries in Europe was built up on athletics. Coupled with that, the physical standard of the youth of these countries was developed through concentration on athletics.  Perhaps some regard to the results that arose from these activities in the past would be helpful to the Minister and I merely suggest to him that he could perhaps usefully study that aspect of the problem.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which is not strictly relevant to the Minister's particular function but it deals again with national morale and consequently is, to that extent, relevant.  The development of an athletic tradition, which could secure international recognition, as I have said will not only contribute to our morale at home but it will contribute to the prestige of the nation and to the strength of the nation in the eyes of outsiders.  Only recently in international boxing Maxie McCullagh brought fame and credit to his country. It should be possible, with the potentialities of a people, largely agricultural, such as ours is, to produce more champions in many spheres of sport. Mind you, they would probably be amongst our best ambassadors to other nations.  As I have said this is, perhaps, under the strict rules of debate foreign to the Minister's Department but I think it is an aspect of the problem that should not be forgotten. It is a further inducement for the Minister and the Government to consider seriously the national value of athletics and athletic activities from the point of view of the physical and moral health of the citizen, from the point of view of national morale and the prestige of the nation abroad.</P>
    <P>Another matter which has been touched upon in this debate is the question of nurses.  In tackling the <Col N="291" /> Minister's problem, his troops so to speak are the personnel who have to deal with the matters of health.  That is particularly true of such a problem as tuberculosis or other diseases but it is also true in regard to the routine maintenance and checking of health.  I do not think the question of doctors needs any particular mention at the moment but the question of nurses does.</P>
    <P>Heretofore, the position of the nursing profession in this country has not been altogether satisfactory.  The Minister will know more about this as a professional man, but many of us who, as patients or otherwise, have seen it from another angle, cannot help feeling that the casualty rate amongst that particular section of the health groups of the country was often high, that the conditions under which these girls had to labour were often difficult, and the safeguards for their own health and efficiency that one would wish were often not there.  In the case of most hospitals, everything that could be possibly done was done, but the problem was one of such proportions that it seemed to require the active intervention of the Minister.</P>
    <P>Without going into the details of that problem, this thought strikes me. If we are to tackle health, we have to tackle it with these particular troops, so to speak.  The first requisite for efficiency in dealing with the problem, after you have laid out your administration, etc., is to provide for efficiency amongst these troops.  In order to get efficiency, the best possible conditions for nurses appear to be one of the first requisites.  A Bill has been introduced in the other House on which this matter will probably be more properly discussed, but I think it is no harm that it should be mentioned on the Estimate.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like also, like Deputy MacEntee and others, to refer to the proposed clinic in Parnell Square. I wonder is the Minister wise in selecting just that location?  In confining myself more or less to the narrow issue on this, I do not want to be taken as ignoring the other issue that other Deputies on this side of the <Col N="292" /> House have pleaded and to whose views I very largely subscribe.  But, by way of supplement to that, I should like to raise the practical question.  What is the case for putting up a temporary building on the upper third of Parnell Square?  Perhaps the Minister will correct me if I am proceeding on a wrong hypothesis.  I am assuming the proposition is to place a temporary building as a health clinic on the upper third of Parnell Square.  I understand it is to be largely a tuberculosis centre. I speak as a layman, but a layman who knows the area fairly well.  It is immediately adjacent to the Rotunda Maternity Hospital.  I understand that they have their clinics also and attending the maternity clinics will be expectant mothers, possibly nursing mothers who are in the post-birth period.  For all I know they may have contacts actually with the hospital cases inside.  It will be right up against the nurses' home for that hospital. As an ignorant layman in this matter, so to speak, I naturally ask the question: is it good business or good health organisation, even if it is only the contact of two queues for two different clinics there, to risk the contact of open tubercular cases going to one clinic with expectant mothers going to another clinic?</P>
    <P>The Minister, with his professional knowledge, may make very small meat indeed of my question.  I am not even advancing it as an argument.  Quite apart from technical reasons or questions relating to the area to which the particular disease germ can be diffused or anything else, you have the physical fact that, by having a tuberculosis clinic on that square, the patients, and I presume these may include open cases, will actually be in a greater density of traffic in that vicinity. There is possible contact with the people going to the other clinic.  Is that wise?  I want to refrain from anything like exaggeration or anything that might tend that way.  If my remarks display ignorance.  I would only be too glad to be corrected.  But this clinic will be right up against the back of the nurses' home.  Does that improve the health environment for a group of people who, by reason of their work and by reason of their avocation, <Col N="293" /> need special safeguards and special help in regard to their own health?</P>
    <P>Apart from that, I have doubts if that particular area is the best centre. I am not aware as to exactly how much of the city this is meant to cater for. But it seems to me that, if it is meant to be one centre for the whole northern section of the city, it is hardly the best type of organisation.  The north side is big and scattered.  No matter where you place the clinic, if it is meant to be one clinic for the whole lot, the travel difficulty for patients attending that clinic will be a serious problem. On the other hand, if it is proposed to have a number of them, then that particular location is not well situated. Would it not be better to put one on the bombed site at the North Strand and another towards the west?  There are undoubtedly other sites.  Even if the Minister wanted temporary sites, I could think of a number of them. For instance, if it was a temporary site was wanted, why not take an area on the virtually waste land up near the Broadstone which is the property of the King's Inns?  Incidentally, I would not otherwise recommend it as it is used as a playground by a lot of children, but at least it would not be open to the objections to which the Parnell Square site is open.  For all these reasons, I think that the actual site for this clinic should be reconsidered, quite apart from the reason which has been pleaded by Deputy MacEntee in particular.  I do not think that there is much sense in my repeating what has been said by other Deputies but, to summarise, I should like to commend particularly to the Minister for his sympathetic attention the question of athletics generally, the question of nurses, and the question of reconsidering this site in Parnell Square.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidJohnMadden" hpid="Mr. Madden Mr. Madden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Madden</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very much impressed by the contribution of Deputy B. Maguire and I wish to join with him in making a very honest and sincere appeal that in matters of public health speeches should be tempered with a little more Christian kindness and charity and less politics.  Yesterday I was listening for a considerable time to many bouquets being passed <Col N="294" /> by Fianna Fáil speakers to the present Minister for the amount of effort, industry and initiative that he has thrown into his Department and the whole technique of its administration. Other speeches made to-day which were completely at variance with those speeches and tempered with bitterness and heat were to me inexplicable.  I rose to refer to one matter.  Most other aspects of the case have been fully discussed.  We appreciate the great effort made by the Minister in attacking the various forms of malignant and pernicious disease, such as cancer.  There is another form of cancer that he must not neglect as a Minister new to the Government.  We know the malignant form of cancer that attacks the human being.  Science is doing everything conceivably possible to minimise and to retard the growth of that disease and the destruction that is caused by it.  County Limerick appreciated the importance of dealing with cancer 14 or 15 years ago.  As a member of the board of health I am in daily or weekly contact with the various institutions and hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As members of visiting committees, we had to witness the terrible suffering and agony and economic as well as physical ruin that was being wrought by that terrible disease. Appreciating our responsibility from an administrative as well as a humanitarian point of view, we decided that there was no use in rubbing 2d. worth of sulphur ointment to a cancerous growth.  We appreciated that it might be a palliative but that it would never remove it.  We appreciated that the only remedy was surgical treatment of the best and most modern kind. We appreciated also the economic and other difficulties entailed in bringing patients a journey of 150 or 140 miles. Viewing these facts, and recognising our responsibility, we decided to do everything possible during our term of administration to help suffering humanity.  We decided that we should get a hospital built on modern lines, without regard to cost.  We formed a joint committee with the Limerick Corporation and proceeded with our plans. That was about 13 years ago.  It took a certain amount of courage but we faced up to it and we were encouraged <Col N="295" /> by the then Government.  Having prepared our plans, acquired the land, met all the legal and incidental costs, a scheme for a regional hospital on modern, scientific lines, which would cost approximately £500,000 was set out.  Having done everything that administratively could be done and exercising all the statutory powers, we finally got the <i>imprimatur</i> of the Government.</P>
    <P>It has been nauseating to be dealing with the Department for the last five years.  Everything that we could do has been done.  I said at the outset that there was another form of cancer that must be attacked by the Minister. It relates to his own particular Department. It is the cancer of red tape that is retarding public effort and increasing the suffering of the poor and the sick. I said quite recently to one of our architects: &ldquo;Will you kick the damn papers away?&rdquo;  A proposed alteration to a door was submitted to the Department and we had to wait two months for an answer.  After eight months the door will be altered.  The colours of the screws did not harmonise with what it was intended the door should be when complete.  All these details are sickening and irritating.  This red tape is a cancer that is retarding public effort.  Last May four years we thought the structure, the foundation of which were laid 12 years ago, would be finished.  It took months and years of careful study and patience on the part of the old board of health.  Now, four years later, we find the same sickening red tape or green tape, a new kind of social cancer, retarding the best efforts of a public body.</P>
    <P>I wish to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that we are facing another winter and possibly another year may elapse and they may decide to change a window, which would take six to eight months more.  Red tape is helping the growth of cancer.  I would appeal to the Minister to show in this case the industry, initiative and determination of which, in 15 months or less, he has given unquestionable evidence.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear many of the Opposition Party paying a just and proper compliment to the Minister. <Col N="296" /> They should bear in mind that during that 15 or 16 months he was prostrate in a hospital for six or eight weeks and was convalescent for another five weeks and that that undoubtedly weakened his effort and his attention to business, and that but for that there would be much less to tell him to-day. I again join with that fair-minded Deputy, Deputy B. Maguire, in saying that we ought to deal with this important matter with more Christian charity.  It is sickening to hear epithets being hurled across the floor of the House, the result of 25 years of bitterness.  We should all join in a common cause, in the knowledge that there are in the world so many conflicting ideologies, to help to build up schemes for the relief of suffering humanity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. Browne) Noel C. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. Browne)</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate, which has benefited from the contributions of over 30 Deputies and has taken the major part of three days' time of the House, has been a particularly stimulating and encouraging experience for me as Minister in charge of the Department of Health because the very fact that it has taken this time shows that at least one of my efforts, that is, my effort to increase the health consciousness of our people, has permeated into the minds of our elected representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of that reason I have been particularly glad and encouraged.  I have too much appreciation of the very, on the whole, generous and objective spirit shown by all Deputies in the House, including the members of the Opposition, in the discussion of this Estimate and of the consideration which I have received from the Deputies of all Parties over the period of months that I have been in office, to follow the two ex-Ministers primarily responsible for the difficulties in which we find ourselves&mdash;Deputy MacEntee and Deputy Dr. Ryan.  I have no intention of trying to play foil to the fish-wife tactics adopted by both of them and what I consider their lamentable displays in this House.  I, as a new Deputy, and I suppose most of us, have the deepest respect for this House.  We feel that our behaviour should go out <Col N="297" /> as an example to the young men of my generation and to the older generation; that our behaviour should be an example in the national life of the country.  I think that these displays, on both sides, can be said to be confined to very few Deputies.  It is unfortunate that our enemies in other countries and in our own seize upon those exhibitions to denigrate the feelings of national dignity of our people, of our behaviour in attempting to legislate for ourselves.</P>
    <P>Personally, I have no objection to politics entering into the discussion on the Vote for the Department of Health.  This is a legislative Assembly in which there are political Parties of different colours.  Different views are held.  It is quite obvious that some of us have and must have different views as to how to run the Department of Education, the Department of Local Government, my Department or, in fact, any Department.  These views are crystallised in the minds of our people under what is known as the politics of the different Parties in the country.  If there is a social or an economic policy or a hospital or health policy, I do not see why it should be completely dissociated from politics. Politics is simply a form of belief.  If your Party thinks that a thing can be done in a particular way, and rather better than the way in which the other Party did it, I am quite prepared to continue with my views as to the behaviour of the former Government, and they are at perfect liberty to make any comments, within reason, that they wish on my behaviour in carrying out the work of my Department.  Of course, it is only the foul, vituperative tongues of the disappointed Deputy MacEntee and the former Minister, Deputy Dr. Ryan, which do detract from the ordinary give and take of political life but from which I have no fears whatever.</P>
    <P>Now, throughout the whole debate there was plenty of criticism, constructive, destructive and every kind of criticism, and it was perfectly welcome. There were suggestions, some rather helpful than otherwise. Throughout the whole debate there was only one incident which, in any way, <Col N="298" /> impinged at all upon my feelings, and of course on my standard of integrity and honesty.  I feel that the House should become aware of all the facts of the particular incident to which I refer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>That is, of course, the nurses' home at Newcastle Sanatorium, County Wicklow.  I will not dwell on the grave seriousness and the implied charges made in the very meandering, tedious and tiresome speech of Deputy Dr. Ryan.  They are quite obvious to all here.  I will simply try and put before Deputies the facts as they are and permit them to use their good sense in judging for themselves. I ask Deputies to throw their minds back to February of last year when the change of Government took place.  They may remember that one of the points in the ten-point programme was the provision of hospital accommodation for tubercular patients. That, quite obviously, in the inter-Party Government became my primary responsibility.  The number of beds required was in the region of 1,000 for young men and women who were waiting institutional treatment.  I suppose few people could be more aware of that than I was&mdash;due to my particular profession, the particular job which I held in that profession and my very close association with the sick people in the community.  I felt particularly strongly about the whole question.</P>
      <P>So far as I was concerned, nothing in the world could obstruct me, or stand in my way, in seeing that every man and woman whose health might be saved or whose life might be prolonged should find the necessary treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I circulated to the local authorities a memorandum which pointed out to them the seriousness of the position in regard to tuberculosis and the waiting lists and I asked them to submit to me any proposals which they thought might prove helpful to us in the Department in solving this very serious bed shortage.  I made my views known in public on every possible occasion. <Col N="299" /> Approximately 20 proposals were submitted to us from various parts of the country, and many others by different Deputies in the House who were anxious to assist.</P>
    <P>Of the proposals submitted to me two came from the sanatorium committee at Newcastle.  One was for the acquisition of a house called Trudder Grange and the other for a house known as Mount John, owned by Senator McCartan.  I might say that, from my short experience in South East Dublin during the general election and subsequent to that, I was well aware that in considering the latter proposal considerable play would be made of the fact that Senator McCartan was a member of the political organisation to which I belonged.  Quite obviously, the facile ability shown by Deputy MacEntee on so many occasions to misrepresent, distort, vilify or twist any action, however good its intentions, would be directed towards me and towards the distortion of my action in this case.</P>
    <P>Both of these houses were examined at the request of the committee. Trudder Grange proved to be quite useless for the purpose for which it was suggested&mdash;that is, a nurses' home &mdash;following the advice of architects and engineers.  Mount John, however, it was agreed, could be readily converted into a temporary nurses' home to provide accommodation which would release approximately 26 beds in the hospital.</P>
    <P>Now, the price to be paid&mdash;and these figures are important-was decided in this way.  As is normally done by Government Departments, the Valuation Office was asked to value the property, which, by the by, consists of a house capable of holding 26 nurses&mdash; hardly a farm house, as Deputy MacEntee suggested&mdash;and there are also 80 acres of land attached, 60 of which are arable and 20 non-arable. The Valuation Office estimated the market value at £7,500&mdash;£4,000 for the land and £3,500 for the house.  We communicated this fact to the hospital authorities and said that we, of course, could not sanction the payment of any more money for this property <Col N="300" /> out of the Hospitals' Trust Fund than the valuation put upon it by the Valuation Office.  The hospital authorities nevertheless proceeded to buy this house and, I understand, paid approximately £10,000 for it.  But the money spent from the Hospitals' Trust Fund was £7,500.</P>
    <P>I made a stipulation that the land should be let for grazing and it, of course, brings in an annual income. The house, costing £3,500, was to be converted into a nurses' home. Incidentally, there was a separate offer of £10,000 by an independent buyer&mdash;a firm offer in writing of £10,000 by an independent buyer.  The way I looked at it was that the land was worth so much and presumbly will not lose much in value.  The house, worth £3,500, provided accommodation for approximately 26 nurses and released that number of beds, occupied by nurses, in the actual hospital itself for the use of patients.  Having the temporary use of this house for a period of approximately three years, required to build the nurses' home proposed by my predecessor, Deputy Dr. Ryan, but never built, will mean that I am able now to provide bed accommodation for 26 patients at approximately £1 per week over the period and the asset will still remain at the end of the period.  That seemed to me to be not only the Christian and humane thing to do, but it also appeared to me to be good business.</P>
    <P>We examined the possibility of providing alternative units on the site of the hospital for nurses.  We went so far as to draw up outline sketch plans. The cost of providing that accommodation on the existing site for 24 nurses &mdash;that is, roughly, the number who now occupy the nurses' home valued at £3,500&mdash;would have been in the region of £12,000.  I might add that that accommodation would have been of a temporary nature.  On the one hand then, we have an expenditure from the Hospitals' Trust Fund of £7,500.  The Valuation Office has valued the land at £4,000.  That land is at present producing an annual income due to letting. The house was valued £3,500.  Therefore, we put £7,500 against an expenditure of £12,000 required to provide the <Col N="301" /> same amount of accommodation, but in a much longer time.</P>
    <P>Another field was mentioned, at the back of the hospital.  I was asked why it was not acquired.  The explanation is simple.  It was not acquired because that 11 acres would have cost approximately £1,600, or more than twice the cost per acre of the land comprising the Mount John estate.  Having acquired that field, we would have had to build thereon a nurses' home costing £12,000.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Ryan said that this sanatorium had been turned down as a training school by the General Nursing Council.  That is not true.  It is a recognised training school for sanatorium nurses and has been passed as such by the General Nursing Council. The new nurses' home is some distance from the hospital, but it was not chosen for that reason.  It was chosen because there was no other alternative at the time and because there were 26 people who had a right to live, a right to have their health restored and their lives saved.  I well knew that, with Deputy MacEntee, Deputy Dr. Ryan and Deputy Brennan there, I was taking the risk of having everything distorted and misrepresented.  I do not attach sufficient importance to success in political life to let the chance of that success stand in the way of doing what I consider to be right, of doing what I consider to be, as I said before, the Christian and the humane thing.  There are to-day men and women who do not share either Deputy MacEntee's or Deputy Dr. Ryan's attitude in this matter.  Too often in the past political expediency was allowed to interfere with the health of our people.  So long as I am in the Department of Health the sick, religion and politics aside, will come first and my political career can come anywhere else.</P>
    <P>I have nothing to hide.  Perhaps I may be permitted to reiterate the figures for the House.  The Mount John estate, composed of a house and 80 acres, 60 of which are arable and 20 non-arable, was valued by the Valuation Office at £7,500.  The land was valued at £4,000 and the house £3,500. The land is at present let and is bringing in an annual income.  The house is occupied by approximately 26 nurses. <Col N="302" /> The beds vacated by them in the institution are occupied by patients.  To provide alternative temporary accommodation for the same number would have cost £12,000.  The alternative site of 11 acres would have cost £1,600, or approximately twice the cost per acre of the arable land which had to be acquired as part of the Mount John project.  For the life of me, I cannot see why members of political Parties should be excluded from buying or selling their property.  I have no objection in the world if Deputy Dr. Ryan himself acquired his own residence and his own estate from the Land Commission. I presume that the whole transaction was carried out in a straightforward and honest way and that he has nothing to be ashamed of.  In this project, neither have I.</P>
    <P>Deputies in this debate covered a tremendously wide field.  I do not think it would be possible for me to reply in detail to all the points raised.  They covered hospitals, hospitals' programme, mother and child service, cancer, clinics, dispensaries, red tickets, deficits, the problem of nurses and nursing generally.  I shall do my best to cover at least the main points.</P>
    <P>On the question of hospitals, it would be wrong to get the general impression that I am building nothing, or proposing to build nothing, but tuberculosis institutions throughout the country, and that my only concern is the problem of tuberculosis.  There are problems which, in my opinion, are as serious and as grave, particularly the cancer problem.  It is killing, I think unnecessarily, a large percentage of those who die each year from this disease in our country.  The services available for the treatment of cancer are very limited and quite inadequate. I am well aware of that fact.  The problem was discussed by Deputy Byrne, Deputy Dunne and others but it is worth remembering that this problem of cancer did not spring up overnight.  So far back as 1935, the Hospitals Commission, in its second general report, pointed out the total inadequacy of cancer services in the country and made recommendations that a cancer hospital and extensions generally of services, should be provided. <Col N="303" /> This was not done and so we find ourselves to-day with a still very formidable programme.</P>
    <P>Coming to the question of what is to be done, a consultative council, composed of men associated with cancer work of all kinds and treating cancer in all the hospitals, was constituted. They were asked to study the problem and to bring in any experts who, they thought, might be of assistance to them in assessing the size of our problems, and having done so, to suggest remedies or schemes upon which I might work.  They met a number of times and did a considerable amount of very hard work of which I am deeply appreciative.  They had also the benefit of the advice of Dr. Pattison, a Scotsman, who is head of the Holt Radium Institute in Manchester, who came over and assisted them as best he could.</P>
    <P>I have only to-day, as a matter of fact, received their report and their recommendations.  The House can be quite certain that no time will be lost by me in considering these recommendations and, where possible, acting on them with the minimum delay.  So far I have been fortunate in being able to carry out a number of things which I had given assurance to the House I would try to do.  I hope that, in the next year, we shall see a considerable development of our cancer services. While obviously it is not a problem which will be solved overnight, I think I can gurantee some move towards a solution of our problems in the reasonably near future.</P>
    <P>On the question of hospitals, Deputy MacEntee was particularly irate because he read out a list of hospital proposals which I mentioned in my opening speech on the Estimate as being likely to be commenced this year, 1949.  He was particularly irate because I had not gone into the Department, taken all the proposals and the plans in the pigeon holes, made a bonfire of them, and started from the beginning, away back in 1931 and 1932.</P>
    <P>Again, Deputy Dr. Ryan, Deputy Derring and a number of the more unthinkingly critical Deputies were wondering where the hospitals were which <Col N="304" /> I had promised.  A little cold thinking is useful at this point.  Last year I had two separate proposals.  One was a proposal to carry through a number of projects for hospital building spread over a period of years.  The other was a proposal to provide a number of beds in a period of months.  I have been criticised by these Deputies because of my ingénue approach to the question of hospital building, the general inference being that I believed these could be produced out of a hat by the wave of a wand.  Similarly, my political organisation has been criticised because of my ingenuous belief in the speed at which you could build hospitals.  Of course, that is a completely dishonest reading of the facts of the situation.</P>
    <P>I said two things.  One was that I would build a number of hospitals in seven years.  I said that last year and I repeat it this year.  I did not say they would appear overnight when I waved my wand.  I also said that I would provide 1,000 beds for people awaiting admission to institutions within a year, approximately, of starting on that.  I have realised the latter project and beaten the target by 200 beds&mdash;they have come in at the rate of at least 100 beds a month.  If the Deputies who criticised had listened to my opening speech, they would have seen that if the proposals which I put to the House are fulfilled&mdash;I have every reason to think they will be fulfilled by the end of this year&mdash;we will have started on approximately £6,250,000 worth of the £17,500,000 projected for the next seven years.</P>
    <P>If, at the end of this year, I have started on approximately one-third of my whole seven year hospital programme, I shall be pretty satisfied. There is obviously every reason to believe that, moving on that basis.  I will not alone redeem by first promise &mdash;which I have done&mdash;to provide 1,000 beds, but I will redeem my second one &mdash;to increase the total bed capacity in the country by approximately 7,000 in the next seven years.  That is double the existing bed accommodation in the country.</P>
    <P>We have made great progress in the Department.  Deputy Corry, Deputy McGrath, Deputy Derrig, Deputy Dr. <Col N="305" /> Ryan and Deputy MacEntee are anxious to know why we have not started building here, there and everywhere. It must be obvious to Opposition Deputies that to say that is one of the most cogent criticisms that they could possibly make of their own Government and their own administration. I do not know if the Deputies understand that in the building of a hospital there are approximately 20 different moves&mdash;that one has to work from the outline schedule of accommodation right down to the getting of quantities. If the hospital projects mentioned by Deputy MacEntee in his very childish speech, the hospital projects advised by the Hospitals Commission in 1933, 1934, 1935 and 1936, all of which were ignored by Deputy MacEntee or whoever happened to be in power at the time, had made any real progress under Fianna Fáil&mdash;the emergency might have deprived them of timber, concrete, glass and steel and all the rest, but it did not deprive them of pencils and paper and some of these projects were started as far back as 1931&mdash;there was no reason why, when I went into office, I should have not been able to lay my hands on the final quantities for every single one of them. They were not available in respect of any single project which was there before the Department.</P>

      <P>Each project had to be put on the move and all the preliminary steps had to be taken in order that we might bring a number of them&mdash; approximately one-third&mdash;to a commencement in one and a half years of office.  I must say that I had great admiration for the extraordinary impertinence and impudence of Deputy MacEntee in his dissertation on what he was going to do next year, the year after and the year after that.  Knowing the facts, as he must, we cannot help admiring his ability to come in here to blast away the fact that he did nothing but plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="306" /> There was nothing but schemes in my Department when I went there. There were 135 of them, all of different kinds, sorts, sizes and shapes and they were all waiting.  There was Longford County Hospital, first proposed in 1932; Louth, proposed in 1935; Wicklow, first proposed in 1932; Leitrim (Manorhamilton), first proposed in 1933; Cahirciveen, first proposed in 1933; Galway Regional, first proposed in 1931; Crumlin Children's Hospital, about which he spoke with great eloquence, first proposed in 1935; the Coombe Hospital, first proposed in 1931; St. Laurence and Vincent's, first proposed in 1935; Dublin Fever Hospital, first proposed in 1936; Carndonagh, Donegal, first proposed in 1932; Letterkenny, first proposed in 1932; Regional Hospital, Cork, first proposed in 1934, and the Cork Fever Hospital, first proposed in 1935.  Well, now, he could talk himself out of that if he was here to do so, but he is not, and it will require all his eloquence.</P>
    <P>As I have stated previously, the emergency did not stop them planning or getting ahead with leaving these projects in the position where I could say to a contractor &ldquo;Go ahead and build.&rdquo;  If they pursued these projects with the slightest modicum of sincerity or with any real desire or intention to provide these institutions, all I would have had to do would have been to advertise for contracts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that but I will deal with that later.  Another point to remember is that if these people had had any interest in the sick poor of this country or indeed the sick of any class in this country they would have done more than to go around the country, bleating and whining about the emergency.  It is important to remember that 90 per cent. of the 1,200 beds that I provided in the last year or so were provided without the building of a single solitary hospital.  The fact of the matter is that these beds were there if they were sufficiently interested or if they had bothered their heads to go and find them.  The emergency did not stop them from providing these beds.  I accept that explanation in regard to the building of hospitals but not in regard to supplying of these beds which were there for the taking.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dr. Ryan asked me a number of questions but he has not had sufficient interest in the answers to remain and hear them.  He made a number of statements which were in the best traditions of the Deputy Dáil Reporter. One for instance was in regard to Castlerea which he emphatically reiterated in spite of my pointing out to him that he was telling lies.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not Parliamentary to say a Deputy was telling lies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I pointed out to him that he was making a mistake and he had not even the good grace to withdraw it.  In regard to Castlerea he said that all I had to do was to go down there, that he had completed all the preliminary negotiations, and all I had to do was to go there and tie up all the loose ends.  That is&mdash;and I state it again for a second time because he made the same statement last year&mdash; at complete variance with the truth. The fact of the matter is that the only approach made to the local authority in regard to the Castlerea institution was made by me following the taking over of Deputy Ryan's position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He asked about various places <Col N="308" /> throughout the country at which projects had been dreamed about, thought about or planned about by him.  One of these was in Sligo.  The architect's plans for this building are nearing completion and the preparation of quantities will soon be put in hand.  Tenders have only recently been received for the adaptations at Killybegs.  In the case of Kilcreene, Kilkenny, this appears to have been a great worry to Deputy Derrig but it has not caused him half as much worry as it has to me. I have been to the house, acquired there during the office of Fianna Fáil, for the accommodation of tubercular patients.  I cannot recall at the moment how much was paid for it but I presume it was bought in good faith. When, however, I saw it, I took one look at it and even to my completely amateur eye I could see what an unsuitable building it was.  The whole roof has a pagoda-like look about it, completely U-shaped.  Having seen the outside I went upstairs and saw that the explanation was that the roof was collapsing due to the fact that there is worm in it.  That would not be very good buying.</P>
    <P>In regard to Peamount, he was wondering about the beds there.  At present they have been completed and are occupied.  In the case of Newcastle they will be ready by September.  In St. Laurence's Hospital, the beds are at present occupied, and similarly in Our Lady of Lourdes.  These are all projects which have been completed in recent months.  Deputy Derring and Deputy Dr. Ryan made reference to the fact that I seemed to spend more time and to be more concerned with the treatment of disease rather than with its prevention.  There is an obvious enough answer to that.  It is quite useless to set about the prevention of disease which already exists. Quite obviously, I must occupy a large part of my time in dealing with the hospital and sanatorium needs of the country for the people who are actually sick at the moment.  No prevention in the world is going to help them much. The Deputies were not completely accurate, because, as I pointed out in my opening speech, we have set forward a scheme for prevention which was <Col N="309" /> in operation&mdash;the use of B.C.G. vaccination.  That is the vaccination for the prevention of tuberculosis in children, cases of contact, medical students, nurses and for all susceptible age groups.  Similarly, in regard to diphtheria immunisation.  By adjustments made last year in the payments to dispensary doctors, a considerable improvement has been shown in this important branch of preventive medicine.  The figures are:&mdash;In 1946, 42,000 people were immunised; in 1947, 49,000 were immunised, and in 1948, 80,000 people were immunised.  These figures show, I think, a very remarkable improvement, and I am sure that in future years it will pay great dividends in a falling off in the number of deaths from diphtheria.</P>
    <P>Deputy Derring was critical of statements which I made about the continuation of pauperism in the health services of the country&mdash;of my criticism of Fianna Fáil for its continued existence. He said there was no pauperism in the health services of the country. But when I mentioned the question of getting rid of the red-ticket system, of which I have a considerable abhorrence, Deputy Burke said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is one system that I am delighted to see going.  The public health dispensaries, one felt, always had the pauper feeling about them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is no doubt at all, of course, that the red-ticket system had rotten associations with which we can readily dispense.</P>
    <P>There is one very important development in regard to the public assistance medical service, and that, of course, is in relation to St. Kevin's Hospital, Dublin.  There are varying opinions about the services that are being provided there at the moment, but I think that as soon as the people of Dublin come to appreciate the very high standard of the medical and surgical services which have been provided there, and which will be further improved in the reasonably near future, they will understand that we will have in Dublin one of the finest municipal hospitals in Europe.  This project was envisaged by the previous Government, and I think credit should go to them for that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="310" /> A group of medical consultant practitioners of the very highest grade gave considerable time and care to this whole question of the provision of a post graduate school at St. Kevin's.  Having considered the problem over a long period, they submitted a report to me. I would like to take this opportunity of thanking those representatives of the medical profession for their public-spirited action in giving up so much of their valuable time to consider that, and in making these representations to me.  It is always, of course, particularly satisfying to a Minister for Health to be able to have the services of these representative members of the consultant and specialist group in Dublin and in other cities to assist him in formulating his proposals for the betterment and improvement of the health services. It is proposed that a post-graduate school will be set up here, if the necessary legislation is enacted.  Its purpose primarily will be to teach and give post-graduate education to the local authority medical officers only. This, of course, will not cut across any of the existing post-graduate courses at present being given by the different hospitals and medical schools in the country.</P>
    <P>Recently we advertised for doctors, surgeons and specialists in bacteriology and pathology for this hospital. It, as Deputies are probably aware, serves practically entirely the poorer sections of the community in Dublin. The salaries which we are offering to these specialists are, I think, unprecedented in the whole local authority medical services.  I am quite certain that we shall attract good, conscientious and efficient medical personnel. It will be the main duty of that personnel to serve the needs of the poorer classes in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Deputy Derring is interested in the building programme.  It may interest Deputies to know that we have divided up the programme with a view to showing the amount of money we propose to spend and the amount of building we propose to undertake in the next seven years.  In 1949, that is, the present year, we propose spending £1,250,000; in 1950 we propose spending £2,750,000; in 1951 we propose <Col N="311" /> spending £3,000,000; in 1952 we propose spending £3,750,000; in 1953 we propose spending £3,000,000; in 1954 we propose spending £2,250,000, and in 1955 we propose spending £1,500,000. That is a total of £17,500,000 which we propose spending over the next seven years on these projects which I have already laid before the House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Derring was anxious to know what exactly had been done in the building line.  To the uninitiated, and even to the most ignorant layman, it is quite obvious that this amount of building could not have been done at once.  A number of building projects of a temporary nature have been carried out.  In Castlerea a 120-bed nurses' home was erected in approximately four months.  I must here pay tribute to the Irish building industry which was able to provide that accommodation in such a short time.  In Castlerea, also, a 100-bed domestic staff home was provided.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mrs. Rice and most of the other Deputies who spoke in the debate referred to the problem of Irish nurses generally.  I think everybody must be aware of my views in regard to the nursing profession.  I believe these women make the greatest contribution to the national life and to the health of the community.  From my experience of them as doctor, patient, layman, Minister and everything else, I believe they take the highest place in the community in close association with, of course, the nursing sisters.  For hundreds of years back these nursing sisters have laid the foundations and built up the traditions of the nursing profession to-day.  In every country in the world these nursing sisters have nursed the sick in flood, famine, pestilence and poverty.  To them we owe the magnificent standards we have to-day in this profession, standards based on Christian principles and closely associated with its very much younger offshoot, the lay nursing profession.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne (Junior) suggested that the nursing profession was shortsighted because it did not form a trade union.  He suggested that they would thereby lose.  I am afraid I do not completely <Col N="312" /> agree with him in that point of view.  The most effective weapon the trade union has&mdash;and a justifiable weapon from the trade union point of view&mdash;is the strike weapon.  That, of course, would be quite out of bounds in either the nursing or the medical profession. I sincerely hope that we shall never, no matter what Government is in power, attach so little importance to nurses and the nursing profession as to force them into a position where they might feel that serious action was required&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the problem of the nursing shortage is not as serious as some would lead us to believe. Certainly we have not found it so up to the present.  We have made representations to local authorities asking them to pay particular regard to the living, working and recreation facilities provided for nurses.</P>
      <P>It is well to remember that we in the Department of Health have no responsibility whatsoever for nurses in either voluntary hospitals or nursing homes. In the majority of the voluntary hospitals I think the girls are treated reasonably well.  In some of them I do not think they are treated particularly well.  All I can do in the Department of Health is to try to set a headline which, I hope, will be followed by these other organisations' institutions.</P>

      <P>Quite a number of girls are coming back these days and taking up positions in our hospitals.</P>
      <P>Deputy Briscoe is interested in the Dublin hospitals with which he is associated in a number of ways and he is anxious to know the building programme for Dublin.  It comprises a new St. Vincent's Hospital at Elm Park, a Coombe Hospital at Donore Avenue, St. Laurence's Hospital, which we propose to start in the seven-year programme, Crumlin Children's Hospital, Dublin Fever Hospital, a genito-urinary unit at the Meath Hospital and infants' units at the Rotunda and the Coombe and the National Maternity Hospital, giving a total of approximately 1,400 beds.</P>
      <P>With regard to a number of these projects, progress is quite satisfactory.  In respect of a number of these I felt that faster progress would be made if I removed Departmental control entirely from them and what I have done is to allocate a certain amount of money and thereafter we in the Department have no functions whatsoever beyond ensuring that when the hospital is built the number of beds which we have budgeted for is provided for my particular responsibility, the local authority patient.  This has had useful results, particularly in regard to the Crumlin Children's Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have done this also in regard to St. Vincent's Hospital.  The amount of money is, so far as I recollect, something in the region of £1,000,000, which we have promised to the promoting body, merely asking that at the end of the time they should provide approximately 450 beds.  That is the project which was first started in 1935.  I hope that Deputies Briscoe and Byrne, who are interested in these hospital projects, will use their enthusiasm and interest to encourage the promoting bodies to proceed as rapidly as possible. There can be no blame attached to the Department; there can be no question of red, white or green tape. <Col N="314" /> These projects are handed over lock, stock and barrel to the promoting authorities and the speed is entirely their responsibility.</P>
    <P>In regard to the money for these projects, the present capital of the Hospitals' Trust Fund is approximately £10,000,000.  Over the next seven years interest will bring in another £1,000,000 approximately, and further sweeps will give us £6,000,000, making a total of £17,000,000.  Liabilities are grants amounting to £14,000,000 and the deficits approximately £3,000,000.  The grants of £14,000,000 will leave approximately £3,500,000 to be found by the various promoting authorities.  When the fund is exhausted, we can hope that the sweeps money will continue to flow in and in that way finance any deficits and new building.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister find that these figures tally?  He refers to capital £10,000,000, interest £1,000,000, anticipations from future sweeps £6,000,000, making a total of £17,000,000, On the other side we have earmarked grants £14,000,000 and deficit £3,500,000, making a total of £17,500,000.  The Minister said there was a further deficit of £3,000,000.  How does that arise?  Maybe I misunderstood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned that £3,500,000 will have to be by way of contribution.  I said £14,000,000 will be available for grants and £3,500,000 will be available from the promoting authorities.  For certain of these projects grants of 60 per cent., 70 per cent. and 80 per cent. will be given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to dispensaries, which seem to have worried a number of Deputies, they also have been a cause of concern to us in the Department. The position is this, that the standard of the dispensary premises is the complete responsibility of the local authority.  We have no functions at all and give no grants at all to the reconditioning of dispensary premises.  We have made representations on a number of occasions to different local authorities asking that they should attempt to bring up the standard of accommodation provided in these dispensaries to reasonable conditions.  We can only hope that the Deputies who are members of local authorities will use their <Col N="315" /> influence to encourage a little more consciousness of the importance of good appearance, cleanliness and reasonable working conditions for the doctors in the dispensaries which are their responsibility.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEntee had a wonderful time in the Rotunda Gardens.  Deputy Vivion de Valera was also interested but I think, quite honestly, and quite sincerely, was not aware of all the facts in connection with that particular case. The history of this is, of course, that the site was given over for the project of a memorial park by the Rotunda authorities.  I do think it is a very sad commentary on a Deputy of Deputy MacEntee's age and associations that he would in this House use that period and the efforts and sacrifices of the men of that period to attempt to score a small petty point in Party politics.  I find it difficult as a junior member of this House to understand a mentality of that kind.  Perhaps it is best to pass over Deputy MacEntee and to deal with the point of the Rotunda Gardens.</P>
    <P>This project, of course, is not aimed at the destruction of the plans to provide a memorial park.  As it happens, I have consulted the members of the Old I.R.A., who are particularly concerned, and have been concerned for a number of years, in the forwarding of this project.  It was very touching indeed to see the concern of these men to assist us in the provision of this hospital.  It is, of course, not a clinic or a dispensary, but a temporary hospital for the use of children in the neo-natal period, just after being born.  It is one of three projects, each one of which is associated with our maternity hospitals and that might explain to Deputy Vivion de Valera, who, I think, was a little confused about the problem, why this particular site, of the sites available throughout Dublin City, was chosen.  The important thing about these hospitals, one at the National Maternity Hospital, one at the Coombe and one at the Rotunda Hospital, is, of course, that we will have the advantages of these very famous maternity hospitals and the excellent service they can provide for us.  I think Deputy Vivion de <Col N="316" /> Valera was also confused in that he thought this was to be a tuberculosis clinic.  That is not so.  It is for children who might be dangerously ill in the first few months of their lives and quite obviously, if we can have for these children in the first few dangerous months of their lives the services of the staffs of these world famous maternity hospitals, it will be a tremendous contribution towards the protection of the lives of these young children.  It is a purely temporary arrangement and there is no question of the indefinite postponement of the memorial park project.</P>
    <P>Deputy Vivion de Valera also mentioned the question of athletics.  Really, of course, it does not come into my Estimate at all and I have no functions in regard to the question of athletics beyond saying that, as Minister for Health, I fully appreciate the tremendous advantages which would be gained by more and more of the youth of our country taking, not a spectator's interest, but a contestant's interest in athletics generally.  A number of organisations are working very hard to promote an interest in athletics in school children and young adults and such organisations are playing a very important part in this very laudable project.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies were concerned about the mother and child services&mdash;Deputy Maguire, Deputy Dr. Ryan, Deputy Derrig and Deputy Mrs. Rice.  The mother and child service is a tremendously important and a very big project indeed.  To say that it could have been introduced in a few months is, of course, arrant nonsense and nobody knows that better than Deputy Dr. Ryan.  I completely agree with the project but have no intention of being panicked into bringing into operation a scheme which might not be capable of giving me the results which I require, that is, the protection of the mother in the period of maternity and of the child in its childhood and early adolescence to the age of 15 or 16. There are a number of different interests which must be consulted. Consultant councils set up by me worked extremely hard and provided a scheme, first of all, for Dublin and, secondly, for rural areas.  The Dublin <Col N="317" /> scheme has been examined by me and my Department and is now with, and has been examined by, the other Departments concerned.  It is a very big scheme and will cost a lot of money. The Dublin scheme alone will cost anything between £250,000 and £750,000.</P>

      <P>That is another story. In regard to the question of tuberculosis, a number of questions were asked and I shall deal with the matter shortly.  I, of course, have absolutely no apology whatsoever to offer for my preoccupation with this problem in the last year or two.  I had to deal with something which was neglected for a decade and a half.  This is quite obvious from the fact that, in the previous 16 years, as I mentioned in reply to a Parliamentary question, only 690 odd beds were provided by the Opposition Party when they were in office. This left us with a totally inadequate number for the needs of the country. Twelve hundred beds in different places have been provided in the last 16 months and, of course, there is no <Col N="318" /> question of the abandonment of any of the regional sanatoria.  Deputy Dunne referred to the Abbotstown Regional Sanatorium.  The position in regard to that is that we have agreed upon a site plan and the civil engineers are at present getting out the drawings.  They hope to be finished in a short time and the site works will commence before the end of the year.  The same progress has been made in regard to Sarsfield Court in Cork.  The site plan has been approved and the civil engineers are now working on the engineering drawings preparatory to taking out quantities and starting the civil development work.  Again I hope it will be possible to start that project this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the question of speed, if we look at the progress made in regard to Santry Court, and start at the same stage in regard both to Sarsfield Court and Abbotstown, we have every reason to believe that we shall have reached the tendering stage for these two projects at least two months more quickly than the time taken in regard to Santry Court.  That is taking the time between the commencement of the outline schedule and the taking out of quantities. We hope even to improve on that time.  Deputy Corry can rest assured that we shall get on that site as quickly as possible and there will be very little delay.  In addition, of course, we have the building of the sub-regional sanatorium at Ardkeen, in Waterford, which was not envisaged at all by the previous Government.  In that case, tenders have been asked for and building work will commence in the next few months.  Similarly, in regard to Limerick Regional Hospital the site works have been completed and quantities are being taken out. Galway Central Hospital has had a very chequered career, starting in 1931. We have also had to work particularly hard in regard to that hospital as it is badly needed.  We are working to see that that building will also be commenced by the end of this year.  Deputy McGrath blames the Department for the delay in the building of the regional hospital in Cork.  He said that the plans were with us and asked would we make haste with them.  That is not so. The plans are at present in Cork and <Col N="319" /> I hope he will make haste with them. In regard to Gurranebraher Fever Hospital, I hope we shall be able to start also on that in the next couple of months.  There is no reason now why it should be utilised for fever purposes. It is up to the damp course level and it is merely a question of finishing it off and using it for some purpose other than that for which it was originally intended.  I understand that it is proposed to use it for the treatment of tuberculosis.  There will be no need to use it for fever owing to the reduction in the incidence of fever throughout the country.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister whether the quarrel or disagreement between the contractors and officials of his Department in connection with the building of the huts at Mallow has reached a satisfactory conclusion or not.  There are 20 beds there that could be occupied by patients for the last 14 months if these two military huts had been provided for the accommodation of the nurses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Byrne was interested in the question of children suffering from pulmonary and non-pulmonary <Col N="320" /> tuberculosis.  The position is that development work on the Ballyowen children's hospital has already begun.  That hospital will provide accommodation for approximately 250 children. Of course, there is also the Foynes children's hospital.  That was an overnight hostel for visitors from all parts of the world.  It is a very lovely and excellent building which was put up regardless of cost.  It is very pleasant to think that the sick children of Ireland will be restored to health in that institution and will get the benefit of money spent for quite a different purpose in the last ten years.</P>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Corry's question about the Mallow hospital, the position there is that we were very anxious that the wages variation clause should be insisted upon so that if there was a fall in building costs we would get the benefit from the contractor. That caused a certain amount of delay.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  A number of Deputies referred to the Civil Service generally and to the staff of my Department.  The architects in my Department do not draw up plans, except in regard to sanatoria; they approve of plans.  The promotion of the different projects is in the hands of the local authorities and the speed at which the Department works depends largely on the Minister.  I personally have received complete co-operation and considerable help and assistance from the members of the staff in my Department.  At no time have they attempted to obstruct or interfere with my work.</P>
