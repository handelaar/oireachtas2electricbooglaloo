    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether he is aware that many primary school teachers who gave service as substitutes, or in other temporary capacities, suffer serious monetary loss because such broken periods of service are not recognised for incremental purposes; and, if so, <Col N="534" /> whether he proposes to remedy the position with retrospective effect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="Minister for Education (General Mulcahy) Richard (General) Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (General Mulcahy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under an amendment to the Department's rules, which was promulgated last year, incremental credit is allowed as from the 1st January, 1947, for such service as substitute or supernumerary teacher as is reckonable under the rules as part of the two-year probationary period.  By virtue of this amendment it is hoped that most national teachers may be enabled to earn incremental credit for service as substitute or supernumerary teacher while they are awaiting appointment in a substantive capacity.</P>
      <P>It would not be feasible to allow incremental credit for all service as substitute which a teacher might give, as there are many factors of an administrative nature to be taken into consideration. I am, however, having the matter investigated for the purpose of ascertaining whether it may be practicable to make some additional amendment of the rule which would have the effect of giving further incremental credit to those who serve as substitutes for teachers absent from school duties in circumstances which render such absences likely to be for prolonged periods.  I cannot, at this stage, say whether such amendment may be found feasible.</P>
      <P>As regards the Deputy's reference to service as teacher in a temporary capacity other than as substitute I should like to make it clear that such service given by qualified teachers and for which salary is paid to the teachers directly by the Department is reckoned as incremental service provided that the rules governing such service are otherwise fulfilled.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the scheme at present in operation an annual <Col N="535" /> grant is paid to the manager of each national school for the provision of free books for necessitous children.

      <P>The Deputy will perhaps remember that on the 5th July, in reply to a question by Deputy A.P. Byrne regarding the cost of text books and school requisites, I told him that I had no definite information on which a reliable estimate of the expenditure per head could be based but that I was having inquiries made in the matter. When these inquiries have been completed, I may be able to answer some further questions on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Any decision about this matter is a decision of my own.  In so far as there is a question of fact at the present moment I have had to decide that I am not proposing to extend the scheme at present.  But, in relation to the question raised by Deputy Byrne in the early part of the month, certain aspects of the matter referred to by the Deputy are being examined into by me and when these further facts are brought to light, if a suggestion has to be made or a decision taken about it, any decision which will be taken in the matter will be a Ministerial or Government decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he will state the number of schools with classes of more than 60 on the roll in the Dublin City area; if he is aware that in some schools teachers are asked to attempt to teach classes with over 75 pupils, and whether he will state if these conditions can permit of the children of the city receiving proper education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of schools in Dublin City area with classes of more than 60 pupils on the rolls on the 1st March last was 72. There were ten classes in the area on that date in which there were 75 pupils or over on the rolls.</P>
      <P>I am fully aware that the conditions resulting from these facts are such as to militate against education of a completely satisfactory standard being imparted to the pupils involved.</P>
      <P>Within the past 20 years the primary school population in the city area has increased from 32,000 to 78,000.  It has been found impossible, particularly owing to the restriction and almost complete suspension of building during the war period, to keep the provision of new school accommodation <i>pari passu</i> with this abnormal growth. In addition to this all-over difficulty, slum clearances and new housing schemes have accentuated the problem in certain areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department's regulations allow of the appointment of an assistant teacher for each 45 pupils on the rolls, but owing to the incidence of numbers in respect of the various standards it it is often found that in spite of staffing <Col N="537" /> strictly in accordance with the regulations, the numbers in the lower standards are high and the numbers in the higher standards relatively low. There is, accordingly, in addition to the accommodation difficulty, a serious problem of organisation.</P>
    <P>As intimated by me when the Estimates for my Department were being discussed, I am having the matter very carefully investigated, and I can assure the Deputy that everything possible will be done to arrive at a satisfactory solution of the difficulties.</P>

      <P>(b)  Forestry workers got an increase in wages this year, but I presume the Deputy is referring to the differential paid to forestry workers for a short period because they were extensively employed on the production of domestic fuel, during a period of acute fuel shortage.  I regret I cannot meet the Deputy's wishes in this regard.</P>

      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;  The Dairy Disposal Company is at present examining the feasibility of providing travelling creamery facilities in the districts referred to by the Deputy, and will do its utmost to provide such facilities at the earliest practicable date.</P>
      <P>In the meantime I would suggest to the farmers in these areas that they avail themselves of the concession granted under the &ldquo;Carriage of Milk Order, 1949,&rdquo; whereby milk producers can have their milk conveyed to creameries or cream-separating stations during the period ending on the 30th September next by owners of motor vehicles who may not be the holders of general merchandise licences.</P>

      <P>I fully appreciate the difficulties in that particular area and I wish to emphasise the first part of my reply, that the survey is proceeding and arrangements being made, but the concessions in transport referred to do not relate exclusively to lorries.  If anyone had a tractor or any other motor vehicle which could be used <i>ad interim</i> to relieve an urgent situation they might combine to ask a neighbour to come perhaps some little distance to carry out transport for them.  But I merely add that as an <i>ad interim</i> measure while better arrangements are, in fact, being made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already announced the decision of the Government that Mianraí Teoranta should proceed with the scheme for minerals exploration at Avoca, County Wicklow. Underground work cannot be started pending the delivery of essential plant and equipment which is expected to arrive within the next three to four months.  In the meantime, Mianraí Teoranta, on the 7th July, 1949, was reluctantly compelled to dispense temporarily with the services of 25 underground and seven surface workers at Avoca who could not at present be usefully employed in the absence of equipment. Seven underground and 31 surface workers were retained in employment.</P>
      <P>I understand that directors of the company have explained the position fully to the men who were dismissed and have assured them that everything possible will be done to provide employment for them at the earliest possible moment.</P>

In view of the essential and skilled work those men are engaged in, I should like the Minister to inform me what is going to happen to those men during the 12 or 14 weeks when they will be unemployed?

      <P>In order to qualify for the payment of the maximum grants available local authorities were not required to provide more money from rates in respect of the current year for the financing of road works than was provided by them for the same purpose during the financial year 1948-49.  I have no funds from which to increase this year's grants.  This matter was fully debated on the 23rd February last.</P>
      <P>In regard to housing it is presumed that the Deputy refers to the Transition Development Fund grants.  These grants, it should be noted, are supplementary to the 60 per cent. contribution towards loan charges on labourers' cottages under the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1932, and the aggregate assistance afforded from State resources under these two heads is not considered to be on an inadequate scale.</P>

The suggested creation of a &ldquo;green belt&rdquo; area was adopted by <Col N="557" /> the Dublin Corporation in December, 1940, on the recommendation of their town planning consultants and the town planning committee of the corporation.</P>

The figures for voluntary hospitals and for the local authority hospitals for each of the years 1932 to 1939 are not readily available and it will be necessary to communicate with the various hospital authorities in order to obtain it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the first part of the question, the Deputy will, of course, appreciate that the capital sums available were constantly changing due to the disbursement of money for hospital projects on the one hand, and the intake of new funds on the other.  I take it that the Deputy's requirements would be met by a statement of the funds available on the 31st December of each of the years mentioned. With your permission, a Chinn Chomhairle, I will circulate a statement giving this information for inclusion in the official record.</P>
      <P>With regard to the second portion of the question, I find that an answer to this could not be provided without a detailed and exhaustive examination of some hundreds of voluminous files in my Department dealing with proposals and commitments for hospitalisation schemes.  I think the Deputy will agree that, in view of the urgent need to go ahead with the projects which are now nearing the building stage, I could not justify the diversion of staff to the compilation of the information for which the Deputy has asked.</P>

      <P>When I moved to report progress on Friday, I was referring to some statements made by Deputy Little on the policy being pursued at our Broadcasting Station. He mentioned in the course of the debate that there was an inclination on the part of the authorities to use the radio for political purposes.  It is my contention and the contention of any reasonable individual that that was a scandalous allegation.  Everyone knows that this particular Department is in charge of civil servants, who cannot be interfered with by any particular Party.  I was glad to see from the Minister's statement on this Estimate that the management of the station has improved considerably and that the methods adopted have been modernised, the result being that we have a better news service than was hitherto available and that the station in general has proved of greater interest to listeners here at home.</P>
      <P>I would be inclined to advocate that a general knowledge Question Time, which has proved so popular over a great number of years, should be carried on during certain days of the week.  Even if the questions are asked on one day and answered on the second day, it would be a method of creating interest and of imparting education on certain subjects.  Up to the present, the radio has not been introduced to schools in any great measure.  I believe it is time that its value should be recognised there.  Lectures of great value, particularly of a technical character, could in that way be given to the students attending secondary schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="566" /> In my opinion, the hospitals' programme could be extended.  If there was such a programme from Radio Éireann in the morning &mdash; I do not think there is one at present &mdash; it would, I feel, be appreciated by patients.  I know they do listen to the midday programme which is provided for them on certain days of the week.  In fact, I know they look forward to it and it is desirable that this service, if possible, should be extended in the matter of hours.  I notice from the Minister's statement that more items are being broadcast within the limited number of hours available than hitherto. That would seem to indicate that there is an improvement in the organisation of the radio service.  The interference that takes place in the case of the radio is, I know, causing a good deal of concern.  It is desirable. in the interests of listeners in cities and towns, that the methods of detection which were employed some time ago should be continued for the purpose of finding out the causes of this interference. I believe that, in many cases, if the interference that he was causing was pointed out to the offender, steps would be taken to remedy it.  I am sure people realise that they owe a duty to their neighbours not to cause interference with reception in their homes, and sure that if attention were called to that matter the people who cause this interference would desist from doing so.</P>
    <P>I notice from the Minister's statement that the actors, producers and script writers employed by Radio Éireann are now in many cases on a permanent basis.  That, I am sure, will make for better service for the public and for better programmes.  Heretofore they seem to have been employed haphazardly, each person getting a turn according to the type of work that he was considered suitable to broadcast. As a result of this new arrangement, there is now more variety in the programmes which are of a lighter character and more entertaining than formerly.  I have noticed that improvement during the last year or so. Previously, the programmes were rather heavy, and they certainly did not display any great imagination on the part of those who organised them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="567" /> I think that, in this agricultural country, agricultural talks should be provided by Radio Éireann.  There are plenty of people amongst the farming community who are anxious to learn modern methods of farming so that they may be able to increase production. In my opinion, lectures on the radio by experts could render a very valuable service to the rural community. I am also of opinion that the organisation known as E.C.A. should be properly described on the Radio for the farming community as well as the benefits that it is intended to confer. The farming community in general are not able to learn all the features of this organisation from reading the newspapers.  Therefore, I suggest that a series of talks on the subject should be given over the radio.  I was glad to hear from the Minister that mobile recording units are now being employed.  These will help to bring the radio one may say into the heart of the community and people will be able to learn what is going on in different places.  This service was not available previously, and could not be, until the mobile recording units were employed for this purpose.</P>
    <P>I think it is desirable that, at an early date in the future, we should have two stations instead of one.  I understand that the one station broadcasts through Dublin, Athlone and Cork.  It is possible that the second station could be used, with Cork as the centre, and could be used for a type of programme different from that which is being broadcast from the present station.  Occasions arise when two very important matters should be broadcast.  That cannot be done, of course, from the one station.  Therefore, the provision of a second station would, I think, be appreciated by the people.  I realise, of course, that that would mean more staff and more organisation, and that in some respects it might have the effect of taking away from the organisation and staff which now exists at Radio Éireann, an organisation which has been built up to such a degree of efficiency as we know it to-day.</P>
    <P>I see, too, that a second wave length <Col N="568" /> was obtained for this country at the international conference held during the year.  In my opinion, the low power which has been made available will leave the radio ineffective to some extent at least.  We have, of course, staked our claim to a second wave length.  On a suitable date we will have the opportunity of pressing our claim to get the requiste power to enable us to broadcast on that second wave length.  It appears that there is a good deal of confusion internationally regarding the existing wave lengths.  In fact, seven nations could not agree to accept the wave lengths allotted to them.  They appear to have adopted an independent attitude because they did not accept any wave length offered to them at the conference. The confusion that has arisen is not, of course, due to any fault of ours.  We must realise that we will have to stake our claim for suitable power for the second wave length when the position regarding international wave lengths has been clarified.</P>
    <P>The use of the radio, and the value of it, cannot be exaggerated.  Every one appreciates the value of the short-wave radio.  That will enable us to advertise our country, expand our tourist trade and make known to continental countries, especially, the fact that we are in a position to export good food.  The radio is also one of the methods which can be employed to improve international relations and to heighten our prestige amongst the nations of the world.  Now, the use of the radio for political purpose referred to by Deputy Little, was justified in his opinion by the fact that references were made to the activities of the Minister for External Affairs when travelling in foreign countries by trying to improve conditions for our country and by bringing before the nations of the world the wrong of Partition.  I would not like to understand from Deputy Little's reference that he did not approve of the efforts of the Minister for External Affairs to bring those wrongs to the notice of nations that he was visiting.  I think it was very helpful that Radio Eireann should have broadcast, at that time, <Col N="569" /> the activities of our Minister for External Affairs.  It made those peoples realise the importance of his mission.</P>
    <P>I believe that the radio, as well as being used as an instrument for amusement, should also be used to some extent as a medium for propaganda.  In my opinion we could create a bias in the radio which would make it clear to the nations of the world that we stand for Christian principles.  That would enable us to combat the possibility of Communism which appears to be moving westwards from Russia.  In fact it seems to be on the increase since the visit of Deputy Boland to Russia as a Minister without portfolio representing Fianna Fáil over 20 years ago.</P>

      <P>The radio, in my opinion, should be used to uphold Christian principles and, if we are going to use the radio for propaganda, I believe that is the line which we should take.  I notice that we are criticised for postponing the establishment of the short-wave station but I think it will be agreed that it was only reasonable that the lot of the old age pensioners and other needy classes should receive first consideration. When they have been relieved to some extent, I feel sure that the Minister will put into operation the short-wave station which exists and which is being maintained at the present time.</P>

      <P>I was interested in the Minister's statement in introducing this Estimate.  I was interested particularly in certain references he made. He referred in detail, to the difficulties the Post Office has to face with regard to complaints by listeners of interference with radio reception.  He mentioned a number of forms of interference.  The most general forms of interference can be referred to under three main headings.  There is the interference which is caused by oscillation.  That is to a great extent due to one set interfering with reception by another.  In that case, of course, it would be very difficult for the Minister or his staff to do anything about it unless they could locate the particular set.  I wonder would it be possible for the Department to examine samples of the main types of radio receiving sets that are sold with a view to seeing that they contain a part which will help to eliminate oscillation. Then there is the interference caused by atmospherics.  Nobody can do anything about that.  If there is a thunderstorm in the neighbourhood, a crackling noise is heard on the radio and we cannot do anything about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not much of the last tram left and there is no interference caused by trams now with radio reception.  There is a form of interference which I think the Department can take notice of and do something about after consultation with the Electricity Supply Board.  It occurs in sets which are used off the ordinary main electricity supply.  There are electricity circuits supplying private houses and off some of these circuits mechanical devices are worked in industrial concerns.  For instance, in my <Col N="571" /> neighbourhood there is an electric drill used in a local garage and whenever the drill is working I have to turn off my radio.  I imagine that in cases of that kind, where industrial undertakings or workshops are in built-up areas, the Department, in consultation with the Electricity Supply Board, could make some arrangement whereby persons using instruments which cause noises and interference could have some kind of apparatus installed which would modify if not completely eliminate it.</P>
      <P>There was some talk here about the manner in which Radio Éireann is now broadcasting their proceedings of this House.  I am not for one moment suggesting that the Minister is directing the news reports from the House or that he is interfering in any way but I think the people who are responsible ought to realise that there are occasions on which reasonable criticism can be levelled at the manner in which the news of proceedings of this House happen to be given over the radio. Take, for instance, the proceedings of the House last week.  A great number of the members on this side of the House spoke at length.  A certain number of members on the other side of the House spoke.  If one adds up the time that was allotted to the reporting of speeches of, say, the Front Bench members on this side, one finds that in some cases a reference was made that lasted, say, eight seconds, and that where a member on the other side spoke, references were made which lasted 30 seconds.  I have here a tabulated statement.  If one compares that with the way the proceedings were reported in the Press one finds quite the reverse position, that the Press devoted something like 33 inches to the speeches made on this side as compared with 22 inches to speeches made on the other side of the House. Yet the total time allocated for reference on the radio to speeches made on this side of the House was slightly over one minute, whereas the interParty groups together got two minutes and 11 seconds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People do criticise and say that the news service there should be a news service.  I disagree to a great extent <Col N="572" /> with Deputy Rooney who suggests that Radio Éireann should be used as a propaganda medium.  I do not think Deputy Rooney knows that under the international convention, except in very extraordinary circumstances, in war time, when ordinary normal conventional undertakings are no longer respected, the radio station of any country is not to be permitted to be used against the interests of another country for propaganda purposes.  We can state our own views and our own efforts, and so on, but, clearly, it would be a very dangerous thing to start a competition in propaganda and for us to listen in then to what the other fellow is saying about us.  Our station should be primarily for the entertainment and education of our people and for the dissemination of general news.</P>
    <P>Our station, with all the limitations attaching to it because of its size and because of its limited income as compared with stations in other countries, has done very good and useful work all through its history.  I am very glad to hear from the Minister that by his efforts, what he described as the wireless pirates, who were not paying their licence fee for their wireless set, have been caught and made pay and that, in addition, the number of listeners has increased considerably. I hope it will continue to increase.</P>
    <P>I have always felt that the Department of Finance regards wireless broadcasting as a commercial undertaking that must pay its way and that it is very chary of its spending in excess of its income.  It is fair to say that this Department has not been a charge on the taxpayer or the State. It has paid its way handsomely through its short history and has done a great deal of useful work.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, other kinds of complaints and grievances.  Everyone of us hears some complaints.  Some of them are without foundation.  Some of them may come from cranks.  The Minister indicated that he gets letters asking him to put on Bing Crosby, and other letters asking him to take Bing Crosby off.  There are other kinds of criticism, too.  I take it that it is the desire of the House and the Department to foster native talent as much as <Col N="573" /> possible.  I would like to see a more generous attitude adopted with regard to payments to authors whose plays are used over our radio, and to Irish artists generally.</P>
    <P>It has been said &mdash; with what degree of accuracy I cannot say &mdash; that we do not give enough time to Irish bands in Radio Éireann, although when foreign bands come to this country they are given a chance to play over our radio to the detriment of our native bands&mdash;in the sense of more time not being given to our people.  We have a very limited outlet for artists.  We have to have a very delicate approach to try to get our people to understand native music and to understand good types of music. I have heard a great deal of satisfaction expressed over the development of concerts from Radio Éireann.  I heard a question asked in the House as to the number of foreign conductors brought in to conduct orchestral recitals.  The general feeling of the people seems to be that these recitals are very interesting and satisfactory and are giving our people a far better understanding of what is called good music.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that as a result of the international conference in Mexico we have been accorded two additional wave lengths.  He did not indicate what the wave lengths are and we would be glad to know if they are purely medium or medium and long. I take it the question of the short wave length has not been settled yet, and will not be for some time.  It will be of interest to know how the new wave lengths, when they are put into operation, will be worked.  Deputy Rooney has already concluded that we will have two medium wave lengths operating at the same time and listeners will have the option of tuning in to one of two programmes.  The information I have asked will also be of interest to people who may be getting a new set.  If the short wave band will not be accorded to us for some time, that may have a bearing on purchases.  If the position will be different from what I am suggesting, I hope the Minister will make it clear so that people anxious to purchase a set will be able to arrange to get a suitable one.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="574" /> Generally speaking, the reception from Radio Éireann is good.  I do not know to what extent it can be received all over the country.  I remember in years gone by there were certain black spots over which the reception was bad.  I do not know to what extent there has been a decline in battery sets and their replacement, where rural electrification has taken place, by main sets.  I think the Minister can look forward to a further increase in the number of listeners as electricity becomes more available.  He should consider the desirability of his experts consulting with officials of the Electricity Supply Board with reference to the elimination as far as possible of interference, which so upsets reception, particularly when the programme is good.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Briscoe complained about the amount of time given on the radio to people from the Government Benches as against speakers on the Opposition Benches.  There may be some justification for that and, in the last analysis, it is a matter for whoever is in authority to decide whose speeches are worth giving over the radio.  There are some back benchers who complain that they speak here for some time and, apart altogether from the radio, even the Press does not devote much space to them.  One might feel inclined to come to the conclusion that what has been said possibly does not carry any great weight.  There is always the possibility of a speaker repeating what has been said by another Deputy.  For instance, it would be a waste of time for Radio Éireann to report Deputy Briscoe's speech and then my speech, if I were to follow on exactly the same lines.  On the other hand, if I took a different line from Deputy Briscoe I would expect to be reported, not alone over the radio but in the Press.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe mentioned that the Minister should give some direction to people anxious to purchase a new radio.  We have heard that radio is being so developed that soon practically all the sets now in operation may be regarded as out of date.  If there is any likelihood of that happening, I think <Col N="575" /> the general public should be warned in time.  We are given to understand that, with the developments in relation to television in America, all the wireless sets we are using at the present time will soon be completely useless. If that is likely to be the position, the Department should warn people who are anxious to buy a set not to purchase an expensive one because in a short time it may not be of much value.</P>
    <P>In his opening statement the Minister referred to the practice of bringing in foreign conductors to conduct our orchestras.  Deputy Little complimented him on that policy, which was also approved by Deputy Briscoe, who spoke of the great advantage we derive from the knowledge that is brought in here by these foreign conductors. That statement conflicts somewhat with the information that has been placed at the disposal of every Deputy by the Federation of Musicians&mdash;that it is not conductors who will be imported, but musicians, which is quite a different thing.  Irish musicians are not getting a square deal.  It was admitted to be a good idea to bring in expert musicians in order to conduct orchestras and to teach our Irish musicians the technique of developing their particular art to its fullest extent.  I do not suppose anyone would object to that: Possibly that was the original idea when the first couple of musicians were brought in here.  I am inclined to think that that idea has been lost sight of because we are now bringing in musicians and not conductors.</P>
    <P>Since I did not know whether my information was or was not correct, I took the precaution during the past few days of putting down a question to the Minister asking him as to how far he proposed to proceed along that line.  Unfortunately the question was not in in sufficient time to be answered to-day.  My information was not given to me in time to enable an early reply to be given.  Possibly, the Minister may give the information for which I have asked when concluding this debate or, possibly, he may prefer to wait and give the information in reply <Col N="576" /> to my question.  Every Deputy is anxious to know what exactly the policy is with regard to the bringing in of foreign musicians.</P>
    <P>It has been said that originally some of these people were brought in as experts.  A good many of them are enjoying privileges which are not accorded to native musicians.  It has been suggested&mdash;I do not know how true the suggestion is&mdash;that foreign musicians are paid on an average £13 or £14 per week and that a certain percentage of that remuneration is free of income-tax.  On the other hand, Irish musicians, some of whom are superior to those who have been brought in, are remunerated at the rate of £8 or £9 per week and they have to pay income-tax at the ordinary rate.</P>
    <P>I said at the outset that I am not opposed to the bringing in of experts, but I am opposed to the bringing in of people, not because they are experts but because they have a high sounding name which will appeal to some of those people who sit in the broadcasting theatre and point out: &ldquo;Over there is Mr. So-and-so&rdquo;, and they spend a couple of seconds, or perhaps minutes, trying to pronounce his name. We all know the song about the wonderful musician.  &ldquo;A wonderful musician once in Germany did dwell, his name was unpronounceable, impossible to spell.&rdquo; Is that the qualification that these foreign musicians have?  If they have any outstanding qualifications, I want to know whether or not it is correct that some of them are only playing second fiddle to our Irish musicians while they are paid £4 or £5 a week more and enjoy privileges which are not accorded to our Irish musicians.  I cannot see any justification for that.  That policy is leading us nowhere.</P>
    <P>Irish musicians who were engaged as extras have had their standard of remuneration reduced.  Their condition of employment is precarious.  They see no future before them.  They have no hope of any improvement.  When the older musicians reach the retiring age they are not replaced by these extras who have been working for a considerable number of years as such.  They <Col N="577" /> are replaced by foreign musicians.  It is a rather extraordinary state of affairs and I think the position will have to be considered very seriously in the near future.</P>
    <P>The Irish musicians complain, too, that their status is being challenged by the Department.  Some time ago they felt they had a right to dictate what their position should be in the future, particularly in regard to the policy adopted of bringing in foreign musicians.  They decided that they would have to join in some federation. They approached the Department and they were told that it was a matter entirely for themselves.  They were then informed that those who were employed full-time were civil servants, but civil servants with some qualification attached to them.  The qualification was that they were full-time <i>unestablished</i> civil servants.  They were asked to decide then whether they would prefer to remain as full-time <i>unestablished</i> civil servants or whether they would prefer to have an outside organisation speaking on their behalf.  Possibly no one could object to that if the musicians employed in Radio Éireann had an opportunity of deciding for themselves.  Actually a direction was given stating that only the unestablished civil servants who were full-time could vote.  In other words, the extras could not vote.  To add insult to injury, it was also decided that the foreign musicians, numbering about 16, would have a right to vote. But the Irish musicians employed part-time would have no such right.  There may be an explanation for that.  If there is one, I would certainly like to hear it.</P>
    <P>The policy and administration of Radio Éireann appears to me to require very careful examination in this respect.  As Deputy Little said, the Radio Éireann orchestra brings joy to the hearts of our kith and kin all over the world.  I do not like the idea of an orchestra composed of nonnationals doing that.  We have changed our outlook to some extent and we feel now that we ought to be proud of our countrymen in every sphere of life. Our Irish musicians should get every encouragement.  Some system must be <Col N="578" /> adopted which will not force our musicians to look for employment elsewhere. Those who have gone to look for employment elsewhere have been accepted and are well paid.  At the same time we are bringing in people whose qualifications are actually queried by those who know.</P>
    <P>This matter requires careful consideration on the part of the Minister and his Department because it might lead to very serious consequences later on.  I do not know whether or not I am right in blaming the Minister.  Possibly he is trying to do his best.  Perhaps he is driving a machine on which the steering is locked.  There seems to be some obstacle in the way, not alone in the Minister's department but in other departments as well.  The steering will have to be broken if we are to make satisfactory progress.  It is no use trying to fool the people.  I have a particular instance in mind.  A famous musician was brought over here to conduct a band.  I had the privilege of listening to that band.  The musicians who composed the band were selected from two or three different establishments in Dublin.  I know people who listened-in to that broadcast and who were under the impression that the conductor had brought his own band. It is not right that the people should be misled like that.  The time may come when they will refuse to pay their licences.  They will then form themselves into an organisation and go into court to publicise their objection in order that serious notice will be taken of the complaints they have to make.  I had a letter last week from one of my constituents in which he referred to money which was being paid for wireless sets. Actually I do not think he was paying anything at all because he mentioned 10/- which, of course, was the fee payable some years ago.  He gave no address and I did not take any notice of it.</P>
    <P>I heard the Minister's statement last Friday in which he referred to the increase in the payments to the Performing Rights Association, an amount of £2,900.  I want to know what is the actual amount paid out, how the amount is arrived at and who arrived at <Col N="579" /> it.  I have some personal experience of the methods adopted by this organisation responsible for collecting fees on behalf of the people who compose music.  It is an organisation under the Performing Rights Society operating here and under the British régime no notice was taken of them.  Quite a number of people here had very great objection to paying that money but the organisation generally got the better of them.  Those individuals who contested it on their own did not actually go to court about it.  From my personal experience I feel that what actually happens in this society is that the governing body decide from time to time what fees organisations such as Radio Éireann, picture houses, ballrooms, etc., have to pay.  They have some system of their own of fixing the rate which is very elaborate.  They were challenged in England last year to the effect that they never took into consideration the people who had to pay. You apply for a licence to the Performing Rights Society and every licence granted is to be so much.  If that is the position, I want to suggest that the Minister should give very careful consideration to it and find out who has fixed the fee to be paid.</P>
    <P>In my constituent's letter, we had a problem of thousands of pounds paid into this organisation.  It appears to be a fact that there is an enormous amount of money, judging by the number of inquiries about licences paid into this organisation's headquarters in England.  They may have had the right to control while we were under British rule but, as everyone in this House now accepts that we are a Republic, we are a foreign country as far as they are concerned.  Without some definite authority, I do not think any organisation in London has the right to fix the fee that Radio Éireann will pay for broadcasting the music of any composer. If there is such an organisation, it will have to be and should be an organisation with a headquarters in the Irish Republic, not an organisation in a foreign country which has, or should have, no control here.  If it is another question of just carrying on the laws and regulations handed over to us by the British, one by one, they will have <Col N="580" /> to be broken.  I feel sometimes that even here in the House some people think, &ldquo;Oh yes, we have the Republic but it is only a label &mdash; a change of label.&rdquo;  If it is only a change of label it is not enough and if the people on the Front Benches are too busy, then the back benchers on both sides will have to do the talking.  Even if our talks and speeches are not sufficiently intelligent to be broadcast or published in the Press we will still make both sides of the House listen.  The label is not enough.  We have broken with Britain and we want to know how much these people are taking out of the country or what rate of interest or income-tax our Minister for Finance is able to collect from them.</P>
    <P>This organisation has spread its wings considerably in this country in the past two years.  They decided the amount of money they were getting out of the country was not sufficient and they increased it.  The amount of the increase is not 25 per cent. or 33? per cent, it is not 50 per cent., 100 or 200 per cent.  That is something which cannot be contradicted.  There is a firm who originally were paying £26 15s. 0d. for the purpose of operating this licence.  Then the licence lapsed about two years ago.  They applied last year for the renewal of the licence to the Performing Rights Society.  They got the licence and the Performing Rights Society, as they usually do, fixed the fee.  They did not say: &ldquo;We want 25 per cent. increase on £26 15s. 0d.&rdquo;  They fixed a fee of £429.  I mention this particular case in order to draw the Minister's attention and the attention of the Department to the fact that if they are paying an increased rate, on the same principle, other people are probably paying increased fees to the same extent.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to give this matter very serious consideration, to look into it, and to find out what method they have adopted and who is responsible for arranging the fees that they have to pay.  Having found that out, he should give the information to the Minister for Finance to find out why people taking so much money out of the country are not paying any income-tax. I do not oppose paying a reasonable <Col N="581" /> contribution to the authors and composers of music.  I believe they are entitled to get it but I believe that if any company is making money out of it and collecting from a Department of the Government, that Department should have a right to decide the amount or arrange who should collect the money and not allow outside organisations to do so.  I again mention that to the Minister and hope for a reasonably satisfactory explanation.  If there is no other method of dealing with this organisation, legislation will have to be, and should be, introduced here.  Again, I would remind the Minister that this is an independent country and England, where the organisation exists, is a foreign country to us and we to them.  They have no power of restriction.</P>
    <P>On the question of foreign musicians, let me again state that if they are brought in here simply as musicians to play second fiddle this system must be altered.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom ar an Meastachán seo tagairt a dhéanamh don Ghaeilge mar is mór an áis an craolachán maidir le hathbheochaint na Gaeilge.  Tá obair mhaith á dhéanamh admhuím ach ba cheart níos mó a dhéanamh faoi dhrámaíocht agus cainteanna a bheith againn an oiread agus is féidir.  Is mór an tábhar an drámaíocht chun an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn agus ba cheart na cainteoirí is fearr sa tír d'fháil chun na hoibre seo.</P>
      <P>Mar gheall ar na bollscairí a léann amach an nuacht sa Ghaeilge, ba cheart don Aire féachaint chuige go labharfaidh siad go soiléir i gcónaí mar cloisim daoine ag rá nach féidir leo iad a thuiscint uaireannta.  Tá cuid acu go han-shoiléir ach ní mar sin dóibh go léir.  Is cuma cén chanúint atái gceist, ba cheart go mbeadh na héisteoirí i ndon iad a thuiscint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Maidir leis an ceol, is dóigh liom nach gcloisimid an méid ceoil Ghaelaigh agus ba cheart ar an gcraolachán, agus ba chóir go gcloisfí níos minice é mar cuireann na daoine spéis mhór in ár gceol féin.  Is dócha nach fuiriste ceoltóirí maithe d'fáil don chraolachán. Is cuimhin liom 20 nó 25 bliain ó shoin go raibh a lán ceolteoirí dúchasacha le <Col N="582" /> fáil, píobairí, bheidleadóirí agus mar sin de.  Samhlaítear dom go bhfuil siad ann anois ach dul á lorg agus taillí oiriúnacha a thairiscint dóibh. Ba cheart, freisin, an ceol a bheith ar an sean-nós.  B'fhéidir gurb iad na táillí atá i gceist&mdash;b'fhéidir nach bhfuil na táillía tairgítear ard go leór dóibh. Táim ag cur an pointe sin ós comhair an Aire agus ag iarraidh air machnamh air.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis na bannaí céilí, is mór an trua nach gcloistear na bannaí seo níos minice agus ba cheart do na bannaí seo an ceol do sheinm ar an sean-nós. Bíonn bannaí ann anois is arís agus ligeann siad orthu go bhfuil siad ag feabhsú an cheoil le castaíocha éagsúl a chur air.  Ba cheart an ceol a sheint ar an sean-nós, an tslí in ar sheinn ár n-aithreacha agus ár máithreacha é.</P>
    <P>Molaim don Aire féachaint chuige go mbeidh níos mó cainteanna ar thalmhaíocht.  Cloisimid cainteanna anois is arís ach is dóigh liom ná bíonn go leór de sna cainteanna seo ar an gcraolachán.  Is é an talmhaíocht an t-ábhar is tábhachtaí dá bhfuil againn agus, dá bhrí sin, ba cheart níos mó cainteanna a bheith againn air.  Bíonn cur síos ar gháirdnéireacht againn uair sa tseachtain agus is maith agus is tairbheach an rud é, ach is tábhachtaí i bhfad cainteanna ar thalmhaíocht a bheith againn.

B'fhéidir gurb <Col N="583" /> amhlaidh is fearr é&mdash;ní fheadar&mdash;ach mar sin féin bíonn fonn ar an lucht éisteachta a fháil amach cad a bhíonn ar súil sa Dáil agus cad iad na rudaí a deireann na Teachtaí maidir leis na nithe a bhíonn ag déanamh buartha do mhuintir na tíre.</P>
    <P>Anois labharfad cúpla focal Béarla.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to repeat what I said in the Irish language because I do not think that repetition from one language to another is altogether permissible. But, among other things, I was referring to Irish traditional music and I said that I considered we do not get enough of that on the radio.  When I mention Irish traditional music, I shall have to make a distinction between ceili bands and individual instrumental music.  In both cases I think that we have not enough of that music.  We used to get more of that music some time ago but, so far as I am concerned, I was never satisfied with the amount of ceili music and Irish traditional music which came over the radio.  I do not know what the cause of it is, whether there is a dearth of Irish traditional musicians or whether these people, if they are there, consider the fee which is being paid too small.  In any case, the fact remains that we do not hear enough of Irish traditional music.</P>
    <P>Sometimes also we hear musicians rendering Irish traditional airs and Irish dance music and they do not seem to be up to the mark.  I do not know whether there is a stiff test applied nowadays or not.  There used to be a fairly stiff test.  But, if we are to have Irish traditional music, we should have the very best, if we can. We should be all-out to popularise and spread our native Irish music and the only way to do that it to get the best Irish musicians that we can find.  It would be a good thing if somebody from the Minister's Department would go down the country and search for talent as regards Irish traditional music.  The talent must be there.  The best place to find it is where the language is still spoken or in places adjacent to the Gaeltacht.  It is very important that we should hear our own traditional music often on the wireless <Col N="584" /> and that what we hear of it is the very best.</P>
    <P>I am afraid we do not hear enough of ceili bands either.  So far as I know, the people in the country attach more importance to these ceili bands than they do to any other kind of band.  Even people outside the country listen in to ceili music, but I am afraid they very seldom hear it. The Minister should make an effort to provide us with more ceili music and, as I have mentioned, the very best of it.</P>
    <P>A short time ago I listened in to a ceili band and was not at all pleased with the performance.  It was supposed to have some harmonisation of Irish traditional music and, so far as my opinion goes, that so-called harmonisation destroyed the music.  The Minister and his Department should see to it that no ceili bands of that description come into the studio or, if they do, they should be thrown out on the top of their heads with their fiddles and bows.  I hate to hear any musician or any band destroy good Irish traditional music.  The way to play Irish traditional music is the way in which our forefathers played it, without any unnatural frills.</P>
    <P>I also referred to the need for agricultural talks on the radio.  It is very important that agricultural matters should be dealt with from time to time. We do get talks on agricultural matters now and again on the radio, but we do not get them often enough.  We get a weekly talk on gardening, which is very good and very instructive, and I do not see any reason why we should not have weekly talks on agriculture as well.  It is a matter to which the Minister should give consideration.</P>
    <P>Sin a bhfuil agam le rá, is dóigh liom.  Tá súil agam go gcuimneoidh an tAire ar na pointí a luas agus go mbeidh leigheas le fáil ar chuid de na gearánta a rinneas.  Maidir le Gaeilge, tá obair mhór, an-obair, le déanamh fós chun labhairt na Gaeilge a chur chun cinn agus ní heol dom aon áis is fearr chuige sin ná an craolachán agus mar gheall air sin táim ar iarraidh ar an Aire an oiread spáis agus is féidir a thabhairt do chainteanna as <Col N="585" /> Gaeilge.  Is é athbheochaint na teangan an obair is tábhachtaí agus is deacra atá le déanamh againn chun go mbeidh an tír seo in a náisiún ceart.  Chuige sin, tá sé de dhualgas ar an Rialtas, pé Rialtas a bheidh i réim, na huirlísí atá féna smacht a chur ag obair ar son na Gaeilge agus is é an craolachán an úirlis is mó le rá dhíobh san go léir.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoderickJamesConnoll" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Kissane has made a very reasoned presentation of his case.  He has the advantage of being musically inclined and musically equipped.  He is able to talk with a certain amount of authority on the aspect of the question to which he directed his attention.  I must, however, preface my remarks by saying that I labour under a disadvantage, not being, not pretending to be, an authority upon any matters musical. My references in this speech to questions of the orchestra and organisation of Radio Éireann on a musical basis are second-hand.  I have no firsthand knowledge of these matters.  I think, however, it is my duty as a Deputy to relate to the Minister some of the opinions, as far as I am able to comprehend them, that agitate certain musical circles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kissane quite rightly referred to the necessity of continuing a search for Irish talent &mdash; in one particular direction.  That search should be extended.  There has been in operation under the Department's organisation a mobile unit.  I understand that this unit did fairly good work with regard to searching out local talent which naturally enough has always a far higher opinion of its own standards and accomplishments, than might be held by others more competent to judge the issue.  While the mobile unit did very effective work in some respects in giving encouragement to singers and other musicians in the different parts they visited, in some cases, I understand, they left an impression behind them that some of those to whom they gave an audience would receive further opportunities for having their voice or their music on the air.  There must be a long time-lag between the making of these promises and their effective carrying out.  To give a specific case, there is <Col N="586" /> in Dundalk a fairly promising singer by name Seán MacManus, a young factory worker, who received kind consideration from the mobile unit.  He was put on the air and that was a very considerable encouragement to him for which the organisers of the mobile unit deserve quite good credit. This, however, should be followed up by a fairly quick decision in many of these cases, kind words of advice as to further improvement or the necessity for further training, or if promises have been made that actual broadcast engagements would be given these promises should be honoured.</P>
    <P>It is a very important thing, I think, that the Minister in this country should act as the patron of the musical arts. He himself may suffer from the same disability as I do.  He may be as non-musical as I am, but still he has a duty to the country to foster musical art and to encourage the young aspirants to develop their talent and make it possible for them to continue the high repute Irish singers and musicians have throughout the world.  That can only be done by the extension of the functions of that mobile unit, by continuing auditions for the different types of musicians, those who go to build up orchestras and the list of people who are able to provide musical entertainment on the air.  How true it is I am not in a position to state because I have very little time myself to listen in to Radio Éireann, but the opinion in the country among musical circles is that there exists in Dublin a small group of musicians and singers who have a practical monopoly of the air, that they have unfair preference in the matter of time and that they receive too many and too frequent engagements to the exclusion of competent musicians, singers and other entertainers down the country who have not such immediate access to the powers that be in Broadcasting House.  If there is any substance in that complaint it certainly should be remedied. The Minister as far as patronage is involved, should extend it over the widest possible field.  The only way many of these musicians, entertainers and singers down the country can establish their position in reasonable time and without the great labours involved <Col N="587" /> for some of their predecessors in the arts is to obtain engagements in Radio Éireann.  Engagements in Radio Éireann are looked upon as very high prizes for which these people are willing to undertake very severe work and training so that they may be qualified to go on the air.  Therefore I think the Minister should investigate this complaint as to whether there is or is not a group in Dublin who have a monopoly of the air.</P>
    <P>With regard to the general position of Radio Éireann, there would appear to be a necessity for further capital expenditure.  There would appear to be a necessity for further expenditure of State funds on its equipment.  It was designed for certain limited fields but, with the growth of our broadcasting and with the growth of our needs over the air, we certainly should look to many of the technical points that appear to require revision at this stage.  I have reports from many of my friends on the east coast of England, and in London and in Great Britain generally, that reception of Athlone is very poor and in some cases non-existent.  The Minister can understand the importance of having the widest possible reception area for Radio Éireann at the present time&mdash; particularly in so far as Great Britain is concerned.  That may involve very heavy expenditure and it may require long consideration.</P>
    <P>However, there are other matters to which the Minister might direct his attention and which would not require anything like the expenditure that might be envisaged in the technical reequipment of the Station generally. There is, I understand, a very poor standard of equipment in the studios generally.  They could be brought up to date and without a very high rate of expenditure.  I understand that the studios themselves are poorly ventilated and are, generally speaking, very inferior compared with studios in other stations.  The atmosphere in studios is oppressive at the best of times to the artists, musicians, speakers and those other people who have to use them.  In this modern age, with all the scientific apparatus that is at our disposal, it <Col N="588" /> appears to be unnecessarily crude and cruel that artists should suffer under such conditions.  We cannot, in these circumstances, expect their best from them.  If the State is paying their fees the State is responsible for giving them the best conditions so that they may give the very best of their talents and of their arts to the listeners who have paid for their broadcasting licences.</P>
    <P>A lot could be said about the organisation of the orchestra itself.  I believe that in that connection, too, there are many defects that might be remedied by the Minister.  The Minister has taken quite a lot of interest in the matter.  He has listened to representations on most of the points that I have raised very briefly but he should carry his interest further by implementing some of the ideas that have been presented to him.  I understand that this orchestra of ours is unique in many respects among modern orchestras.  Most of these respects are negative respects.  There is in Radio Éireann no manager for the proper management of the orchestra.  For orchestras of the size of our orchestra there is necessity for a full-time manager.  That manager would have many functions.  I need not go into the details but it will surprise most of us to hear that there is no manager for a staff of the demensions of this orchestra staff.  The manager, in addition to his ordinary managerial functions, has also a diplomatic function which might promote a great deal more harmony and goodwill in the Radio Éireann orchestra than appears to exist at present.  He should come as a buffer, to some extent, between the members of the orchestra, the conductors and the other authorities who come into contact with these members in different respects.</P>
    <P>There is, further, no full-time librarian attached to the orchestra. That is another post which should be filled.  With the growth and development of the orchestra it has become a necessity to have such a post.  When the orchestra was small, in the more youthful stage of its development, that post used to be a part-time post.  The work could then be done by some member of the orchestra but, I understand, <Col N="589" /> that now it involves such duties that a full-time official could easily fill that post and be very well occupied.</P>
    <P>Of still greater importance than either of these two points is the fact that we do not appear to have what these musically knowledgeable gentlemen call a balance and control officer. The function of this officer is a very important one.  The lack of such an officer, musically educated, may in many cases&mdash;and has done, I understand&mdash;destroyed completely the full effects of very fine artistic renderings. This balance and control officer who not only be a technical officer who understands the electronic part of the business but he should be one who is musically trained.  He must be a musician.  He must be able to follow the score and relate the output of the station to the variations in the musical score.  If that is not done&mdash;if he has no understanding of the amount of emphasis or accent or tone that should be given&mdash;then it is quite obvious that the very best rendering of the song or of any musical composition could be destroyed by his handling of the various gadgets or controls that release the volume of sound to the listeners.</P>
    <P>The orchestra, as a whole, is mixed in its composition.  There are both native musicians and foreign musicians in it.  The question actually arises then as to whether the proportion between these is correct&mdash;whether our native musicians are encouraged and whether the best use is being made of the foreign musicians who are at present engaged in the orchestra.  I am not by any means averse to the employment of foreign musicians.  I think that if a proper balance is kept up it should be a permanent feature of not only this orchestra but of any orchestra in any country.  Theoretically, I think it is correct because music is one of the international arts and there should be interchange and exchange of the competent musicians of different countries.  However, we in this House &mdash;apart from our musical or lack of musical prejudices&mdash;have the right and the duty to see that our native musicians are encouraged.  It is said that there is a lack of instrumentalists of various kinds who are required to <Col N="590" /> keep the orchestra up to strength but there does not appear to be sufficient attention given to attracting these musicians to the orchestra &mdash; to give them auditions and to give them places on the orchestra.</P>
    <P>I should like to know something in detail about the composition of the orchestra and perhaps the Minister will be kind enough to answer my question.  I understand from those who are in a position to know that the average age of the members of our orchestra is extremely high compared with the average age of the members of other orchestras.  On that point I wish to be enlightened.  The Minister might inform the House as to the number of instrumentalists in his orchestra who are over 60, who are over 65 and who are over 70.  He might, further, tell us the average age of the members of this orchestra and how that average age compares with the average age of members of other orchestras.</P>
    <P>This leads me to a reconsideration of the pension position.  There would appear to be no valid reason for the retention, on the orchestra, of those who like all of us at a certain time reach an age when we are beyond our labour.  There are doubts expressed as to whether a certain section of the orchestra could not be improved by the introduction of younger blood.  The Minister's position, I know, is extremely difficult in reference to what will be done with this, but if a generous pension scheme, or a more generous scheme than that which exists at present were worked out the position in relation to that question might be made much easier.</P>
    <P>In reference to the work and the organisations of the orchestra there are complaints that the members of the orchestra are worked too much like civil servants.  We can all have sympathy with the members of the orchestra who are artistes and are not like ordinary human beings.  They are very temperamental in their outlook and their mode of work.  They are capable of excessive and highly sustained efforts for a short period, and then may not be inclined to follow the ordinary humdrum routine for a considerable time thereafter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="591" /> I know it is very difficult, from the point of view of the Department, to organise the work of the orchestra, but the system that obtains at present appears to be unsatisfactory as far as their positions are concerned.  Their hours of work are too long.  They are worked in excess of the hours that should be applicable to people of their talents and of their position in the musical world.  I would like the Minister to investigate that question. He is, I know, very sympathetic on this matter.  He would not, I think, like to be unfair to the orchestra, and yet he would like that proper value should be given by the members of it for the remuneration that they obtain from the State.  I hope the Minister will look into that matter and examine it, and so it may be possible to obtain a solution which will be agreeable both to the musicians and their organisation on the one hand and the departmental heads on the other.</P>
    <P>In reference to musicians of foreign birth who are here, I should like the Minister to tell us whether there is any obligation on them to impart their skill and technique to native musicians, whether it has been made part of their contract that they should do a certain amount of teaching, or whether they are here just as instrumentalists to do their work and then depart.  I think that, if we want to develop the musical art in this country, we should have the best foreign musicians.  We should take them and treat them in the very best manner and give them the highest remuneration that we can possibly afford, but we should make it a duty on their part to do a certain amount of teaching so that in due course our musicians will be brought up to the standard which they themselves are able to exhibit at present.</P>
    <P>The same consideration arises in reference to conductors who have been employed by Radio Eireann.  I have no objection, and I am sure very few members of the House who have any cultural outlook at all have any objection, to the employment of foreign conductors for a limited period to do a certain line of work.  The only objection there could be, I think, would be <Col N="592" /> on the basis that I have already made in reference to the instrumentalists. These foreign conductors, if they are to be employed by us, should be of first-class quality.  I understand that, from time to time we have had foreign conductors of very inferior class.  Criticism has been made that some of them are third rate, or even lower than that. That is not good enough.  Some of those foreign conductors are held in the highest degree in their own country. They are internationally recognised, and have cast a certain amount of credit on Radio Éireann and on Radio Éireann orchestra by acting as conductors to it, but that does not apply to all those who have been employed.</P>
    <P>I submit, of course, that it is possible to make a mistake.  It is not always possible to get musicians of the first water, but, as far as possible, the foreign conductors should be of the highest standing in their own country, and the Minister should be prepared to make the fees and the conditions of employment attractive enough to secure for us the services of the best conductors in foreign countries.  At the same time, there should be an obligation on them, while they are here, to train some of our young Irish conductors, to impart to them the knowledge that they themselves have acquired.  I think that most of them would be delighted to do so, and would consider it an honour to act as instructors. These young conductors. our native conductors, should be given an opportunity of doing work under these high-class foreign conductors.  I think it is a valid criticism to say that the Department is not over-generous in reference to the employment of Irish conductors.  They are not given a sufficient opportunity of earning their daily bread by music.  Their engagements are very haphazard.  They are given a few concerts at very extended intervals and under conditions which would not apply to the more high-class foreign conductors.  They labour under disadvantages that we would not think of compelling foreign conductors to labour under.  That is a matter that can be remedied, and I suggest to the Minister who is sympathetically inclined, to take steps to remedy it.  I have indicated some of the offices that <Col N="593" /> should be filled in a properly equipped modern orchestra, and I think the Minister could find some of the younger conductors who might fill these offices while they are studying and preparing to become conductors.  No one will expect these younger conductors of ours, no matter what their musical talents may be, to get the best out of the orchestra when they are given fewer rehearsals, as I understand is the case, than the more seasoned and experienced foreign conductors.  If anything, it should be the other way about.  They should be given sufficient encouragement and the greatest possible latitude to build up their work and, in addition, every opportunity should be given them of keeping close to the musical field by earning their living some way or other in relation to music.  If there is any way, directly within the orchestra, or indirectly, by which the Minister can assist them, as the patron of the art of music, the Minister should do so.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the case which should be examined by the Minister, that is, the question of the resumption of public concerts which were a delight to the public, which were very popular and which, for some reason or another, best known to the Department, have been abandoned. The value of these public concerts is considerable.  Not only are they of great value and interest to the public generally but they are a check upon the orchestra, on the conductors and on the organisation of Radio Éireann because the public is the best judge. If they do not like a concert or do not like the programme that is planned for their enjoyment, they will not patronise the concert.  They will not pay their money.  In that way, there is an effective guide and an effective judge and a restriction, if the type of music offered is inferior or not sufficiently popular and an inducement and encouragement where the organisation of the concert and the programme merit the public's endorsement.</P>
    <P>The Minister might supply us with some of the figures in reference to the concerts to let us see whether there is any valid excuse for their abandonment or not.  It has been held that the <Col N="594" /> last series of concerts was a financial flop.  If that is so, we are entitled to have some of the figures over a number of years to see what was the position. Some of the concerts, I understand, were a financial success.  Others were the reverse.  If we had the figures, we would be in a position to judge what type of concert and what type of organiser was the more acceptable to the public.  Even if there were a financial loss on some of these concerts, the Department should be able to stand that loss.  I do not think the loss would be very excessive.  There are large sections of the public who, from time to time, would like to see the orchestra in action.  They have listened to the orchestra perhaps quite often.  They may be very good instrumentalists themselves and they would like actually to see the performers.  These public concerts give them an opportunity of doing that.  They give those who are really interested, who are interested enough to pay money to gratify their desire, to see the orchestra in action.</P>
    <P>These concerts, I believe, were introduced by Captain Michael Bowles, who was one of the conductors of Radio Éireann.  Some of the concerts under his baton were quite successful.  I would urge the Minister to consider sympathetically the question of resuming the public concerts for the delight of the public.</P>
    <P>I mentioned Captain Michael Bowles. I might say that around him in Dublin musical circles there appears to be quite an amount of talk, at least, or friction or conflict of one from or another.  Into this I do not propose to go.  As the Minister knows, and I know, many of these musicians are very highly temperamental and they are probably beyond our competence as ordinary human beings to understand. There have been difficulties between Captain Bowles and the authorities in the Department, between the Civil Service and between, perhaps, fellow musicians.  There have been difficult passages at times but, while we should not ignore these things, while we should not try to smother them or pretend they do not exist, the Minister has a duty to solve these difficulties and to utilise whatever talent lies in this country, to utilise the abilities of a <Col N="595" /> conductor of the quality of Captain Michael Bowles to the best advantage of the country and to his own best advantage.  The Minister has that duty to perform.  He has, I think, gone to the other extreme compared with the ex-Minister.</P>
    <P>The ex-Minister, as far as I can gather from those who are interested in Radio Éireann and the orchestra, was too apt to interfere, correctly or incorrectly is immaterial to me.  He considered himself a judge of music. He considered himself competent to deal with musical matters.  That, perhaps, led him unduly to interfere in the organisation of the orchestra and what they might do and unduly to influence them, perhaps, in what he considered was the best fare to give the public. That may be open to criticism.  It may be a good thing or it may be the reverse.  I am not saying it is one or the other.  It is immaterial to my argument at the moment.  Now it appears that the present Minister is going in the opposite direction and that though he may have real sympathy with the case and the various aspects of the organisation of the orchestra, the question of the conductors and the instrumentalists and all that, and the very technical difficulties that exist there, he does not appear to be giving the amount of interest to it that would be required of a Minister.  Too much indifference may be as bad as too much interference.  The Minister should take a more kindly interest.  He has taken an interest, I want it to be understood, in the affairs of the orchestra but it is not evident to many people who are in the orchestra or to those who are interested in it or to the wide circle around the orchestra that the Minister is as interested in it as is actually the case.  He should give greater prominence to his own interest in these matters.</P>
    <P>I may have said many things which were not very constructive.  I explained to the Minister in the beginning, and I reiterate, that what I have given to him I have given as a duty, second-hand, as I can speak from no personal experience of these matters and no trained knowledge of music.  To that extent, what I have said is merely a <Col N="596" /> recital to the Minister of the views of those whom I have attempted, very inefficiently, to interpret to him to-day.</P>
    <P>There is one matter on which I might make a constructive suggestion, to finish this contribution of mine.  It is in a field where I am more at home. The question of the value of the broadcasting station as a propagandist agency arises.  It might consume quite a considerable amount of our time, but I want to put only this one aspect of it before the Minister.  We wish as Irishmen, anxious to obtain the unity of our country and to extend the jurisdiction of our Republic, to attract the greatest attention to Radio Éireann, to our broadcasting agency.  It is essential, I think, that we should make our broadcasts more attractive to the people of the North.  I submit that we do not give sufficient attention to the matter of directing the beam of our subject matter to the North.  It could be quite easily effected by a Northern News item, or a news time could be worked out which would attract the attention of those in the North.  We have the ordinary news item which covers most of the affairs in the South, but it is surely possible that, with correspondents in the North, we could have a late news item or a news service, for half an hour or so, which would give prominence to events in the North&mdash;not necessarily of a propagandist nature.  Ordinary everyday events may be broadcast, somewhat on the style, though with a different slant and a different object, of the B.B.C. Northern News Service.  They have these Regional News Services and, to my mind, this would be a very effective means of bringing the attention of the people of the North to Athlone and Radio Éireann.  If it is said that they are already fully keyed up to listening to Radio Éireann, then we owe them some return, by giving them special news items or by reporting special events in the North, even if it is only a report of the Twelfth of July Celebrations. Even that might figure well in a Northern News item.  We might give it an entirely different slant, or we might exhibit it in a way that it has not been exhibited before, though that might be a very contentious matter. Seriously, however, there are items of <Col N="597" /> importance from day to day and from week to week, occurring in the North, that receive scant attention from Radio Eireann, which is too concerned with events here in the South and does not throw its eye over the whole of Ireland, as it might well do.  In conclusion, therefore, I would ask the Minister seriously to consider the advisability of incorporating in the programme at some time suitable to the North a special Northern News edition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. John Lynch Mr. John Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. John Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two statements made by the last speaker with which I find myself very much in agreement.  Since the second observation is more present to my mind, I would like to support him now and bear him out in what he has said about treating the Northern people as part of our own nation.  If there is one matter in which we can ignore the existence of the Border, it is in the matter of the radio.  I would not be too keen on creating special Northern broadcasts but I would include in our broadcasts a certain amount of the Northern slant. In the same way as we deal with aspects of life and culture in Connaught and Munster, I would include similar aspects of life, as we see them, in the North.  I believe that already many Northern people, not necessarily what we describe as nationalists, listen to Radio Éireann; but there is scope for an even greater listening public north of the Border.  In the North, they have a certain tradition for different brands of Irish music, and I suggest that, by including some of their own peculiar music, racy of the northern counties, even in that manner we could attract more Northern listeners and treat them, not as subjects of a different nation, but as our own, which we always hold they are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other matter on which I find myself in agreement with him is that of the artists, musical and otherwise, in the immediate vicinity of Dublin, forming the wave length of Radio Éireann.  With the concentration of broadcasts in the Dublin station, it is only natural that musicians, singers and actors get far greater opportunities in Dublin than they do all over the country.  Last year I advocated greater use of the station in Cork, even <Col N="598" /> to the extent of providing an alternative programme.  Either in his opening statement or in his reply last year, the Minister said he, too, was interested in that, but that there were two main considerations affecting it&mdash;one was power and the other was money.  As far as I know, the Cork station is not used, even at present, to the limit of its power.  Since I came into the House, I have not had the same opportunity of listening to the radio as I had before I became a Deputy, but even before that I thought the Cork station was not used sufficiently at all.  As a Cork Deputy, I naturally will not agree that the talent outside of Cork is in any way superior to that inside, but I do maintain that there are programmes which were popular throughout the country, which were broadcast from Cork and for some reason or another they are not being broadcast at the moment or at least with the same frequency.</P>
    <P>For instance, there are the Cork Melody Makers.  That might be completely outside the power of the radio authorities in Dublin, but nevertheless it is their duty to provide the listening public with alternative programmes, if those already on the air are not available. I think I am right in saying&mdash;I speak subject to correction&mdash;that at least on one occasion during the year the Cork station was used to provide an alternative programme for some period of time, simultaneous with the programme being broadcast from Dublin. I was not listening to it, but I have a recollection of reading the radio programme one day and I saw a programme advertised from Cork and Dublin at the same time.  That is a thing that could be developed to a much greater degree.  I realise there is a certain limitation in the matter of power and it is grossly unfair, with a radio station which has been in operation for practically 25 years in this country, that the quota of time or power&mdash;the strength of the station&mdash; should be almost exactly the same still. If there is a remedy, and if therein lies an opportunity for extending our pro gramme and providing the people with an alternative programme, it should be followed up without delay, and with <Col N="599" /> all the available influence the Minister can muster.</P>
    <P>At present there is a very good complement of artists in Radio Éireann and some of them are natives of Cork. They contribute regularly to the programme. I suggest that these artists would much prefer to work in their own home town.  For years we have been listening to a lot of talk about buying a single ticket to Dublin.  It is not for the love of Dublin that Cork people come here.  They are much happier in their native city.  By providing a sufficiency of alternative programmes in the Cork station we will have the means of keeping these young artists at home in Cork.  Even now their loss has been felt by the local theatres.  I can say with conviction that if these young men had an opportunity of earning in Cork what few pounds they get from Radio Éireann in Dublin, I have no doubt as to the course they would take.</P>
    <P>For some time we have been listening to a discussion on accommodation. Last year the Minister rightly pointed out that any alternative accommodation would necessarily mean interference with the building of houses and hospitals.  I take it the building of houses and hospitals will always be an necessity.  The administration of a country must be taken as a whole and if we are not prepared to advance the cultural side as well as the social and health sides, we are not really doing our duty by the people.  I urge the Minister to consider more seriously the provision of alternative accommodation for Radio Éireann both here and in Cork and if eventually he can see his way to establish a station in the West or some other part of the country, he should do his utmost.</P>
    <P>There is one special item which I would like to mention.  I refer to the hospitals' request programme on Wednesday afternoons.  That programme should be extended.  Week after week when I get home to lunch I am able to listen to this programme and I hear the announcer sometimes apologising to people for not being able to play their request record.  If these people could get an hour or so extra in the week, the broadcasting authorities <Col N="600" /> would be doing a useful service, not only to the poor people in hospitals, but to the nation.</P>
    <P>It might be possible to extend the hours in Radio Éireann.  In most parts of the country people do not get the daily papers until rather late in the day.  There was a suggestion made last year that there should be a short news service or a weather forecast in the morning.  I hope the Minister will treat that subject sympathetically and have a broadcast between 9 and 10 or 9 and 9.30 in the mornings.  Such a service would give the farmers the benefit of a weather forecast and there might be a short news summary.  Most people listen to the B.B.C. home service at 8 o'clock for the news or to the alternative programme at 9 o'clock. I have listened to certain items of Irish news which did not get the slant that I thought was fair and just.  They treated the matter with a certain amount of dispassionate indifference. I will not say it was through any malice, but they did not give the correct resumé of whatever event occurred, either in the Dáil or in some other part of the country.  The Minister should consider this matter seriously, particularly in view of the fact that the time and strength of the station are practically the same as in 1926 when the radio was instituted here.</P>
    <P>There were certain charges made last year about the use of the radio for political purposes.  I accept the Minister's statement without reservation that, so far as he was concerned, there was no authorisation or direction to the employees of Radio Éireann to put any particular political bias or colour on any announcement they were making. I listened to a broadcast some months ago.  I thought there was a certain bias put on the announcement made on that occasion in connection with the passing of the Republic of Ireland Act in this House.  On the passing of that measure there was really no issue between one side of the House and the other except possibly one, and that was the constitutional situation as obtaining at the time of the passing of that Act.  It could all be resolved down to this, whether or not our status at the time was truly republican or not.  For years I have <Col N="601" /> read and listened to statements about the confusion created in the public mind, while supporters of the then Government maintained that there was no confusion whatever, that they accepted the Republican Constitution of 1937 for what it was.</P>

      <P>My lead-up is practically finished.  There was a question at issue as to what was our status before the introduction of the Bill.  I listened to a commentator from Radio Éireann. I assumed he was a paid commentator.  I remembered his name, having heard it frequently.  I dislike anybody attacking an individual without that individual having an opportunity to reply, and for that reason it is not by way of an attack on this particular individual that I make this statement.  I suggest that that statement was a subjective treatment of the situation as it obtained at that time.  The radio and whatever additions may accrue therefrom are the property of the people as a whole.  The people who are employed in broadcasting and in its subsidiary adjuncts are also employees of the public and are paid out of public funds.  I suggest that any treatment of any news item, political or otherwise, should be purely objective and not subjective, as I insist this particular item was.</P>
      <P>The present Government have used the radio liberally as a means of addressing the public and as a means of informing the public on particular schemes they are putting into operation. I have no serious objection to that.  I do know from my own experience that the Fianna Fáil Government did not use it to the same extent.</P>

      <P>I do not know why Deputy O'Higgins should say &ldquo;Oh&rdquo; in <Col N="602" /> such a tone of voice.  I think there can be no doubt at all that when drainage schemes were opened by Fianna Fáil, such as the Brosna drainage scheme, there was no blowing of trumpets, no sounding of horns, or blowing of whistles such as we are entertained with now.  I ask the Minister and his colleagues in the Government to realise that in this particular respect, too, the radio is the property of the people and not the property of the Government in power.  I appeal to the Minister and the Government to use it with more discrimination and to ensure that matters, particularly matters of political import, are treated objectively and not subjectively as was done on the occasion to which I have referred.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Consideration of the subject matters of this Estimate falls into three heads. In the broadcasting service and in the radio there is available to us a national propaganda vehicle and a means of stiffening and strengthening morale <Col N="603" /> second to none.  I do not know whether sufficient consideration has been given to that aspect of the broadcasting service in the Estimate so far.  I would like to hear from the Minister when he is concluding that a fuller, greater and more effective use will be made of Radio Éireann for the strengthening of our national morale, for the revival of the Irish language in order to make it once more the spoken language of our people, and for putting the Irish case and the Irish point of view and the Irish outlook before the people of the world.</P>
    <P>Deputies have concerned themselves mainly in the course of this debate&mdash; quite properly, I am sure&mdash;with consideration of the radio as a service provided for the people.  I think it is only fair to say that for the most part the Minister is entitled to the congratulations of the House for the manner in which, generally speaking, this branch of his Department has been conducted. The same difficulties were enumerated this year as were mentioned by him last year and it would be ungenerous and unfair to expect that these difficulties should disappear by merely waving a wand.</P>
    <P>I think many Deputies and the majority of the listening public outside apply a completely wrong yardstick and completely wrong standards in their assessment of the value of the entertainment given in the programmes broadcast by Radio Éireann.  Let us be sensible about this and get it into our heads that it is not within our compass or within our power to provide a service comparable to that provided by the B.B.C. From the inquiries I have made from people connected with the radio both in this country and in other countries I am satisfied that the service provided by Radio Éireann does compare favourably in the main with the service provided by other small continental countries.  I do not think we should expect too much.</P>
    <P>I think we should aim at a standard of uniform excellence in what we attempt or undertake.  I think that in many respects a high and very excellent standard has been achieved. I think I mentioned this in the Estimate last year and I make no <Col N="604" /> apology for repeating this year that in the realm of drama Radio Éireann compares very favourably with everything that I have ever heard from the B.B.C. Certainly, a great tribute is due both to actors and producers. Perhaps one of the causes of it is that there has been a marked improvement since the introduction of the repertory system which, I think, was introduced by the Minister's predecessor.  I think that was a step in the right direction although many people at the time, from a purely selfish point of view, regarded it as an unfair method of recruiting actors and felt that it was unduly hard on the part-time actor.  The results have shown that the recruitment of the repertory company, of whole-time producers, of whole-time actors, has, in the light of experience, proved successful.</P>
    <P>Payment of radio artistes has been improved.  I am not satisfied that all the salaries paid are even yet adequate, but inasmuch as an advance has been made I would not feel justified in being unduly critical of the Minister.  Let me say in passing, however, that I think some cause for complaint has been given to certain members of the symphony orchestra, not alone with reference to the rate of salary paid to them but I think they have some reasonable complaint in the restriction of their right to organise in a union for their own protection.  I think that is a matter that the Minister should re-examine because I am not satisfied that Radio Eireann is on completely solid ground in the line that they are taking.</P>
    <P>In any criticism of the services given to listeners by Radio Éireann regard must be had, particularly if one is to compare them with the B.B.C. programme, to the comparative expenditures. I understand the B.B.C. average in cost per hour over a yearly period is as high as £120 to £130 per broadcasting hour in artistes' salaries alone.  It is impossible for us to aim at anything as high as that; regard must be had to that fact.</P>
    <P>I should like to endorse what I think Deputy Connolly said about the resumption of the symphony orchestra concerts.  I notice in the Estimate a <Col N="605" /> reduction for the proposed travelling expenses of the orchestra.  It is not a matter on which I feel very strongly, but I would suggest to the Minister that it is a step in the wrong, rather than in the right, direction.  The centralising of all cultural influences, just as industry is centralised and as Government Departments are centralised, in Dublin is not a healthy sign of the national life and I think, if it were possible, an impetus should be given to cultural activity in cities.  Two spring to mind immediately, Cork and Sligo, both of them with a great musical tradition.  I think it is a pity that an impetus cannot be given to the desire for development of music, the desire of music lovers to hear good music played, by allowing the symphony orchestra to travel as was originally anticipated.</P>
    <P>I should like to endorse also what Deputy Lynch said in connection with the morning news broadcasts.  I do not know whether there would be very serious technical difficulties in the way. Certainly, if it is possible for the Minister to consider that at all, I think it is a service that should be provided for listeners and certainly one that would be appreciated.  There are many of us whose only opportunity of listening to Radio Éireann is, say, at mealtimes, and if it was possible to have a morning news broadcast it would be a valuable service for the listening public.  The Minister did not mention anything in that connection in his opening speech.  I do not know what consideration has been given to the possibility of hours of broadcasting up to 12.  Presumably, when he is concluding we shall hear something from him in that respect.</P>
    <P>The question of a second programme is one which is ventilated in this House annually.  I do not know that there is much to be said on it except to say to the Minister that it is highly desirable if it is possible.  Frankly, I believe it should be possible.  I believe that it would be worth while even to make a start in a small way with a limited number of hours' broadcasting. The Minister referred to the increased amount of variety and lighter entertainment that has been provided on Radio Éireann during the last few <Col N="606" /> months.  I am quite prepared to concede to the Minister that that is probably all to the good.  At the same time, I think it is highly desirable that people who want a different type of programme should have some provision made for them by the type of second programme that was envisaged. I think it is only fair to say also that the Minister, in so far as they have been pointed out to him and in so far as it has been possible within the limits of the money available, has made very definite improvements, as indeed, did his predecessor.</P>
    <P>The history of the development of radio in this country has been one of continual progress.  One does not need to be very old to think back to the time when we were all attempting to make little crystal sets in cigar boxes and listening in with headphones.  After all, that is only a comparatively few years ago.  One of the few things I used my hands successfully on was in an attempt to make a crystal set. There has been a continual progress. My exhortation to the Minister is to see to it that that progress continues. One of the next steps he should take is to initiate even a very limited number of hours' broadcasting in a second programme.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lynch, when he was dealing with this Estimate, criticised the news broadcast of Radio Éireann.  He criticised it for its lack of objectivity. I do not want to join issue with Deputy Lynch.  I did not, I think, hear the broadcast to which he referred.  I would merely make this rejoinder to him, that in any news broadcasts from Radio Éireann during the past 12 or 18 months there has been a far greater objectivity than there was in the paeons of adulation that came over the ether during the period when the Minister's predecessor was in office.</P>
    <P>Last, but not least, I should like to refer to the short-wave station. Deputies on the benches opposite were very critical of the Clann na Poblachta Party during the debate on this Estimate last year.  They took us to task, and Deputy Lemass, in the colums of the <i>Irish Press</i> on a Wednesday morning, under the pseudonym of &ldquo;a Dáil Reporter&rdquo;, took us to task because we, <Col N="607" /> as alleged, acquiesced in the scrapping of the short-wave station.  We in this Party were vehemently opposed to the scrapping of the short-wave station but we had a little more influence with the Minister than Deputy Lemass or Deputy Little believed at the time, because we got from the Minister an assurance that that project of a short-wave radio station would not be abandoned but would be postponed.  We were charged on that occasion with political dishonesty, with not merely looking for a way out, but a way to save our faces.  Well, I hope that Deputies opposite will admit now that we were not saving our faces, that we were not looking for a way out, and that we did succeed in saving the short-wave station.</P>

      <P>Bacon is not a subject that should be mentioned from the opposite benches.  One final matter. I believe that the Minister is prepared to give all facilities for broadcasts in the Irish language from Radio Éireann but I would urge on the Minister that it is his duty to adopt a more positive policy.  All Parties in this House, or sections of all Parties in this house I should say, pay lip service to the ideal of reviving the Irish language as the spoken language of the country.  In Radio Éireann is the ideal vehicle and method of doing it.  In Radio Éireann is the ideal vehicle and method of developing a standard Irish, an Irish not unduly influenced by dialects.  In Radio Éireann is the ideal vehicle for bringing home to the people the necessity for reviving the language as the spoken language of the country. I would urge on the Minister that he should take more positive steps in that regard.  I understand there has been difficulty in getting suitable programmes for broadcasting in Irish.  If that difficulty has existed, it has existed because these programmes have not been looked for, because Gaelic script writers for the radio have not known that were they to make scripts available, they would be used in broadcasts.  Much admirable work was done for a period when bi-lingual scripts were utilised and I would urge <Col N="608" /> that the Minister should take positive steps to utilise Radio Éireann to promote the revival of the language.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardButler" hpid="Mr. Butler Mr. Butler">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to delay the business of the House and I shall be very brief.  Radio has many functions to serve&mdash;to instruct the people, to amuse the people, to encourage music, drama and various matters of that sort.  I think the principal function of our broadcasting station should be to reflect, as far as possible, our native culture and to make our way of life known and appreciated abroad.  I think that Radio Éireann really does that to a very large degree.  I think it would be quite unreasonable to criticise it for not doing that adequately and that a great deal of the criticism of Radio Éireann comes from people who seem to desire a round-the-clock light entertainment programme, a sort of music-hall programme that would run the full round of the clock.  I should not listen to criticism from people who have that idea of the functions of our radio, and I certainly should not allow myself to be influenced by them in the preparation or presentation of programmes. I would advise the Minister to resist steadily the pressure that, I think, is being attempted to be exerted on him, to make Radio Éireann simply a replica of some of the light programme stations in foreign countries. If people want these things they can tune in to them and get them elsewhere but I certainly should try to make our station as distinctive as possible. As I say, that is being done very largely now within the bounds of our resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are unfairly criticised sometimes for want of technical perfection in our programmes.  The B.B.C. is an immensely rich corporation, with rich resources in personnel and rich resources in finance.  To expect anything from our station to equal their technical perfection would be quite unreasonable.  We might just as reasonably say that we should maintain as large a Navy or as large an Army as Britain, or as large an Air Force as America.  That criticism to my mind is quite unfair and quite foolish.  I think on the whole that we are given good sound value from our station.  On <Col N="609" /> Sunday night I was listening to the item &ldquo;The Long Road to Ummera&rdquo; and I certainly never heard better from any station, British or Continental. I thought it was really splendid.  I know that public taste in music has become very debased.  There are such floods of cheap popular music being poured out that people have become, as it were, used to it and expect it and when they hear anything in the nature of our traditional music they do not like it as a rule.  That is nothing to be wondered at.  I remember, a full generation ago, a series of classical concerts were held here in Dublin.  I know that people went to these concerts in the beginning rather because they thought it was the proper thing to do than for any love of classical music.  I know they were bored for a long time by these concerts. But the extraordinary thing was that these people became extremely fond of classical music and some of them cultivated a taste for it which has lasted through their lives.</P>

      <P>I want to try to get our people not to give way to this pressure for cheap and rubbishy music.  Reference was made to ceili and traditional music.  Ceili music as a rule is not popular in this country, but our people abroad love it.  I have been talking to missionary priests and they assured me that our people simply love ceili and traditional music.  But the point is that we seldom hear that music given in first-class style.  As a matter of fact, most of the ceili music, and there is no doubt that it is splendid music, is presented in a crude, amateurish way.  There is not sufficient training for those who indulge in that sort of music.  I do not think that either in the university or in any of our academies Irish traditional music is given the place and prominence that it should be given and that is a matter which the Minister might usefully try to get remedied.  I do not see why there should not be a special diploma or certificate in Irish traditional music issued by the academies. That would give a fillip to Irish music <Col N="610" /> and it would also give a standing and a training to those who may present such music to the public instead of having the really crude performances to which we sometimes listen.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested that we should use the radio for the purpose of ending Partition.  That has been a very popular demand for a long time.  I do not myself think it would be a very desirable thing to do, because the best we can do in the realm of radio is a very small and weak thing in comparison with what can be done from outside. If you try to provoke a radio war, as it were, on a question of that sort, you are simply hitting with a feather to be hit back with a sledge hammer.  I do not think that is the best thing to do.</P>
      <P>If I were the Minister I would invite opinion as to the relative merits of various sections of the programme, but I would just as steadily resist any suggestion that our station should be made a non-stop music-hall performance. In those sections which reflect our life, our culture and our aspirations, I would invite opinion as to their relative merits and try to meet the wishes of the people in the readjustment of hours.</P>

      <P>No, Sir.  I often think that Radio Éireann is very like the curate's egg&mdash;good in parts and very bad in other parts.  Quite a lot of the programmes are exceptionally good but other parts are exceptionally bad. I think that is a simple way to put it. But those advocates in the House this evening who would insist on the radio being used for the purpose of developing culture must have listened very seldom to the radio in company.  When, in company, we have some of these cultural items on the radio, we always hear somebody saying: &ldquo;For God's sake turn it off.&rdquo;  That is what happens and those people know that.  Nevertheless, they come here and tell us to use the radio for the purpose of strengthening the Irish language, to use the radio for the purpose of making the people speak Irish, to use the radio for the purpose of inculcating a taste for classical music.  There is no sense in that approach to the radio because, although you may put these things on the radio, you cannot make the people listen to them.  The younger people, as I have seen them growing up, want to hear jazz, they want to hear modern dance music.  They listen to it and they sing to it.  In fact, you see them hanging on to the radio and they are told very often to &ldquo;hang on to the bell&rdquo; over the radio.  I may like on a Saturday night when I am out motoring to tune in and be told how to mend a fork or how to take a stain out of a mahogany table.  That may suit me but it may not suit the people who are travelling with me and they may want to switch on to some other station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Radio Éireann being the one station we have at the moment, we must endeavour <Col N="612" /> as best we can to cater for all tastes.  In the last resort Radio Éireann is not an instrument for culture; it is an instrument for spreading information and for giving entertainment. That is my view of what Radio Éireann ought to be and I think it is just as sound, just as constructive, a view as some of the views that have been expressed here this evening.  We can all be cranks if we want to be. It is the easiest thing in the world for each and everyone of us to spend long hours here this evening advocating the use of the radio for this, that or the other.  My view is that its main use is the entertainment of the people and the Minister should endeavour to see that it is used for that purpose.  Those items like the Hospitals' Trust programme at night and the programme for the patients in the middle of the day have been mentioned here.  Why are they popular?  They are good entertainment and that is why they are popular.  It is the Minister's duty, having control as he has of an instrument that is maintained by the people who pay their wireless licences, to see that the people get the service, which is substantially entertainment, that they want.</P>
    <P>I am aware that what we pay to artists is insufficient.  That complaint has been made against Radio Éireann over a long period and it is no use saying that Britain is a wealthier country and can spend so much per hour on radio that we cannot afford here and that therefore we cannot pay artists. We should, however, pay them reasonable fees and encourage by the fees artists who are now unknown in the larger and smaller towns and even in the countryside to submit scripts to Radio Éireann and try to get on the air.  I have been to concerts now and again through the country and have enjoyed the entertainment served up. I am sure that if Radio Éireann made a search by means of competition they would be able to get excellent material throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Last year I made a slight complaint about the use of the radio for the purpose of encouraging gambling.  I have not been able to follow that particular feature for some time and I do not know if it is still persisted in.  While <Col N="613" /> the racing commentary is perfectly all right&mdash;I can see no objection to that&mdash; I do think that it is hardly right to mention two or three horses that may win to-morrow.  It is an encouragement to people who have never put a halfpenny on a horse to back.  I intended to put a question down to the Minister on that particular point.  How many horses have been tipped to win in the last 12 months and how many in fact did win?  We should know whether in fact it is a good service or a bad service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been some talk about the news.  The news that Radio Éireann gives us is, I suppose, given as best it can be given within the very serious restrictions imposed on those who give it.  They cannot interfere with party matters and if they do we have a question in the House.  They are restricted severely therefore and the result is that we get the sort of news Radio Éireann gives&mdash;official news.  I suppose the same thing will apply to the short wave station when we get it and the very same control will be over it.  It will be watched the way a hawk would watch a bird in case it should make the slightest slip and this is the machine with which the Minister will be expected to combat the evils of Partition.  It is nonsensical to think that that can be done.  I think we ought to have a little bit of commonsense in regard to this and if by any chance the Opposition happen to get a special write up one evening I am sure it would be made up for another evening when this side of the House would get a write up.  Unless some freedom in the matter of news presentation <Col N="614" /> is given to Radio Éireann then it will not be worth tuning in to hear. The difference between the news presented by Radio Éireann and the news presented by any of the newspapers produced in this country shows how inadequate a news service can be when it is under the very severe control Radio Éireann is under because we do not look at it in a very sensible way. They have an item on the B.B.C.  &ldquo;To-day in Parliament.&rdquo;  Possibly that is a feature that might be adopted.  Some members of this House might be asked in their turn to speak on events in the House.  Naturally those people will present&mdash;if they are asked or permitted to do so&mdash;their case from their own political Party point of view, but as long as members of the House were taken in some form of reasonable succession, I think there would be no trouble about it.  It would stimulate interest in Parliament and it is quite possible&mdash;which would be a consideration for the Minister&mdash;that it might be given free, that there would be no question of the Minister having to pay for it, and apparently free contribubutions are frowned upon by Radio Éireann.</P>
      <P>In sport, Radio Éireann has certainly broken records.  The broadcasts of sporting events which have been given have been uniformly successful. They have been magnificent, and I think that Radio Éireann can pride itself on having as sports commentators some of the best commentators in the world&mdash;certainly the English-speaking world which we are able to hear with our ordinary radio sets.  If that aspect of the broadcast reporting of sporting events of all kinds can be made a success, these other features which have been complained of here can be made a success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Butler asked the Minister not to be led astray by advocates of jazz and so on.  I want the Minister not to be led astray by the cranks, because it is a peculiar thing that the cranks are only a very small minority of the people but a minority who want to force their will down the throats of the majority.  I want the Minister to resist that temptation.  I want him to give us good, healthy, wholesome variety shows and to encourage our <Col N="615" /> artists to give us these variety shows. I want him to go around our theatres and select the best items on for the week and broadcast them; to go to our concerts through the country and broadcast a quarter-hour, a half-hour or an hour of these concerts.  Give us good, sound entertainment and plenty of it.  That is what we want. We have plenty of time to be serious. When we are listening to Radio Eireann, let us have variety and let us enjoy it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.D. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few complaints I want to put before the Minister.  I think the broadcasting service has improved somewhat during the past 12 months, but the amount of time devoted to agricultural talks in an agricultural country such as this is altogether inadequate.  From June, 1947, to May, 1948, we had the tremendous amount of time of seven and a quarter hours devoted to talks on agricultural topics, and, during the same period, there was not one minute devoted to a talk on forestry or anything in that particular connection. During that 12 months' period, we were able to devote over 1,000 hours to canned music on gramophone records. That is something the Minister should attend to in the future.  I know that recently the number of talks on agricultural subjects has been increased, but they are still inadequate, and people living in this agricultural country have to tune in to the radio station of highly industrialised and urbanised Britain to get talks on agricultural subjects and particularly on modern technical developments in agriculture.  That is a matter the Department should attend to in the next 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter about which I have to complain is the bias and prejudice which the Department seems to have with regard to broadcasts from the Cork studio by Cork artists.  If these programmes are good, they are definitely fixed on for the axe of the Department.  The Department seems to be particularly jealous of a good programme coming from Cork or from the Cork studio.  There was a programme <Col N="616" /> from the Cork studio, the Cork Melody Makers, which was proved, as a result of a poll, to be the most popular programme from Radio Éireann, and, just because it proved to be the most popular and came from Cork, it was never heard here again. I want to make a very serious protest against that and I want the Minister to realise that the Cork people will be very patient for a time, but when they rebel, they become rebel Cork again.</P>
    <P>With regard to the news, the principal news of the evening comes on at 10.10 p.m.  The principal news should be at some definite hour. People living in towns and villages will know when to switch on for news in which they are particularly interested when the clock strikes and having the news broadcast at nine minutes or eleven minutes past 10 is frightfully inconvenient for a number of people. The news should come on at 9.30 p.m. or 10.30 p.m. or 11 p.m.&mdash;at some definite time and not at five minutes, nine minutes or ten minutes past the hour.</P>
    <P>A lot has been said about Irish and cultural programmes, but, in my opinion, Radio Éireann has done more harm to the revival of the Irish language than anything else by putting out crude programmes by people with raucous voices which turn the people against the language and make them shut off their sets or tune in jazz from the B.B.C.  If Irish programmes are to be put on, and if the Irish language is to be fostered and revived by the broadcasting service.  Radio Éireann must put on the best possible programmes and have the best artists in their broadcasts.  There are a number of broadcasts I have listened to and a number I have seen in various parts of the country which have had the effect of turning people absolutely against the Irish language and forcing people who would ordinarily prefer to listen to the Irish programme to listen to the B.B.C. and other foreign stations.  I hope the Minister will have these points attended to so that we will not have to repeat them next year.</P>

      <P>Nuair a bhíonn daoine ag caint i dtaobh Radio <Col N="617" /> Éireann, is minic gur á cháineadh a bhíonn siad.  Nílimse chun Radio Éireann a cháineadh mar is beag cúis cháinte atá agam ach tá moltaí áirithe ba mhaith liom a chur in iúl don Aire.  An chéad rud, an nuacht sa Ghaeilge.  Níl aon ghné de Radio Éireann is mó a gcuirim spéis ann ná an nuacht sa Ghaeilge.  Chun teanga agus saíocht a leathadh, ní dóigh liom go bhfuil áis ann is éifeachtaí ná an craolachán, agus is cóir lán-úsáid a dhéanamh de chuige sin.  Do dhaoine a bhfuil roinnt Gaeilge acu, agus do dhaoine a bhfuil meirg ar an eolas a bhí acu uirthi tráth, measaim nach bhfuil aon cheacht Ghaeilge is fearr ná an nuacht sa Ghaeilge, go mór mór nuair a deintear í a chraoladh go bríomhar agus go soiléir, ach ba mhaith liom é seo a rá: do réir mo thuairimse lucht mór is ea é gur beag éagsúlacht a bhíonn idir an nuacht i mBéarla a craoltar ar 6.30 um thráthnóna agus an nuacht i nGaeilge ar a 10 a clog. Creidim dá ndeintí iarracht go bhféadfaí an nuacht sa Ghaeilge a thabhairt suas chun dáta níos fearr.  Nuair a chuimhnimíd ar an méadú atá tagtha ar an líon Gaeilgeoirí ó cuireadh an radio ar bun, ba chóir go bhféadfaí cúig nóiméad déag ar a laghad a thabhairt anois don nuacht sa Ghaeilge.</P>
      <P>Gach tír a bhfuil forás uirthi, tá meán craolta aici a tuigtear i ngach páirt den tír.  Dá bhrí sin, ba chóir do lucht craolta na nuaíochta gach rud i bhfoirm canúnachais agus paróisteachais a sheachaint.  Ba cheart dóibh cuimhneamh ar Ghaeilgeoirí na Galltachta ar mar a chéile acu gach saghas Gaeltachta.  Sé cúnamh mhuintir na Galltachta i dtacaíocht leis an nGaeltacht a shabhálfaidh an teanga.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Maidir le daoine a bhíonn ag craoladh nGaeilge, ba chóir go mbeadh an teanga ar fheabhas acu.  Ba chóir go ndéanfaidís staidéir ar chúrsaí urlabhraíochta nó <i>elocution.</i>  Bíonn ar aisteoirí Béarla é a dhéanamh.  Más fíor san, is riachtanaí fós do lucht craolta i nGaeilge, idir Ghaeilgeoirí ó dhúchas agus eile, é a dhéanamh.  Sé an fochal labhartha an áis is cumasaí dá bhféadfaí a cheapadh.  Is leis a spreagtar naisiúin chun gníomha, is <Col N="618" /> leis a treoraítear daoine ar bhealach a leasa.  Is leis a teagastar briathar Dé.  Ar an abhar sin, ba ceart an t-ómós is cuí a thabhairt dó agus iarracht a dhéanamh ar é a &ldquo;chur trasna&rdquo; go fuinniúil, soléir, ceolmhar.</P>
    <P>Aontuíim leis an moladh a chuir an Teachta Ó Líatháin ós cóir an Aire i dtaobh caighdeán na Gaeilge. Cé gur le Cúige Mumhan is mó a luíonn mo chroí, measaim gurb é leas na Gaeilge meán craolta a dhéanamh de mheascán de na trí canúintí. Ní bheadh aon chúis gearáin ag aoinne ansan.  Níl aon chanúint saibhir a dóthain le seasamh aisti féin.  Ghlac Muimnigh agus Connachtaigh agus formhór na nUltach go fonnmhar leis an gCaighdeán Oifigiúil, agus glacfaidh an tír chomh fonnmhar céanna le meán craolta a cheapfadh Gaeilgeoirí tuisceanacha.</P>
    <P>I should like to conclude what I have to say by commenting on the high level of musical entertainment from Radio Éireann for some considerable time past.  Whoever is responsible for this high standard deserves, I think, the praise and commendation of the members of this House and of the people of the country generally.  I do not profess to be a music critic or to be in any way well-qualified to criticise musical compositions, or for that matter their presentation, but I believe that I can appreciate the difference between good music and bad music, and good presentation and bad presentation.  There was a time when the standard of entertainment from Radio Éireann was not at all as high as it is now&mdash;and particularly in the sphere of musical entertainment. I think it only right to say to the Minister that whoever is responsible for that improvement deserves the commendation and praise of us all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to emphasise one or two points which were made by other speakers and to express the hope that the Minister will make a personal inquiry into the grievances of musicians in Radio Éireann.  I received a two-paged circular a day or two ago which contained a list of grievances.  It would appear from that circular that our own people at home are discriminated <Col N="619" /> against by somebody&mdash;by whom, I do not know.  Complaint is made that our own people do not get the same standard of wages as the outsider who is brought in gets.  In that connection let me say that I think we have as fine musicians in Dublin to-day as are to be found elsewhere, and they ought not to be discriminated against in any way.  If the Minister, through this personal inquiry, will try and bring about peace and contentment amongst the musicians he will have done a good day's work.</P>
      <P>A friend recently asked me: &ldquo;Why are you retiring some of your best musicians when they reach the age of 65?&rdquo;  This friend of mine who asked that question is a musician himself.  He told me that some of the musicians retiring or to be retired at 65 are regular geniuses.  If a man becomes so highly qualified in music that he can be described by one of his colleagues in the profession as a &ldquo;genius&rdquo;, why should our orchestra be deprived of that man's gifts?  It is not right that men who can be described in such complimentary terms by other musicians must retire at 65 and that their work should then come to an end.  Incidentally, I do not think they are pensioned. I have two names in my mind but it would not be right to mention them&mdash;apart altogether from the fact that it would not be fair to give their names after having mentioned that they were described as geniuses.  I appeal to the Minister to make a personal inquiry into the matter and to see that these men are kept on and that their musical gifts will be retained for our own people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard one Deputy refer to the way in which céili music is put over as &ldquo;crude.&rdquo;  I think that is a wrong description. The céili music programme of Radio Eireann is a thrilling half hour.  I have heard of people associated with the various bands say that it is a delight to hear the céili music coming from Radio Éireann.  I have been in Liverpool, Manchester and other places in Great Britain and I have been told by people over there that they regard the half hour during which céili music is played from <Col N="620" /> our radio as a special half hour and that they take great delight in listening to the music.  Therefore céili music having been paid that tribute by people outside our own shores I do not think that the two or three Deputies who used the word &ldquo;crude&rdquo; in connection with it were altogether correct. They may have a great knowledge of music&mdash;of such a high standard that, as one member says, when that type of music comes on the air it is above their heads and they turn it off.  I hope that céili music will continue.</P>
    <P>For my part, I enjoy Radio Éireann. I think there have been some marvellous improvements and I have heard other people saying that there have been marvellous improvements recently in its productions generally.  I just rose to express the hope that the Minister would make a personal inquiry into the conditions of the musicians and see that any cause for complaint is removed.</P>

Níl mise ag dul ag tabhairt aon mholadh don Aire ná do stiúrthóir an Radio, mar ní dóigh liom go bhfuil aon bheirt sa tír atá ar aon intinn i dtaobh clár Radio.

Dearfainn féin go bhfuil glacadh mór faoin dtuaith le ceol na gcéilí.  Níl a fhios agam ar cheart dom faireann ceol céilí a mholadh.  Ós rud é go raibh caint fhada inniu ar an gceol claiseacach&mdash;agus, ar ndóigh, níl mise in aghaidh an rud sin&mdash;ba mhaith liom a chur in iúl don dream atá ag stiúradh an Radio go bhfuil an-mheas ar fad ag muintir na tuaithe ar an gceol Gaelach.  B'fhéidir nach dtuigeann siad an cineál eile&mdash;níl mise ag rá go dtuigim féin é&mdash;agus b'fhéidir nach bhfuair siad seans go dtí seo é a thuiscint nó é a chleachtadh.  Ar chuma ar bith, níl an chuid is mó díobh chomh hard-nósach agus go dtuigeann siad ceoldráma Iodálach agus a leithéid. Is amhlaidh a éisteann siad leis an rud is mó a aitheans siad, agus sin an ceól Gaelach.</P>

Is minic a chonnaic mé scríofa é, nach ceart an t-aon ábhar amháin nuaíochta a bheith ann in Gaeilge agus i mBéarla. Níl fhios agam an féidir aon dá eagar a bheith ar nuaíocht,. ach más féidir, molaimse go mbeadh rudaí eagsúla i nuaíocht na Gaeilge, rudaí níos mó, rudaí sa mbreis, thar mar a bheadh sa Bhéarla.</P>

Má tá tú ag cur spéise sa nuaíocht, agus mura bhfuil an Ghaeilge ar fheabhas agat&mdash;b'fhéidir go mbeadh duine á tabhairt amach nach dtuigeann tú a chanúint go ró mhaith &mdash;fanann tú leis an leagan Béarla. B'fhéidir gur ceart dom cuidiú leis an rud a mhol an Teachta Ó Tiománuidhe, rud a cheapaim a chaithfidh teacht am éigin, go gcaithfidh caighdeán oifigiúil a bheith ann le haghaidh an Radio; ach is é an rud is mó, an rud is tábhachtaí ar fad, aire cheart a thabhairt don urlabhra.  Is cuma cén chanúint atá ag an duine a bhíonn ag labhairt, má labhrann sé go réidh, go mall <Col N="622" /> soiléir, tuigeann gach duine a bhfuil beagán Gaeilge aige go sásúil é.</P>
    <P>Feictear dom nach dtugann na gnáth-chainteoirí Gaeilge an oiread aire dá gcuid urlabhra agus a thugann siad don Bhéarla.  B'fhéidir go bhfuil leithscéal dó sin, go luíonn sé ar bhealach le canúint éigin&mdash;tá mise agus canúint amháin agam, a raibh orm an chanúint sin d'fhoghlaim, agus tá daoine eile agus canúint eile acu sna háiteacha arb as iad féin.  Is cuma cén chanúint é, caithfidh leagan amháin a bheith ann ar an Radio, agus go dtí go mbeidh sé sin ar fáil, is é mo chomhairle don Aire, agus do lucht stiúrtha an Radio, go ndéarfaidís leis na cainteoirí aire a thabhairt don phointe seo.  Níl mise ag fáil aon locht ar na cainteoirí anois, mar tá na cainteoirí ar fheabhas.  Tá mé ag déanamh mo dhíchill iad d'fheabhsú agus déarfainn leo go mbíonn beagainín stró go minic ar lucht an bheagáin Ghaeilge iad a thuiscint.  Duine a bhfuil an Gaeilge go maith aige, nó a bhíonn ag stiúradh ranganna, tuigeann sé an deacracht mhór sin faoi an cineál sin éisteóirí.</P>
    <P>Molaim go láidir aire a thabhairt do cheist na nuaíochta, mar chonaic mé moltaí ó dhaoine a bhíonn ag éisteacht le nuaíocht ó Radio Éireann, nach maith an dá rud i ndiaidh a chéile. B'fhéidir gur mhaith an ní don Ghaeilge é dá bhfeadfaí é a thabhairt amach leath-uair nó uair i ndiaidh an Bhéarla, agus ansin bheadh caoi ann aon nuaíocht a thiocfadh isteach go dtí an Radio a rith an ama sin d'insint sa nuaíocht deireannach.  Ar an gcaoi sin, bheadh tuille nuaíochta ar fáil ag an bpobal i nGaeilge thar mar bhí leath-uair, nó uair a chloig roimhe sin i mBéarla.</P>
    <P>Cloisimse cuid mhaith clamhsáin ó chuid mhaith daoine go bhfuil an iomarca claoine sa nuaíocht, go mór mór an nuaíocht a bhaineas leis an Dáil, le polaitíocht.  Ní maith liom an cineál sin clamhsáin a thabhairt isteach i mo chuid cainte ach tá sé le cloisteáil agam.</P>

      <P>Tá mé ag aontú leis an tuairim sin ach níl sé de dhanaíocht ionam mo thuairim féin a chur os aird sa Dáil.  B'fhearr liom i bhfad tuairim na ndaoine a chloisim ag caint a nochtadh.  Sin é an tuairim atáim a nochtadh.  Tá an tuairim sin go láidir agamsa, bíodh a fhios agat.  Tá sé sin le cloisteáil go minic agam.  Tá a fhios agam nach bhfuil aon chead ag na stát-sheirbhísigh nó ag foireann an stiúrthóra é sin a réiteach.  Sin ceist a bhaineas díreach leis an Aire agus leis an Rialtas. Caithim an locht agus an milleán a leagadh anuas ar an Aire.  Ceist pholaitíochta, ceist polasaí, é sin.  Tá mise ag rá leis an Aire go bhfuil an clamhsán go láidir agus go foirleathan le cloisteáil ar fud na tíre.  Sé an clamhsán is mó a thagann faoi mo bhráid féin ar chuma ar bith.

Más féidir iad a shásamh, níl aon duine ag cur ina aghaidh.  Tríd is tríd, tá sé sáthach maith agus, mar dúirt mé i dtosach, ní dóigh liom go bhfuil beirt duine sa tír seo atá ar aon intinn faoi chlár an Radio.

      <P>Deputy Little, when he was moving the reference back, alleged that Radio Éireann had been used for political purposes and in particular for giving publicity to certain Ministers, especially the Minister for External Affairs.  I would like to say here and now that there is no interference whatever with the station officials who select and edit news items for broadcasting; I made a similar statement last year.  As, however, Ministers have the responsibilities of office, their statements and activities have always been given more prominence in the news than those of ordinary Deputies.  I might add that mobile recording apparatus became available in the beginning of 1948, and two descriptive news writers were obtained about the same time for the purpose of covering events of Irish interest.  Since then it has been possible to liven up the news bulletins by including news talks on items of interest to Irish listeners.  Reference was made to the activities of the Minister for External Affairs in some of these talks but this is not surprising in view of the prominent part he has taken in international conferences and international affairs generally.</P>
      <P>Deputy Little went on to allege that not a word was given on the radio on the night of the 7th July about the division that took place on the Post Office Estimate and quoted that as &ldquo;perhaps the most remarkable&rdquo; example of the use of Radio Éireann for the Government's political purposes. I will do no more than read what was actually said in the late news bulletin on the night of 7th July.</P>

      <P>The very first news headline that night was:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A motion by Mr. Little to refer back the Estimate for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs which the Minister, Mr. Everett, had introduced earlier this evening has been carried in the Dáil.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="625" /> In the details the announcer went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;By 62 votes to 59 a motion by Mr. Little to refer back the Estimate for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs was carried in the Dáil to-night.  When the Vote was announced the Taoiseach said that he would suggest that the House adjourn until to-morrow morning to consider the position, etc.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think every Deputy will agree that that was a fair account of what happened a few minutes earlier in this House and will enable everybody to judge the value of the Deputy's criticism on the score of political propaganda. As regards the question of a new broadcasting station, the premises at Ardmore are still in our possession but it has not yet been decided when building operations will commence.  As regards the concert hall project, the matter is hardly one for my Department but the position is that after the Government had decided to defer the building of the hall it was found that a binding contract for the lease of the Rotunda site did not exist and the hospital authorities were informed that it was not intended to take the lease.</P>

      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick then complained about the number of foreign musicians in the orchestra.  One would imagine by statements made by some Deputies that the orchestra had a majority of foreign musicians.  The position is that there are 84 posts for musicians in our two orchestras as against 40 in one orchestra a few years ago.  Of these 84 posts only 15 posts, <Col N="626" /> all in the Symphony Orchestra, are at present filled by foreigners.  The recruitment of these foreigners was an absolute necessity when the size of the orchestra was increased.  We have at present 14 vacancies in the Symphony Orchestra and 11 in the Light Orchestra for which there were no Irish musicians of sufficient competence available when auditions were last held.  We are not filling these vacancies permanently in the hope that in time we will be able to get Irish players of the standard required. Meanwhile, in order to secure a reasonable balance, we find it necessary to fill some of them in a purely temporary capacity by musicians who are somewhat below the standard required.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick asked me to make a statement and I have pleasure in doing so.  I agree that, where we have Irishmen capable and with the qualifications, we need not bring in any foreigners.</P>
      <P>As far as I am concerned, when we are in a position to put forward Irishmen capable of taking their place I will give them a preference that I will not give to foreigners.  I think no one will disagree with that.  I am only a lay-man.  I do not claim to be a musical expert or to be possessed of musical talent, and so I can only be guided by the officials who have been appointed specially to advise me on this matter. Who is to be the independent judge? I shall be only too pleased when the day comes&mdash;probably it will come sooner than many of us expect&mdash;when Irishmen will be competent to take their place as members of the orchestra and to prove themselves to be a credit to this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was another criticism made in connection with foreign players and the Irish Musicians' Union.  I understand that Deputies have received a memorandum from the Irish Federation of Musicians dealing with the position of foreign players.  In regard to that memorandum, let me say at once that it does not deal fairly with the Departmental position.  The memorandum fails to point out, for instance, that such differential as exists in rates of pay is due to a temporary disturbance allowance given to the foreign players <Col N="627" /> in order to compensate them, in some degree, for having to break up their homes abroad and to set up a house here in new and strange surroundings. One Deputy said he understood that the difference in favour of the foreign player was £4 or £5.  Actually, a single foreign player receives £2 extra, and a married foreign player £3 extra.  That is the compensation they receive for disturbance.</P>
    <P>The memorandum likewise fails to represent the Department's viewpoint in the matter of representation for the orchestra.  It seeks to show that it was the foreign element in the orchestra that procured a majority in favour of accepting a particular status involving representation by a Civil Service organisation instead of another status which would have enabled the orchestra, if they so desired, to be represented by a non-Civil Service organisation.  In fact the decision was taken by all the members of the orchestra excluding the &ldquo;extras&rdquo; or casuals.  Quite clearly casual players could not be allowed to decide the status of those who are in permanent or quasi-permanent employment.  The casual players were told that they could be represented by the service organisation to which the permanents or quasi-permanents adhered and in this the Department was following a practice generally accepted throughout the Post Office service, and, so far as I know, the Civil Service generally.  The Post Office Workers' Union makes representations on behalf of the casual employees of the Department.  If the casual musicians have a grievance, the Department will be willing to meet them at any time, and any difficulties that they have can be discussed.  From what I know of the Department's officials they are prepared to discuss grievances and meet them in every way possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick and Deputy Connolly asked some questions about ages. The age at which members of the orchestra are supposed to retire is 60. That has been extended to 65 for men employed before 1947.  Deputy Byrne referred to a recent retirement.  The person concerned had reached the age of 74.  It cannot be said that he was <Col N="628" /> treated harshly in relieving him of responsible work in the orchestra at that particular age.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to follow Deputies into the by-ways of this problem of the orchestra.  As I said before, I am not a musician.  I have less musical knowledge than some of the Deputies who spoke here.  On questions affecting the qualifications of individuals, I can only satisfy myself that the selection of players is carried out by competent people who try to remedy injustices.  I must, however, leave the day-to-day organisation of the orchestra in the hands of the director and his staff.</P>
    <P>On the general broad question of policy, it is my intention to limit the introduction of foreign players to the necessary minimum.  The employment of foreign players is, I hope, a purely temporary measure, and so far as my Department is concerned everything will be done to ensure that a supply of competent native players will become available at the earliest possible moment.  Towards this end we are cooperating with the Department of Education and the principal teaching organisations with a view to extending the existing teaching facilities so that the end we all have in view may be reached within a reasonable time.  We also contemplate making a public announcement regarding the vacancies that are likely to arise over a particular period in order that young Irish musicians may be preparing themselves to fill them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Little referred to broadcasts to schools.  This matter is still under consideration.  The question of international commercial telephonic and telegraphic services, especially with the United States, is constantly under review in the Department.  It would be uneconomical to use the short-wave station for such purposes and in any event the international agreement under which we have been assigned wavelengths for broadcasting prevents us from using them for any other purpose.</P>
    <P>We have now a regular talk for farmers every Wednesday night, and we recently arranged for farming talks every Sunday evening at 5.45 p.m.</P>
    <P>On the question of wireless interference&mdash;Deputy <Col N="629" /> Briscoe referred to this&mdash;we recently had discussions with the Wireless Dealers' Association and the association agreed to co-operate with the Department in every possible way in dealing with this problem.  It will be necessary to train additional staff and to purchase extra vans and portable interference locators.  This will take some time, but in the mean-time we propose to have some talks broadcast advising listeners on the proper installation and care of sets and asking them not to purchase any electrical apparatus unless they are given an assurance that it will not cause interference with wireless reception. The wireless dealers will help in the fitting of suppressors to electrical equipment, but we hope eventually to induce manufacturers to fix suppressors to apparatus in the course of manufacture.</P>
    <P>Poor reception in the Wexford area during the war was caused by German aids to navigation situated on the French coast.  Since the end of the war this trouble has disappeared.</P>
    <P>As regards the points made by Deputy Derrig and Deputy Timoney on the matter of Irish pronunciation, I should like to say that everything possible is being done to improve Irish pronunciation on the radio.  A panel of the best Irish speakers in Dublin has been drawn up and persons on this panel are being utilised for plays, features, etc.</P>
    <P>We are trying to get material for broadcasting from the Gaeltacht, and our outside broadcast officers have already recorded a considerable amount of material with the new mobile recording apparatus.  It is extremely difficult, however, to broadcast successfully plays and long items from the Gaeltacht because suitable telephone lines are not generally available to these areas and if the items were recorded it would be necessary to make so many records that the features would be very disjointed.  We are investigating the possibility of using portable magnetic wire recorders for longer items but it is too early yet to say whether they will be satisfactory.</P>
    <P>We have, of course, several Irish <Col N="630" /> series, including an Irish version of &ldquo;Radio Digest&rdquo; and an Irish Question Time from the studio.  It would, I find, be impracticable to have a travelling Irish Question Time like the English version.  Deputy Derrig may not be aware that the station distributes weekly publicity matter in Irish concerning the Irish programmes to all newspapers and newspaper critics, but very few of them make any use of this material.</P>
    <P>Deputy Connolly put forward certain suggestions.  Like myself, he did not claim to have any knowledge of music. He had to depend on the advice and suggestions given to him by some of his constituents, but he did suggest that we should have a manager for the orchestra.  Managers are not required where we have a stationary orchestra and not a travelling orchestra.  He also suggested that we should have a librarian for the Radio Éireann orchestra. It has been found satisfactory to have members of the orchestra to do this library work.  These men are always at hand during rehearsals and have an intimate knowledge of orchestral routine.  The Deputy complained about the reception from Athlone.  He said it was very poor on the east coast of England and in London.  The Athlone station was designed to give a satisfactory reception over as much of Ireland as possible and it cannot be expected to give a good reception so far afield as eastern England.  It is not practicable to modify the station so as to provide a satisfactory service over the very wide area of which the Deputy speaks.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also spoke about the equipment in the studio.  The possibility of getting a new building equipped in a modern way is kept constantly before our minds.  In that event we will have equipment of the most up-to-date kind.  He suggested we should get Irish conductors.  The Deputy's remarks in connection with young conductors have no foundation in fact.  The conductors engaged here give satisfaction without exception, and most of them, I am proud to say, are of the very first rank.  The summer School of Music under the Department of Education includes a course for orchestral conductors.  In that way certain young Irishmen have <Col N="631" /> been selected to conduct the symphony concerts and they have been given the same facilities as foreign guest conductors.  They get every facility from the Department.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe wants to know all about interference.  If he reads my introductory remarks in connection with broadcasting he will get all the information he requires.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kissane wants more agricultural broadcasts.  The trouble I see here is that some Deputies want more news, some want more Irish news, some want a greater variety, some want high-brow music and others want a good variety show, if possible, broadcast from the country.  All these things are very desirable.  I am sure everybody wishes that we would be in the position to provide them, but we have not the money and neither have we the station nor the time at our disposal to satisfy all the people.  We try to give satisfaction in our programmes, and we give as much time as possible to the Irish side and we devote a considerable time to variety.</P>
    <P>I want to satisfy the man who lies in a settle bed in the West or the South of Ireland, who comes in from a hard day's work and who likes to hear a varied programme from his Irish station.  We must then meet the people who like high-class music or cultural subjects.  We try to satisfy their wants by means of symphony concerts and items of a cultural character. We follow the policy of giving each section a share in the programme from Radio Éireann.</P>
    <P>Deputy Timoney suggested that the Irish news should last for 15 minutes. That is a reasonable suggestion and I will recommend it for consideration.  If the time can be given, we will be only too pleased to give Irish news for 15 minutes instead of ten.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lynch said we do not devote enough of the programme to North of Ireland news.  We do not consciously ignore the North.  Indeed, we employ northern talent and utilise them as much as possible and we endeavour to give them a very generous representation. I can assure the Deputy we are not recognising the boundary in <Col N="632" /> that respect.  North of Ireland artists get every facility so far as we are concerned.</P>
    <P>I have been asked why the short-wave station should not be used.  I want to let people know that the short-wave station will not be heard in this part of the country, even when it is in operation.  We will use the short-wave station for news that will be interesting to Irish men and women abroad. They will be able to listen to news from their kith and kin in this country.  Deputies must recognise that there are international agreements which will have to be observed.  For a few years we will have, through the courtesy of other countries, the right to operate a short-wave station.  In that we have to face up to the position of doing what we believe will be in the interests of this country.  We will do nothing that will prevent us from having the facilities from these countries that will be obliging us until we have our own short-wave wave-length in operation in 1951.</P>
    <P>Last year we were attacked because we said we suspended the short-wave station.  I remember Deputy de Valera saying that probably our tactics would secure for this country what it failed up to that time to secure, and I believe that by the threat of sale of the broadcasting station, when we had other nations trying to purchase it, we achieved a lot.  Some of those nations had no love for this country, but when it came to the Mexico conference, sooner than let nations jealous of it buy it, they voted for us.  The majority of the nations present voted that Ireland should get a wavelength, although for years before that I believe they refused to do so.  I said that we would not go cap in hand to any other nation, and I am sure every Deputy agrees with that policy.  I feel certain that Deputies are pleased that we were able in such short time to secure a suitable wavelength for our short-wave station.</P>
    <P>We do not want to claim an advantage over any Party, but I would like it to go on record that Deputies on the other side of the House were trying to make political kudos out of the statement made here that we would <Col N="633" /> suspend the short-wave station.  I hope when it is in operation that it will be a benefit to our people in all parts of the world.  We will do everything possible in order to bring the grievances of the Irish people before the peoples of the world.  But we shall not depend on the short-wave station alone in order to do that.  We are making other efforts to inform those who are ignorant of the Irish position and to bring knowledge to those who have little conception of the way in which we have been treated by a foreign nation.  In that way we shall arouse the sympathy of every democratic country and we shall be able to prove that it is not by the wish of the Irish people that our country is divided.</P>
    <P>In the course of this debate many valuable suggestions were made.  I shall consider the recommendations put forward by Deputies.  If there is any Deputy who thinks that his suggestion was an important one and that I have overlooked it because I omitted to reply to it now, I am prepared to meet him any day that he cares to call to my office.  We can discuss the particular point there and, in turn, may advance Departmental views on the matter.</P>
    <P>As I said in the beginning, I know nothing at all about music.  My acquaintance with music is that of the ordinary man in the street.  I want to see the ordinary man get value for his money and the advice I give to my officials is to give the ordinary man some value for his money.  I want him to have some variety.  In the last year a certain amount of progress has been made in that direction.</P>
    <P>I want to point out that the officials of the broadcasting service were not appointed by me.  They were appointed by my predecessor.  I do not know what their politics are and I have never discussed politics with them.  I know that they are good, loyal civil servants.  I venture to say that there are no more loyal civil servants to be found than those whom it is my pleasure to control in Radio Éireann.  As Deputy Little knows, we have one engineer in particular.  He is a modest, unassuming gentleman.  I think that it is to our credit that we have one Irishman who has won recognition from the other nations of the world.  A special letter <Col N="634" /> of congratulation was received by the Government because we had a man of his abilities and qualifications to plead Ireland's cause in connection with wireless broadcasting.  We are proud to have this gentleman with us.  Yet Deputy Little accuses us of having politicians on the staff.  It is against such men as these that the accusation is made that they are working for the Government.  I have had complaints from Deputies on our side accusing us of giving too much to another side.  I may say that I never interfere.  The officials are appointed, and I believe that the less interference one has with officials the better.  It is their responsibility. If they fall down on the job we can deal with them.  Up to the present these men have given loyal service and I hope that after this evening we shall hear no more of these statements, such as that made by Deputy Little, that we do not give the news of the proceedings.</P>

      <P>If he withdraw it, that is enough.  I would not have referred to it at all if I had known that he had withdrawn it.  Radio Éireann has been criticised on both sides of the House. It shows how democratic we are when Deputies have the right and the freedom to express their opinions and criticise.  Wholesome criticism is, of <Col N="635" /> course, helpful and it is always welcome. It will be our duty now to consider the criticisms made and see if anything can be done to overcome any defects that may exist.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Everett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £3,366,630 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1950, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (45 and 46 Vict., c. 74; 8 Edw. 7, c. 48; 1 and 2 Geo. 5, c. 26; the Telegraph Acts, 1863 to 1928; No. 14 of 1940 (secs. 30 and 31); No. 14 of 1942 (sec.23); etc.), and of certain other Services administered by that office.</P>
      <P>A lot of unnecessary heat was raised on Thursday about this matter of free postage.  Deputies must relate what I said about prepayment of letters to Government Departments to my earlier statement that the privilege of free postage was intended to apply to correspondence which was on the business of the State.  There is no doubt in my mind, nor I should imagine in the minds of any Deputy that the privilege has been abused. Everyone will agree that abuses should be stopped.  That is what I intended to do.  But in trying to stop the abuse I do not intend to go further.  So far as I am satisfied that the condition &ldquo;on the business of the State&rdquo; is fulfilled, I have no desire or intention to interfere with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last Thursday Deputies made reference to the widow and the orphan and the poor man applying for a grant. If those people or any others are writing on the business of the State, their letters will be delivered in the ordinary way, whether they are prepaid or not. <Col N="639" /> And as I hinted last Thursday the letters which Deputies send to Government Departments will be delivered in the future as in the past.  The question of how my intentions can be achieved and how abuses can be stopped is something which is being considered as a matter of administration. Again I want to emphasise that what I want to do is to stop abuses and not to stop legitimate user of the privilege.  I never intended and do not now intend to prevent persons sending letters to Departments without prepayment of postage as long as these letters are genuinely official letters and that is a public assurance from me.  I do not stand for, and I think the House will not stand for, abuse of that privilege by persons who are well able to pay postage and should pay postage on private letters seeking contracts, requesting that special records be played on the radio and seeking autographs, etc.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Vote be referred back for reconsideration. This whole question turns on what is the interpretation of the term &ldquo;State business&rdquo;.  It seems to be clear, from what the Minister now says, that if people write into a Department about old age pensions or social services generally, that will be regarded as State business.  How on earth the administration is going to distinguish between State business and personal business, I do not know.  The officials will have to open a letter before they can surcharge it or else they will have to return the letter.  I cannot see how this arrangement can be carried out at all administratively.  I think, however, that we have succeeded at least, by what we have done, in stopping what might have been a very quick one, put across on us by the Department of Finance rather than by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the £300,000 you are getting out of increased postal charges.  Then again, another very quick one was put across on the House and a protest was made by the <i>Independent</i> at the time against it, but the Minister's predecessor was blamed for it.  That was for raiding the Post Office Savings Bank, out of which he got £466,000.  That is a very serious matter.  Power was taken under the Act of 1930 by which the Minister could take over to the Exchequer certain sums from the reserves of the Post Office Savings Bank.  That was not materially touched by the Fianna Fáil administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>In general for 15 years it was not touched, but last year £466,000 was taken.  Having regard to the fact that the savings had been invested in British securities and that there was a decrease in the value of the securities, money would naturally be required in order to restore the full value of the moneys lodged by these people in the bank.  It was a very dangerous thing to touch these reserves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>These people may be confronted with the necessity of returning that money to the Post Office Savings Bank.  These are just the two other points to which I wished to draw the attention of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to make one point.  The Minister promised that he would reconsider this matter but there is just one aspect which I should like to bring to his attention.  I understand that under the Act which governs this matter of postage, the Minister for Finance has power to lay down general rules, but, in regard to exemptions, it is entirely a matter for the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs. Under the law, any subject had the right to petition the King and there was no obligation on him, when he petitioned the King, to put a stamp on his letter.  By the change of functions <Col N="642" /> which we have had in this State, I suppose the President takes up the position of the King.  Anyway, any citizen who has any doubt about whether he should pay postage or not on a document that he wants to send to the Government, could send it in the form of a petition to the President, in relation to an old age pension or in relation even to matters about which the Minister complains, as to whether certain people should be allowed on the air or not.  If the citizens will adopt that procedure it will solve all the problems.  Therefore, strictly speaking, the situation has not altered one way or the other.  That is the position as I see it.  Any citizen who is in doubt can write to the President in the form of a petition and the matter must be attended to by the Ministers of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to be quite clear as to what the Minister has just stated. The Minister told us last week that anybody who wanted to write to a Government Department should write to the Department and they would send him a franked envelope in return.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>That was my suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the Minister's suggestion the last day&mdash;that a fellow was to send a letter with a 2½d. stamp on it and that the Department would send him back a franked envelope so that he could send the next letter for nothing, having paid 2½d. for a stamp for the first letter.  I want to be a definite and clear as to what change the Minister is making in the position as regards the ordinary citizen of this State in writing to a Department.  I would say there are close on 1,000,000 letters sent to Government Departments each year by people writing about old age pensions, about unemployment assistance, to the Board of Works on various matters and to the Revenue Commissioners about their income-tax.  Then, undoubtedly, an enormous number of letters are written to the Department of Agriculture and to the Department of Lands.  I want to know from the Minister if a poultry-keeper in my county wants to write to the Minister for Agriculture about <Col N="643" /> these new wingless chickens they are producing in America is he obliged to put a stamp on the letter.  I should like the Minister to say definitely whether he must or must not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>About anything in connection with State business.  The people are paying the Ministers for giving certain expert advice.  Is a citizen entitled to write to the Department of Agriculture for leaflet No. 1 in regard to the best manner of producing eggs, for leaflet No. so-and-so as to the cheapest way of fattening a pig as he always was in the past and to send those letters without any stamp?  Will the Minister give me a definite answer on that, because I want to be clear on it?</P>
      <P>So far as I could understand him, the Minister has mended his hand since last week.  I am glad that the little lesson they learned here has induced them to mend their hand.  The Minister told us last week that he was prepared to give certain concessions to Deputies, but that he was not prepared to give any concession to the general public. We are not looking for concessions for Deputies, but for the general public. That was the Minister's statement last week.  Has he now mended his hand? Is the Minister going to allow this right to the ordinary citizen of the State&mdash;whether by usage or by precedent, he always did it&mdash;to continue?</P>

Apparently not, because this is a thorny job.

      <P>If the rights of some sections of the Irish nation have been vindicated, it is not due to Deputies like the Deputy who has just spoken.  It is not due to Deputies who are members of the Labour Party, nor Deputies like Deputy Cowan.  It is due to the fact that you have in this House an alert Opposition which repudiated the policy submitted to this House on behalf of the Coalition Government by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs. I have heard some of the colleagues of the present Minister trying to get out of their responsibilities by saying: &ldquo;After all, it was not the Party which calls itself the Irish Labour Party which was responsibile for this, but it was the Minister who had been nominated by the National Labour Party.&rdquo;  I have heard supporters of Clann na Poblachta say that it was the Fine Gael Party that was responsible for this.  There must be some simulacrum of truth in that suggestion, because we do know that the screw has been very tightly turned by the Department of the Minister for Finance.  In his effort to bolster up a dishonest Budget, he has instructed the Departments to screw every penny they possibly can, by administrative means, out of the Irish citizen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At any rate, there is the doctrine of collective responsibility and for what the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs tried to do and to get the House to assent to last Thursday every member-and every supporter of the Coalition. <Col N="645" /> whether he calls himself an Independent, like Deputy Sheehan, of Cork, or Deputy Cowan, of Dublin, or is formally and officially a follower of Deputy Larkin, like Deputy Connolly, or a supporter of the Minister for External Affairs, like Deputy Timoney or Deputy Fitzpatrick, is responsible.  If we succeeded in staying his hand and if he has mended his hand here to-night, it is not due to them but due to the opposition of the largest Party in Dáil Éireann, the united opposition of Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <P>I hope, however, that the Minister has learned a lesson, that there are some things which even a Government cannot do, although I gather that the Minister is going to try to attempt one of them.  He has told us, I understand, that letters which are sent to a Government Department purely on Government business will be accepted, will not, that is to say, be subject to any surcharge&mdash;though I do not see how a Department could pay a surcharge&mdash;but will be opened and will be dealt with.  I would like if the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, when he is winding up this debate, would tell us how he proposes to give effect to that procedure.  Has he developed a pair of X-ray eyes that will scrutinise an envelope which has been written by an old age pensioner down the country and has been tendered at the post office unstamped?  Will he by reason of this extraordinary and miraculous vision of his pierce the opaque envelope and see what is written inside?  Will he employ, perhaps, a special machine for the purpose or recruit individuals thus super-humanly gifted?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There, apparently, is the answer.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs says that he will refuse to accept any letters tendered at the post office which are unstamped unless they are on Government business; and when I asked him how that was going to be accomplished Deputy Dockrell <Col N="646" /> comes to his rescue with the wise and sage suggestion: &ldquo;He can open the letter&rdquo;.  So the position now is that a staff of civil servants is to be recruited for opening letters and perusing them in order to satisfy themselves that they are letters which have been written by private citizens upon Government business.  If they decide that these letters which have been delivered unstamped have not been written upon Government business, presumably the missives will be very carefully folded over, put in another envelope, this time with an economy label on it, and returned to the sender.  Is that how Deputy Dockrell's suggestion with regard to these letters written on other than Government business and delivered at the post office should be dealt with?  Of course any attempt on the part of the Minister to enforce the sort of principle&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I was saying when Deputy Cowan interrupted with what appeared to his intelligence to be a point of order, that we are now in agreement that it is quite impossible for the Minister to enforce the rule which he has laid down, that is, that he will permit only letters which are written on Government business and addressed to the Government Departments to be delivered in the ordinary <Col N="647" /> way through the post if they are unstamped. It would be quite impossible to enforce that principle, and any Deputy of intelligence in this House&mdash; and the majority are intelligent people &mdash;will realise that, and so will the people down the country.  What we have been listening to to-night therefore is what you might describe as a diplomatic surrender on the part of the Government to the Opposition.  We are now fully justified in the lesson which we gave to the Government.  If the people are going to enjoy henceforward the privilege they have enjoyed, not merely under the Irish Government, but even under the British Government, if an applicant for the old age pension may now write to the Minister for Social Welfare&mdash;and if he has time to attend to it&mdash;without having to put a 2½d. stamp on the envelope it is due to the Fianna Fáil opposition.</P>
      <P>If a person is aggrieved by the action of any servant of the State, if he wishes to draw the attention of a member of the Government to the fact that he has been so aggrieved, and can do it henceforward as free of charge as he could have done previously, it is due to the Opposition which sits on these benches.  Whatever else has emerged as a result of the Division which took place on Thursday night last this creditable thing emerges.  We have taught the Government a lesson and they are not likely to forget for a long time and the people will not forget it either.  The people will not forget this.  I have sometimes said that there were Red elements in that Government and I think I can say that not only are there Red elements but there are also yellow elements, yellow elements who are afraid to face the country and the people in a general election.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one matter which I have already mentioned on this Estimate to the Minister but which I wish to bring to his notice again, that is, the question of the rearrangement of postal districts.  The matter was raised by Deputy McQuillan and to some extent by myself on the last occasion.  While the rearrangement in the Ballinasloe area has conferred a <Col N="648" /> benefit on a large number of people it has been decidedly a disadvantage to a number of other people.  This rearrangement which was contemplated was something which should not have been done in the manner it was done because the districts were rearranged from Dublin and not from the local office.  It was done on maps, old-time maps, and it could not be rearranged on maps by anybody.  If somebody is not prepared to go all over the district they will not now know the proper lie of the district because since some of the maps were prepared&mdash;and as I said, I believe that this rearrangement has been based on old-time maps&mdash;a number of new roads have been made. They have not been taken into consideration at all.</P>
      <P>The question of changing a person's address is an inconvenience, for some time, at any rate, and I think a certain length of time should be given in that respect.  I know that districts have been enlarged, and have been doubled in a number of instances and district postmen have to undertake that extra work.  Strange though it may seem&mdash; and it appears very strange to me that the Minister should be in any way a party to it&mdash;in cases where the districts have been doubled, the weekly wage has been reduced by amounts from 1/- and 5/-.  I do not think the Minister should countenance that.  Last year, an increase of 11/- was given to these men and a certain amount is now being taken away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then, we have the case of a number of men who were temporarily employed but whose temporary employment was almost whole-time.  They are now disemployed as a result of this.  When this action was contemplated, men with nine and ten years' service with the Post Office in a temporary capacity should have been trained as van drivers and kept in the service, instead of new men being brought into the service and these men being put on the unemployed list.  I hope that this is merely a temporary arrangement which will be further considered and that a surveyor or some official of that type will be sent out with the postmen.  Furthermore, the people in the sub-post offices now have to get up at 6 o'clock <Col N="649" /> in the morning and they get no extra remuneration for doing so.  So far as some of the postmen whom I know are concerned, they will not be able to do the work which they are now being called on to do within the scheduled time.  I know a postman who goes out at 7.30 in the morning and who is supposed to be back at 12.30. He would not be able to be back at 4 o'clock, if he were to do himself justice, and I would like the Minister to look into that matter with a view to bringing that arrangement to perfection, or as near as possible to perfection, and so avoid the hardships I mention which are imposed on the people concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make one thing quite clear.  When we moved last week to refer back the Estimate, it was for the purpose of enabling the Dáil to express general disapproval of the administration of the Department and particularly of the action of the Government in increasing the postal rates subsequent to last year's Budget. The submission of the Estimate for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs this year was the first occasion upon which the Dáil had an opportunity of expressing approval or otherwise of the action of the Minister in increasing postal charges.  I think I am right in saying that the method they adopted for the purpose of effecting that increase in charges was almost without precedent.  Always in the past any substantial alteration of postal charges, an alteration capable of yielding an additional £250,000 to the Exchequer, was notified to the Dáil in the Budget and was discussed by the Dáil as part of the Government's financial proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House is aware that this Government, having made no forecast in the Budget of any intention to increase postal charges and having claimed that it was their policy to reduce taxation. subsequent to the adjournment of the Dáil for the Summer Recess last year, announced an alteration in postal charges by Order.  The Dáil had no opportunity of discussing that action as it could have discussed any other proposal to increase Exchequer revenue and it had no opportunity certainly of expressing, by vote, its approval or <Col N="650" /> disapproval of that action until the Estimate for the Department was submitted to the Dáil this year.  The decision to ask the Dáil to refer back the Estimate for the Department for reconsideration was based upon that fact in particular, as well as the general feeling of dissatisfaction with the administration of the Department which was expressed here last year by many Deputies.  It was only subsequent to the commencement of the debate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and disorderly interruption by the claque on the Front Bench will not stop me.  It was only subsequent to the commencement of <Col N="651" /> the debate that the Dáil learned of the intention of the Government to withdraw this privilege of free postage.  I take it that that decision of the Government has been reversed and what the Minister meant to convey to-day is that it has been completely abandoned. There is certainly no sense in this suggestion that it would be possible to leave the privilege available to some people and to check up where the Minister believes there is abuse.  If we are asked seriously to believe that a Minister getting an unstamped letter dealing with official business will pass it on to his Department to be dealt with, whereas if the letter contains a subscription to Party funds, he will send it back, it is taxing the credulity of Deputies and the public far too much.  In fact, what the Minister meant was that he was retreating from the decision he announced on Thursday and this reference to an effort to discriminate between one type of letter or another is merely a smokescreen to disguise his retreat.  We are glad he has retreated.  We think he has made a wise decision, and we think he would be much straighter with the Dáil if he announced that he has retreated and that the position in future is going to be as it was in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion to refer back the Estimate for reconsideration, which is again before the Dáil, and which will be voted on was not moved merely because of our objection to that particular proposal of the Minister.  It is intended as a means by which the Dáil can express its disapproval of the actions of the Minister and the Government during the past year, with particular reference to the increase in postal charges which they effected by administrative Order during that period.  May I say this to the Dáil before I conclude: if we can persuade a majority of the Deputies to support this motion to refer back the Estimate, we do not mean that the Government can hold a hasty meeting out there in the corridor, submit the Estimate for reconsideration and bring it in again?  We mean that we disapprove of the administration of the Department and demand from the Government the withdrawal <Col N="652" /> of the increase in postal charges which they effected last year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoderickJamesConnoll" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that Deputy Lemass is extremely wide of the mark. He gives as the reason for the reference back on Thursday the increase in the postal charges which was decided upon by the Minister subsequent to the summer Adjournment.  He evidently has not taken the precaution of reading columns 361 and 362 of the Official Report, Volume 117.  If he had, he would have seen that the ex-Minister, who hesitated as to the correct procedure, asked the question of the Chair whether he could move the Estimate back,</P>
      <P>&ldquo;so that we can discuss it&rdquo;,</P>
      <P>and reserve his right to speak later. He was told by the Chair that he could not adopt that procedure,</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the reason being that in every case the question is widened by referring it back and the House is entitled to know for what reason and to debate the full matter&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;for what reason&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Deputy Little then gives his reason&mdash; merely to widen the debate so as to discuss policy rather than Departmental matters.  He goes through the different Departmental matters.  He talks about having seen the machine working from the outside and how different it looked from working on the inside.  He asked for some more details in regard to certain figures.  He goes into some of these figures in reference to various details&mdash;never mentioning the increase in postal charges.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoderickJamesConnoll" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>After that, he comes to the question of policy.  He relates the question of policy to the question of telephones and telegraphs which he refers to as the nerve centres of the whole system of commerce and of industry.  He tells us how much these brought in last year&mdash;£35,000,000.  He says that the Minister's policy deserves to be criticised because they have not gone out on a bold enough scheme.  He goes on to talk about telephone development.  He asks for various figures in reference to this and the <Col N="653" /> development facilities all over the country.  He talks about Departmental policy in reference to telephone exchanges.  He urges the Minister to develop the telephone to the fullest possible extent, as nothing more impresses a stranger as the wide use of the telephone.  He contrasts Ireland with other countries which, though smaller in size, have a larger population because they have developed their industries and that that should be our objective.</P>

It is quite an elementary matter of debate, which anyone accustomed to debate knows, that the proposer of a motion, the one who takes the initiative, should certainly lay down the fundamental principles upon which that step is based. Deputy Little was lamentably lacking in knowledge of his subject.  Deputy Lemass has to come in to-day to try to rectify the matter.</P>

      <P>He had to act the big boy towards the little boy on the Front Bench.  He has to correct his little brother and to protect him.  He is able to do so.  We must give Deputy Lemass every credit for having done it.  If the matter went to the country, as Deputy Little presented it, we would not be fighting the case at all on a matter as pungent and as full of resource as Deputy Lemass has now given to the Opposition.  He is the real inspiration of the Opposition&mdash;and Deputy Little might as well realise that now and admit that he was badly misled about this matter.  He did not understand the Minister's speech.  It would seem that he did not read it or study it although he was given a copy of it and should have done so.  He left it to Deputy Briscoe to find out this paragraph that caused all the trouble&mdash;the paragraph about the 2½d. stamp and prepaid postage.  He had not noticed that as a very good point to attack. Had he done so, and had he been as gifted as Deputy Lemass is, a case might have been made and well made for the Opposition.  I think the Opposition is to be congratulated on the work they did.  They are entitled to keep the Deputies of this House and the Ministers on their toes.  Ministers undoubtedly have a right to have severe criticism from the Opposition.  That is the duty of an Opposition.  Fianna Fáil <Col N="656" /> have carried out that duty well.  This is a democratic country.  We are cntitled to applaud sincerely what Deputy MacEntee has said&mdash;not in any gibing or sneering fashion.  We sincerely applaud the fact that this country has been able to carry out a democratic act in the way in which it has been done&mdash;with, perhaps, too much furore.</P>
      <P>The Opposition were not as smart or as clever as they appeared to think they were.  When they did this they did it with commendable credit to themselves in regard to that one matter, but to think that they would thereby plunge the country into a general election was overshooting the mark.  They picked the wrong time and they picked a matter which the public consider as frivolous&mdash;and they will not be permitted to repeat that experiment.</P>

      <P>No.  I think they have given a lesson to any Party which may be in opposition in the future to be as much on their toes as Fianna Fáil were on their toes this session.  It is wonderful for some of the older Deputies to see some of the members of the Fianna Fáil Party springing to life after such a long somnambulance.  I would say that the Opposition cannot repeat that experiment.  They cannot do it again.  The only effect of their having done it on a wrong Estimate and on the wrong day&mdash;because they should have chosen Friday instead of Thursday&mdash;will be that some very optimistic Deputies perhaps who were not giving us time to get our Works Bill, our Land Reclamation Bill and the remainder of the Government's programme put into operation, and thus enable us to reap the benefits of these projects, will not be in a position to rush to the country as they fondly imagined.  Instead of having an early general election, Fianna Fáil, by their tactics of having a snap division, have postponed the general election by probably four years.</P>

      <P>The statement has been made, I think by the Minister for <Col N="657" /> Finance, that nobody in the course of the debate referred to the interim increase in postage that had been mentioned by Deputy Lemass. I would refer the Minister for Finance to the speech of Deputy Lynch, as given in column 391, to that of Deputy O'Rourke, column 404, and that of Deputy Allen, column 420.  Each of these Deputies definitely referred to the increased postage and pointed out the objections in the manner in which Deputy Lemass has referred to it.</P>
      <P>Coming back to the main issue of the reintroduction to-day of this Estimate, I would like the House to be quite clear on this.  If Deputies read the statement of the Minister in introducing the Estimate, they will see that it was quite clear that it was the intention to do otherwise than what is said here to-day.

      <P>It is so difficult to deal with the two Deputies O'Higgins.  On that particular point the Minister might be a little bit more frank with the House than he has been to-day.  It was his intention to do a certain thing. Everyone who spoke on it was left in the state of mind that what he was saying was correct.  No one interjected to say that that was not the intention. The Minister did not say it was not the intention.  Towards the end of the debate, when the Minister was replying, he actually said he was prepared to compromise with the Deputies &mdash;and certain Deputies stated they did not want a compromise, as far as their postage was concerned; that they were speaking on behalf of the public; and the Minister would not withdraw the new suggestion, as far as the ordinary public was concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, this evening the Minister tries to state that it was intended only to deal with a certain type of letter, with somebody who writes to him saying he does not like a record which is played over Radio Éireann or someone who wants another record played.  I am glad to see that there is a change. When the Minister for Finance came in <Col N="659" /> here on Friday morning, and indicated his motion to reintroduce the Estimate, he actually used the words: &ldquo;Word for word as it was introduced in the first instance&rdquo;.  There was going to be no change whatsoever.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance very often quotes from debates and he could not read in column 356 any other meaning than what the whole Dáil took out of it last Thursday-speaker after speaker, with no interjection from the Minister.  As a matter of fact, I heard certain members of the Government Benches actually making comments that they were surprised that Deputy Little had not spotted this particular thing. Here is what the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It has accordingly&rdquo;</P>
      <P>that is very official language; it is a considered thing, and language that was used in a written, prepared statement&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>To the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  I thank Deputy MacEntee for that correction.  The statement was made that there was an abuse growing up.  It had been said it was the practice for a long time to have letters sent and admitted free of postage if they were on the business of the State.  That was the keynote of the remark the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs made.  The phrase to which Deputy Briscoe referred comes immediately after that.  It was in the context of the abuses with regard to letters.  The whole position was as to whether letters were sent on the business of the State or not.  There is an abuse and the abuse is going to be stopped.  It cannot be stopped in this manner, on which so much attempted ridicule has been poured, of trying to decide by looking at the cover alone of a letter whether it is on the business of the State or not.  That is not the way in which to stop it.  It is hoped that people will realise that they have been abusing a privilege and that they will not write these letters.</P>
      <P>There is another way of dealing with it.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs gave the example of letters sent to his Department containing recommendations for people.  These clearly were not on State business. If people get it into their heads that letters recommending candidates for posts will not be attended to unless they are stamped in the ordinary way, they may come to decide that it would be worth while putting a stamp on them.  The main object in this is not to gain money.  Certain comments were made here that certain phrases were used and not countered by the Minister.  There was one remark that came from Deputy Briscoe that could have been countered at once.  The Deputy asked how much money was in this.  There is not one penny in it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Prepaid postage is one thing that I can deal with, but the Deputy's state of mind is another, and with regard to that I would rather deal with a 2½d. stamp.  It is much easier to do so.  Deputy Childers seemed to look on this as an easy way of achieving a fair amount of revenue because he asked that it be spent in a different way.  There is no money in this.</P>

      <P>I do not think the Minister did interrupt&mdash;certainly not in the way that I think that he should have&mdash;in the debate.  There is not one penny of money in this from the finance angle.  The Estimate for the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is not increased by one penny piece on account of this.  It is not expected that there will be any money coming from it, but it is hoped that there will be a lessening of this type of letter, of people asking for the autographs of folk whose songs are played over Radio Éireann, of people wanting to send in recommendations for candidates, and, particularly, of firms sending in contracts for stores.  In the case of the latter, we hope that they will stamp their letters. We hope that other people simply will not write letters in the way they have been doing, and in that way that there will be some easing, some little saving from the staff point of view.  But there is not a penny of money in this for what has been called the hard-pressed Minister for Finance, even with a dishonest Budget.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>And so it does, but there is no intention of getting money out of it.  We want to put a stop on this free service.  We think it ought not to be free.  Supposing I was to face Deputies next year and say that I wanted some small tax that would bring in £25,000 and that I required it because of the expense the Post Office was involved in, expense that it should not be involved in through having to deliver the letters of business people and of other senders on matters that had nothing to do with State business, would not every Deputy be up in arms against me for taxing the people for providing free postage where it was not required?  There are abuses and definite abuses.  The only way, I think, in which these abuses can be got at is by having it made known through the Press that the abuses have been recognised, and that an appeal is being made to people not to send in this type of letter unless they think it worth while to put a stamp on it.  But, may I say again, there is no hope of extra money accruing to the State revenues by what was said here on Friday.  If it comes in, all the better, but the hope is that this type of Post Office service will not be demanded.  I hope it will be made clear to people that, if they want to write letters recommending candidates or looking for contracts, they will realise that their letters will not get the same attention unless they obey the law, and do not make the abuse still heavier than what it has been.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know if I am entitled to refer to the matter of the Post Office Savings Bank.  It has been said that this fund has been raided twice.  At a time when this money was lying in hand, the Party opposite had to reduce the interest rate.  I restored the interest rate on the money lying there. These are what are called &ldquo;dormant balances&rdquo;.  I hold that I am perfectly <Col N="664" /> entitled to bring that money to the relief of the taxpayers.  I have no excuse to offer for that.</P>
    <P>On this other matter which has been made a bone of contention in the debate, the question of Post Office charges achieved by Order last year, that is the proper way in which these charges should be made.  There can be no gainsaying that.</P>

      <P>It was not known. The question was raised at a critical point late in May&mdash;that the application of the 11/- increase made to industrial workers outside should apply to Post Office workers.  It was decided to pay that sum of money.  It was also decided, so to speak, to make the punishment fit the crime&mdash;that the proper way to look for the money required to pay the Post Office workers the wage increase was by increasing the Post Office charges.  It has been generally accepted here that the Post Office service should be made as near as possible a self-supporting concern. If the wages of the Post Office employees are increased, is it not a proper thing to have the increase put on the service which these employees render?</P>

      <P>I do not believe it is.  If Deputies are not able to put two and two together&mdash;that increased wages to Post Office employees will mean increased Post Office charges&mdash;I do not know why I should be expected <Col N="666" /> to come into the House to cross the &ldquo;t's&rdquo; and dot the &ldquo;i's&rdquo; for them. However, that is the explanation.  It has been said that this debate&mdash;the reference back of this last Thursday&mdash; was due to this matter of increased charges.  Any reference there was to the increased charges&mdash;and it was very, very small&mdash;did not arise in relation to that matter itself but in relation to what was called this new charge of the increased postage because of what was called the deprivation of the old-time privilege with regard to free letters, and that was all based on the mistake that there was any money in this.  There is no money in this.  There never was.  If something little accrues to the State, very good, it may lead to some remission in some other way next year, but there is no expectation that there will be any money.  There is an expectation that this abuse will not go on.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance's reiteration that there is no money in this is rather surprising, having regard to the fact that the Minister for Finance has himself come down here and has, apparently, taken the conduct of this debate out of the hands of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  If the Minister for Finance wants us to believe now that this is purely a matter of convenience within the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, surely the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is competent to talk about administration within his own Department.  If, up to this moment, rightly or wrongly, no matter how the facts may be, Deputies have assumed that there is a substantial matter of finance involved, at least colour has been lent to that by the fact that not only here to-day does the Minister for Finance sit in the leading seat in this House, apparently directing this whole debate for the Government, not only does he come in and take charge when it has become a matter of confidence last week, but he has virtually held his fire to speak until almost all Deputies in this House had spoken and then, apparently, replies authoritatively.</P>

      <P>He is.  I am not in the least in any way criticising the Minister for Finance's right to talk, but the Minister for Finance is a member of the dominant Party in the Coalition and, apparently, at certain times every other Party must dance to the tune of that dominant Party. However, to come now more specifically to this question involved, there can be no doubt in the mind of anybody impartially reading the report of the debate on the previous occasion, starting at column 356, where the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs said &mdash;the Chair will pardon me if I quote the complete paragraph:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A matter which has been causing considerable concern is the extent to which correspondence from the public for Government Departments is being posted without payment of postage.  It has been the practice of the Post Office to accept and deliver all such correspondence, but this arrangement was originally intended to apply only to correspondence which was on the business of the State.  It has, of course, been impossible for the Post Office to determine what correspondence posted by the public in private envelopes is on the business of the State, but from a recent examination of correspondence for my own Department, it is clear that many letters which should have been prepaid were posted without postage.  It has, accordingly, been decided that letters addressed to Government Departments will have to be fully prepaid by the senders in future, unless, of course, an official paid envelope supplied by a Government Department for the purpose is used.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As pointed out by Deputy Briscoe, I think, in connection with this, here is a reasoned, formal statement made by a Minister and I should imagine in conformity with his brief.  It is a statement that we are entitled and that the public are entitled to take as a reasoned statement from a Department and we are entitled to assume that a Department and a Minister is open and above-board with the public and that nothing is hidden away in words: in other words, that lawyers' subtleties <Col N="668" /> are not employed and that the words mean what they appear to mean to the ordinary man.  I think the public and we are entitled to that from a Department and from a Minister.</P>
    <P>Taking these words in that sense, particularly having regard to the statement that it is impossible for the Post Office to determine what correspondence posted by the public in private envelopes is on the business of the State, and then the definite statement that letters addressed to Government Departments will have to be fully prepaid by the senders in future, unless of course, an official paid envelope supplied by a Government Department for the purpose is used, it was fair to assume that the Minister was announcing to this House that in future all correspondence addressed to a Government Department would have to bear a stamp.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Unless, of course, an official paid envelope is used and the Deputy knows as well as I do that a prepaid envelope carries a stamp. In any event, there is the statement of the Department and on that hypothesis the debate proceeded.  I am stating facts.  In regard to that, practically every Deputy from, I think, Deputy Briscoe who was the second speaker, onwards, on this side of the House, adverted to it.  Certainly, the Deputies named at the columns mentioned by Deputy Briscoe adverted to it and also to the previous imposition of tax by increasing the postage in a previous year.  Not only did Deputies on this side advert to it but Deputies such as Deputy Kyne&mdash;and he himself has intervened in this debate to show the accuracy of what he has said&mdash; joined in the course of opposition against the Minister in this matter and at the conclusion of that debate we find the Minister taking the stand that he must insist on it but that he is prepared to meet Deputies and he gives, particularly at column 448, his reasons.  He distinguishes consistently through that between what he calls State business and the other.  I will hand that to the Minister for Finance here to-day if he wants it.  Yes, I <Col N="669" /> admit the Minister made a distinction between what he called State business and the other but he made no other offer that I can find except the offer to meet Deputies and he used this phrase, particularly, at column 451, that he cannot give way to the public:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I will consider and help Deputies.  I know their trouble and their difficulties.  I know what they have to contend with but then I cannot give way to the public.  If it is to meet Deputies I am prepared to meet them and discuss the matter and give them every facility.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Then he goes on.  In the next column he says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I insist that the public must pay when they are writing on private matters to Government Departments.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Now, the issue, therefore, was this that Deputies here were not satisfied&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The point in this is that the Minister, having made that categorical statement, seeks to differentiate between private and public business. It is very difficult to see how as a matter of practical politics one could do it.  For instance&mdash;I am talking to this here now and I understand the Minister to have conceded this point&mdash;a person writing about an old age pension, a farmer writing about a claim he had from a Department in cases where, say, a manufacturing licence was involved, this, according to the way you looked at it, could be <Col N="670" /> and most probably would be put in a category of private matters.  Were these to be matters which would require to have stamped envelopes?  It was on the question as to whether the public were entitled&mdash;and I think all Deputies are agreed that on such matters the public were entitled&mdash;to have free access to Departments that the issue was raised.  Now, I take it from the Minister&mdash;and I would ask the Minister now to make it very clear &mdash;that people writing on old age pensions, farmers writing in connection with schemes, anybody writing in connection with private matters that require Government intervention, that are not merely requests for autographs which we heard so much about will be free.</P>
      <P>All matters which are business between the State and the individual can be looked on, according as you look at the parties, as private or public. If the State came into it or any right from the State, one person may call them private matters because they are personal to the individual, and another may call them public because public funds and public administration are involved.  In those categories, anyway, I take it the Minister is now telling us&mdash;and I ask him to clear the air&mdash;that on such communications there will be free access to Government Departments as there has been heretofore.  I will give him his point about the autographs.</P>
      <P>There is one point with regard to radio records.  It is all right to say that the people are not to write in freely to the Departments about radio records, but it would be well to remember that the average owner of a radio set is paying 12/6 for his licence and is entitled to service, and this mechanism by which requests are got is a very convenient way for the Department to keep in touch with the public and give the public what they want.  I am prepared to argue on such matters in the interests of the licence holders from the point of view of giving the citizens as nearly as possible what they want.  I think there is a case for asking for the old situation to continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, moving from that, there is the <Col N="671" /> financial aspect of all this.  If a Minister says something in the House, categorically, I shall be very slow not to accept what he has said.  But I ask this objectively without reference to personalities. How many letters are involved? The Minister has the way of knowing the figures.  A certain number of letters is reaching the Departments every day unfranked or unstamped, but they are sufficient in number, whether from a money or an administrative point of view, to warrant the Minister making this specific provision and to warrant the Minister for Finance coming in and taking control of all this debate and the affairs relating thereto. I am prepared to believe the number involved is substantial.  What is the probable number if you cut off the free franking?</P>
    <P>It is undoubtedly true that if the Minister were to carry through what we and some Deputies on the far side of the House only last week assumed to be his intention there would be a certain decline in the present numbers, but in any event, even working out the casualties due to the fact that a 2½d. stamp would have to be procured for every letter going to the Department, a certain number of letters would still reach the Government Department each day and each letter would account for 2½d.  In the absence of the figures I am unable to complete the sum, but the Minister should be able to tell us the number involved, what the estimated decrease in the number to be received is, and we can multiply the proper figure by 2½d. and get the answer in pence.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It may then be too late.  Last year the postage in other categories was increased and we did not get an opportunity of discussing it until last week.  There is no harm in asking for it now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>But you did get an opportunity of discussing it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is this. I do not know whether it is substantial or trivial, but there is definitely some financial aspect.  The working out of <Col N="672" /> that sum may show it is trivial and I make no point about that; but there is definitely a question there in relation to finance and revenue which we are entitled to ask.  Quite apart from the inconvenience to the farmer, there is this point, that whatever additional revenue, be it little or large, is collected from that source, it means revenue, and one thing I would object to in principle, even if the additional revenue were only ld., is that in a Coalition Government the Minister for Finance, a representative of the major Party, can give reliefs with the appearance that the reliefs are coming from the major Party and hide away in the Estimates of Ministers from other elements of the Coalition concealed taxation and let them take the rap.</P>
      <P>An attempt is being made to say there has been no change.  If there has been no change in what has been presented by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to-day, it is an awful pity the matter was not cleared in the previous debate and a lot of fuss would have been saved.  I remember an occasion recently when the Minister for Defence in a debate here, when some of us took a figure by mistake, quietly and quickly intervened and put the debate on the right road and all misapprehensions were cleared up.  Why does it have to go the length of having the Government defeated on the Vote, the reintroduction of the Vote, and an explanation offered here to-day that was not given on what was meant to take the place of a vote of confidence without the embarrassment of a full discussion of the type that would follow a vote of confidence?  Why does the Minister for Finance get up now and say there is no change?</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to make it clear that letters of a non-important nature, such as looking for his autograph, will require a stamp and that letters from old age pensioners, farmers and anybody else dealing with what may be personal business but has relation to the State, will be carried free as heretofore?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I would like very much to know, in spite of the Minister for Finance and his quick criticisms of Deputies on this side of the House, the <Col N="673" /> exact machinery by which differentiation between the two types of correspondence will be effected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to take this opportunity of congratulating the Minister on the very fine work he has done during the past year and the efficient manner in which he has carried it out.  There is no doubt that the Minister and his Department, with the means at their disposal, have done much that has commanded the praise and respect of the people. It is true the Minister will, in the course of the next year, extend the activities of the Post Office and I hope he will be in a position to do so, particularly the telephone service.</P>
      <P>The position of the Post Office is rather peculiar.  When I look back some 20 or 25 years, I realise that at that time the Post Office was losing practically £500,000 a year.  So far as my memory goes, I think, prior to the signing of the Treaty, the Post Office in the United Kingdom and Ireland was losing £1,000,000 each year.  That is a thing that Deputies opposite ought to realise, because their own Government had to realise it.  To-day the Post Office is almost self-sufficient and, due to the work of the various Ministers, we have here services equal to the postal services in any country of its size in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made to some minor matters in relation to what the Minister has done.  I was particularly amused by the reference made by Deputy McGrath to the importation by the Minister of dressed telegraph poles ready for erection.  He asked the Minister to ensure that future imports should be brought in in the raw state. I understand that Deputy McGrath is a tradesman.  He would be just as logical and consistent if he asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce, instead of bringing in timber prepared and ready for use in building construction and in the erection of houses which are so vitally essential at the moment, he would bring in round timber in the rough.  Would Deputy McGrath like to get a bar of iron with humps on every three or four inches of it instead of getting the prepared iron that is imported at the moment? <Col N="674" /> These are the kind of criticisms with which the Minister has to contend.  I appeal to the Deputies opposite to exercise a little commonsense in matters of this kind.</P>
    <P>An attempt was made to create the impression here this evening that the people in the country were shrieking in indignation because they would be expected in the future to put a 2½d. stamp on every letter sent to a Government Department.  I have travelled the length and breadth of my county during the past few days.  I heard not a single word of criticism of the action of the Minister in that regard.  Like the people in every other county, the people in my county are at the moment busily engaged on the one thing; they are looking upwards to the clouds, praying and hoping for the long-delayed rainfall that will bring relief to everybody concerned.  They are not paying any particular attention to the speeches delivered here this evening.</P>
    <P>We look upon the world at the moment and we see the dangers that exist therein and we see the problems with which the statesmen of the world are confronted.  Thanks to the present Government and to the previous Government, too, we occupy a happy position here.  Why all this hullabaloo ever a simple matter as to whether a person should or should not put a 2½d. stamp on a letter?  One wonders whether we really are in earnest.  One wonders whether all this criticism is not due to the fact that the Opposition Deputies are not in a position to plunge this country into the wholly unnecessary expense of a general election.</P>

      <P>I did not think we would go back as far as telegraph poles this evening.  I would like to point out to Deputy Coburn that a deputation of workers employed in dressing these poles waited on me and asked me to do something about the importation of ready dressed poles.  The work of dressing the poles gave employment to about 40 men.  If Deputy Coburn prefers to have the poles dressed in the country of origin and to let the men employed on that work here go on the dole, that is a matter for himself. I do not subscribe to such a system. <Col N="675" /> I would prefer to give our men all the employment we can.</P>

I think it would be just as cheap to employ men dressing the poles as it is to have them drawing the dole.  I think Deputy Coburn would have been well advised to leave the poles out of it and not think this was a stupid, silly remark of Deputy McGrath.  Deputy McGrath speaks from experience.  He has met the men who became idle as a result of bringing in these dressed poles.  Might I remind Deputy Coburn that iron was brought in with lumps on it and rolled down in Haulbowline? I would prefer to see it coming in in that state and giving ultimate employment to our own people rather than give employment to people in some other country.

That means that people will be put to the trouble of writing two letters.  First of <Col N="676" /> all, I want to know will the initial letter be delivered free?</P>
      <P>With regard to another point, when Ministers are writing to their constituents on constituency business will their letters go out free from their offices?  Will the ordinary Deputy have to pay?  I would like the Minister to straighten that matter out.</P>

      <P>Tá cúpla ceist agam le cur ar an Aire Airgeadais.  I understand that there are 60,000 letters received yearly in the Department of Lands.  These letters come from rural constituencies and deal with time to pay annuities, vesting of the land, claims for farms, land provision and housing under the Land Commission. Are all these people now to pay postage?  Is it the intention not to reply to these requests for farms, for time to pay annuities, queries about the vesting of farms?  Are none of these 60,000 letters addressed annually to the Land Commission to be replied to?  Every Deputy on the Government Benches from a rural constituency knows that the biggest thing they have to deal with is the question of farms and lands.  It is the biggest part of their correspondence.  Are we to understand from the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs that requests for deferment of payment, for vesting of farms, for grants for houses and various other things that concern the 400,000 farmers in this country, the biggest section of the community, will not be dealt with unless the letters are stamped?</P>

      <P>In the reference back I do not know what case to meet.  Deputy Lemass points out to-night that the reason why it was referred back was owing to no notice and no opportunity <Col N="677" /> being given for a debate on the increased postage of last year.  Deputy Vivion de Valera gets himself worked up into great excitement and he gives a quotation of the statement I made last week, but he does not complete it. If he had completed the sentence you would have heard, and would have read, where I said: &ldquo;Where it is the business of the State there will be no change.&rdquo;  That was the position.  However, the Opposition, through their clever tactics, worked out their propaganda that we meant to tack it on to the old-age pensioners, but at the same time they forgot the vote against the increase of old-age pensions a year ago.  You are accusing me of trying to make the aged and the infirm people pay something extra for making an application for their pension.  I said there were no changes.  It was only in your mind that we were going to ask the people to pay.  I said deliberately the only ones we were asking were the wealthy people&mdash;not the poorer section &mdash;who are asking for concessions not in the interests of the State.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>We send to farmers and others a franked envelope or a slip of paper just the same as you get in your income-tax.  The whole argument here to-night by Deputy Lemass was that there was no opportunity given last year to debate the increase in the postage.  Let us read my statement last year in the debate.  Volume 112, column 813 of the Official Reports on the 20th July, 1948:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Certain schemes were put up to the Minister for Finance and the Government.  It was not considered necessary at the time the Budget was being framed to put on these extra charges.  Immediately after the Budget statement I was faced with demands for increased wages from the staff.  I was faced with increased demands from Córas Iompair Éireann in order to give the country people a mail service.  These services cost a very considerable sum.  Now the Department of Posts and Telegraphs is a commercial undertaking <Col N="678" /> and has to bring in revenue.  I have been informed that the rates for papers have not been revised for a long time back.  Faced with that problem we had no other alternative except to increase our rates in order to meet the exceptional demands. Had I not secured those increases I am perfectly certain that Deputy Little would have been the first to condemn the Department for not taking appropriate action.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was on the Estimate last year when the matter of these charges was debated by the Opposition.  To-night I am faced with Deputy Lemass, who says the reason why the Estimate was referred back was because he wanted to get an opportunity to protest against the charges being put on without giving the Dáil an opportunity to discuss them at the present time.</P>
    <P>With regard to the reason why the increase was put on, I was faced with a cost of £336,000 for increased wages and other things I mentioned.  That was the annual wages bill.  The Department had no option but to look for additional revenue, as we must maintain a self-supporting Department. Now, the Opposition has found that, with all their misrepresentation in connection with the matter, there is no change other than that the people who are using the letters, even to Deputies, putting Éire on the envelopes, asking for subscriptions for the erection of a hall, are not to go free.  Will the Deputy not be pleased that the letter probably will not be delivered?  How would he like to be charged 5d.?  Surely he cannot contend that wealthy people looking for contracts from the various Government Departments should not pay postage. Are these the people Deputy Corry wants to get free postage for?  I am not going to ask the poorer section of the people to bear the costs when these wealthy combines take the advantage of writing to Government Departments asking for contracts.  I am sure no Deputy present will agree to that arrangement; it has been abused.  However, as far as Deputies are concerned, I am giving a freer concession than they ever had before. I am giving the public a concession, because under the Act they are not <Col N="679" /> entitled to it.  Deputy Corry cannot get away with making out that we are going to charge the farmer.  The farmer would not object to getting £100 grant.  If he sends up his application he will get a prepaid envelope back, the same as with regard to income-tax.  He will not have to pay on his taxes.  If he is writing to Deputy Corry for a subscription, either Deputy Corry will pay on it or he will pay on it.</P>
    <P>We only hear, as I said, a whole misrepresentation in connection with this matter.  I said I do not know what case to meet.  Deputy Lemass puts forth one argument giving his reasons. I pointed out to him that he has overlooked the fact that that was discussed last year.  Now you have shifted your tactics on to another point; you may take it from the old age pensioners and we will never forgive you.  There is no use trying to use your propaganda for them to-night.  The road worker will not forgive.  Your 2d. increase to-day was no use to the road worker when he was starving.  I have tried to do my best for all sections of the community.  The road workers have got 10/- and 12/- increase where you refused to give them only 2d. to-day. You used your Standstill Order against any man for getting an increase.  When you are in a hypocritical mood as you have been for the last two days it is only politics you are playing.</P>

As I have said, the old age pensioners will never give you a chance again, neither will the road worker, nor the widows and orphans.  They are never going to put Deputy Corry in a position in which he can vote against them again.  He is one of the astutest politicians in this House.  I have heard him here, when we occupied the Opposition Benches, getting up and criticising the Government then in office, but when into the matter came to a vote he went into the division lobby to support that Government and to vote against those whom he pretended to support.</P>

That is the difference between Parties on that side of the House and on this side.  Deputies on this side have a right to criticise, and that is what will make Ministers do what is right.  That is what makes this Government the servants of the people and not their bosses.  There have been too many instances in the past where the Government <Col N="681" /> forgot the people, where Ministers did not associate with the plain people and where they would not allow Deputies to express the views of their constituents.  We have now on this side of the House Deputies holding various opinions who are free to express their opinions publicly without fear of being carpeted or expelled from the Party for doing so.  They are free to criticise Ministers any time they wish to do so.  That is true democracy and I welcome it.  I have always welcomed constructive criticism and have never objected to it.  Because of such constructive criticism, Ministers are always on the alert and try to meet the wishes of the people.  It is in that spirit that I submit my Estimate for the judgment of the House.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>At the end of sub-section (4) to add the words &ldquo;and shall be accounted for in the Vote for Gaeltacht Services of the annual Estimates for public services&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister is responsible to the House for all expenditure taking place under the Vote for which he is charged and on the annual Estimates the House has an opportunity of reviewing the administration of this Department, other Departments and any ancillary matters in which Deputies may be interested. The fundamental position, of course, is that the House is responsible for expenditure and the House controls it.  The Minister comes with his annual Estimate and then there is a discussion upon his proposals.  Fault has been found in the past with the system of State or semi-State companies for which the House provides the money although it has not an opportunity on the annual Estimate or in some other way of reviewing their work.  Such State or semi-State company is precluded because as it is financed in another manner it will be declared to be out of order for the House to discuss its working.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this Bill the Minister is taking the majority holding in regard to a company which has very important work to perform and which will certainly, I am sure, be of the greatest possible advantage to the Gaeltacht area.  I think there is no sound reason why the House should not have the opportunity of getting the fullest possible explanation about the working of this particular scheme.  It may be that for technical reasons the Minister had to adopt this particular procedure of taking the majority holding of the shares of the company and working through a nominee, but it is certainly a principle that is, I think, at variance with the principle that he is responsible to the House and that the House controls expenditure, as when this Bill becomes law we are to have no opportunity whatever on the annual Estimate of referring to the operation of this company.  The Minister has given us no information as to the exact functions of this nominee.  I understand that this nominee who will represent him on the board will be a civil servant.  If this civil servant performs whatever duties attach to this post of nominee during his ordinary working hours, or, indeed, after his ordinary working hours, as part of his Civil Service duties, it seems to me right and proper that the work he does there representing the Minister&mdash;in fact, he is only acting by the Minister's direction and carrying out the Minister's policy&mdash;should come up for review.  Since he is responsible, as I have said, in a particular way to the Minister, I can see no reason why the work he does representing the Minister in this particular company should not <Col N="687" /> come up for review precisely in the same way as the work of other officials who administer schemes in connection with Gaeltacht industries.</P>
    <P>Though it is very difficult as the Bill stands to secure the aim I have in mind of having the position that the Dáil will be entitled to review the work of the company when the annual Estimates are under discussion, I think that this amendment may go some distance at any rate to enable us to refer to the work of the company upon these Estimates.  If the Minister is going to give us assurance that arrangements will be made by which it will be made clear in the annual Estimate for Gaeltacht services that whatever remuneration this civil servant gets by reason of his work as nominee will be clearly stated then of course the question will settle itself, but I am assuming that that is not the Minister's intention.  I propose that not alone will arrangements be made in regard to certain matters which are provided for under Section 4 but that there will be a definite direction from the House that these matters shall also be accounted for as far as expenditure is concerned by definite reference under the Gaeltacht Vote.</P>

I refer particularly to the developments in the seaweed industry in Northern Europe.</P>

      <P>I cannot accept this amendment because it is not Parliamentary procedure to account for money that is not in the Vote.  There will be a certain amount of expenditure under certain sub-heads for the purchase of searods, and other kinds of seaweed, too, I hope, and as such that would be accounted for, but I think as the Deputy had some experience in the Government for a very considerable period he must be aware by now that this amendment if added would be totally unworkable.  In other words, it would be asking the Minister for Lands to account for expenditure, to account for the affairs of a semi-private company.  I cannot accept the amendment in the form in which it has been put down. At a later stage, I hope to ask the House to accept an amendment of mine which I think should meet the wishes of the Deputy and of the other Deputies who raised this matter previously.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To delete all words after the word &ldquo;a&rdquo; in line 13 and to insert instead the following words: &ldquo;report on the working of the company during the <Col N="690" /> preceding accounting year and a balance sheet, a trading account and a profit and loss account of the company for the same year duly audited by the auditor of the company.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment is designed to secure the fullest possible information from the Minister as to the working of the company during the year.  The Bill merely specifies that a balance sheet and profit and loss account for the accounting year, audited by the company's auditors, shall be placed upon the Table of each House.  I think that a report on the working of the company would also be necessary, because, as I explained already, the accounts afford only very meagre information, even to those who are acquainted with the figures.  In the case of any companies in which the State has a direct interest of this nature and is actually responsible for the major control, the Oireachtas ought to be given fuller information through an annual report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I am absolutely in favour of furnishing a report on the working of the company and the amendment which I propose to move will, I think, meet the Deputy in that respect.  The amendment as it stands asks that a trading account be furnished. I might point out that the Minister for Lands proposes to purchase 51 per cent. of the shares, while 49 per cent. will be held by an outside company.  The Deputy should bear in mind that this is not a matter of the formation of a new company&mdash;we are merely taking over existing shares to prevent an industry from perhaps perishing completely, an industry which is only in its infancy but which promises to be very valuable from the point of view of the people along the coast, where these searods are thrown up.  It cannot be compared with other State-sponsored companies in that regard, because, in the case of the other companies to which I presume the Deputy is referring, the Minister for Finance holds all the shares.  I am sure that if the Deputy found himself Minister for Lands, he would have difficulty in saying how he proposed to compel the other half of the company to furnish their trading accounts &mdash;something which company law does <Col N="691" /> not provide for and which is not done by any other company or concerns. They might always, if they wished, withhold information.</P>
      <P>Our concern with this company is, first, to induce the people to gather the greatest quantity of searods, to purchase them and to pay them with money voted by the Oireachtas, and then to sell the searods to this company which will dry them by a special process and mill them into meal.  After that, we have finished with the searod product.  Our only desire is to expand the industry and to gather as much as possible of this type of seaweed.  About 3,000 tons were gathered last year and a total of £12,000 paid out.  There must be three or four times that amount going to loss, because the whole industry is only starting.  There may later, as I pointed out, if experiments at present under way prove successful, be another branch of the seaweed industry which will have a fairly promising future, in connection with the rock weed or bladder weed, as it is known along the coast.</P>
      <P>I cannot accept the amendment, as it is, but I suggest that the amendment which is in Deputies' hands, tabled by myself, will give the House the fullest possible opportunity for discussion. The report which the amendment envisages and the sub-head in the Vote for Gaeltacht Services each year will give ample room for full discussion, so that Deputies will be able to know all they want to know about the industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want information as to whether the Department is keeping in touch with developments in the seaweed industry in other places.  From a report which I have recently received I understand that a very important development has taken place in, I think, Norway and the Northern European countries.  A great many by-products of seaweed have been discovered and these are the basis of new industries.  There are, I understand, 16 different products being produced&mdash; among them food products, cosmetics, textiles, paint and lacquer.  If we could develop our seaweed industry along these lines it is quite obvious that a development of this sort would be of the first importance for the poorer areas.  Further, if other important industries such as the ones I have referred to could grow out of a development of this industry which the Minister is now taking over it would probably prove to be one of the most important developments for those areas for which it is so difficult to find suitable industries.</P>
      <P>I want to know if the Department is keeping in close touch with developments in other places and if, under this Bill, it is the Minister's intention to exploit these new discoveries to the fullest possible extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite a number of the by-products of seaweed are fairly valuable. For instance, the British War Office paid particular attention to any of the by-products of seaweed during the war years.  The cessation of hostilities has not thrown the whole industry overboard as, unfortunately, happened to the seaweed industry on two occasions before&mdash;(1) when the seaweed <Col N="693" /> was being used to produce iodine and when some deposit, I cannot recall the precise details at the moment, was found capable of producing iodine of as good if not better quality far cheaper and far simpler and (2) when kelp was being used for potash and unfortunately that only blossomed forth into something worth while when the usual supplies of potash were not available. In this new development it is the belief of experts that no other alternative raw material will be found to displace it.  As far as the quantity of seaweed, particularly around our western coast, is concerned, I have every hope that it will prove a very valuable industry.  It will never become a gigantic one or anything like that but it is one well worth fostering and developing and we are keeping a close eye on it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bartley said that he understands there are about 16 by-products. Actually there are 52.  Searods are scattered along the coast of Galway, Clare, and Donegal&mdash;the coast the Deputy knows so well.  The trouble is that this industry is only in its infancy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the kelp industry collapsed before, due to the introduction of potash from more plentiful and cheaper sources, people here became discouraged and allowed the seaweed to rot and it was not gathered, except in small quantities which were used to replace farmyard manure.  That is not the case now.  The total amount gathered last year was in the neighbourhood of 3,000 tons.  I am sure that the officials in Gaeltacht Services say that at least four times that amount is going to waste just because the people have not been educated, so to speak, and are not in the habit of gathering it.  Mind you, it is a very lucrative thing for them.  All they have to do is to gather the rods and so forth and place them on the walls or other suitable drying places so that they may reach the maximum air-dried condition. They are then purchased&mdash;cash on the spot.  Many people have found it to be a very useful industry and it is growing.  I have not a table with me at the moment but I think the industry has sprung from something around 400 tons per year to 3,000 tons per year, and even yet we have only barely <Col N="694" /> touched the fringe.  I have no doubt but that, with good careful management and a properly constituted drive to get in the greatest amount possible, the industry will flourish inside the next three, four or five years and that it will then be at least three times the size it is this year.  Then there is the question of the reorganisation of the company and also the fact that it may be found necessary to get better and more up-to date machinery for the drying and milling of kelp.  Incidentally, about 2,000 tons of turf are burned for the airing and drying of about 3,000 tons of searods.  If we can treble the amount of searods going to the factory it will mean 6,000 tons of turf needed in an area where bog is plentiful and where work is not always as plentiful as we would like it to be.  The turf will provide a useful little side-line.  Six thousand tons of turf are not easily got and production will provide a very useful amount of employment over a limited area.  We do not see many snags ahead and I hope snags will not arise.  We have every hope that the industry will grow for the people of the west coast.</P>
    <P>In my opening speech perhaps I did not make quite clear the fact that the best field for searods is that from Loop Head in Clare to the north of Donegal. It depends on the seabed, to a great extent.  If the shore slopes down steeply you do not have searods.  A gradual slope is required and the more of it there is at about six fathoms the greater the area of searods.  It very often happens, and it is happening even at the moment, that a lot of rods are lost&mdash;rods that could be gathered. We hope to round up that waste, to gather it up, because it will bring a fair amount of prosperity to many homes that at the present time may not be so prosperous.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That the Dáil approves of the Statute of the Council of Europe signed at London on the 5th May, 1949, a copy of which was laid on the <Col N="695" /> Table of the Dáil on the 23rd June, 1949.</P>
    <P>The statute which is being presented to the House for ratification in effect constitutes the first attempt of the closer degree of co-operation between the various nations of Europe.  True, at this stage unfortunately, it only includes ten European nations.  It is sincerely to be hoped that it will, with the passage of time, gradually come to include many of the European nations that are not now included.</P>
    <P>I will not conceal from the House that the statute is largely a compromise between a number of different views, ranging from very loose contact at Governmental and Parliamentary levels to a closely-knit federation of States akin to the United States of America.  In some respects it is bound to be disappointing, but at least it is a beginning which is capable of considerable enlargement.  The closer the contact that can be established between the Governments and Parliaments of Europe, at this stage, the more likely is the idea of a closer federation to develop.  I hope that we in Ireland will give the whole of this concept much more consideration than we have in the past.  It is an issue that deserves full discussion on a non-Party basis.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with the direct issues raised, it might be well to give the House a brief outline of the growth of the concept of European unity.  This may be of assistance to the members of the House in considering the proposal and particularly to those members of the House who will ultimately represent Ireland at the Assembly of the Council of Europe.</P>
    <P>Historically, the ideal of European unity is not new.  Ever since the break-up of the Roman Empire, the conception of European unity has continued to haunt the minds of philosophers and statesmen.</P>
    <P>The names of great writers and thinkers who have advocated the idea make a formidable list.  They include, at the beginning, the Duc de Sully, chief adviser to Henry IV of France, <Col N="696" /> whose &ldquo;Grand Design&rdquo; was published in 1638; William Penn, whose &ldquo;European Parliament&rdquo; was published in 1693; and the Abbe de Sainte Pierre, who, in his &ldquo;Perpetual Peace&rdquo;, written about the same time, said that &ldquo;great institutions are only gradually made&rdquo;, but that the sooner the idea of European unity was propagated, the sooner it would be attained. Bentham, Kant and Rousseau were others who advocated European political unity, putting forward concrete proposals in elaborate and carefully argued treatises.  Rousseau said that the realisation of the ideal was purely a question of whether the States of Europe had &ldquo;understanding enough to see their own interest and courage enough to act for their own happiness&rdquo;. It was in connection with his discussion of European unity that Rousseau used the phrase which has since become famous:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If, in spite of all this, the project remains unrealised, that is not because it is Utopian; it is because men are crazy and because to be sane in a world of madmen is in itself a kind of madness.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These arguments, however, had little effect on the current of European political development.  None of the moves towards unity in Europe since the 15th century was really anything more than a temporary league or alliance created in the face of a common enemy.  All of them collapsed when the threat was removed.  On the other hand, the process of regional federation in Europe made considerable progress in the 19th century.  In Germany, Switzerland and Italy the movement towards union successfully overcame difficulties presented by historical tradition, social custom and even language and culture.</P>
    <P>The first concrete step in the present century was taken in 1922, when Count Coudenhove-Kalergi founded the Pan Europa movement.  He believed that the unity of Europe was essential to combat the danger of war and the menace of Communism.  The first congress of the union was held in Vienna in October, 1926, and was attended by delegates from 23 European countries &mdash;many of them public men of high <Col N="697" /> standing and authority.  Monsieur Aristide Briand became honorary president of the union in 1927.</P>
    <P>The annual congresses of the Pan Europa Union resulted in gradually forcing the question of European unity into the forefront of discussion in the various national Parliaments.  Monsieur Herriot was an outstanding advocate of the idea in the French Parliament; Dr. Stresemann championed it in Germany; Dr. Schuschnigg supported it in Austria; and so on.  Finally, on the 5th September, 1929, Aristide Briand, 12 times premier of France and a Nobel Peace Prize winner, raised the question officially at the Assembly of the League of Nations.  In doing so, he said, <i>inter alia:</i>&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I think that among people constituting geographical groups, like the peoples of Europe, there should be some kind of federal bond; it should be possible for them to get into touch at any time, to confer about their interests, to agree on joint resolutions and to establish among themselves a bond of solidarity which will enable them, if need be, to meet any grave emergency that may arise.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>M. Briand's proposal was supported at once by Dr. Stresemann, Dr. Benes and M. Hymans, the Belgian Premier. M. Briand then undertook to put his proposal in the form of a detailed memorandum for the consideration of European Governments.</P>
    <P>The Briand memorandum subsequently circulated made it clear that the organisation which M. Briand had in mind was little more that a European conference representing all the European members of the League of Nations.  The conference would set up a permanent political committee, composed only of a certain number of members of the conference, and would have a small secretariat.  The whole thing was to be &ldquo;on the plane of absolute sovereignty and of entire political independence&rdquo;.  It was merely a &ldquo;grouping of the material and moral forces of Europe&rdquo; and was not a European federation or union in any sense.  As the memorandum itself put it, the new organisation was to be a &ldquo;federation based on the idea of union <Col N="698" /> and not of unity&rdquo;, that is to say, a federation elastic enough to respect the independence and national sovereignty of each State while guaranteeing to all the benefits of collective solidarity.</P>
    <P>All the 26 European Governments to which the memorandum was sent gave the proposal their blessing in principle, but there was no marked enthusiasm.  In many cases, doubts were expressed as to the desirability of creating a new organisation which might weaken the authority of the League of Nations, and most of the replies indicated an unwillingness to accept any limitation whatever of sovereign rights.  When the League Assembly met in September, 1930, the memorandum and the replies were sent to a special commission for study, and soon the original idea was lost in a mass of sub-committees and technical reports.  The Japanese conquest of Manchuria, the economic depression, the rise of Hitlerism, the Italian invasion of Abyssinia and the civil war in Spain gradually diverted the minds of European Governments into other channels, and the idea of European unity was quietly dropped from the international agenda.</P>
    <P>As the Second World War drew to a close, planning for peace became the fashion and the idea of European unity emerged again.  People remembered a speech made by Field-Marshal Smuts in November, 1943, in which he said that Britain would come out of the war a pauper but that she could strengthen her position by working more closely with the small democracies of Western Europe, some of which might well enter the British Commonwealth.  Mr. Attlee, who had said in November, 1939, that &ldquo;Europe must federate or perish&rdquo;, found a rival in his advocacy of European unity in Mr. Churchill, who, in the winter of 1946-47, took the initiative of forming a provisional British Committee to advocate the idea of a united Europe.</P>
    <P>In 1947 a Joint International Committee was formed, embracing an international organisations interested in the question of European unity.  This <Col N="699" /> committee organised the Congress of Europe at The Hague in May, 1948, and was itself succeeded by the European Movement, which represents the five organisations working for a united Europe and has for its Honorary Presidents Messrs.  Spaak, Churchill, de Gaspari and Leon Blum.</P>
    <P>The resolutions of The Hague Congress were submitted by M. Bidault to the Consultative Council of the Brussels Treaty Powers in July, 1948. They were approved by the Foreign Affairs Committee of the French Assembly later that month.  In response to an invitation from M. Spaak, the Joint International Committee drew up proposals in August, 1948, suggesting that there should be a European assembly which should be purely advisory in character, and that its constitution should be drawn up by a preparatory conference of representatives selected by the Parliaments of the five Brussels Treaty Powers.  The French Government announced its approval of these proposals, but, in correspondence with Mr. Churchill, Mr. Attlee stated on the 26th August, 1948, that he</P>
    <P>&ldquo;did not think the time was opportune for a major initiative of this kind when Governments were already so fully occupied with urgent problems&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Although a spokesman of the United States State Department expressed approval of the French Government's attitude in a public statement, Mr. Bevin, in the course of a debate on the subject in September, 1948, took the same line as Mr. Attlee.  The French and Belgian Governments continued their pressure, however, and, in October, 1948, the Brussels Treaty Consultative Group set up a committee to consider the matter.  This committee began its meetings in Paris on the 26th November, and, early in February, an announcement was issued that agreement had been reached on a general scheme which would be discussed at a conference at which other European countries would be invited to be represented.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="700" /> Throughout, our Government kept in close and sympathetic touch with the developments that were taking place. I took the opportunity at other conferences to discuss, informally, with individual Foreign Ministers, the possibility of making further progress. Finally, in the early part of this year, through the good offices of Monsieur Schuman, the foreign Minister of France, I was given an opportunity of indicating that we would be glad to participate and co-operate in the formation of the Council of Europe.</P>
    <P>Subsequently, on the 7th March of this year, a formal invitation was received from the British Foreign Secretary, inviting the Government of Ireland to attend a conference of Foreign Ministers.  This invitation was accepted.  For one reason or another, it was not possible for this conference to meet until the 3rd May, but, in the meanwhile, representatives of the different Governments met to prepare this draft statute.  As it was to be expected, a great many divergences of opinion became apparent in the course of the preliminary discussions.  These divergences of views were considered at the meeting of Foreign Ministers that took place on the 3rd and 4th of May.  The draft statute was finally approved in its present form and signed on the 5th of May of this year. It was also decided that the Consultative Assembly should meet in Strasbourg on the 11th August next.  The meeting of the Consultative Assembly will be preceded by a meeting of the Committee of Ministers on the 8th August.</P>
    <P>I should next like to deal with what I hope the Council of Europe will achieve, and the reasons why I recommend it to the House.</P>
    <P>At the outset, I should emphasise that there is no desire in this statute to interfere in any way with the independence and sovereignty of the participating nations.  European nations are not new nations that can be detached from their traditions and culture. They are all old nations which are largely the main-spring of a civilisation and culture which now spreads far beyond Europe into most parts of the world.  There is no wish&mdash;even if it <Col N="701" /> were possible&mdash;to in any way alter or interfere with the tradition, culture or individual characteristics of the different European nations that will compose the Council of Europe.  This would be both impossible and undesirable.</P>
    <P>While, as I have said, Europe has been the main-spring of the civilisation and culture which now spans the world, she has also been the storm centre and the origin of the wars which have caused so much destruction to the social structure of Europe.  This may be due to the fact that so many nationalities are encompassed in such a proportionately small area of the world and are dependent for their existence on limited resources.  However, that is immaterial to this discussion.</P>
    <P>The one thing that is all-important is the elimination of the causes of war. Destructive as the last two wars have been, it is now abundantly clear that another war must lead to the complete material destruction of the countries through which the war passes.  The development of atom bombs and new weapons can leave no doubt as to the utter destructiveness which another war must cause to Europe.</P>
    <P>The material destruction caused by war is only part of the damage which war causes to the structure of our civilisation and society.  It destroys and distorts moral values that have taken centuries to build.  The extent to which the last war destroyed the moral concepts which we had complacently come to accept as safely entrenched in our civilisation is frightening to contemplate.</P>
    <P>There is always a tendency in human beings to avoid facing those things that are horrible and unpleasant and that are an indication of our own weaknesses.  So, within just a few years of the end of the most terrible war in the history of the world, we are again inclined to forget its terrible lesson.  The last war proved how weak and ineffectual our man-made civilisation in reality was.</P>
    <P>Few of us would have thought, even in our most horrible nightmares, that planned extermination of racial groups, <Col N="702" /> or wholesale destruction of civilian populations would have come to be regarded as part of civilised planning. Yet, these things happened, practically in our midst.  It would be dangerous self-deception to imagine that these things happened because of the vice or weakness of any particular nation or group.  Those who were responsible for these ghastly deeds were highly civilised&mdash;just as civilised as we claim to be.</P>
    <P>The lesson of the last two wars, with the methods of destruction used, should teach us that the veneer of our civilisation is very thin and has not hitherto been able to withstand the impact of the immense scientific developments that have taken place in this century.</P>
    <P>In the past, wars were localised, by reason of transport difficulties and by the restricted range of weapons. Because wars were localised and because weapons of destruction were not as effective as they are now, it was possible to enforce certain rules.  Now, because of scientific advances, wars have come to be what we euphemistically call &ldquo;total warfare&rdquo;.  It is no longer a question of two armies fighting in a field.  In order to win a war you must aim at destroying the productive capacity and social organisation of your opponents.  In order to do this you aim at the destruction and extermination of your opponents by every means at your disposal.  Unfortunately science has placed at the disposal of mankind weapons that will enable mankind to hurl itself to self-destruction. The mass air-raids, the atom bombs and the extermination camps of the last war will pale into insignificance, should another war take place.</P>
    <P>The social and economic destruction caused by modern warfare leave their imprint, not merely in the countries through which the war has passed, but on the rest of the world as well.</P>
    <P>Communism, in the main, was built out of the wreckage of the last two wars.  World War I, in effect, created a situation in Central Europe which caused World War II.  The last war has created a situation which at present disrupts Europe.  There is no <Col N="703" /> longer a victor in a war&mdash;there are but sufferers when it is over.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with these matters because I think it is essential, no matter how unpleasant, that we should face these realities frankly and search for remedies.  I know that wars have been the rule rather than the exception and that, therefore, it may sound Utopian and unrealistic to think that it is possible to avoid wars.  The truth of the matter is, however, that another world war is likely to entail the complete destruction of this civilisation.</P>
    <P>The advance of scientific development is largely the cause of the peril which faces the world.  Or, rather, I should say, the advance of scientific development without a proportionate advance in the moral and ethical outlook of mankind.  Full of our own material achievements, we have been complacent and apathetic in relation to the moral and ethical basis of human society.</P>
    <P>In a way, the Council of Europe is a recognition of the dangers and of the remedy for these dangers to which I have just referred.  In the first paragraph of the preamble&mdash;for which we, incidentally, were largely responsible&mdash; it is recognised that the pursuit of peace is vital to the preservation of human society and civilisation.  The preamble also recognises that spiritual and moral values form the basis of our civilisation.  While these declarations may not go as far as some of us would like them to go, and while they are but words, they nevertheless indicate at least a realisation of the dangers we are facing and of the necessary remedies, if we are to survive.</P>
    <P>In broad outline the statute seeks to provide for closer co-operation and contact between European States.  It provides machinery for this purpose at Governmental level and at Parliamentary or representative levels.  Its success will depend on the degree of understanding and co-operation it can bring about, not merely between Governments and representatives of different countries, but between the peoples of the different countries themselves. It cannot, however, in any way <Col N="704" /> replace the functions of religion or education.  It can, however, help in both spheres by creating a public opinion that will emphasise the ethical and moral basis which must govern human action and relationship.  The statute provides for two bodies, one a Committee of Foreign Ministers representing the Governments of the participating countries and the other a Consultative Assembly.</P>
    <P>The powers of the Committee of Ministers are defined in Articles 15 to 19 of the Convention.  It is really the executive body and can do most things that are within the objects of the Council of Europe and that it is not specifically excluded from doing by the statute.</P>
    <P>Considerable difficulty was found in relation to the method of reaching decisions by the Committee of Ministers and a rather elaborate procedure for providing for a unanimous decision of the Ministers voting and a majority of the Ministers entitled to vote is provided in some cases.  In other cases, a two-thirds majority is to apply, and in yet another set of cases a simple majority may suffice.  That matter is dealt with in Article 20 of the statute.</P>
    <P>The powers of the Consultative Assembly are very limited indeed.  It cannot initiate proposals, save with the consent of the Committee of Ministers, and can only make recommendations to the Committee of Ministers. However, in practice, I have a feeling that the assembly will rapidly succeed in loosening many of the bonds and fetters which the statute seeks to impose upon it.  For instance, while the assembly has no power to include items for discussion on its own agenda, it may recommend to the Committee of Ministers the inclusion of items on the agenda.  I think it would be hard for the Committee of Ministers to resist recommendations made by the assembly if it carries sufficient support in the assembly.</P>
    <P>As to the representation, France, Italy and Britain will each be entitled to 18 delegates and 18 substitutes. Sweden, the Netherlands and Belgium will be entitled to six delegates and six substitutes.  Ireland, Norway and <Col N="705" /> Denmark will be entitled to four delegates and four substitutes each. Luxembourg will be entitled to three delegates and three substitutes.  There will, accordingly, on present membership of the Council of Europe be a total of 87 delegates and 87 substitutes at first.  That is on the present representation of the council, which is composed of ten nations.</P>
    <P>One matter which caused a great deal of difficulty, and which, indeed, is not resolved yet, is the exact relationship which is to prevail between the Committee of Ministers and the Consultative Assembly.  That was dealt with in Article 27 of the statute and was largely sidestepped and referred to a committee which rules to govern that position.  In our view, individual members of the Committee of Ministers should be free to participate in the deliberations of the assembly without voting, while, in the view of some other States, members of the Committee of Ministers should only address the assembly when they are deputed to do so by the Committee of Ministers itself.</P>
    <P>We felt that this latter course was open to a number of grave objections&mdash;</P>
    <P>Firstly, a Minister who has a minority point of view in relation to the Committee of Ministers as a whole should not, we felt, be precluded from addressing the assembly and putting forward his point of view.</P>
    <P>Secondly, we felt that there could be no collective responsibility in the Ministerial Committee in the sense that we know it here, because, in the final analysis, each Foreign Minister is responsible to his Government and to his own Parliament, and not to the Consultative Assembly.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, we felt that if Foreign Ministers are themselves precluded from addressing the assembly, Foreign Ministers will take good care to ensure that another Minister from their country will be chosen as a delegate who can then express freely the same viewpoint.  We felt this would be a drawback as it would tend to change the texture of the various national delegations attending the assembly. <Col N="706" /> There would be a tendency to write-off with Government members to make up for the fact that the Government representatives on the Committee of Ministers were not allowed to participate in or to express a viewpoint in the assembly itself and, also, we felt generally that the Foreign Ministers of various countries should have an opportunity of giving their viewpoint there as, in many cases, they include people of standing in Europe whose viewpoint would be helpful to the assembly.  To a certain extent, they are the experts in matters of foreign policy.</P>
    <P>Article 40 provides for the granting of privileges and immunities to members of the council, freedom from arrest and legal proceedings in the territories of all member nations in respect of utterances made at the assembly.</P>
    <P>I think I have covered most of the main provisions.  The method of selection of the delegation is left to the Government of each participating country.</P>
    <P>As I said at the beginning, this statute may be full of infirmities and may be largely the result of compromise between different viewpoints. Nevertheless, it is, in my view, one of the most important and constructive developments that have taken place in Europe.  Speaking personally, I hope that it will evolve rapidly into a more closely-knit body that may lead us to a Federated States of Europe.  Paradoxically enough, one of the features of the statute which, in the long run, will give strength and reality to the Council of Europe is that it excludes from its ambit all questions of military measures.  Unlike many other attempts at world organisation, it relies rather on moral, ethical, social and economic forces than upon military measures.</P>
    <P>I have pleasure in asking the House to ratify the statute.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that our only power here is either to ratify or not to ratify, that is, the question of amendment does not come in.  There are, perhaps, a number of things in the statute itself which, if we were dealing <Col N="707" /> with it with the power of amendment, we might suggest should be changed but cannot approach it from that point of view.  We have accordingly considered it from the simple point of view as to whether it should or should not be ratified, that is, whether we should or should not give support to the idea that a Council of Europe, a European organisation such as envisaged, is of advantage.</P>
      <P>I think if we approach it from that simple point of view there is nobody who will say that it is not an advantage, that it is not desirable.  Most of us will regret that it could not go much farther but anyone who has had any experience in trying to bring a number of States to agree will realise how difficult it is to make any real, significant advance towards effective co-operation and will also agree that unless we are to despair altogether we should try to make some beginning no matter how slight.  We must regard this as a very slight beginning.  In practice I fear the new council will find itself up against the difficulties which proved too great for previous organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that military measures are excluded, but just as difficult in their way and just as important are economic measures.  Each State has considered a certain economic foundation to be necessary for its well-being and it is very hard to get these States to change their viewpoint in that respect.  The question is, whether the alternative which threatens is sufficient to bring about a cohesion that otherwise could not be secured.  It would be completely wrong, I think, to despair and to say that because efforts in the past have failed new efforts should not be made.  I believe that eventually States and peoples will be driven by the very prospect of the alternative to face the difficulties, and to face them in a realistic way, which union of any sort entails.  For instance, the question of sovereignty has been mentioned.  It surely must be clear to everybody who thinks at all that the right to do as you please is not consistent with any form of real collaboration and that the first thing States must be prepared to do, if they <Col N="708" /> want to enter into a union that will be effective, is to face that question and to realise what indeed they do when they enter into treaties, that absolute sovereignty cannot be retained if there is to be agreement with others. I have always wondered why so much was made about this question of sovereignty.  When you enter into a treaty, over the period in which the treaty is effective or lasts, you to that extent bind yourself not to follow your own sweet will but to do the things which you have contracted to do.  I have always held that when this question of sovereignty is raised we ought quite flatly to tell everybody that sovereignty in the sense of being allowed to do as you please must go if there is to be any type of union. It is essential that it should go.  It is inconsistent with union and with real co-operation and I see nothing derogatory in contracting to limit your sovereignty in the same way that other States are prepared to limit theirs.</P>
    <P>The next question is to what extent, for the sake of co-operating, you are to sacrifice your own economic ideals. Again, all one can do in these cases is to consider what is vital and what is not vital.  Surely, the alternative being what it is, the things that are not vital we must be ready to give up.  The sacrifices in that respect that would have to be made by the different States are by no means equal and that is one of the fundamental difficulties, I think, in the whole situation.  A State like ours cannot condemn itself&mdash;that would be the meaning of it&mdash;to persist in the position in which it found itself as a result of many centuries of foreign rule.  We have to build up.  We have to build up our industries and to build up an economy that would be suitable to our people.  The Minister will therefore have to watch very, very carefully in any commitments that may be suggested that that right of our people to get up to the level which others have reached through their freedom will not be denied or surrendered in our regard.</P>
    <P>In speaking in this way I may be regarded as speaking from a selfish, nationalistic point of view.  These phrases have been used and bandied <Col N="709" /> about a good deal.  When a nation like ours, however, is trying to secure the material means by which it can continue its existence&mdash;a reasonable livelihood for a reasonable population &mdash;that is not, and should never be classed as, extreme nationalism.  The States that would compel other nations to be subservient to their interests, are the States that, in my opinion, are guilty of excessive and unreasonable nationalism.  But for an old nation like ours to make sure that means for its continuance should be left to it, that is not extreme nationalism and ought never to be referred to as such.</P>
    <P>Our representatives, then, in entering into any union such as this, in being asked to co-operate, ought to make sure that the reasonable needs of this country are safeguarded and that they are understood.  It is along the lines of these economic matters that I consider our problems in international co-operation and I feel that certain other States will have similar difficulties and, just as in our case, no matter how anxious we are for co-operation with other States, we have to consider the fundamental matter of our own continued existence as a nation, so too, other States may have considerations of a similar sort and it is these that cause the difficulties. They are not to be lightly brushed aside as things that should not be considered by States that desire genuine co-operation; they are and must be regarded as vital by every nation and the ability of the council to get these often conflicting interests reconciled will be its principal task.</P>
    <P>However, I can say for my part, and I think on behalf of our Party, that we support the ratification and that every step that is reasonably taken to bring about the unity of the States of Europe we will support, always looking critically to see that if we are asked to make any sacrifices, other States will be asked to make similar sacrifices.</P>
    <P>It is not the first time that representatives of this State have spoken in favour of union.  I was interested, as the representative of this State, in these ideas at Geneva and I remember it was like a cold douche to read some <Col N="710" /> of the replies that were sent to the memorandum that was circulated in connection with the Briand proposal. The replies pointed out genuine difficulties which must be faced if we are to have success.</P>
    <P>There are a number of things in this statute which I think could be bettered, but we are not concerned with that.  We have to take it in the hope that gradually as time goes on it will become a better instrument for the co-operation intended and the aims expressed in the preamble.</P>
    <P>Before I close, there are a few relatively small matters about which I would like to ask the Minister.  I notice the signature is on behalf of the Irish Republic and I notice also that in another place where the names of the countries are indicated it is also the Irish Republic.  Recently, we passed an Act declaring that the description of the State should be the Republic of Ireland.  I am wondering is there any special reason why the official designation in the Act was departed from. In the case of the list of names where you have the simple words Belgium, Denmark, and so on occurring, I was wondering why the name Ireland did not appear instead of Irish Republic. I am sure the Minister will be able to give some good reasons.</P>
    <P>The next matter I would like to ask him about is, what is the basis on which representation in the Consultative Assembly is determined, and whether it is on a similar basis, or by way of similar proportion, that the financial contributions are assessed.  It seemed to me that, looking at the representation that is proposed to be accorded to the States, these are not in proportion to the population&mdash;they certainly do not seem to me to be&mdash; and I do not know either whether the financial contributions are on the same basis as the number of representatives.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which the Minister might give an answer is the Government's attitude&mdash;if it has arrived at any decision&mdash;with regard to representation on the Consultative Assembly; whether the view of the Government is that our representation should be altogether Governmental&mdash;I <Col N="711" /> can see reasons why the Government would so decide&mdash;or whether it is intended that it should represent the Dáil as a whole.  If it represents the Dáil as a whole, I would like to know on what basis the representatives are to be chosen.  Are they to be nominated by the Government and, if so, on what basis?</P>
    <P>Another point, a small point, is the question of the secretariat.  I think the Secretary-General is appointed by the Consultative Assembly, or is it the Council of Ministers with ratification by the Consultative Assembly?  When the secretary is appointed he selects his staff.  Is this selection to be ratified by the Council of Ministers or by the assembly?</P>
    <P>These are relatively small points, but on the main issue we are at one with the Government in desiring to have this unity of Europe brought about. Our regret is that it is only a very partial unity, because it does not embrace all the European States and it is only a very minor and, indeed, a hesitating first step.  I am not saying that the Minister or the Government here are responsible in any way for that.  The Government can be assured that we will support them in every effort they reasonably make to bring about this union and make it as successful as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that the Minister's statement this evening was not made available to us in the form of a White Paper, because he has gone over a considerable part of European history covering a period of years, and it would have been interesting to have had an opportunity of considering that in a calmer atmosphere than this House, although I think that, as far as this House is concerned, we will have as calm a House as one could wish for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What strikes me first about this Council of Europe is that its title is, of course, completely wrong.  It is not a council of Europe at all.  It is a council of a corner of Europe, an important corner, no doubt, but quite a number of States that one can think of are missing from it.  However, as <Col N="712" /> Deputy de Valera said, it is a beginning, even if it is only a very tiny beginning, and it may be that within the provisions of the statute itself it may be possible to reach a larger council, a council of Europe as a whole.  One does not like to throw cold water on any of these efforts that are being made by statesmen to achieve a condition of world peace, but one must be sceptical when one thinks of the declarations that have been made in our own lifetime by other organisations that were duly ratified by States and came together for the purpose of achieving peace.  The declared object of the people who have signed this document is to achieve peace, whereas we do know that some of the people who have signed that document, in another sphere, are working not for peace but for war.  I think every Deputy in this House must agree with that.  While, as I say, one must give support to any effort that may result in peace even in a corner of the world, we would be very foolish to think that the signing of this document or the ratification of this document is to lead to peace.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy de Valera I am worried about an aspect of it and that is the economic aspect.  The statute itself states in Article 1 (a) that one of the objects is to facilitate the economic and social progress of the nations comprising this council.  Article 15 says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...the Committee of Ministers shall consider the action required to further the aim of the Council of Europe, including the conclusion of conventions or agreements and the adoption by Governments of a common policy with regard to particular matters.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to explain when concluding whether that means that this Committee of Ministers may direct a member State as to the adoption by it of a particular economic policy.  I want to be clear on that because that is the meaning that I put into Article 15.  It is just as well that we should be clear as to what that does mean at the moment.  I share the same worries as Deputy de Valera.  We are an old nation, we are a small nation, we are a nation that has been in bondage for <Col N="713" /> many centuries.  Our economy has been broken down deliberately by a foreign nation, an aggressive nation, that maintained itself in this country.  In the last quarter of a century it has been the aim of every Government we have had&mdash;the two Governments up to this and I take it it is the aim of the present Government&mdash;to build up our own economy, which necessitates protection of our industries.  Is there a danger that the Committee of Ministers may decide that certain steps that we might take for the protection of our own economy might not be in accordance with this particular statute?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I am worrying about.  The paragraph on national defence is not particularly well worded, but I take it that it means what the Minister said in his opening statement:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="714" />&ldquo;Matters relating to national defence do not fall within the scope of the Council of Europe.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I agree that matters relating to the national defence of each of the participating countries have nothing to do with the Council of Europe, but I take it that it has also been agreed, although not expressed, that the matter of common military action does not arise either.  National defence, as we all know, consists in the ability of a particular country in relation to defence, and certainly, so far as the statute is concerned, we are not concerned with national defence.  We can arrange our own national defence without reference to this particular council.</P>
    <P>The most important article it seems to me is Article 3, Chapter II, which says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Every member of the Council of Europe must accept the principles of the rule of law and of the enjoyment by all persons within its jurisdiction of human rights and fundamental freedoms, and collaborate sincerely and effectively in the realisation of the aim of the council as specified in Chapter I.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a counsel, undoubtedly, of perfection, and I am sure the Ministers who signed their names to that article must have asked themselves: &ldquo;How far have we reached that stage within our own countries&rdquo;?  We are bound by ratifying this statute to accept the principles of the rule of law and of the enjoyment by all persons within our jurisdiction of human rights and fundamental freedoms. I take it one of the human rights and fundamental freedoms would be the right of the individual to hold or express a particular point of view.  I think that also would be one of the fundamental freedoms.  I take it that, by and large, so far as we are concerned, we are endeavouring to assert these human rights and fundamental freedoms.  We can say that these human rights and fundamental freedoms exist in each of the 12 or 13 countries that have signed this document, but all documents of this kind are like the constitutions of political <Col N="715" /> Parties.  They set out very elaborate and grandiose principles, but when it comes to the application of those principles, the principles are quickly forgotten.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to say that there is one small point to which I personally take exception.  I suppose it has to be there whether we like it or not, but it does annoy me to see any collaboration between this State and a State that describes itself as &ldquo;the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland&rdquo;.  That is, from our point of view, an offensive description.  It is an inaccurate description; it is wrong.  It is regrettable that we have to collaborate at all with such a State and that our Minister for External Affairs, as our representative, should sign a document to collaborate with a nation that describes itself in this way.  It is regrettable that we, as a Parliament, should have to ratify an agreement entered into with a number of other nations, the principal and leading nation of which is one that describes itself as &ldquo;the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is a small nation and we cannot enforce our rights on other nations, but as a small civilised nation it is our duty to contribute what we can to the well-being of the world.  It is our duty to contribute everything we possibly can towards building up the rule of law and order in the world.  I sincerely hope that the Council of Ministers and this assembly which is now being established will have a longer life than other international organisations that have been formed with a flourish of trumpets in the past.  I can only hope that the efforts of the leaders of the people who will have this responsibility thrown on them will be rewarded with a measure of success and that the principles, particularly in relation to human rights and fundamental freedoms that are written into this document, will be made effective as real principles and that an effort will be made by the Ministers of every country <Col N="716" /> participating in this convention to make its principles really operative principles in their own countries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very indebted to the Leader of the Opposition and Deputy Cowan for the attitude they have adopted in relation to the motion ratifying this statute.  Probably one omission I made in my opening statement was not to deal with the relationship which will exist between the Council of Europe on the one hand and the O.E.E.C. on the other hand.  I should have explained that it is one of the relationships that have yet to be sorted out.  No definite relationship has yet been decided upon or seriously considered by the different countries.</P>
      <P>The O.E.E.C. was formed originally to implement the Marshall Plan.  It has been decided since that it should remain in existence, outlive the Marshall Plan and direct economic co-operation in Europe.  It is not quite clear yet&mdash;it is a matter that will have to be discussed and it is a matter upon which I should like to have the benefit of the views of members of the House &mdash;as to whether the Council of Europe should ultimately absorb the Organisation for Economic Co-operation or whether the two should remain separate.  If they remain separate, I take it that matters of an economic nature would fall to the O.E.E.C. and matters of a political and social nature would be dealt with by the Council of Europe.  There is a certain amount of confusion in the minds of everybody on that particular point.  If the O.E.E.C. is in existence and survives the period of operation of the Marshall Plan and of the coming into existence of the Council of Europe, then I take it that it will deal with economic questions and that the Council of Europe will have little or no function in regard to economic matters.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
      <P>Debate adjourned.</P>
