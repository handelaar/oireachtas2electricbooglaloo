    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether he is aware that considerable dissatisfaction exists amongst national teachers at the nature of the Irish paper set recently for the primary schools certificate examination and that it is the opinion of many teachers that this type of paper is calculated to make their task in awakening enthusiasm for the language more difficult; and, if so, whether he will cancel the paper in question and arrange to have a suitable substitute paper set for the examinees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>No representations have been made to me or to my Department by national teachers, as a body, expressing dissatisfaction at the nature of the Irish paper set recently for the primary school certificate examination or at its possible repercussions on the teaching of Irish in the schools.  Some complaints&mdash;three or four in all&mdash;from individual teachers have been received, but isolated complaints of that nature are not unusual in respect of examination papers, and the volume of dissatisfaction, as expressed in formal protests, is not greater in regard to the paper in question than it has been in other cases in the past.</P>
      <P>I do not consider the matter of such gravity as to necessitate cancelling the paper and providing a substitute one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="865" /> As is customary, however, in such cases, all complaints formally submitted and duly authenticated will be brought specially to the notice of the officials charged with the marking of the candidates' scripts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that there exists, whether it has been expressed to the Minister or not, very grave dissatisfaction, not alone amongst national teachers but amongst others interested in the revival of Irish as the spoken language of the people, at the setting of a paper of this nature, which is calculated to cause pupils to view Irish with despair and not to awaken any enthusiasm for the language in their minds?</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not any more that I can reply to the Deputy's question than what I have said at the moment.  As far as any representations have been made to me in the matter, the position is exactly as stated, and the complaints that have been made, and any others that might be made, will be put before the people who are charged with the responsibility of examining the papers.  That is all I can do at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. MacBride)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the unanimous approval of the Dáil, the Government applied for the admission of Ireland to the United Nations Organisation in 1946.  The United Nations has not yet disposed of the application.  The Government <Col N="866" /> is not called upon to take any further action in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that Ireland's application for membership of the United Nations Organisation has been twice rejected, on the veto of Russia?  Would it not be exposing this country to unnecessary humiliation to repeat the application?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated to the Deputy, it is not a question of repeating the application.  The application was put forward in 1946 and is still there.  No steps have been taken by the Government to repeat the application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not think that the correct thing to do would be to withdraw the application, in view of the attitude that has been taken?  Further, does the Minister not also think that there is even a greater danger to this country if Russia should withdraw her veto against us and thereby more or less indicate that we were favourable to her policy?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs whether satisfactory arrangements have now been made as to short-wave length allocations to cover North and South Americas, Europe, Australia and New Zealand, and further, whether he proposes to continue the erection of the four radio masts for short-wave transmission and what power it is proposed will be used to ensure effective transmission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Everett) Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Everett)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Everett)</NameTxt>
      <P>At an International High Frequency Broadcasting Conference in Mexico City, which ended about two months ago, a basic plan for the allocation of short-wave lengths was drawn up under which this country will <Col N="867" /> it is hoped, be able to broadcast effectively to North and South America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand, South Africa, India and Pakistan.  The basic plan is suitable for one particular period only and will have to be developed further by technical experts for five other periods.  It will then come before a further international short-wave conference in Italy in October next for approval and it is expected that it will come into force in 1951.</P>
      <P>We hope to be able to make arrangements by which we will be able to obtain the use of some reasonably good wavelengths for transmission to North America during the period before the Mexico City plan comes into force.</P>
      <P>The radio masts for transmissions to North America are erected and the aerials to be used on them are being completed at present; it has not yet been decided when the masts and aerials for transmissions to other areas will be erected.</P>
      <P>The short-wave station will transmit at 100 kilowatts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs whether he now <Col N="871" /> proposes to install a telephone exchange in every post office in the country, enabling persons requiring telephones to apply and obtain telephones in their houses throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>Additional exchanges will be installed in post office only in so far as this may be necessary to provide service for all persons requiring telephones in the surrounding areas. The provision of an exchange in every post office is, however, neither necessary nor desirable.  In fact, it would be extremely wasteful of engineering plant, staff and accommodation, apart from having an adverse effect on the service generally.  In many cases post offices are too near existing exchanges to provide suitable centres as telephone exchanges.</P>

I am asking the Minister if he is aware that his Order in respect of, amongst other things, rusks as a baby food has now resulted in an increase in price, because all other forms of biscuits have been reduced in price except baby rusks.  I ask the Minister if he will not consider giving the subsidy again and so prevent an increase in the price of these commodities.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>These fruits already enjoy protection and I am not satisfied that the imposition of further restrictions on importation would have the desired result.  No useful purpose would, in my opinion, be served by directing the horticultural instructors to schedule existing orchards.  The owners of these orchards receive from the instructors, on application, all advice, instruction and assistance they may require in regard to the cultivation and marketing of their crops. The development of fruit growing is encouraged by the county committees of agriculture under the schemes of grants towards the establishment of apple orchard plots and plots for small fruit and towards the purchase of modern types of sprayers and marketing equipment, as well as schemes for the supply at reduced rates of fruit trees and bushes and trees for shelter. The inducements afforded under these schemes are, in my opinion, adequate for the purpose.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that farmers' butter is being purchased at 1/6 and 1/8 per lb. and, I have heard, at an even lower price?  Does the Minister realise that that is an altogether inadequate price, being equivalent to 7d. or 8d. a gallon for milk, and surely he must realise that an injustice is being done to producers of farmers' butter which ought to be remedied and which cannot be remedied by supplying creamery facilities in the course of a few years?</P>

The price receivable for farmers' butter is, in my judgment, entirely inadequate, and I would deplore any proposal to perpetuate a situation in which people with surplus milk were required to dispose of it in the form of farmers' butter; but if the Deputy is labouring under the illusion that creamery facilities are to be supplied in the course of the next two years, I am happy to dissipate that illusion. Creamery facilities have been supplied in every district reported to me as being embarrassed by a surplus of milk within the past fortnight, and, in any area where 2,000 gallons of milk can be collected in a circuit of 40 miles, I am prepared to provide facilities, provided there is a central creamery within 40 <Col N="875" /> miles of the suppliers.

It seems to me to be more in accordance with reason and common sense that a staff should be permitted to work in a coherent and efficient way to liquidate this further imbecility of my predecessor's Government than that I should dislocate the Department's work in order to do in one 12 months what can be done without serious injury to anybody over a period of three and a half years.</P>

      <P>The letter referred to is on the relevant file in my Department. It involved very important issues which were under examination when a new proposal was made by this company in October, 1948, which raised further issues.  Subsequently a complete modification of the proposals was made by the company at an interview with officers of my Department in February, 1949; and certain information for which the company was asked in connection with the modified proposals was supplied to my Department in May, 1949.

It is true that there was subsequently an interview between officers of the Department of Industry and Commerce and representatives of the company, but as the modified application involved the imposition of a duty, and as any application for the imposition of a duty must be fully documented in regard to price, quality, potential output and so forth, and as there was no evidence from the company of the contemplated output or the price or the source from which supplies would be drawn, it was not possible to give a decision.</P>

It is desirable that that should have gone on during the war.  I feel that the loosening of this capital now is a very necessary and desirable <Col N="887" /> development in view of the depreciation of sterling generally.

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £96,250 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1950, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Finance, including the Paymaster-General's Office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the sum required in addition to the amount already granted under the Vote on Account.  Deputies will notice that there is an increase in the Vote of £23,000, which can be divided under three headings.  First of all, there are the ordinary incremental increases that accrue from time to time. The second is the transfer from the Vote associated with the Supplementary Estimate taken last year for the increase in the Vote for civil servants. Part of that is distributed through this Vote and, in fact, is distributed <Col N="889" /> through most of the other Votes of which I have charge.  The third is in connection with foreign exchange control. In that, there has been an addition to staff.  That, of course, is a consequential increase in the moneys taken from the taxpayers for the remuneration.  Foreign exchange control has developed over the years, starting in a rather limited way.  It was hoped that exchange control in the ordinary sense of the word might have been got rid of by this time, but, of course, circumstances have moved against that.  In addition to that, the Foreign Exchange Department now has to take upon itself the duties that are appropriate to the Marshall Aid Fund and the whole of the E.C.A. developments, in so far as they react here. For that reason, there has been quite a considerable building up of staff. Some of these, of course, are people who are on loan from other Departments and, therefore, other Departments will show a corresponding decrease.  But there have been additions to the staff owing to an increase in the work.  I do not think there is any other question arising out of the Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister explained that one of the reasons for the increase was the increased work in the Foreign Exchange Department.  The Minister during the year has approved of many information officers being appointed to various Departments.  It would be no harm if he asked some of his own officers to give a little information to Ministers of the Government about our internal finances.  We had the Taoiseach saying down in Bantry a couple of weeks ago that they had reduced taxation to the extent of £7,000,000 in 16 months.  He said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;By reducing taxation by over £7,000,000 in 16 months, we have eased the burden which has been oppressing every member of the community, for nowadays everyone is a taxpayer.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He said that in Bantry on Saturday, 11th June last.  Would the Minister convey to the Taoiseach that, instead of reducing taxation by £7,000,000 they have increased it by nearly £8,000,000?</P>

      <P>I am complaining as a matter of the Minister's administration that during this year which we are now discussing he turned down an application for expenses to which citizens of this country were put by the commission established by this Dáil to investigate charges of corruption which were proved to be absolutely unfounded.  The last reply on this matter to a certain firm&mdash;the firm of Stokes and Quirke&mdash; who applied for their expenses was from the Taoiseach's Department on <Col N="892" /> the 29th January this year.  The last reply from the Minister for Finance two months previously clearly established it as a matter of administration coming within the purview of the Minister for Finance this year.  I think it is very wrong when this Dáil believes a matter to be of sufficient public importance to warrant an inquiry carried out by three senior judges, and when the charges are proved to be unfounded, that the Minister for Finance should refuse to bear the reasonable expenses of the persons who are accused unjustly and put to abnormal expense.  In this particular case the charges hurled in this Dáil were also hurled from every platform round the country.  The Dáil set up this tribunal. The judges consisted of Mr. Justice O'Byrne, Mr. Justice Davitt and Mr. Justice Haugh.</P>

I object to the Minister for Finance refusing to meet the reasonable expenses of any citizen in this country who was taken before this tribunal or who was summoned before it, and in respect of whom the tribunal found that the charges made against him were made recklessly and falsely.  The proper thing for the Minister to have done on that occasion was to have followed precedent: that, where charges were made falsely, the accused person should be indemnified against loss.  If there were charges made against him of sufficient importance for the Dáil to set up this procedure of inquiring into them, and if, in respect of some of those charges, there was a finding against him, then he should bear the costs in relation to those charges; but here was a case where a firm of auctioneers, a couple of Ministers and several other firms <Col N="896" /> were brought before the tribunal and put to expense.  You had a firm of solicitors, the firm of Messrs.  Arthur Cox and Company, brought before this tribunal, to tell what they knew about the matter, and you had a firm of Messrs.  Stokes and Quirke.  That particular firm was subjected to very heavy expenses.  As a matter of fact, we know that one of the members of the Government, the present Attorney-General, was employed at that time in his capacity as senior counsel to defend the firm of Messrs.  Stokes and Quirke.</P>

      <P>The Attorney-General was present at that tribunal and, not only was he present at the tribunal, but he stated in no uncertain fashion what he thought of the Minister for Finance and of his allegations here. That was published in the papers, and I am sure it will be within the recollection of the Minister for Finance that he denounced his conduct as completely reckless.  However, that is by the way.</P>

If we are going to carry on here as a democratic State in which everybody has reasonable rights guaranteed to him, then I think that a person has as much right to be defended by the State when he is being deprived unjustly of his character as if he were deprived unjustly of his property.  If it is of great importance that there should be full freedom of discussion in this Dáil, it is also of importance that this Dáil should not be used as a fort from which people can sling slanders without any danger to themselves, or even without having to answer for them before any court.</P>

A number of people went before this tribunal and paid their legal expenses in the knowledge that, heretofore, where people were found guiltless on certain charges they were indemnified with regard to their costs.  These people have a right to expect that when the charges were found to be utterly reckless, when witnesses were found to be &ldquo;shifty&rdquo; in their evidence, that they were liars, in other words&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;they have the right to expect that they would be indemnified against loss in relation to those charges and the Minister has refused to do it.  I believe that, in doing that, he acted very wrongly, that he acted against the best interests of this State and also against the best interests of the people of this State.  It is in the interests of the people of this State to see that charges made against their Government or charges made against public men are fully investigated.  In order that that should be done properly it is in the interests of the State to <Col N="899" /> see that the accused people will be able to get the best legal advice that they can get.  In this particular case, the legal expenses were very heavy.  I have no hope that the Minister for Finance will change his mind.  We all know that he is biased in certain regards.  I want to give my opinion of that to the Dáil and to say how ill-advised, I think, he was, not only ill-advised but very vindictive, in refusing to meet the legitimate costs of all the people involved in this tribunal in respect of the charges of which they were found guiltless, the charges which the judges said were completely reckless.</P>

      <P>I, too, would like to speak on this matter, but I fear, from the ruling given by the Chair, that it will be almost impossible to deal with it at all.

      <P>How can I make that case?  How can I deal with that matter unless I am at liberty to point out the precise circumstances?  As I stated in my intervention, this matter would be quite different if the findings of the tribunal were other than what they were.  The case that has been made was made on the basis of the findings of the tribunal and, consequently, unless one can deal with those findings, it will be impossible to make the case that should be made. The point is that there were certain findings of a public tribunal, a tribunal that was essential.  The findings were quite clear in their expression.  As a result of those findings, I submit that the State is bound, in justice to the individual, to see that that individual is not out of pocket.  It is bad enough to have a person charged publicly and have a lot of the mud that was flung at him sticking to him, without making him bear certain losses, out of pocket expenses, money which he had <Col N="900" /> to spend in defending himself against these false charges.</P>

If we cannot discuss it now, an early opportunity ought to be given to the House to enter into a discussion on it.</P>

      <P>I should like to put the argument to the Minister in this form, that it would appear to be an outrage <Col N="901" /> if any man, a slander being issued, the case coming before a tribunal properly appointed and a decision having been properly arrived at, should be made a bankrupt, although he vindicated himself in the court, because the Government would not protect him not merely as regards his character but also as regards his property.  If that attitude were to be adopted, almost anybody could be broken.  Any citizen could suffer unless the principle is established that when an honest man is falsely slandered and he succeeds in vindicating himself, at least his expenses should be paid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and there was no rush made to try to cash in on the situation.  It was taken for granted justice would be done by any Government. You have to make allowance for Opposition Parties; they do overstate the case.  But, when they get into the saddle and have to shoulder responsibility, what you expect from any decent Irishman is a fair deal all round and an effort to maintain the standards of justice which are so essential to the public life of the country. I was disappointed with the Minister's attitude.  I thought we would have got some light and leading on his attitude towards sterling and what he thinks ought to be done.  I think this arises properly on the Estimate.  He said a great many things which might easily be quoted to show what his attitude formerly was with regard to sterling in the face of any situation that might arise.  Now, there is a very dangerous situation from the point of view of any small country that is relying on sterling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy be kind enough to repeat that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I said there is a very dangerous situation owing to the likelihood that sterling will be depreciated in value&mdash;there is a possibility of it. You could get quotations from British Ministers and supporters of the present British Government to show the <Col N="902" /> present precarious situation, the indication of failure in spite of their colossal efforts to balance their imports and exports, together with the austerity programme that is being carried out.  With all that, they have not succeeded in securing that balance. Again, we have read of the fall of Shanghai, which amounts to imperilling all the trade that at one time meant an annual income to Britain of £200,000,000.  That represented her trade with the whole of North China and that is now in very grave peril.</P>
      <P>We have also to consider the friction that has arisen&mdash;the objection which the United States are making to the agreement between the Argentine and Britain.  Friction has also arisen between Canada and Britain and it is affecting their trading relations.  All these things are of such a nature that they may give rise to a dangerous situation.  There is also to be considered the slump which was indicated, I think, by the Minister in one of his speeches.  All these things would seem to suggest that the country is entitled to a statement from the Minister as to his attitude and how he is going to get out of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is an asset, therefore, that should be developed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened carefully to what both Deputy Aiken and Deputy de Valera said in regard to the Locke Tribunal.  I would appeal to the Minister to consider the implications in this matter.  I gather from Deputy Aiken that if he had continued as Minister for Finance after February of last year he would have agreed to the payment of costs and expenses incurred by Messrs.  Stokes and Quirke at that inquiry. I understand that other parties are involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not confine it to Messrs. Stokes and Quirke.  The owners of the distillery were dragged before this tribunal.  That was quite natural. Their manager may have known something about negotiations that were going on.  The owners of the distillery were absolutely oblivious of them. They were at considerable expense in appearing before this tribunal.  Messrs. Arthur Cox and Company, solicitors in this city, also appeared.  There were other people involved throughout the country.  Mr. Morris of Clonmel was one of them.  These are the people I recollect at the moment.  I hold that <Col N="904" /> all those people who were guiltless of any offence and who did nothing dishonourable should have their proper expenses met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that the owners of the distillery were involved in very heavy costs and expenses in regard to this tribunal.  I could not now, without reference, deal with the particular findings of the tribunal, but I think there is a general principle involved.  That principle is that where a tribunal is set up by this House, unless the findings are very unfavourable to the parties involved, their costs and expenses should be paid.  They are represented there by their legal advisers, counsel and solicitor and so on.  I think the principle should be established that these costs and expenses should be met.  I merely mention that.  I do not know what correspondence has passed.  Anyone who knows anything about the workings of the Department of Finance over a quarter of a century&mdash;and Deputy Aiken will admit this I am sure&mdash;must admit that the Department of Finance will always refuse to pay until there is substantial pressure put upon it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know anything about that.  I want to discuss this matter quite apart from politics and from the individuals involved.  I want to discuss it quite apart also from some of the findings of the tribunal. I think that if we put the matter to the Minister in that way, probably it can be reconsidered departmentally and by the Government.  I take it that a Supplementary Estimate might have to be introduced, but that Estimate would receive the approval of the House.  I am concerned in the matter only because of the general principle involved. For that reason I ask the Minister to indicate in his reply that the door is still open for further consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter to which I would like to refer.  Recently some difference of opinion has arisen between the Minister and a trade union representing <Col N="905" /> a substantial number of civil servants.  I refer to the Civil Service Clerical Association.  I understand that the Minister has withdrawn recognition from that association because of that difference.  I am perfectly satisfied that the Minister is anxious that whatever difference there is should be solved and that the position should be clarified as soon as possible.  I know that would be the Minister's own view.  I also know that there are obstacles to the solution of problems such as this.  Those obstacles exist in the Civil Service itself.  I do not propose to go into details.  I do not want the Minister to go into details in his reply.  I would like the Minister, however, to take a generous step in meeting this association.</P>
    <P>Things have happened which have brought this association under official displeasure.  What has happened may never happen again, because a very useful lesson has been learned by everybody concerned.  By some generous approach now on the part of the Minister the problem could be solved in the course of a few hours. Recognition could be restored to this association and that body could then work in the ordinary way.  This association is a very useful one from the point of view of the public, the Government and the civil servants.  I ask the Minister to do everything that is humanly possible to bring this dispute to an end.  It is a bad thing for any body of people to feel it has a grievance.  It would be a bad thing if the large membership involved in this association felt they had a grievance. I do not think that grievance is against the Minister.  That is one of the troubles.  Whatever the Minister may decide the grievance will not be against the Minister, but against somebody else.  For that reason, I appeal to the Minister to be exceptionally generous.  I know he is anxious to be generous.  I appeal to him to bring this dispute to an end within the next couple of days.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a matter in connection with Vote 15&mdash;Commissions and Special Inquiries&mdash;on which I should like some information.  I notice in connection <Col N="906" /> with the Commission on Place Names that a sum of only £917 is being provided by the Minister this year, whereas a sum of £4,537 was provided last year.  I should like some explanation from the Minister as to why that reduction has taken place.  If the Minister does not object to that commission, why does he not allow it to function, or is it to be allowed to function any more?  Is its work not of sufficient national importance?  I think it is all-important. It was generally agreed by everybody that it was engaged in useful national work and that it should be allowed to continue that work.  I think it is a shame that the Minister and the Government, in what one cannot call anything except a spirit of pique, reduced the provision made for its Vote very substantially.  It would be more decent to have wiped it out altogether and to have told the country that the Minister has no use whatever for it.</P>
      <P>There is another commission mentioned here&mdash;the Commission on Emigration and other Population Problems&mdash;and perhaps the Minister would tell us when it is expected to have a report from that body.  That commission has been sitting for quite a considerable period now and it was expected that the country would have seen at least a preliminary report from the commission.  It was set up to solve the problem of emigration originally. It was boosted as such and it was expected that within a few short weeks, or months at longest, the country would be given a solution for the emigration problem.  It has now been sitting well over 14 months and considering that emigration&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister's recent decision to grant increases in the pensions payable to retired civil servants was very widely welcomed and long awaited, but very many of them were greatly disappointed to find that they had been treated differently to serving civil servants, that is to say, their increase in pension does not date from May, 1948, while serving civil servants received an increase retrospective to May, 1948.  I think for the sake of the few extra pounds concerned the Minister might have given the pensioners similar treatment and I appeal to him even at this late stage to reconsider that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister whether he has anything further to say about the conditions of employment in the Ordnance Survey Office in the Phoenix Park and I would appeal to him to investigate fully the conditions of employment there and to try to find out why it is that the Valuation Office, <Col N="911" /> the Land Commission and other offices rob the best men from that important office in the Phoenix Park.  I suggest to him that it is of course because the conditions are very bad up there and if he wants to keep a good Ordnance Office he must see that conditions of employment are raised to a higher level.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Vote for Special Commissions and Special Inquiries, Vote 15, it is very difficult to discuss the Locke Tribunal without going through the merits of the case.  I have refused every application that has been made to me in that connection and I have done that mainly on the grounds of precedent.  The precedent right from the foundation of this State has been that even though people are unfortunate enough to be brought before any court or tribunal on a charge which has eventually been proved to be unfounded, those people meet their own expenses.  That has been the case in the Criminal Court and in so far as people have been subjected to inquiries set up by this Dáil and incurred expense, up to the case of the tribunal set up to investigate the charges which were made against Dr. Ward, has any payment ever been made?  The memories of the Deputies who are sitting <Col N="912" /> opposite are not so short that they will not pick up the occasion when shortly after they came into the Government they sent forward two servants of the State to meet a criminal charge under the Official Secrets Act.  The judge refused to let the case go to a jury it was so bad and when he was summing up at the end he indicated that the expenses of the two or three servants of the State who had been in this reckless way brought before the court should be met.  Of course they were not met, and, in so far as my information goes, those civil servants suffered in their particular status as such civil servants and they were not rehabilitated.  Certainly they were not given any money reward to meet their expenses.  It is also notorious that the first occasion on which a precedent was established was the Ward Tribunal case and it may be news to this House but it is not news to some people sitting opposite me that when they decided to meet these expenses they sent the matter to one of the taxing masters to get him to say what the proper payment should be.  They were not satisfied with the first reference of the taxing master and sent it back a second time and, whether it was deliberate or not, the result was that Dr. Ward who did not come unscathed from it got a greater percentage of his expenses than Dr. MacCarvill who was largely responsible for starting the tribunal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have heard of the circumstances in relation to the Central Bank Act.  There is a bit of a strait jacket, if the Deputy looks at it. It is rather hard for the Deputy, who for years has packed all the eggs into the one money basket&mdash;and there is quite a basket of eggs there&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>And the Minister packed £3,000,000 more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>And the basket is likely to break down?  Is the situation as bad as that?  I thought Deputy Little might have given some advice and made known how near this danger of devaluation was to us and what he would do in order to minimise the danger if it came nearer.  I do not know how near the danger is.  I have read the comments made and I know the matter has been the subject of comment among various international gatherings.  I know that there has been a definite attitude, so far as England is concerned, that she will not allow sterling to be devalued.  There are certain forces which, in times to come, may make it necessary to allow sterling to be devalued, and then there may be a revaluation of currencies&mdash;possibly, our own included.  But that is a matter which is a considerable way off in the future, thank goodness, and I do not think I should be questioned as to my attitude in a whole variety of circumstances that might arise.  The Deputy is entitled to ask whether it is appreciated that there is a movement of that kind on and ask whether there is watchfulness here on that account.  I can say that there is watchfulness here, <Col N="918" /> but I do not intend to be drawn into a debate on that point.  Later on, probably, there will be an opportunity of judging how tight the strait jacket is, and who fashioned it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cowan has brought in the matter of the Civil Service Clerical Association and, though it was quite tactfully done, I am sorry it was raised at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">

      <P>If the Minister prefers not to deal with it&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has gone into certain points of detail and I must go into them, in following him. There is no question of an official attitude on this matter which is different from mine.  Deputy Cowan has been advised on this point, but that is wrong, that I would have a different attitude personally from the officials of my Department.  When I am asked to recognise that this is a matter that should be solved in a few hours, I must say, first of all, that the offending matter appeared in the journal last December.  We are now in the month of June, and I do not know how many letters have passed. I have read them all.  No letter went out without myself in person being aware of it or agreeing with its terms. There have been deputations&mdash;I have taken some of them myself and have seen reports about the others.  I suppose I am more definitely intimate with that matter than I am with a host of other matters in the Department.  It has been very seriously considered, and I do not know what I am expected to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cowan talks of big and generous steps.  There has been quite enough generosity of the kind displayed in this whole matter.  If Deputy Cowan likes to see the full details, I shall be very glad to show them to him, or to any other Deputy, and I will stand the test of their judgment in the matter, as to whether any harshness or any unkindness or unpleasantness was shown.  There is no question of barring doors.  They have been opened and reopened and <Col N="919" /> kept ajar and many people have been trying to push in.  It is a pity this small matter has been occupying the time and attention of very responsible officers over this period of six months.</P>
    <P>The Place Names Commission&mdash; which a Deputy inquired about, if he is still interested in the matter&mdash;has not been abolished.  It is being kept alive, and we are paying certain moneys out this year.  The director is engaged in the compilation of a certain list of place names and he is assisted by one other officer.  I am keeping it in that position until the circumstances I mentioned last year are met, that is, as I said, until such time as we have got this matter, and other matters connected with expense on the Irish language generally, better looked into and got something more in the way of a correlated scheme in regard to all these matters.  The position is that the commission has not been abolished.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Commission on Emigration, which was set up in April of last year, I do not know how anyone could expect that commission to report earlier.  The terms of reference are:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;to investigate the causes and consequences of the present level and trend in population in Ireland;</P>
    <P>to examine, in particular, the social and economic effects of birth, death, migration and marriage rates at present and their probable course in the near future;</P>
    <P>to consider what measures, if any, should be taken in the national interest to influence the future trend in population; and generally to consider the desirability of formulating a national population policy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is certainly not too much to ask for 14 months, or even 28 months, for that commission to get down to work and to produce a good report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose is that there was a desire to put the office on a better basis.  It is intended to increase <Col N="928" /> the importance of the office and also, of course, to increase its activities. It was thought that the Taoiseach's Department was the most suitable Department to co-ordinate the activities of the new office.  While this is a new Estimate and involves a sum of £4,000, Deputies will understand that, of course, in the main, the bulk of the expenditure in the current financial year is on, and will be borne out of, the Vote for one of the offices of the Department of Industry and Commerce. Next year there will be a transfer of that sum, which is a pretty big sum, with whatever is the addition to the new Vote.</P>
      <P>As far as this year is concerned there is one new post, the post of deputy director.  We have definitely decided on that and the personnel for it.  That is also part of this effort to speed up the compilation of official statistics. In the main, any comments that have been made by Deputies with regard to official statistics are that they are rather late when produced so as to be somewhat out of date and that we have not got statistics covering a wide enough field.  It is hoped to meet both objections by the provision we are making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, there are four extra statisticians recruited by the Civil Service Commissioners.  They are in replacement of four posts of administrative officers who were in the statistics branch of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  Two of these are being sent to the United States for a course of eight months' special study and training in practical statistical work that comes under the scheme that has been promoted for economic cooperation administration for rendering technical instruction available, including instruction of this type.  We are trying to build up the strength of the office and to give it a greater field of activity, and the change-over from the Department of Industry and Commerce to the Taoiseach's Department is partly to mark the special importance associated with the office and also to give the Director of Statistics more in the way of independence even than what he had.  I am not saying that he was to any degree curtailed.  We hope <Col N="929" /> he will be in an even more independent position than he was.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Donnellan) Michael Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Donnellan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the practice in previous years, I propose to take Votes 9 and 10 together.</P>
      <P>Vote 9 bears the salaries and expenses of the administrative, executive and technical staffs of the Office of Public Works, which is the Office responsible for the administration of Vote 10.</P>
      <P>Vote 10 provides the necessary funds for the purchase of sites and buildings for State purposes, for the erection, maintenance and furnishing of the Government offices and other State-owned premises throughout the country, for arterial drainage and other engineering works, for the erection and improvement of national schools, for the erection of major military buildings, for the maintenance of State-owned parks and State harbours, and for a number of minor activities.</P>
      <P>The gross expenditure under Vote 9 is estimated at £5,263 more than in 1948-49, but an increase of £5,793 in receipts under the Appropriations-in-Aid sub-head is anticipated making the net Vote £530 less than in 1948/49.</P>
      <P>The increase in gross expenditure is almost entirely under sub-head A&mdash; salaries, wages and allowances, due to the revised consolidated Civil Service pay, and to proposed reorganisation of the secretary's branch, the heating and electrical section of the architectural branch and the recruitment of additional staff for the marine and arterial drainage divisions of the engineering branch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increase in estimated Appropri-ations-in-Aid is mainly attributable to the additional amount recoverable from Vote 10 in respect of the salaries and travelling expenses of engineering staff <Col N="931" /> engaged on arterial drainage construction works.</P>
    <P>In Vote 10, the Estimate for Public Works and Buildings shows an increase of £249,870 on the amount voted for 1948-49.  The main increases are in the sums required for new works, drainage, the maintenance of engineering plant and machinery and the operation of the central engineering workshop and stores.</P>
    <P>Expenditure last year on sub-head B &mdash;new works, alterations and additions &mdash;was £492,714, as compared with £299,950 for the previous year.  The considerably increased expenditure last year was due partly to increased wage rates and to the better progress made with the various works owing to the improved situation in regard to supplies of materials.  Of the total expenditure, £308,000 was in respect of grants for building and improvement of national schools, this amount being more than double the previous year's expenditure.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on other new works last year was as far as possible confined to urgent works and to works which were in progress or in respect of which commitments had been entered into.</P>
    <P>For 1949-50 we are providing for a total expenditure of £600,000 under sub-head B, being an increase of £115,000 on the amount voted in 1948-49 due mainly to the increased costs of labour and materials of which the full impact will be felt in 1949-50.  The provision for building and improvement of national schools is increased from £250,000 to £300,000.</P>
    <P>The provision for arterial drainage construction works is £156,000 being an increase of £87,000 on the amount voted last year.  This provision is almost entirely in respect of the estimated net expenditure on the Brosna Catchment Drainage Scheme which is being carried out at present.  Gross expenditure on this scheme, the total estimated cost of which is £1,080,000, is estimated to amount to £233,000 in 1949-50 as compared with £95,000 in 1948-49.</P>
    <P>A scheme for the Glyde and Dee catchment areas has been designed and will shortly be exhibited.  Provision <Col N="932" /> for purchase of the necessary plant and machinery is made in the appropriate sub-head, K (1), and every effort is being made to expedite the commencement of drainage operations.  A provision of £5,000 is being made for such works as may be found possible in 1949-50 and for expenses in connection therewith.</P>
    <P>The amounts provided under the K sub-heads for the purchase and maintenance of plant and machinery for arterial drainage, dredging operations and other engineering works, are necessary to enable the plant and machinery to be brought up to and maintained at the level essential for economical and efficient output.  The increase of £17,000 in the provision for sub-head K (2), for maintenance of engineering plant and machinery, is attributable to the increase in the number of excavating machines and to transport vehicles, etc., engaged on drainage and other engineering works. The increase of £22,200 in the provision for the central engineering workshop and stores (sub-head K (3)) is in respect of the purchase of machine tools and machine parts, the cost of which cannot be entirely recovered in 1949-50 by way of charges against the services on which they are intended to be employed.</P>
    <P>The remaining sub-heads call for little comment.  There is a decrease of £65,000 in the provision for sub-head A&mdash;purchase of sites and buildings, but expenditure under this sub-head is unpredictable.  Maintenance and furnishing costs are still high but it has been considered feasible to make reductions of £25,000 and £11,000 in the sub-head C and D (1) provisions as compared with last year. The increase of £9,500 under sub-head E arises from the general increase in rents and rates and probable new commitments with regard to legations. The decrease of £124,190 in estimated Appropriations-in-Aid&mdash;sub-head L, is due mainly to the inclusion in last year's receipts of a fine of £120,000 paid by the Dublin Corporation in respect of the lease to them of the former Hibernian Military School premises in the Phoenix Park for hospital purposes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOGrady" hpid="Mr. O'Grady Mr. O'Grady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that this Estimate be referred back.  Deputies on all sides of the House will, I am sure, be surprised&mdash;having regard to the spate of propaganda to which we used to have to listen in years gone by &mdash;with regard to the delay in proceeding with arterial drainage.  A short while after taking over Government last year we were treated to a display of propaganda on the initiation of the arterial drainage scheme on the Brosna.  The entire Government was represented there in an effort to make all the political capital they could out of the implementation of that scheme. A new whistle was purchased to start operations but not a word was said by any of the spokesmen there to the effect that the scheme had been prepared by the previous Administration. Actually what happened was that the scheme was to have been put in force in the first week of April but, owing to the change of Government, it was deferred for two months more.  It is about time another whistle was purchased, in case the old one is getting rusty, with a view to starting another scheme.</P>
      <P>The next scheme, which was very far advanced in the course of preparation, was that for the Glyde and Dee in the counties of Monaghan, Meath and Louth.  That scheme was pretty well advanced two years ago; yet, despite all the propaganda of the present Government and their spokesmen, little progress, if any, has been made towards implementing that scheme. Judging by the sum of £5,000 which is provided in the Book of Estimates this year for it, very little progress can be made during the course of the present year.  It seems an extraordinary state of affairs, considering that many of the spokesmen of the present Government, when occupying these benches, seemed to think that drainage was a policy that could be gone ahead with without very much delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They are profiting by experience now: they know that the preparation of a drainage scheme is a pretty big job and that it takes considerable time. The Parliamentary Secretary did not refer to any other scheme.  I wonder <Col N="934" /> what has happened.  I am sure that the staff of the Board of Works are as eager to do their job now as they were in the past and that they must be going ahead with the preparation of other schemes, but&mdash;for some reason, best known to himself, perhaps&mdash;the Parliamentary Secretary was discreetly silent in that connection.</P>
    <P>A scheme was well under way in respect of the rivers in the North Kerry area.  We have not heard a word from the Parliamentary Secretary about it.  If greater progress is not made in the future than has been possible since the change of Government, then it will take a long time before arterial drainage is got properly under way and it will take a great many years before the people in the areas that are low down on the list of priorities will reap any benefit from drainage.  Incidentally, in connection with drainage, I would say that we have so many schemes now, under the various Departments of State, that there will be a certain amount of confusion. The Board of Works is responsible for arterial drainage: some drainage and clearing of streams, etc., is being carried out under the minor employment and the rural improvements schemes and now the Department of Agriculture is entering into the field.  A lot of people down the country will undoubtedly be confused &mdash;particularly in regard to smaller schemes&mdash;as to which of the various Departments of State will be responsible for carrying out certain of these works.</P>
    <P>On the question of drainage in my constituency, I wish to state that I prepared this drainage scheme.  At the time of the passing of the Fergus Act provision was made for the crection of sluice gates at Clarecastle.  That is a good many years ago now, but, as far as we are aware, nothing has been done in the matter beyond placing gauges in the river to estimate the flow of the tide and so forth.  Surely, after that period of time, the Commissioners of Public Works ought now be in a position to state what they propose doing in connection with that particular work if it is considered by the engineering experts concerned that the <Col N="935" /> provision of these sluice gates would be a preventive against flood damage in the future.  On a few occasions, in my memory, these banks have been burst by a combination of forces&mdash;the incoming tide with the western wind meeting the downcoming flow from upstream. If these gates had been there they would, very probably, have helped considerably in that situation. I hope that, before another Estimate under this heading is presented in this House, something will actually be done other than the placing of gauges in the river to know the rate of flow and the height of the river under certain conditions.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is also responsible for the maintenance of public parks.  I should like to know the intention of the Government in connection with the scheme for a garden of remembrance at Parnell Square.  Is it the intention of the Government to proceed with the original proposal of having that place converted into a garden of remembrance in respect of the men who gave their lives in the fight for Irish freedom&mdash;or is it proposed to abandon that scheme and, if so, what is the alternative?  Is the alternative to forget all about them&mdash; or are their memories not to be commemorated in the City of Dublin?</P>
    <P>I notice that there is a token Vote of £10 for the provision of a short-wave broadcasting station.  Here, at least, the Government are profiting by experience. They now realise that the much-criticised provision of a short-wave broadcasting station is very essential at the present time.  However, they have not gone very far in the provision of money for that station although there is a token Vote which, I hope, will enable them to proceed with that work.  I hope that the Government will speed up the erection of that station as much as possible.  It is clearly obvious now, even to the present Government, how essential that work was.  It is to be regretted that it has been delayed as a result of a Government decision for a period of well-nigh two years.</P>
    <P>Another park which is under the jurisdiction of the Parliamentary Secretary is the public park at Killarney <Col N="936" /> which was given as a present to the nation.  At present, visitors are prohibited from driving in their cars through the park.  Possibly, the local hackney-car owners are responsible for that situation.  It is a pity, however, because it creates a bad impression amongst visitors if they have to park their cars on the roadside and go through the park on Shank's mare or drive in a hackney vehicle if they want to see the sights.  The Parliamentary Secretary should look into that matter and see what can be done to facilitate visitors who have, perhaps, only a very limited time at their disposal in the district and the delay occasioned may upset their entire programme.</P>
    <P>Turning again to my own constituency, about two years ago I drew the attention of the Office of Public Works to an ancient and historic ruin in the heart of County Clare&mdash; Leminagh Castle&mdash;which, so far as I know, has not yet been taken over by the Office of Public Works.  It is one of the best preserved castles in that county and is of considerable historic importance.  Recently, when passing by, I made it my business to examine it to see if the usual notice was on the wall intimating that it had been taken over by the Office of Public Works and I saw no such notice.  I hope the Office of Public Works will proceed to take it over at once before it becomes an utter ruin.  I remember a good many years ago passing another very old and historic castle near Ballivor, County Meath, which was occupied by Owen Roe's troops at the Battle of Portlester.  I saw Meath County Council workmen taking down that castle for the purpose of using it as road material.  Let us hope that the same fate does not await Leminagh Castle. I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will take note of my remarks and see that that historic ruin is preserved for the nation.</P>

      <P>So far as drainage is concerned, I do not think many people in the country are worrying about it now, as there is a very considerable shortage of water in almost every county.  I want to mention, however, the question of the erection of a <Col N="937" /> Guards' barracks in Trim.  I take it the Office of Public Works are responsible for the selection of the site for that barracks.  I am not concerned with the shape of the barracks or its architectural design which seems to be perfect, but, if you tried, I do not think you could possibly discover a worse site.  From the point of view of public security, it is 500 or 600 yards from the centre of the town on the road leading into Trim and it is completely isolated.  It is overshadowed by an old jail which is in a half dilapidated condition, with the result that the sun does not shine on it until the evening.  On the opposite side is King John's Castle which, in the morning, prevents the sun from shining on the barracks.  As soon as the dry weather ceases, old Mother Boyne will, I am afraid, come in on the ground floor, because it appears to be under the level of the Boyne when in flood.  The selection of that site was a gross mistake.  I do not know who was responsible for it.  I was under the impression that the barracks was to be built in the centre of the town. It may be argued that there was no available site there, but I believe that a site could have been found.  There are three banks and several business houses and the main traffic is through the centre of the town.  The people of that town should be given the protection that a Guards' barracks gives if it is situated in a proper place.  If people met with a motor accident they would have considerable difficulty in locating the barracks.  However, there is not very much use in talking about the matter now because the building is almost completed, but it is very unfortunate that it should be put in such a position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to see that something like £100,000 more is being provided for the building of schools.  A school is very badly wanted in the parishes of Oristown and Kells.  I am not sure where the Office of Public Works or the manager have decided on erecting the school.  I do know, however, that this matter has been going on for quite a number of years, and that there are children of nine and ten years of age in that district who have not yet gone <Col N="938" /> to school, as the schools are too far away.  If the school is erected in the parish of Oristown, it will be too far away from a certain number of children, and if it is erected in the parish of Kells, it will also be too far away for some children.  In any event, the school has not yet been built.</P>
    <P>A mile or two away there is a magnificent school which was built recently in Gibbstown.  It was built for the migrants' colony set up there. Apparently, however, it has been forgotten about, as the paint is off all the doors and windows and it presents a most dilapidated appearance.  I do not know who is responsible for the maintenance of the school, but it would be a good thing if some paint were put on the doors and the windows and it was tidied up generally, because it is a fine modern school, well situated, with good sanitary conditions and everything else.  I am afraid, however, that it is rapidly going into decay.</P>
    <P>There also seem to be a difficulty about the school in Rathcarne.  It seems to be nobody's child.  The Department of Education or the Office of Public Works should decide who is responsible for the unkeep of these schools.  Incidentally, there is no water available for the Rathcarne school.  All the wells which were made have collapsed.  At present they are trying to find water there.  I was told yesterday that they had gone down a couple of hundred feet but had got no water as yet.  The colony there is a fairly large one.  There are some 60 families in it, although most of the younger people have gone away.  The children and the older people, however, are in an extremely bad way for water.  That is not a matter, of course, for the Office of Public Works, but the maintenance of the schools is very likely their business. It would be a great pity if these schools were allowed to go into decay.</P>
    <P>I should also like to direct attention to the condition of Bective Abbey, a very old and well-known abbey.  Some time ago I happened to go through it. There are many long archways there and in one of them there is a very considerable bulge.  The Office of Public Works might give some attention to that for fear it might collapse.  On last <Col N="939" /> Sunday there must have been 150 or 200 people passing in and out through those arches, and if this arch collapsed it would cause a very serious calamity.</P>
    <P>In North Meath we are not concerned very much with drainage.  We have so many drainage authorities at present that I am really puzzled and would not really know to whom I should appeal.  I hope that position will be clarified in the near future.  It would be a great thing to know exactly whom one could blame.  One cannot blame the Parliamentary Secretary except for arterial drainage.  His position seems to be fairly clear.  I hope he will try and have a decision taken as to who is responsible for the upkeep and maintenance of the Gibbstown and the Rathcarne schools.</P>

      <P>I avail of this opportunity for the space of two minutes to ask the Minister if his attention has been drawn to the stonework in the buildings just outside the door here.  The stonework, which is of soft sandstone in the museum and in the National Library, is now crumbling away and we may be faced with heavy expenditure very shortly.  Does the Board of Works intend to continue to use that <Col N="940" /> soft sandstone in their buildings?  Are they going to allow that soft sandstone to be used by Córas Iompair Éireann? I was asked to draw attention to this. We have all seen the ornamentation on the museum in Kildare Street.  In our own grounds here you can see the weaknesses where portions are crumbling away into dust.  I want to know when they are going to be removed in order to save the rest of the building. I avail of this opportunity to draw attention to the condition of the stonework and to ask at the same time whether that is the kind of stone that is going to be used in the Córas Iompair Éireann building in Store Street.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask, the Parliamentary Secretary, in connection with the continuation of the main drainage scheme, whether he has had any advice from forestry experts as to the advisability of considering simultaneously with drainage, the planting of non-commercial trees, particularly in mountain areas where it is not possible to plant commercially valuable trees; whether, in the long run, the capital cost of non-commercial plantations, combined with main drainage, would be an advantage to the State.  The Forestry Department, no doubt, have their own view about that.  I have spoken with at least two forestry experts of other countries where this problem exists.  Of course, without definite knowledge they would not be able to state the exact facts in regard to the situation here.  I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary whether, in connection with any review he has made, he has considered this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, I should like to ask him whether he has any definite views on the fundamental drainage of the Shannon Basin.  As the House is aware, the Drainage Commission reported firstly that the capital cost of building levées along the Shannon Basin would, in their view, be prohibitive and the value thus obtained would be uneconomic.  There is the opposite point of view that, even if it was not economic, for the sake of the happiness and the conditions of living of the people along the Shannon, the work should be carried out.  The <Col N="941" /> Drainage Commission then went on to report that a modified scheme for deepening the channel between Athlone and Meelick at a pre-war cost of some £500,000 might prevent flooding, but that it would not prevent the most serious type of flooding which would occur in periods of abnormally bad weather.  As the Parliamentary Secretary knows, there are two periods when flooding occurs along the Shannon, particularly in the Athlone, Roscommon and Offaly area&mdash;the winter flooding which does not affect adversely the interests of some people and affects adversely the interests of other riparian owners, and the summer flooding which takes place in August, preventing the removal of hay and a source of great disadvantage to riparian owners.  I presume that the cost of deepening the Shannon, on the post-war basis, would be more than double the estimate of the commission. I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary what is his view on the matter.  From memory, he answered a question addressed to him by a Deputy as to the value of opening the sluice at Meelick, where flooding took place.  I think he replied that in the case of very bad weather it would not solve the problem.  It might have effect when there was a heavy shower or a few days of rain, but in conditions such as existed for a considerable period from 1938 to 1947 the opening of that weir would not be entirely effective.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary a question already addressed to him by other Deputies. Has he arranged for any kind of coordination in connection with the various drainage schemes, either in operation or about to be put into operation?  In North Longford a considerable amount of reclamation work was done under the previous Government's farm improvements scheme, and riparian owners along the tributaries to the Carulin, on account of sporadic bad weather, did not observe the constant increase in flooding along their banks, caused by both bog drainage and reclamation drainage, until a considerable period had elapsed. Then quite suddenly it became apparent that even in a time of normal <Col N="942" /> rainfall the flooding was more serious. One of the results was the stoppage of drainage work as work that could be done under the farm improvements scheme in the North Longford area. If the Minister for Agriculture's reclamation scheme succeeds in areas such as these there will be farmers who will be affected by flooding but who may not appreciate the increase of flooding because of the fact that the weather varies from year to year.  It may be rather hard for them to remember.  It would be hard for them to know what is an increase of flooding on their particular holdings.  Therefore, it would seem essential to create some kind of co-ordination machinery so that the Board of Works is immediately aware of the general effect of the reclamation scheme.  Equally the other schemes, such as bog development and rural development schemes, should be dove-tailed into drainage operations, taken as a whole.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary whether, under the rural improvement scheme, the drainage of small schemes undertaken collectively by farmers is still possible or whether that is to be entirely replaced by the new reclamation scheme.  I should also like to ask whether the bog development schemes will continue as before.  I think I am not permitted to speak on bog development schemes on this Vote, because I understand they come under the Employment and Emergency Schemes Vote.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary, the commissioners, the chief engineering officials and any other officials who may have any responsibility for the wonderful work that has been and is being carried out inside of a very short period <Col N="943" /> on the Brosna drainage scheme.  I was one of the Deputies who was privileged to be present when that scheme was started by the Taoiseach.  About two weeks ago I had the opportunity of having another look at the wonderful work that has been carried out there within the past year.  When that work is completed, as I am sure it will be in the near future, the Parliamentary Secretary and all those who had any responsibility for the preparation of the scheme and the carrying out of the work, can look back on a landmark in the history of the Board of Works. Before my visit to the Brosna drainage scheme, I had been under the impression that the Barrow held first place in the history of works carried out by the Department of Public Works.  I think everybody who has seen the work on the Brosna will agree that it represents&mdash;I suppose that is due to the organisation of the machinery necessary &mdash;a wonderful improvement on the work previously carried out on the Barrow.</P>
      <P>Within the last couple of months the workers employed on the Brosna scheme made representations for an improvement in their wages and working conditions.  I want to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on the way in which he handled the dispute which arose there.  His method was very unlike the previous methods of red tape that were employed for dealing with disputes of the kind.  The Parliamentary Secretary took his courage in his hands.  He went down personally and met the representatives of the workers concerned and settled the matter on the spot within a few hours.  I, for one, welcome that departure from the previous red tape method of dealing with labour disputes affecting Government Departments.  The Parliamentary Secretary has established a very welcome precedent.  I hope that it is one which will be followed by any of his colleagues who may be concerned in disputes of that kind in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that since the Parliamentary Secretary came into office he has been pressed with proposals put forward for an improvement of the River Nore and the drainage scheme and maintenance <Col N="944" /> work to be carried out there.  I know, of course, that pressure of the same kind comes to him from all over the country in connection with various schemes.  In the case of the Nore, it is nearly a year since the Parliamentary Secretary met a deputation representing the three county councils concerned &mdash;North Tipperary, Laoighis and Kilkenny. Since that date very serious damage has been done in the Kilkenny end of the Nore.  The three county councils, as well as the Deputies from the three constituencies concerned, would welcome a statement from the Parliamentary Secretary that he hopes&mdash;I trust he will be able to make such a statement&mdash;to do something in connection with the drainage and the clearance of that river at an early date.  I was wondering whether the Parliamentary Secretary would be in a position to recommend to the Minister for Local Government that when the Local Authorities (Works) Bill is passed, a certain amount of preliminary work might be carried out on the Nore under that measure.  I know, of course, that that is a matter which will call for consideration and decision by the engineering advisers to the Parliamentary Secretary.  I hope, however, that he will be able to make a statement on the lines which I have indicated, so as to deal with a situation which involves the flooding of 1,600 acres of land every year.  That flooding will continue until something is done by the Department.  Perhaps if some preliminary work could be done on the Nore under the Works Bill it would prevent flooding of that kind occurring. I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will be able to say that, when the Works Bill becomes law, preliminary work can be undertaken on the Nore.</P>

      <P>I have just a few words to say on the Estimate.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary will expect me to refer to the Brick and Cashen drainage scheme in North Kerry.  This is a scheme which badly requires to be done.  Representations have been made to the Parliamentary Secretary by various parties with a view to having it carried out. I am personally aware that the <Col N="945" /> Parliamentary Secretary himself went down to North Kerry during the local elections campaign and, I think, he left the people there under the impression that the scheme was to be carried out right away.  I was not present myself to hear any pronouncement that may have been made by the Parliamentary Secretary, but I have been told that he gave the people concerned to understand that the scheme was to be commenced by the 1st of June this year.  I do not know whether there is any foundation for that statement or not, but, apart entirely from whatever statement or statements that he may have made to the people down there on that occasion, I want to impress upon him&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>The people down there were so convinced that they were prepared to lay bets on it.  However, I hope that very much time will not be allowed to elapse until work on the scheme is commenced, because of all the schemes that have been mentioned here I imagine that this is the most important one.  No doubt every Deputy sees the importance of his own scheme, but in regard to this scheme that I speak of at least 100,000 acres of land are involved.  When serious flooding takes place all that land is covered for several months, and it is some of the best land in the County Kerry.  Having regard to that, I think that this is a scheme that should be given an early priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether any Deputy has referred to the question of historical buildings.  I think the time has <Col N="946" /> arrived when the Office of Public Works should make a general survey of the country with a view to ascertaining what historical buildings require to be repaired and maintained.  I know a few of them here and there; they appear to be nobody's concern.</P>
    <P>I think it would be a national loss if some of those buildings were allowed to fall into ruin and decay.  I would advise the Parliamentary Secretary and the Department to have a survey taken of all such buildings in the country.</P>
    <P>Now, as regards national schools, I think that the amount that is being made available this year is £300,000, or £50,000 over the amount that was provided last year.  I do not consider that a sufficient sum, having regard to the need there is for building schools in many parts of the country.  I am aware there are schools in County Kerry that are not fit to house school children. There is one school particularly, within three miles of the village of Ballyduff, in a place called Ballincrossig, and I think it is one of the worst in the country from the point of view of repair. Perhaps later on I will give particulars of that school to the Parliamentary Secretary with a view to having the building reconstructed or a new school built on the same site or near it.</P>

There is considerable difficulty in that area in that respect, but I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will endeavour to have that matter expedited.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether the Board of Works are directly responsible for the erection of a school at Tynock, County Carlow, but there has been undue delay in carrying out the erection of that building there.</P>

      <P>The work of erection is actually in progress but the building has not been completed; it may be that the work has been set by contract.</P>
      <P>I do not know what the intention of the Parliamentary Secretary was when he decided upon the erection of the platform outside this House.  I do not think that even when it is completed it can be regarded as a monument or an ornament or indeed any improvement of this building from any point of view. It will not even facilitate parking arrangements for motor cars.  As a matter of fact, I think it will cause a certain amount of inconvenience in the parking of cars.</P>
      <P>I think the whole idea appears to be misconceived and I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to tell us what really was intended to be achieved by the erection of that platform&mdash;one cannot call it a monument and it is really difficult to describe it.  From the point of view of convenience in parking cars it will be more of an obstruction than anything else.  Something in the nature of an island in the centre of the lawn would be far more suitable.</P>
      <P>With Deputy Byrne, I am rather interested in this, that most of the public buildings adjoining Leinster House are being defaced by reason of the deterioration of the stone on the facets of those buildings.  The more important buildings that are so affected are the National Museum and the National Library.  It is unfortunate that such an inferior type of stone was selected in the first place.  It is to be hoped that the Board of Works will endeavour to ensure that no stone of that type will be used in the future in the construction of public buildings. I will remind the Parliamentary Secretary that there is in County Wicklow the best type of granite that is available anywhere in Europe.  If he will turn his eyes in that direction he will find that he will get a reliable type of stone.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first fine rapture <Col N="948" /> of opposition long ago one was inclined to view the Board of Works as public enemy No. 1.  There was a period when one felt inclined to say that the Board of Works was the Board of No Works. It is now responsible for buildings running to £200,000, plus something over £1,000,000, and I feel that their work is extremely onerous and complicated. It varies from National Museums to drainage.  From one's experience of it, one feels that it is most effective in the maintenance of all Government institutions.  It does that work extremely well and it is hardly fair to blame it for certain shortcomings.  The more one has experience of it the more one feels that it should get more help.  It is a far more important Department than is usually thought when the Estimates are under consideration.</P>
      <P>Owing to the pressure of work in other branches, drainage and so on, I felt there was not as much attention given to the very complicated relations that necesarily exist between the Post Office and the Board of Works as should be given.  The plans required are plans which must very largely be prepared by the experts in the Post Office who know what is required in the way of buildings and machinery, and for that reason there has to be a constant interchange of ideas and there are readjustments which cause considerable delay.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether the Board of Works have been able to develop a scheme which was under consideration when I left, so that a certain number of architects would devote their attention to the work in the Post Office. This is a matter which I would like to raise on the Post Office Estimate.  I feel that the Post Office requires a very great speeding up because of its reactions on business generally through the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another aspect of this Department has reference to cultural matters. There has been a considerable neglect of these things, an inclination to regard them as things that could be done with the left hand, because they were ornamental.  Deputies will recollect the kind of answer I got to-day about the building of a broadcasting <Col N="949" /> station.  I was told that we must build houses first.  Must we always use that stick to beat every effort at enterprise? Surely the building of houses could go ahead without interfering with the work which must necessarily be done if the nation is to be built up?</P>
    <P>Cultural matters are a big asset in the earning of dollars.  In this connection our national monuments require great attention.  Possibly they require more brains and initiative to give them the necessary support.  I do not think there is anybody at the head of that particular section.  I believe the person who was appointed has resigned. Whoever deals with this should be a person of enterprise and one who knows how monuments are cherished in other countries.  One is really ashamed of some of our monuments at the moment.  They are overgrown with grass, weeds and trees.  These historic monuments should be kept as attractively as possible, because they have a tremendous traditional value from the point of view of tourists.</P>
    <P>The present National Library is over-crowded. It is impossible to carry on the work properly there.  A scheme was initiated in connection with this but the plans are not being pursued. Neither are the plans being pursued for the building of a proper National University.  We have heard a lot of criticism of ourselves because we wanted to erect new buildings.  We were accused of extravagance.  The proposed buildings were described as luxury buildings.  Buildings such as these are not an extravagance.  They are essential in any country.</P>

      <P>Another important item is the museum at Kilmainham.  I notice that will not be pursued this year.  I think it would be very valuable to have a proper historical museum.  The present museum is over-crowded.  It is, of course, our shop window for tourists.  Distinguished people visit the museum and they subsequently say whether they were impressed or otherwise. Attention should be paid to the museum.  An American expert said recently that it is to the Irish race abroad we mostly appeal.  We should show these people the very best we have when they visit our shores.</P>
      <P>There was a proposed extension to the National Gallery.  That is urgently needed.  The Hibernian Academy has no proper accommodation.  That, I think, is a matter for the Department of Education.  The scheme for the building of a national theatre has also been set aside.  We all know that our drama and our acting has helped to put us on the map, especially in America, where hitherto we were regarded as hewers of wood and drawers of water.  In recent years no important buildings have been erected with the exception of the Department of Industry and Commerce. No building of any distinction has taken place in Dublin in the last 50 years.</P>
      <P>I was glad to hear the Minister for Finance say that he was friendly towards cultural developments with the object of attracting tourists.  I was also glad to know that the front of Leinster House will be put into some sort of order before the end of August. It has certainly taken a long time to remove the old statue and make the necessary improvements.</P>

    <P>The Fianna Fáil Government had plans for the reconstruction of Dublin Castle.  I do not know whether those plans are being actively pursued.  This year it is hoped to spend about £7,000 on Dublin Castle.  In the Vote for 1948-49 £30,000 was to have been spent. Of that sum £9,200 has been spent already.  I do not know what the position is at the moment.  Perhaps the <Col N="951" /> Parliamentary Secretary will enlighten us.</P>
    <P>I am vitally interested in the construction of proper Government offices in Waterford, and I am disappointed to see that there is only a token Vote for that purpose in the current financial year.  I hope this matter will be pursued at an early date.  We all know the Office of Public Works has a colossal amount of work to do.  Forty-eight new Garda barracks are needed by the Department of Justice.  Unless some initiative is taken, our great-grandchildren will be dead before the present Estimates will be cleared at our present rate of going.  I think there is need for general reorganisation from the top.</P>

      <P>The glasshouses are doing very well.  The position with regard to the St. Andrew Post Office looks hopeful, since the Government propose to spend £12,000 this year. When Deputy Dillon was in opposition I was blamed for everything that went wrong.  This could really be described as a nerve centre and work on it should be speeded up.  I see that in the Pearse Street Post Office the postmen's department will be extended. The sorting office will not be tackled evidently.  The total estimate for the work has not yet been made.  We had got title for the ground before we left office and there is no reason why the work should not go ahead rapidly.  I notice that it is one of the buildings for which plans have not been completed. <Col N="952" /> There are two others here which appear in italics.  I do not know why they are being dropped, but I shall wait until the Estimate for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs comes up to raise the matter.  Quite a number of post offices are being left over&mdash;Arklow, Ballina, Cahirciveen and Carlow.  Cork head post office is going ahead.  I am glad of that, because it is a very important office. The quicker it is completed the better it will be.  It was impossible to complete it until 1948 because of lack of materials.  Nothing is being done in Galway with regard to the provision of a proper post office there.  I notice that in connection with Waterford £5,500 will be spent this year.  The total estimate for the work is £111,000. It looks as if work will be a little bit slow there.  Waterford, like Cork, requires special attention.  Nothing will be done in connection with Wicklow Post Office.</P>
      <P>In connection with broadcasting, I take it that a Supplementary Estimate will be introduced for the short-wave station.  Only a token Vote appears in this Estimate.  The erection of the broadcasting house, I was told, would have to await the easing of the housing situation, which, I think, is absurd, in view of the fact that the efficiency of both the people in the G.P.O.&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do think the Government or the Board of Works are a bit conservative in not employing outside contractors to carry out a lot of their work.  If they did, it would save them a great many headaches, would give a good deal of employment outside and <Col N="953" /> would considerably speed up work of national importance.  Dublin, for instance, has no proper hall for conferences. We had almost signed a contract to take over the Rotunda would The plans were that the Rotunda would be used for conferences or even exhibitions and for various public purposes. There is no adequate building to hold even the Feis Ceoil or public functions of that sort.  Dublin was beginning to get a reputation as being an excellent place for conferences.  The Air Conference that took place here obtained for us a reputation which placed us ahead of places even like Paris.  These big places cannot give the great attention to conferences which small places can.  Other countries in Europe are trying to get as many of these assemblies as possible.  Not merely the reconstruction of the Rotunda but the building of a first-class concert hall&mdash; which is absolutely essential for any civilised country&mdash;would certainly be a paying proposition.  I do hope, now that the Minister has begun to see the necessity for utilising tourist development as a means of earning dollars, that he will rise to the situation and do something that will place us on a level with cities such as Salzburg. Austria is a very poor country at the moment, but it managed to make Salzburg a great centre for musical festivals.  I am sure the people there are nor any richer than we are ourselves. We are a far richer country from the point of view of external assets and if some of the external assets were spent in the way I suggest, it would be very valuable indeed.  I do feel that the Department of the Board of Works does not get a fair crack of the whip and that they should be treated as a much more important body, as they are essential to the building up of our national assets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Some Deputy on the opposite side of the House mentioned that the problem of the moment was that some rural areas were short of water rather than that any great necessity existed for drainage in these areas.  I am sure he meant that that obtained only in fine weather, but it would show a very peculiar attitude <Col N="954" /> towards the question of drainage if it were to be carried out according to the type of weather which we happen to have at any particular time.  So far most Deputies have had something to say in praise of the work of the Parliamentary Secretary in connection with the problem of arterial drainage. Deputy Davin, for instance, complimented him and his staff on their work so far in the Brosna area.  No doubt, the people in whose area work is being carried out are satisfied, but there are other Deputies, such as Deputy Kissane, who are anxious to know when drainage in their particular constituencies will be commenced. That, to my mind, raises the problem of priority.  I think we should have some idea of how the priority list is arranged and on what it is based.  To my knowledge, the schemes that are being carried out under the Arterial Drainage Act are done according to the amount of good land adjacent to each particular river.  Preference is given to rivers in the vicinity of a considerable area of good land or upland. Rivers which are in close proximity to bogland areas are very low on the priority list.  I want the Parliamentary Secretary to inform the House whether that is the method by which the priority list is determined.  If it is, I do not agree with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have the position in rural Ireland that the majority of the population live in the poorer areas and on what can be described as the worst possible type of land.  I think that if we want to raise the standard of living of these people and to keep them from emigrating we shall have to tackle the problem of drainage in their areas first.  The case could be put up, of course, that good land should get the preference but it is not so much a question of draining good land as a question of relieving small farmers whose lands are flooded constantly for six or seven months of the year.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will tell us what is the order of priority for arterial drainage. If he cannot give the exact priorities in which the rivers are to be tackled, he could at least furnish us with an idea of the system on which the list is based.  A considerable amount <Col N="955" /> of work has been taken out of the hands of the Parliamentary Secretary in order to enable him to tackle this question of arterial drainage.  If it is the case that he is going to be relieved of a good deal of work by the new land reclamation scheme and the Local Authorities (Works) Bill, he should be able to devote more attention to the big problem of arterial drainage.  In that respect I would like to know if every possible effort is being made to purchase machinery abroad.  The buyers will, I hope, look, seek and search everywhere to secure more and better machinery every day.  I hope that the Board of Works are not going to sit down and pat themselves on the back now that the Brosna has been started and promise themselves that the Glyde and Dee and the others will be tackled next year or the year after.  That would not be satisfactory and it will not be accepted from the Parliamentary Secretary, I assure you.</P>
    <P>Proof of the earnestness of the Board of Works in their desire to tackle drainage problems would be seen in their attempt to secure the services of engineers.  In order to make a success of any drainage work it is necessary to have the best engineering skill available. If we intend to have three, four or even five arterial drainage schemes going at the same time it will be necessary to have first-class engineers and these engineers should be trained at the present time so that at a later stage they will be able to take over the bigger jobs.  It would be no use looking for engineers in two or three years' time when the job is about to start.  It is not for me to tell the Board of Works how to train engineers, but engineers on drainage schemes need special training; the ordinary qualifications of a civil engineer will not suffice because there are various special aspects which they must study.</P>
    <P>There are a number of local problems in my own constituency which I brought to the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary before and again I want to congratulate him, this time on his action last year when I asked him to <Col N="956" /> come to open the sluice gates on the River Shannon at Meelick and he did so.  He did so, I know, in spite of the advice of his technical experts.  I have said before that experts are not always right; they were not right with regard to afforestation and the same applies to the drainage of the River Shannon. Deputy Childers mentioned two types of flooding, summer flooding and winter flooding, and the most serious, to my mind, is summer flooding, because it comes at a time when the hay is down or in cocks.  Deputy Childers said that it prevents hay from being taken away but I do not believe that.  It takes hay away itself and there is no question of the farmer being able to take it away.</P>
    <P>Hundreds of thousands of cocks are taken down the Shannon yearly.  It rises within two days and covers a terrific area of country within a very short space of time.  The suggestion was put up that if the sluice gates at Meelick were opened when the heavy rain came the callow land would not be flooded.  I brought that suggestion to the Parliamentary Secretary and he agreed to give the thing a trial.  The engineers and experts were against it but when the trial was over I maintain, in spite of what the engineers may say, that it proved a success.  There is one further point which I would like to bring to the notice of the Parliamentary Secretary in that connection.  It is no use opening the sluice gates when the flood has started to rise.  If it has started it rises so fast that the damage is done, but as soon as a heavy fall of rain comes the sluice gates should be opened immediately prior to the rise of the flood.  If that is done it will relieve people between Athlone and Meelick. Those people have very poor holdings and are dependent to a very great extent on the land on the banks of the Shannon so every effort should be made to give them at least temporary relief until such time as something can be done under the Arterial Drainage Act to help them.</P>
    <P>Another problem in my area is the River Suck.  There are numerous other rivers there but I do not wish to take up the time of the House in dealing with them.  The Parliamentary Secretary himself is as well acquainted with <Col N="957" /> the Suck as I am because it flows between our two constituencies.  He must have people coming to him time and again as they come to me asking if something can be done.  I do not know how Kerry gets priority on the list.  If it is on merits I do not mind.</P>
    <P>One point about which I would like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary is arrears of drainage rates.  In my constituency and in the Parliamentary Secretary's constituency there is a great grouse from people who have been pulled up by the Board of Works with regard to arrears of drainage rates, along the Suck particularly and in South Roscommon.  One example is a man who was brought to court recently for failing to pay 13 years' arrears of drainage rates.  I think it is an absolute scandal that a man should be asked to pay arrears over 13 years for work which was not properly done at the start.  Since it was done his land has been flooded yearly and yet the man is asked to pay.  That is only one example, but hundreds of farmers are affected along the Suck and other rivers in the West.  I do not think the Board of Works should go back 15 years in order to suck the life blood out of a man.  I am not an authority on this, but I think the Board of Works is not statute barred and can go back as far as it likes to claim these arrears.  I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to deal as leniently as possible with people who are not able to pay these arrears because their land is unable to support themselves let alone support the Board of Works.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>There is naturally a good deal of anxiety in areas that have suffered considerably from flooding as to the rate of progress that has been made with the arterial drainage schemes and in that connection the City of Kilkenny, which suffered a great deal is, I think, entitled to consideration.  We are apt to forget in times like these what can happen in periods of heavy rainfall or particularly bad weather and the tribulations through which the people of Kilkenny passed a few years ago are not likely to be forgotten by them for a long time.  The same is true of <Col N="958" /> Carlow, and in that case the people had a belief that the troubles they suffered during heavy flooding were to some extent accentuated by the bog works in the Midlands.  I cannot say whether that is true or not, but that is their belief.  Unfortunately, in the case of Carlow Town the sewerage was affected because the Barrow is a rather sluggish river unlike the Nore, and does not take refuse rapidly.  A characteristic of the Nore is that it is pretty fast-running and, while floods may be severe in the neighbourhood of Kilkenny, they do not last more than a few days, whereas in the Nore, the tendency is for the waters of the Barrow not to subside for a considerable time, the country being more flat.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary had a discussion with the local representatives regarding the drainage of those rivers.  I would like to know what progress has been made in connection with the survey of the arterial drainage regions which the Commissioners of Public Works have in mind that the country ought to be divided into, before this arterial drainage work can be completed.  I think it is necessary to deal with the areas which suffer particularly, and where the fertility of the land which is affected is such that there is considerable loss to the country that it should be out of production, and that makes it incumbent upon me to press the Parliamentary Secretary for a statement as to when he thinks it likely that the preliminary step of the survey of the basins of the Nore and Barrow systems&mdash;the lower Barrow&mdash;will be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the understanding we had, when the Arterial Act of 1945 was passed, was that the arterial drainage system was the essential foundation of minor and subordinate drainage schemes throughout the country. Unless we hear to the contrary from the Parliamentary Secretary, I take it that the position still remains that the arterial drainage scheme then contemplated is to proceed on the lines that were then envisaged.  How exactly these minor schemes are to work in with the larger national drainage work, and how minor drainage is to proceed in areas which have not yet been even <Col N="959" /> surveyed and where there is no prospect of the larger arterial drainage work being completed for a period of years, are questions which I certainly cannot answer and I doubt if anyone who is conversant with drainage problems could answer them.  Either the experts on the drainage commission were entirely at fault in this matter or an explanation is required of what is likely to happen at the present time if minor drainage work is carried on and if it does not fit in with the general scheme for the drainage of a particular river basin which will be carried out, presumably, in due course.</P>
    <P>The question of the conservation of water has been raised.  It may be that when the drainage commission reported, seeing that their task was to deal with arterial drainage, they had special regard to the historical facts connected with it and the development of the system.  In other countries, however, attention has been given to the problem of conserving the waters. There seems to be a feeling in the country among engineers that we ought to consider carefully what the position is as regards our ultimate water supply.  It may be that the amount of precipitation in this country renders it unnecessary to pay a great deal of attention to that aspect of the matter, but there has been a feeling expressed that the area in the centre of the country acts rather as a sponge which holds a great deal of this precipitation and that it is to the advantage of an agricultural country like ours that that water should be held there and that it should be drained off ultimately into the surrounding areas.</P>
    <P>In any case, the point has been made that we should not regard water as entirely an enemy; we should regard it as a thing that, though perhaps not always necessary in the places where it occurs in too great abundance, is needed in other places.  The problem of the conservation of water, and the possibility of utilising this water which will be drained off under the arterial drainage for power development, is one to which I think it is right to call the Parliamentary Secretary's attention. In fact, if the present Commissioners <Col N="960" /> of the Board of Works were to go into this whole problem of arterial drainage and devote their whole energies to the arterial drainage schemes only, I am sure they would have more than would fully occupy their time.  They have a great many other duties to perform. If drainage is to be gone ahead with in the way that members on all sides of the House demand, then nothing else would suffice, in my opinion, than that there should be a special drainage commission which would be empowered to go ahead and do all the requisite work.  Such a commission should not be burdened, of course, with all the other multifarious duties that the Commissioners have at the present time.</P>
    <P>I had not known, until Deputy Little mentioned the matter, that the inspector of ancient monuments had resigned and has not been replaced. He did excellent work during his period there, and while we can all see the things that have not been attended to, marvellous work was done with some of the ancient monuments like Dunbrody Abbey, Cashel and other places.  Large sums of money were spent and a great deal of architectural and skilled planning was put into the work and the country has benefited to that extent.  If the country is not aware of it, and the people do not take the trouble to find out what has been done, that is their loss.  When tourists &mdash;particularly Americans &mdash; come to other countries, it is noted that it is to the historic landmarks they go, and I think the representatives of E.C.A. in this country have called attention to this matter in their radio talks.  I have only to hope that the work carried on so well for so many years will be continued with equal success by whoever is to succeed the outgoing officer. I also suggest that these ancient monuments ought to be signposted better.  It should be part of the work of the ancient monuments committee and they should be enabled to erect suitable signposts on the nearest public or trunk roads, to set out the distance and so on, and the nature of the monument in the vicinity.</P>
    <P>Deputy Little also called attention to the question of the institutions of science and art.  I cannot let the <Col N="961" /> opportunity pass without again expressing my regret that the Government has removed from the Estimates even the token Vote for the proposed new National Library.  Nothing has been done to provide additional accommodation since the building was established in 1890.  Since that time, the number of readers must have increased enormously, as the population of Dublin has increased by hundreds of thousands during that period.  I venture to say&mdash;at least, I hope&mdash;that it has become far more literate and far more highly educated and more interested in matters that would require access to the National Library.  We have large collections of documents accruing there from time to time, like the Ormonde Deeds, that would require special accommodation.  At the present time, large numbers of those documents and books have not suitable accommodation and have to be laid on the floor. Moreover, the accommodation for readers is limited and is not at all adequate, having regard to the importance of the City of Dublin from a cultural point of view.  We are the chief centre, from the point of view of Celtic scholarship and from the point of view of antiquarian research and folklore, as well as from our own national history point of view and we certainly would regard the National Library as being the foremost place where foreign scholars would come and do research work.  In fact one of the objects, one of the values of purchasing the Ormonde Deeds was that, since there was no other collection of that nature in this country&mdash;documents coming right down from the time of the Norman Conquest&mdash;scholars interested in the medieval period as well as the later period, in feudalism and so on, would come here to study these documents.</P>
    <P>I heard some suggestion from the other side that this talk of new large public buildings is out of order, but I see that we are to spend a great many millions on hospitals and other large schemes.  I have nothing to say against these&mdash;I am sure they are all very worthy purposes&mdash;but the point is that, when this building was taken over by the Provisional Government, the rooms at the back belonged to the museum. The museum never got back these <Col N="962" /> rooms and never got any alternative accommodation.  A certain number of rooms were taken away in that way. It has been impossible, since the Irish Government was set up, to show one of the most important collections, the geological collection, properly, and, in more recent years, the Irish antiquities section of the National Museum has grown enormously.</P>
    <P>Everyone knows that during the period of excavations under the former director and for very many years prior to the war, and even during the war, there were thousands of thousands of new accessions.  The staff had to be increased, and, in addition, there is a particular section devoted to recent Irish history from 1916 down, which is very inadequately housed and not at all accommodated in the way we would wish.  One of these sections is entirely new and is growing and the other, the Irish antiquities section, has also grown enormously.  You have also new departments like the department of coins and the department of stamps. Every country in the world which makes a new issue sends its stamps here and all these stamps have to be catalogued, labelled and put in cases. It is only by treating these buildings as a whole and seeing what can be done to improve the situation that I see any hope for an improvement in the way of the provision of additional accommodation not alone for the library but for the museum.</P>
    <P>If a new National Library is provided, it would be possible to transfer some of these collections, which are either not on show at all or very inadequately housed in the National Library at present.  One of the functions of the library is the collection of the national archives&mdash;for example, all the documents in connection with the history of the Irish national movement and the recent struggle for Irish independence.  The intention was that they should ultimately be placed in the custody of the librarian at the National Library.  All countries who pride themselves on their history, and particularly on the movements which brought about their national independence, feel that <Col N="963" /> special steps ought to be taken to preserve these records, and anybody who reads about the French Revolution, the enormous interest taken in it and the huge literature that has grown up about it during the past 150 years, will have some realisation of the way posterity will regard the history of this country over the past 30 or 40 years.</P>
    <P>I suggest that if we are in earnest about that matter, and if we want to provide proper and suitable accommodation for these national archives, we ought to be interested in seeing that they are properly housed&mdash;first, that there is sufficient accommodation for the housing of the documents proper; secondly, that there is accommodation for the staff who look after them; thirdly, that there is accommodation for the readers; and, fourthly, that there is accommodation for the students who come there to study.</P>

      <P>While I believe the Parliamentary Secretary is doing his best in relation to carrying out the arterial drainage scheme, at least in one part of the country, we in Kerry have a serious grievance because, so far, nothing has been done.  In South Kerry, not even a survey has yet been made of the river Maine, where serious floodings occur at various periods of the year.  In North Kerry, not even one machine has yet been sent in in connection with the drainage of the Brick and Cashen.  There is also another river in South Kerry, the river Flesk, which flows into the Killarney lakes and which frequently causes flooding of houses, land and roads.  No attempt has been made to carry out a survey there.  In my part of the county, there are numerous townlands where the people have no means of access to their farms by means of bridges.  They have to cross rivers at fords, and, when the rivers are in flood, they have to stay inside, if they want to come out, and must stay outside when they want to go in. During the past year and a half I, and, I presume, other Deputies for the area, have made representations to the Office of Public Works with regard to the erection of bridges which are absolutely <Col N="964" /> essential if the people are not to live for all time under very primitive conditions.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 7, Section 10 (1), to delete lines 33 and 34 and substitute the following paragraph:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="965" /> (b)  either&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  was awarded, under the First Schedule to the Act of 1927, a gratuity on account of such loss of employment, or</P>
    <P>(ii)  would have been awarded, under the First Schedule to the Act of 1927, a gratuity on account of such loss of employment if the reference in paragraph 1 of that Schedule to a period of not less than two nor more than five years had been a reference to a period of not more than five years, and.</P>
    <P>I undertook on Committee Stage to consider the position of certain employees of the Dublin Corporation who were employed at the Pigeon House at the time of the closing down of the station in 1930 but who, owing to their short service&mdash;less than two years&mdash;were not entitled to either pension or gratuity.  This amendment, if accepted, will enable the Electricity Supply Board to count the prior service of these men with the Dublin Corporation in addition to their service with the board and to grant them non-contributory pensions.  I think I should say at this stage that on the Committee Stage Deputy Lemass referred to certain individuals covered by the section who received gratuities on the closing of the Pigeon House Station in respect of their service prior to the date of closing and he urged that the pensions that would be payable to these individuals under Section 10 should be based not only on their service with the Electricity Supply Board but also on the prior service at the station before it was closed.  The men already received compensation in respect of that prior service by way of a gratuity and, as I said on Committee Stage, it would be objectionable in principle to give double credit in respect of the service by allowing it to count ultimately for pension purposes. I am prepared to make an offer to the individuals.  As the section stands, they will on retirement be entitled in respect of service with the Electricity Supply Board either to get a pension in respect of that service or to get a reduced pension with a gratuity.  The option as to which form of award will be taken rests with the individual.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="966" /> Any individual who opts to take in respect of his service with the board a pension and a gratuity and who also agrees to an abatement of the gratuity ultimately to be received on retirement by an amount equivalent to the gratuity already received in respect of service before the Pigeon House was closed could be given credit on ultimate retirement for all his service and, if that is agreeable, I could move an amendment in the Seanad to give effect to that.  I think we must adhere to the principle that you cannot give double compensation in respect of service and if the men are prepared to abate their ultimate gratuity by the amount which they received in the earlier gratuity, I can move an amendment in the Seanad to meet the Deputy's point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is a fair enough offer, but I want to be sure that I have it straight.  On retirement these men are entitled to a pension plus a gratuity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>And the offer is that, if they take the first of these alternatives, a pension plus a gratuity, and deduct from that the gratuity they already got, then the pension will date back to the beginning of their service?</P>

      <P>That seems reasonable enough.  It is better than nothing anyway. I can understand fully that the adoption of the proposal which I made here in Committee might prove embarrassing in some other cases, perhaps in future cases which have not yet arisen, and that perhaps it is not the right kind of precedent to establish.  I felt that as the position which existed in the Pigeon House was being cleared up, it was better to clear it up completely because there will always be a sense of grievance because some men may get what they consider to be less favourable treatment than others.  The suggestion of the Parliamentary Secretary seems to be a reasonable compromise and I should be glad if he <Col N="967" /> would do as he suggested, arrange for the submission of an amendment on these lines in the Seanad.  I can undertake that the amendment will be suported here when it comes back.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 8, to insert before Section 11 the following section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Where&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) on the date of the passing of this Act, a person is in the continuous employment of the board and is paying contributions and is entitled to superannuation benefits under a superannuation scheme under the Superannuation Act of 1942, and</P>
      <P>(b)  he was formerly employed in relation to the generation or distribution of electricity by the Dublin United Tramways Company (1896) Limited,</P>
      <P>the following provisions shall have effect:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  sub-sections (2) and (3) of Section 15 of the Superannuation Act of 1942 shall apply to such person subject to the modification that the reference in the said sub-section (3) to actual service in the undertaking from which the transfer to the board took place shall be construed as a reference to service in the employment of the Dublin United Tramways Company (1896) Limited,</P>
      <P>(ii) for the purposes of Section 8 of this Act, such person shall be regarded as a person to whom Section 15 of the Superannuation Act of 1942 applies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is to deal with the case of a few former employees of the Dublin United Tramways Company who are now employed by the board. On Committee Stage, Deputy Lemass suggested that consideration might be given to the possibility of applying to these men the provisions of Section 15 of the Superannuation Act, 1942. Briefly, that section applies to persons transferred from an acquired undertaking <Col N="968" /> who had no pension rights on transfer and who had reached an age that the pension they would receive would be insufficient to maintain them.</P>
    <P>In the case of a person who, when he retired, was eligible for a contributory pension under a superannuation scheme of the board, the board may at their discretion grant that person a supplementary pension.  A supplementary pension is generally one-half of whatever pension would be payable under the board's scheme if it was based on the person's service with a former undertaking.  The amendment will enable the board to grant supplementary allowances to these former employees of the Dublin United Tramways Company.  I should say that it will be necessary for the Electricity Supply Board to take account of pensions or gratuities received by former employees of the Dublin United Tramways Company in calculating the supplementary allowance to be granted to such persons in respect of their service with the board.</P>

      <P>In page 9, to delete Section 12, lines 9 to 30.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment, if agreed to, will have the effect of deleting Section 12 from the Bill.  On Committee Stage a number of Deputies questioned the need <Col N="969" /> for the powers contained in the section. I have had the matter further considered in consultation with the Electricity Supply Board and it is felt that the powers may not in fact be required for general development schemes, which the section as it stands held in contemplation.  Consequently, I think there is no need to retain the section in the Bill and, if the Dáil agrees, I propose to delete it.</P>

      <P>In page 9, to delete Section 13, lines 31 to 41.</P>
      <P>Deputies will remember that there was objection on Committee Stage to the granting of powers in respect of urban areas.  Deputy Lemass in particular objected to the extension of these powers in respect of urban areas and I agreed to introduce an amendment on Report.  Since the Committee Stage, I have consulted the Electricity Supply Board.  If the amendment which the Deputy moved were accepted, it would make the position even more difficult.  It is better to delete the section altogether because in some cases the wayleaves concerned are affected both by a rural electrification scheme and by an urban scheme and it would mean probably two notices on a single occupier.  So, the easiest way out of the difficulty is to delete lines 31 to 41.</P>

      <P>Deputy Larkin wants a guarantee.  Does, in fact, the repeal in the third column of the <Col N="970" /> Schedule mean that there is an absolute guarantee of 4 per cent., on the moneys invested, to the trustees? That is the point of difference emphasised throughout the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not actually a guarantee but it meets the point Deputy Larkin&mdash;and, I think, Deputies from all sides of the House&mdash;wanted on the Committee Stage.  Amendment No. 7 does not actually delete it in the section but if the Deputy turns to the Schedule of the Bill on page 10 he will see the answer in the third column. Amendment No. 7 reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 10, to insert in the third column of the Schedule &ldquo;the words &lsquo;or by the board to such trustees&rsquo; in paragraph (c) of sub-section (3) of Section 8;&rdquo; after &ldquo;sub-section (1) of Section 3;&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this amendment, these words in the 1942 Act will be repealed.  The effect of the section is to require the Minister to make regulations setting out the notice which the board shall give to the trustees of its intention to repay moneys held on loan by the board from the trustees.  As the House is aware the board was advised that as long as any statutory provision exists the board would be in a difficulty. Consequently, this amendment amends the difficulty&mdash;although I do not entirely accept the contention of Deputy Larkin that there was any ground for apprehension&mdash;and perhaps the Deputy would be prepared to withdraw his amendment in favour of it.  I think that while there is no definite guarantee in this, it enables the board to make whatever arrangement is necessary with the trustees.  I understand that that meets the trustees' point of view.  The trustees were apprehensive lest any step that might be taken would in any way weaken the solvency of the fund.  As I understand it, the actuarial calculation is based on payment of 4 per cent. While there is no statutory guarantee here, the board, once these words are removed, are apparently prepared to pay 4 per cent.  That will satisfy the actuarial requirements and it will relieve the trustees of any apprehension. Consequently, I do not think <Col N="971" /> there is any need for the amendment in the form in which Deputy Larkin wants it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Cosgrave)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The Trade Union Act of 1941 made it unlawful for any body of persons, with certain specific exceptions, to carry on negotiations for the fixing of wages or other conditions of employment without a negotiation licence issued under the Act.  For the first time, trade unions engaged in such negotiations were required to make and maintain large deposits with the High Court.  This is a condition of the grant of a negotiation licence and <Col N="972" /> the amount of the deposit depends on the numerical strength of the trade union concerned.  The scale of deposits is laid down in the Schedule to the Act.  Where the number of members does not exceed 500 the amount prescribed is £1,000; the appropriate sum for a trade union having 1,000 members is £1,400, and the scale gradually ascends to a maximum of £10,000 for the largest organisations.  It was foreseen in 1941 that, on account of the prevailing abnormal conditions, some of the Irish trade unions would be unable to make the full deposit, specified by the Schedule to the Act, and it was therefore deemed necessary to make provision for a variation of the requirements in favour of such cases. Accordingly, Section 8 of the Act conferred the necessary power to grant temporary relief to trade unions registered in this State where it was established in any particular case that, on account of abnormal conditions referable to the war, undue hardship would ensue if the trade union were compelled to make and keep with the High Court the full deposit.  This relief extended to a maximum of 75 per cent. of the sum mentioned in the Schedule but the power to grant it was exercisable only while the Emergency Powers Act, 1939, was in force.</P>
      <P>Reduction Orders in pursuance of the provisions of this section had been made in several cases.  These Orders however would have expired on the 2nd September, 1947, and the trade unions concerned would then have been required, under the Act of 1941, to raise their deposits to the appropriate sum mentioned in the Schedule.  Moreover, since the repeal of the Emergency Powers Act, any trade union applying for a negotiation licence would have been required to make and maintain the full deposit whatever its circumstances may be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After conversations with the representatives of the trade union organisations it was held that the circumstances which necessitated the relieving provisions in the Act of 1941 had not materially changed, and that the withdrawal of the concession, at that time, would impose hardship and in some cases might have the effect of disqualifying <Col N="973" /> trade unions from holding negotiation licences already granted.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, the Trade Union Act, 1947, was introduced and enacted.  It repealed Section 8 of the Act of 1941, and re-enacted its provisions for a period of 12 months as from 9th July, 1947.</P>
    <P>As the circumstances which necessitated these relieving provisions still existed in 1940, the Trade Union Act, 1948, was enacted in order to continue these reliefs up to 8th July, 1949.  It is now considered desirable to continue to meet the difficulties of the Irish trade unions, of which 24 have received reduction Orders, and I am satisfied that there is a case for the extension of this concession.</P>
    <P>The Bill, accordingly, continues the relieving provisions for a further 12 months, that is, to the 8th July, 1950.</P>
    <P>The question of a further extension after that date will be closely examined in the light of the circumstances and conditions then obtaining.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will recall that this is a matter which was discussed at some length on the Second Stage and there was revealed a difference of opinion on the matter.  It was thought by some Deputies that it was desirable that where a farmer, by the application of lime and phosphate to his soil, could earn for himself an ample profit when the crop fell to be gathered he should get the lime and fertilisers on terms of substantial subsidy although the yield of these fertilisers in the autumn was believed to be not only sufficient to pay for the lime and fertilisers but, in addition, to yield him a substantial profit on the husbandry he used in connection with the land on which the lime and fertilisers had been put.  I made the case that if we once accept that doctrine either the whole policy of the <Col N="976" /> Department of Agriculture is a fraud or we should accept the principle that we ought to pay a man to make a profit.</P>
      <P>The Department of Agriculture is proclaiming the doctrine that if you apply fertilisers and prudent husbandry to your land to-day you will reap in the autumn the cost of the fertilisers and a profit to boot.  That is why farmers are well off.  If that is not true, we ought not to advise farmers to put fertilisers on their land and to work it according to the recognised methods of husbandry, because it would be wrong to exhort a farmer to invest his money and his labour in land and get no reward.  But if that is true, that he can earn a profit for himself over and above his outlay, I cannot see why this House should ask the taxpayer to pay a man to earn a profit for himself.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that the proposal to pay a man to put out fertilisers on his own land is contrary to common-sense, more especially when you recall that he must put out fertilisers on his land every year for ever more.  The farmer who does not put out the appropriate fertiliser, whether in the form of dung or artificial fertiliser, every year for ever more is going to allow his land to deteriorate.  It is because I believe that the farmers of this country are not going to do that that I recommend this whole project to Parliament.  If I believed that the farmers, having had their land rehabilitated for them, were going to devote the rest of their lives to mining out of the improved land all the fertility that is put into it without retrieving anything themselves, this whole project would be a horrible confidence trick on the people. I am sure the farmers whose land is rehabilitated will appropriate a part of their profits every year to put on fertilisers and dung where these are required.  But, if we are to accept Deputy Allen's philosophy they are entitled to say to us: &ldquo;Every year for ever more if my land requires fertilisers, then it is the duty of the State to put them on.&rdquo;  I reject that philosophy completely.  If I believed it were valid, I would refuse to promote this land rehabilitation project at all.</P>

      <P>I do not think the Minister's argument meets&mdash;certainly not completely&mdash;the point raised by Deputy Allen.  During the course of the discussion on the Second Reading emphasis was laid by the Minister on the fact that in borrowing those moneys for the purpose of embarking on a land reclamation scheme such as this we were engaged in an effort to help owners of land to increase the production of that land.  In asking the Minister if under this section we are now discussing he has power to assist a farmer whose land did not require drainage, or most of the work that is contemplated as a result of this measure, Deputy Allen, to my mind, was asking the question that occurs to the minds of many Deputies and many people outside.  The point is that if you are borrowing money as an individual which you will have to pay back, the sensible thing to do with it is to apply it in a way that is likely to give to the community the best results.  If that is not the sensible approach to spending money either by the State or by the individual it is a very peculiar argument indeed.  I agree with the point that is made by Deputy Allen and as I pointed out, I think, in the course of the Second Reading debate, I believe there should not be such rigidity in regard to the manner in which the money is to be spent.</P>

I just wanted to emphasise again that the argument that has been advanced by the Minister to the point raised by the Deputy is not a completely convincing one.  There is no use in attempting to say that it would pay a farmer or might be advantageous to a farmer to buy the manures and lime of his own accord and so on.  After all, on the Minister's own word, these moneys are being borrowed, they will be expended for one purpose and that is to help those who are engaged in agriculture to increase the productivity of the soil.  Naturally, we are entitled to ask whether or not we are likely to get, through the means proposed by the <Col N="978" /> Minister here, the best results or whether we might get better results if, in addition to availing of the means suggested by him, we were to avail of the other means referred to by Deputy Allen.</P>

      <P>Land reclamation includes this activity envisaged by Deputy Allen, I respectfully submit, inasmuch as this project can be carried out in two divisions; where the farmer does the work himself and gets a grant and where a farmer asks the Department to do it under Section 2. It is permissible to examine the full meaning of land reclamation because it applies to that part of the operations to which further reference is not made in this project at all.</P>

      <P>Deputy Allen asked, does this go so far that if the farmer wants no more than an application of suitable fertiliser to his acres, the Minister has, under the definition &ldquo;land reclamation&rdquo;, the power to meet the farmer's wishes within the terms of this project.  My reply is &ldquo;No&rdquo;, and we do not want that power for the reasons I have outlined.  Deputy Smith's supplementary observations evoke this reply.  It appears to be the appropriate relief for a farmer whose land lacks nothing but a fertiliser.  He may require credit.  It may be he is willing and anxious to work his land. His land is very workable but is deficient in fertility and he cannot pay in advance for the fertiliser.  He can make his work remunerative, but if given fertilisers in time to save the crop which he has worked the land would produce.  Out of the proceeds there of he can then afford to pay for the fertilisers and out of the surplus he can effect whatever family savings he had in mind.  But that is outside the purview of this project.  Provision is made by the local authorities for a loan to farmers for seeds and manures.</P>

      <P>I have no reason to believe at all that local authorities' solicitors would refuse a loan for all legitimate requirements of farmers in their district.  Should they fail to meet the local problems, however, the farmer can have recourse to the Agricultural Credit Corporation for a loan.  Nor should we forget that up and down the country there are the manure merchants, the vast majority of whom are very anxious to get the custom of any solvent farmer who wants to buy fertilisers and wishes to wait until the autumn when his crop has come to hand to pay for it.  Observe where we would be going if we accepted Deputy Allen's proposal to make that service a part of this project.  If lime and phosphate were put upon the farmer's land to-day as part of this service, how could we refuse him this day 12 months, how could we refuse him every spring for evermore?  His land is deficient in 1949, may it not be deficient in 1951, 1952, 1953 and 1954?  May his grandson's grandson not be in a position to say, in 2554, that his land is deficient in fertiliser?</P>
      <P>Who will argue that every year, for all those years, the fertilisers necessary for the successful cultivation of that land are to be supplied to the farmer on the basis of a subsidy, in part at least by his neighbours.  Unless the work contemplated is of a non-recurrent character designed to set the farmer, now overtaxed by defects in his holding beyond his capacity to correct, on the way with a holding in good heart and good physical condition, needing nothing but hard work and good husbandry to provide a fair living for the family that lives on it evermore, this project is all nonsense.</P>

      <P>I do not think that any farmer will recoil from the prospect of hard work.  What we are concerned to remedy is the necessity of undertaking a preliminary rehabilitation of his holding quite beyond his capacity, mechanically or financially, to contemplate, but, once that is done, and he is sent on his way without any obligation on him but to work his holding and to exercise good husbandry upon it, to maintain his fences and his drains and all other ancillaries of the holding, I think it would be utterly wrong to admit that, due to his own failure to do what any man should do who owns land, he should be entitled to come to his neighbours again and again and say: &ldquo;though you put my holding in apple-pie order, because I did not want to bother maintaining my drains and because I did not want to keep my fences in repair or purchase fertilisers, I want my neighbours to come and do it for me again.&rdquo;  That cannot be, and if that is the mind of farmers in this country every penny spent under this project is thrown away.  It is because I am convinced that that is not their mind, and that once put on their way they will want help from nobody in running their own holdings, rearing their families and earning their own living, that I recommend this project to the Dáil, and I have not the slightest doubt that I shall be vindicated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The argument that the Minister has used in support of giving help to a farmer to drain his land can be used with equal force in assisting the farmer to fertilise his land where it is in a condition to justify such expenditure. The Minister has stated that it is only in a case where, as a result of the neglect of drainage and where the task before the farmer is impossible, that the State is intervening to help him, and that having done that, the State will expect the farmer to maintain these works.  The same case <Col N="981" /> could be made where a farmer, for one reason or another, finds that his land has been neglected to the point that the amount of money required to fertilise it and give it the necesary dressing of lime would be so great that he could not be expected to undertake the task.  The same argument applies in both cases.  In any event, it is not a question only for the farmers.  We are told that the money required for the implementation of the works contemplated under this measure will be borrowed by the Government on the strength of the community as a whole. Therefore, the community will be responsible for the repayment of these moneys over a period of years.  While it is quite reasonable to think that the Minister and the Government should have regard to the owners whose lands will be directly benefited by the expenditure of this money, they must also have regard to the value that the community will secure from the execution of these works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The submission that we are making is that the community would reap a richer harvest if these moneys were devoted to a wider purpose than the Minister appears to have in mind or than is contemplated in the section. One, of course, could keep on raising fine points on this for a considerable period.  When the Minister makes the case in regard to drainage that the Government and the Department are merely saying to a farmer: &ldquo;We are going to carry out certain works on your land after which you will be responsible for their maintenance,&rdquo; I want to say that the same argument could be applied in the case of a farm that was so deficient in fertilisers that to supply the deficiency would cost the owner more than he could reasonably be expected to undertake.  There the State could say that they would assist him to rehabilitate his land by the application of suitable quantities of fertilisers, but that after that it would expect him to see that the land was kept in good condition.  Our point is that these moneys are being borrowed on the strength of the community.  The community will have to see that they are repaid.  Therefore, the community is interested in seeing that, from the productive point of view, the greatest <Col N="982" /> possible value will be secured as a result of whatever expenditure takes place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The more the Minister tries to explain this the more we are driven to the conclusion that he is an impracticable optimist.  The Minister quite obviously is without the practical knowledge that is necessary to visualise even a few of the problems that will arise under this Bill.  Let me give one case.  Assume that farmer A has 90 acres of land and that five acres need drainage or that the fences need to be levelled.  Let us assume further that the five acres will be drained and manured, and that the other 85 acres will get no service whatever.  Can the Minister visualise a case like that? There may be 85 or 90 acres and, if you do not give service to that land, if you do not rehabilitate it by giving lime or manure, it will not be of much help to the farming community.  You will do probably the poorest five acres, hoping to put the farmer on the high road to prosperity as a result.  I am afraid in these circumstances the Minister is doomed to disappointment.</P>
      <P>There are tens of thousands of acres that do not need drainage or fence levelling, but they do need both lime and manure.  The Minister has power to do that.  We take it that the definitions in Section 1 are, roughly, the definitions that will guide the Department in the other parts of the scheme. You do not need legislation to do the other portion of the scheme&mdash;the law as it stands enables you to do that, just as it enables you to carry out the farm improvements scheme.  I hope the Minister will not close his mind completely in this respect and perhaps he will tell us that he proposes to subsidise the carriage of limestone from the quarries, where it is mined and ground, to the farmer's field or residence.  If the Minister could tell us that, it would be a step in the right direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some portion of this money should be devoted to liming and manuring, leaving drainage or the knocking down of fences aside.  Since this scheme was advertised, Deputies met practical, sensible farmers who have pointed out that unless the Minister sets out to make artificial manures, ground limeson' <Col N="983" /> stone or burnt limestone available at a much cheaper rate, no great improvement will be effected.</P>

Having done that, the scheme is then submitted to the applicant for his approval, or otherwise. The applicant, having vetted the scheme and the estimated cost and being made aware of the charge to which he will have to consent against his holding, notifies the Department that they are to proceed with the execution of the work.  As a result of that authorisation, the Department that they are to proceed with the execution of the work.  As a result of that authorisation, the Department can proceed to carry out the proposed works either through their own organisation or through some outside contracting firm.  I do not know exactly what means may be available in the course of time to the Department for the execution of this work which is entrusted to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Even if there is no delegation of responsibility, and even if the works are carried out solely by an organisation established by the Department, with responsibility to the Department, my argument still holds. When the works are completed by that organisation, they will be vetted by an officer of the Department.  The works will be carried out by an organisation set up by the Department. The works, when completed, will be vetted by an official of the Department.  That official may be the official who was responsible for the preparation of the scheme and the estimate.  He will advise the Minister as to the completion of the scheme and the estimate prepared by him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not say that a State Department would deliberately set itself out to do a faulty job of work.  No one would expect that from a State Department. In the main, that could not happen.  But one can conceive of a case, or even cases, in which faulty <Col N="988" /> work might be done.  The work might not be satisfactorily carried out in the manner originally contemplated by the applicant.  The decision as to whether the work was or was not satisfactorily carried out will rest with an officer of the Department who, if the work was faulty, might perhaps be subject in some way to penalties of one kind or another.  A Department of State would not, of course, be inclined to take the near cuts that an outside contractor might resort to, but I can conceive cases where the work carried out by the Department might not be satisfactorily carried out.  I suggest, therefore, that a month would be given to the applicant during which, if he was dissatisfied with the work, he could appeal to some authority.  I do not suggest that it should be the authority I mention here.  The Minister may prefer to appoint his own authority. This authority should be competent to decide that, if the work is not carried out to the satisfaction of the applicant, he should be relieved of some of the burden that would otherwise be placed upon him.  That is the purpose of this amendment.  It may not be in the most acceptable form at the moment; but I think some such modification is necessary to protect the individual should circumstances such as I have described arise.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Deputy to reflect for a moment upon the situation which his amendment would create?  Would it not be to the advantage then of every beneficiary under this project automatically to go to the District Court?  He could not lose and he might get something.  What fool would pay what he agreed to pay?  He would repair to the District Court and say that he had hoped for great benefit but the benefit had not come up to his expectations, that there was a defect in the work generally which was manifesting itself in an inadequate discharge of water, or the improper replacement of a fence, and that equity could be done by a reasonable rebate. From his point of view, the worst he could argue would be that his liability for the payment of his debt would be postponed one month.  The best that could happen would be that he would <Col N="989" /> be relieved of a part of the whole of what he had undertaken to pay.  It would surely be an improvident farmer who would not take this chance.  If every farmer were to take his chance, the land reclamation project would have very little to do except to conduct law suits.  Remember he has only to make an appeal to have access to the court.  He has to prove nothing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Bill as it stands, if any farmer finds that there have been submitted to him plans with which he has agreed and that the land project authority has failed to carry out these plans, and having so failed, declares the debt to be due and proceeds to charge his land, the farmer rightly retains his full freedom to appeal to the court for an injunction to restrain the Minister for Agriculture or the Land Commission from proceeding to charge his land, on the grounds that the event which would justify the charge being made on the land has not transpired because the agreed programme has not been carried to completion. If the court holds that he can prove that to be the case, the court would forbid the Minister for Agriculture or the Land Commission from charging his land and direct them not to charge the farmer's land unless and until they had carried out the work which they had undertaken to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should be much humiliated if a single farmer on any of the land we handle were constrained to have recourse to such a remedy by our conduct. I would regard it as so grave a reflection upon the Minister responsible for such a situation supervening as to require very serious consideration. <Col N="990" /> Picture what the position is going to be.  I do not think that Deputy Smith is getting a full view of how things work when he imagines that an officer of my Department will agree with the farmer what is requisite to do, that the work will be carried out under that officer's direction and the officer will be the final determining authority as to whether the work was properly done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that it is quite unthinkable that that could happen in any of the proposals we have received and we have already handled a very large number.  The regional officer and the local officer may be involved. Sometimes it might be only the local man but on request the regional officer might attend himself.  I would expect that 97 per cent. of all cases would reach the point of completion and certification without the intervention of anybody more remote than that.  If there was a dispute as to whether the work had been rightly done or not, it would at once become the duty of the provincial officer&mdash;one of the four officers of my Department who are in charge of what roughly corresponds to a province&mdash;to take cognisance of the case at once, to attend on the farm to satisfy himself that whatever was necessary to be done to satisfy the farmer within the limits of reason, would promptly be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If still there remains dissension, it would be his duty to notify the director of projects that here was a case that no three of the men in the field had been able to resolve satisfactorily and that he wanted directions as to what could properly be done to resolve the matter.  It would be only in the event of the director of projects himself authorising a charge to be made, the farmer <i>nolens volens,</i> that the situation could arise in which the farmer would be faced with the prospect of a charge being made on his land for work which he believed had not been done.  If despite the arbitration of the two officers who first did the work and if the provincial officer, who had come upon the scene to see justice done and who knew that his prime duty was not <Col N="991" /> to be a pinch-beck or to be foolishly grudging but to give satisfaction and if the director of projects himself, having reviewed the whole case and having gone down himself&mdash;as he certainly would, apprehending that there must be something in this, if three officers in charge of one case could not satisfy one farmer in a matter of this kind&mdash;only in that event could a situation arise in which it would be conceivable that the farmer would have to invoke the protection of the court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasBrennan" hpid="Mr. T. Brennan Mr. T. Brennan">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly and the courts are there before whom he can haul me, the director of projects or any other officer of my Department or any member of the Government and ask the courts to restrain me or anybody else from charging his land because, he will aver, we have failed to do the things which we were pledged to do in consideration of the right to charge his land.  That issue will be heard by a court of competent jurisdiction and if we fail to satisfy that court that we have not done that which we undertook to do, and done it satisfactorily, the court will forbid us to charge his land with a penny piece or perhaps will tell us that we may charge it with a part but that if we want more, we shall have to go back and re-do the work up to a point which satisfies not only ourselves, but the farmer whose land we want to charge.  Now in that situation the Dáil can be satisfied that while every device is sure to be employed to avoid legal costs or litigation there is always reserved to the right of the smallest farmer in Ireland, in the last analysis if everything else has failed to please him, to go to the court and stand there on a footing of perfect equality.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If we were seeking an injunction I think it would probably have to go to the Circuit Court.  We ought to create a situation in which a farmer would have to think once or twice before instituting proceedings to injunct the Minister from charging his land, because if the Minister allowed <Col N="992" /> a situation to arise in which the courts convicted him of having sought to charge a farmer's land beyond what was due he should go out to Milltown over the week-end and consider whether he was a fit person to be Minister.  It would be a very grave situation.  I suppose it is conceivable that it would happen, but I find it hard to believe because it is a thing that would not happen in a moment because the Minister himself would be fixed with the notice that injunction proceedings were pending against him. He would have to satisfy himself beyond doubt before he joined issue that every conceivable device had been employed to give the individual satisfaction, and he should resist injunction proceedings only on some point of high principle to yield on which would put the whole project in peril.  If everybody has access to the District Court as a result of saying &ldquo;I am not satisfied&rdquo;, it is a queer man who would not take advantage of that. Mind you, with the principle Deputy Smith enunciates I am in entire agreement. While it is good practice to say in all matters in relation to this project that the Minister for Agriculture should be the final authority, the way of saying that must be so framed as to reserve to every individual, however humble, the access to court for an injunction if the Minister acts arbitrarily or improperly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJosephTimoney" hpid="Mr. Timoney Mr. Timoney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timoney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that there is that ample provision in sub-section (4) of Section 2? What the sub-section says is:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The contribution shall become due and payable to the Minister by the occupier for the time being on the date upon which the Minister certifies that the works have been completed.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It does not say that the contribution shall become due on the date the works are completed but the date upon which the Minister certifies that the works have been completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>But in default of payment there then ensues a series of steps, the last sanction available to the Minister being the charging of the debtor's land.  If the Minister wrongly <Col N="993" /> certifies for some peculiar reason I am entirely satisfied that the individual citizen has the right to seek an injunction from the appropriate court to prevent the Minister from proceeding to charge his land and to aver that although the Minister made his certificate the facts manifestly demonstrate that it should not be made on the basis of the statutory procedure designed to impose a charge on the land; he may ask the court to intervene and injunct the Minister from taking the statutory steps to charge the land.</P>
      <P>It is quite true that the relationship of creditor and debtor is created, but it does not give the Minister automatically an overriding statutory power to charge the land and I think the Deputy will agree with me that the court would have the right to forbid him from taking the additional statutory steps to charge the land.  The court could not stop him from creating the situation of creditor and debtor, but to enforce his claim under that situation created by the certificate he would have to go to court and the moment he goes into the court the court is entitled to examine the circumstances under which the claim is being made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timoney</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see the Minister's point, but it seems to me that it would make the position much clearer if there were a further condition and if to the sub-section&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The contribution shall become due and payable to the Minister... on the date upon which the Minister certifies that the works have been completed&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It might provide a very substantial additional safeguard for the citizen but a world of complications for the Minister.  But this I gladly undertake to do because I have the greatest sympathy with the Deputy.  If a single case ever arises on which it appears that this section denies to a citizen, great or small, the freest possible access to the courts where we have failed to satisfy and he seeks the arbitration of the courts to lay a grievance between him and us under examination and resolution, I would be <Col N="994" /> the very first Deputy of this House to come in here with whatever legislation is necessary to open wide the doors of the appropriate court to him.  I present this section and I oppose the Deputy's amendment only on the representation that there is free and ample access to the appropriate court to the humblest citizen to prevent the Minister from improperly charging that which is not due for work which the Minister alleges has been properly done but which the farmer contends has either not been done or has not been satisfactorily done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister should consider this amendment which I suggest.  I admit it may not be everything it should be, but still it has in it something which I think we should strive to insert in this measure.  It is all very well to say, as the Minister has stated, that the humblest citizen will have the right to go to the appropriate court, but we must have regard to the cost that will be entailed for that humble citizen.  We must have regard as well to the extent of the work which may have to be carried out on the land of that humble citizen.  While it may be a very small affair it will be to him an important matter.  I reject entirely the argument advanced by the Minister that applicants under this scheme, which contains the provision enabling them to go to the District Court will rush there merely because they have the right to go.  According to my understanding of it, the exercise of that right will mean that the applicant will have to go there with evidence. They will not only be expected to make a bald statement that the work as executed does not conform with the estimate presented originally, but to go to court armed with evidence of a technical nature.  In arming themselves with such evidence they will have to take the risk of incurring costs and for that reason if for no other they will not be as anxious to avail of the position as the Minister suggests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After all, it is all very fine for the Minister to say: &ldquo;If, on the working of this measure, I find such and such to be the case, I would be the first to come forward and do so and so.&rdquo;  In spite of that gesture, we are here striving <Col N="995" /> to make it so difficult for that humble citizen to whom the Minister referred that he might say, as humble citizens often have to say because of the expense that would be associated with having their rights vindicated: &ldquo;The cost of the work was so-and-so, while the risk I am taking in going into the Circuit Court will mean, maybe, a junior counsel.&rdquo;  He is able to calculate what that is going to cost him.  We are thereby debarring him from a right which he ought to have, seeing that the estimate of the work is carried out by the Minister's agent, seeing that the work is executed by the Minister's own organisation and seeing that the work is certified by the Minister on the recommendation of his own officials.  I say, in those cases, and they will not be numerous, the owner of the land, where dissatisfied, should have the right to go before some simple court, in the full knowledge that he will have to arm himself with evidence that would be concrete and substantial and that, if he took a frivolous case to that lower court, it would cost him a sum of money he could not well afford.  I would appeal to the Minister to reconsider his attitude on this matter between now and the Report Stage. While this amendment of mine may not be everything that I might desire, if we went into it fully, I think some such amendment should be inserted here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I will just mention in the next section the things that will arise under this and that would have reference to Deputy Smith's amendment. For instance, if the farmer asks to have his land charged with an annuity, the Minister automatically, when the work is completed, charges that land.  I take it that he certifies the work is completed and then the charging is automatic. If the farmer elects to pay the Minister and the farmer defaults, it is &ldquo;within three months&rdquo;&mdash; there is three <Col N="996" /> months' delay there.  I suggest that, even in the first instance, there should be a delay before you notify the Land Registry or the Land Commission to charge.  There should be some waiting period, a delay of at least a month. The Minister must keep in mind also that, under this section or the next section, he proposes charging the farmer's land for a period of 60 years. That is a serious consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It all depends on what the farmer wants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>If a farmer wants a charge, the Minister will charge it for 60 years.  The farmer would have a complete job done.  The job should be complete to the farmer's satisfaction before that charge is put on his land. There is a case that could be made for some provision&mdash;I do not care personally whether it is the District Court or not.  It may not be the best possible way.  I suggest that the Minister may set up an arbitration board, a panel of farmers or people competent to judge whether a job was complete on land or not.  That would be the right type of tribunal, a panel of individuals set up by the Minister.  He could send down one or two from the panel to the farm, if the farmer expressed dissatisfaction, and the panel could be the final arbitrator.  That would satisfy me personally.  The less law that will arise under this Bill the better.  While there will be always the common law there for the aggrieved citizen and the Minister cannot prevent him from going to court, it is always very expensive to bring the Minister into court.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;without the farmer's invitation.  The Department's official goes to the land and discusses with the farmer, not what the Department wants to do but what he, the farmer, <Col N="997" /> wants done.  Now, if they cannot agree on a programme of work that will achieve the purpose of rehabilitation, they part, and there are no hard feelings.  The officer of the Department is the servant of the farmer, and is paid by the farmer to come and do that job.  If they cannot agree on what should be done, the officer of the Department takes his leave and there are no hard feelings.</P>

All being agreed between them, the farmer with a map of the work in his hand, asks the officer to do the work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Allen says: &ldquo;Why not have a panel of men?&rdquo; Every officer of the Department of Agriculture is a servant of our people: it is in the service of our people they earn their daily bread. This hierarchy of appeal is available &mdash;the man who did the job; the regional officer of the area, roughly corresponding to a diocese or a county; from that, there is an appeal to a provincial officer, the man in charge of a province; from that there is an appeal to the deputy director, the technical man who is dealing directly with the whole thing; from whom one may go to the director; and from him it would come to me, if I were Minister for Agriculture.  There are six appeals&mdash;five of them from one highly-qualified and experienced man to another, five of them to the political head of the Department.  That is all without a penny expense &mdash; no lawyer, no proceedings, no court.  Could anyone seriously say to me that he apprehends we are putting farmers in jeopardy of hardship, against which statutory provision must be made, if it is present to our minds that when five technical officers and the political head of the Department have all been <Col N="998" /> had recourse to, he then can go to the High Court, if he wants and as the Bill stands at the present time?  Come, now, if we are to be reasonable, I put it to Deputies, and I am proceeding on the assumption&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Deputy has a perfect right to compel me to make it if I want to defend my Bill and no apology is necessary from him for requiring me to do so.  It is my business, but I do suggest that, on reflection, Deputies will see that ample provision is made against the possibility of any individual, however humble and simple, being put down without his rights having been most carefully protected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must keep in mind that Deputies have many years of practical experience of the working of Government Departments. If he does, he will take a different view, as I am sure he did in the past, on many of these matters.  Government Departments always were the same and always will be the same.  We know that almost every officer agrees with the other officer in a Department.  When the views of John Citizen outside do not coincide with the views of the Department of State under any Government, you can take it that if officer No. 1 holds a different view from that held by John Citizen, officer No. 7 will also take that view.  Generally speaking, that has been the experience.  The Minister's officers will estimate that a certain job is going to cost a farmer £100 and that amount will be charged on the farmer's land.</P>

      <P>There are such people&mdash; a good few of them&mdash;in this country.  A certain job is done and he is not satisfied with it.  What redress has he? His lands are about to be charged automatically with an annuity.  The Minister is advised by his officers and he certifies that the job is done.  What redress has that farmer if he is dissatisfied, if he contends that the drainage work carried out by the Minister is flooding another portion of his land or that some damage is being done, that the work is not complete or that it has been done in a slipshod manner?</P>
      <P>We know, too, that officers of Government Departments often find themselves unable to do a certain job within the original estimate.  There is not a Deputy who has not had experience of that.  For instance, officers of the Minister for Lands will find themselves short of funds in reconditioning a holding which they have acquired and which they propose to let out to tenants.  Similarly, officers of the Office of Public Works, in carrying out a drainage scheme which is to be completed within the estimate, find that they cannot do so, and we know the row kicked up by the accounting officer of any Government Department, if their men down the country, their engineers and so on, have to come back to look for more money.</P>
      <P>We know the difficulties these officers have and they will not come back if they can avoid it.  They must complete the job within the estimate, as a general rule, and the Minister must keep that in mind.  All kinds of problems can arise for an officer of his Department doing a job to a certain specification and within a limited sum of money. If the Minister will at least consider it, the matter can end here and now. I am sure that Deputy Smith will be satisfied if the Minister will give a promise that he will further consider the matter to see whether it is necessary to make provision for any kind of tribunal, arbitration or otherwise.</P>

      <P>The Minister has admitted that there is a possibility of an unsatisfactory job being done. Most of the work covered by this scheme is, so to speak, overground, and, if a farmer is a man with any brains, he will be able to see for himself, say, in the case of a new fence being erected or an old fence being demolished, whether the job is being satisfactorily carried out or not; but drainage is an entirely different matter.  I venture to suggest that the <Col N="1001" /> number of farmers who understand how a drain should be laid is very limited. If you want to carry out a satisfactory job, there is a little more to the laying of a drain than merely sinking a trench 18 inches wide to a depth of two feet six inches and putting down drainage pipes or making a french drain covered in with field stones.  I maintain that it would take a highly technical man to ensure that the levels are carried out properly and where there is a break in the levels to ensure that particularly between two salient points the bottom of the drain is properly constructed.  I believe that a lot of drainage that has been carried out on land&mdash;&mdash;</P>

There is the possibility of faulty work being carried out. The Minister will be dealing with thousands of small jobs distributed over the farms of the Twenty-Six Counties and he will be surprised when the work is completed how many unsatisfactory jobs have been carried out because proper regard was not had to the necessity of so constructing the bed of the drain as to prevent silting, etc.  For that reason, and particularly in view of the fact that the Minister admits that there is the possibility of unsatisfactory work being carried out, the Minister should not object to the amendment.  He should accept it in order to ensure that the farmer concerned will be covered in some way and get redress if an unsatisfactory job is carried out.</P>

If I did not believe that that was there, I would accept Deputy <Col N="1002" /> Smith's amendment.  It is because I am convinced that that is in the Bill that I am not accepting the amendment.</P>

      <P>I would direct the Minister's attention to the fact that a Deputy on the Government Benches also expressed doubts as to whether the section, as drafted, did not estop an aggrieved person from going to court and that particular Deputy is a man of legal training.  So the Minister will see the reason as to why <Col N="1003" /> Deputy Smith&mdash;and I agree with Deputy Smith&mdash;put down this amendment. It was to ensure that an aggrieved person who may say: &ldquo;The Minister contracted to do certain work; he did not carry out the work, he is billing me for it,&rdquo; should have the case between himself and the Minister adjudicated upon, that the Minister would not be the judge in his own case.  I suggest to Deputy Smith that he would withdraw this amendment and bring it up on Report Stage and that in the meantime the Minister would go into it.  I would be satisfied if what the Minister has stated is stated by the Attorney-General, for instance, to be the case: that an appeal does lie to the Circuit Court.  No one wants a farmer running into court and dragging the Minister into court every day.  No one wants the expense of that either on the farmer or on the State, but this would work better and everyone would be better satisfied if the farmer had a clearly stated right to appeal to some court.  I would advise the Minister, if he saw his way to do it, not only to have it as some common law right but to put a right into this Bill to do away with Deputy Timoney's doubt as well as Deputy Smith's and mine.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Is the Minister in a position to tell me what will be the maximum amount spent on any acre? The general scheme seems to be £36 with the farmer paying £12 in the case where the farmer calls upon the Minister to do the job.  Is that a maximum?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The general scheme envisages £30 to £36, with the farmer being asked to accept liability for two-fifths of the estimated cost with an overriding maximum of £12 per acre. When the Deputy asks can I forecast a maximum expenditure, I would not like to bind myself in advance.  It really drives one back to the question as to the precise definition of arable or potentially arable land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think a Minister limited by that definition is clearly prohibited from undertaking the removal of the top of a mountain or the conversion of a rocky mountainside into ploughable land.  But one can conceive oneself going on to land, and the removal of one rock in a particular position might bring into very useful user quite a considerable area of land which the presence of that rock seriously interfered with.  Its removal might be very hard to relate to all the acreage which one foresaw would benefit by its removal. Still, I could imagine one feeling justified in proceeding with it, although one was restricted to levying no more than £12&mdash;and two-fifths of the cost of carrying out that work might be much more than £12, but that would be an exceptional case.  The general rule would be that anything that took more than £36 an acre to do <Col N="1005" /> would really be an effort to convert into arable land, land that could not reasonably be called potentially arable.</P>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add at the end the following new sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>()  No occupier other than the registered owner shall be entitled to authorise under this section any increase in the charges on the holding occupied by him.</P>
      <P>An amendment such as this suggested itself to my mind because I had the feeling that none other than the registered owner of land should have the right to impose a charge upon it.  I suppose that idea was largely conveyed to my mind by a practice which I had known to exist, in so far as the Land Commission is concerned, all down the years&mdash;say, in the case of a housing loan.  If the Land Commission in their wisdom in the past saw fit to insist upon this procedure I thought that it would be right and proper that it should also continue in a measure of this kind.  If the owner of a farm were erecting a house and applied to the Land Commission for a loan, the Land Commission would only consider giving that loan to him and allowing it to be consolidated with the original advance on the understanding that he was the registered owner.  If that is the case in regard to such a substantial construction on the holding as a dwellinghouse, how much more so is it the case in regard to the improvement of drains and so forth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the point that if you give that right to other than the registered owner he may not be as careful or as exact in seeing to it that the work carried out will conform, as far as he can see, to the actual specification that was originally provided.  He can say to himself that it is not a satisfactory job but that, after all, that land is not his&mdash;that he has only an interest in it.  He might have an interest in it with five or six other people and, therefore, he would not have the same inducement to watch what was being <Col N="1006" /> done and how it was being done. Therefore, I thought that in this measure we should have a provision to the effect that if land was to be charged with any additional amount of money to be paid over a period of years that charge could be registered only at the request or on instruction of the man who was, in fact, the registered owner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly the same difficulty occurred to my mind.  In fact, it seemed so formidable a problem that I was tempted to drop this whole scheme of permitting these charges to be charged&mdash;for the very reason set out by Deputy Smith.  On reflection, I felt that that degree of conservatism was not essential because, as Deputy Smith probably knows, if you stipulated that no land was to be dealt with except where the occupier was the registered owner or where the registered owner was a living person you would exclude a very large part of the land of this country.  As the Deputy knows, the practice is widespread of leaving the father's or the grandfather's or the great-grandfather's name in the Land Registry and of allowing the old registration to carry on.  If you are dealing with the building of a house on land or of adding any amenity to the land I think the reservation made by Deputy Smith would be coercive&mdash;that you would have to refuse to proceed except at the instance of the legal and beneficial owner of the land.  It seemed clear to me, on reflection, that inasmuch as the work to be done on the land is not within the exclusive discretion of the occupier&mdash;it can only be done consequent upon agreement between the occupier, whoever he may be, and an officer of the Department of Agriculture&mdash;that gives you the assurance that no unnecessary work will be consciously undertaken, no inadequate or useless work will be whimsically done.  I think we are bound to presume that no officer of the Department would consent to a scheme of work being done on the land which he did not believe would benefit the land in proportion to the money laid out for it.  That being so, when we are satisfied that the expenditure is to be on foot of work <Col N="1007" /> which will leave enduring added value to the land itself&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Not more so than a house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>You may want a house or you may not want a house but if you want arable land you must want the land put into the condition which an officer of the Department is prepared to agree to put it&mdash;bearing in mind that he is confined under this project to the purposes set out from (a) &mdash; (h) in the definition section.  He could not consent to a proposal to put in a rose garden; he could not consent to a proposal to lay out a cabbage garden.  He can only consent to a proposal which will make arable land that is not arable or convert potentially arable land into arable land.  Therefore, if it turns out afterwards that the title is defective and that the land clearly belongs to somebody else, that third party has suffered no injury because, though he may get the land with a charge that had not been upon it, he gets in addition to that the benefits of the work done upon it.  When we recall that for every eight shillings charged on the land 20/- worth of work has been put into his land it would be a very queer farmer indeed who would feel that he was unfairly treated because, before that, while his title was in abeyance, somebody put 20/- worth of work into improving his land&mdash; charging only 8/- for every 20/- benefit that was given.  If one were to take a purely legalistic view, I would be constrained to agree with the Deputy but, were that view taken, I do not think I would exaggerate if I said 40 per cent. of the registered land of Ireland would never be touched&mdash;particularly on the small poorer holdings. So long as we are reassured that the ultimate owner is guaranteed against injury by what the putative owner authorises the Land Commission to do, I think we ought to take the view that for the greater good we should suspend the legalistic view and get on with the job of reclaiming the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has conveniently dodged the principle involved <Col N="1008" /> in this amendment.  The principle is either right or it is wrong.  Even if an amendment such as I propose were accepted, the beneficial owner or occupier or the non-registered person could still apply under Part I of the scheme and carry out the work himself, thereby imposing no charge upon the holding.  I contend that Part I of the scheme is available to such a person.  I agree with the Minister that such persons unfortunately would be fairly numerous.  I do not agree that they would represent 40 per cent.  I agree, however, that the number is substantial.</P>
      <P>This is a matter of principle, however. The Minister, in discussing a previous amendment of mine, as against my argument, said: &ldquo;Here you have a case where the owner of the land applies under this Bill when it becomes an Act.  He discusses with an official of my Department the works that are proposed and finally some sort of agreement is reached as between them.  After this has been done, the owner of the land, having had the scheme and the estimate submitted to him, is free to say whether or not he will agree to have this particular work carried out.&rdquo;  That is the case the Minister made for the purpose of inducing the House to reject a previous amendment of mine.  I say now that in taking the course he has so far taken against my amendment he is rejecting that whole line of argument.  What I want to ensure here is that if my brother and myself are the owners of a holding of land, he will not be entitled to register a charge against that holding without my knowledge inasmuch as I am a joint owner with him. If he wants to carry out a scheme of work for the improvement of the land, as suggested by the Minister, he can say that he would prefer to have the work done by the Department's organisation but, as he is not the registered owner, he must provide his own organisation and have the work carried out under Part I of the scheme.  In that way no additional charge is imposed against the holding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister very seriously not to reject this case which I am arguing. Not in all cases, but in most cases, I <Col N="1009" /> would regard the erection of a house as a more substantial contribution than the clearing of a drain.  In addition to that, the Minister has used the argument that, in making the drain, the occupier of the land would be consulted and there would be an obvious benefit. But, in erecting a house, a plan and specification would have to be submitted to the Department of Local Government and approved of by the appointed officer.  The grant would only be paid after inspection by the Department's engineer.  It is only after that the Land Commission would give the advance and the advance would only be given on the understanding that the man who made the application was the registered owner.  They would only agree in these circumstances if the scheme was a scheme under Part I.  If it were a Part II scheme, I would be inclined to take the sort of &ldquo;near cut&rdquo; that the Minister's argument would seem to suggest.</P>
    <P>This is a scheme of two parts.  Part I is the part under which the applicant can carry out the work himself, thereby relieving all concerned of the necessity for a further charge on the holding along the lines I have indicated. So long as Part I is there, I contend there should be a definite provision in this Bill prohibiting anybody from agreeing to the registration of an additional charge against the holding other than the person who is in fact a legal owner in the fullest sense of the term.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>I agree that if they can do the work themselves they can benefit under Part I.  If they cannot, 100,000 holdings will be excluded.  The Deputy envisaged a case where he and his brother were the owners in common of a holding of land.  He says that his brother should not be empowered to charge the land.  Why should he be allowed to charge the land for drainage or work of that kind any more than he would be allowed to charge <Col N="1010" /> the land for the cost of a house?  For the simple reason that land has as its only purpose, if it is arable land, the raising of crops.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not follow that the Deputy's brother and he would have the same view as to the expediency of putting a house on that particular piece of land.  It is quite possible that one brother might think that it would be a good thing to have it as an out-farm and the other that it would be a good thing to have it as a residential farm.  I can see the Deputy's point that there will be a legitimate conflict of interest and that to allow one party to determine would be to injure the other in his legitimate interest in the land.  If two people own arable land in common or jointly, I agree that in legalistic theory the Deputy's case is unanswerable. But, in practice and equity, the principle is to protect the interest of the absent owner from injury by the action of the occupier for the time being.  How is that principle violated by limiting the power of the occupier for the time being into charging the interest of the absent owner with 8/-only on condition that a benefit worth 20/- is indissolubly bound up with the land?  I think the Deputy must agree with me that if our only solicitude in this House in writing the criminal law was to protect citizens of the State from the danger of their neighbours insisting on their taking pound notes for 8/- we need not waste much public time enacting criminal law.  Need we, therefore, forbid the benefits of Part II of the scheme to 100,000 holders lest a few absent owners should find that an occupier had imposed upon them the heavy burden in their absence of accepting 20/- for 8/-?  We must remember the work is not done at the whim of the occupier.  It is undertaken only when the officers of the Department of Agriculture are themselves satisfied that the work envisaged will accrue to the permanent advantage of the land on which it is done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to accept Deputy Smith's amendment <Col N="1011" /> or something like it.  The fact is whether the drainage carried out under this or any other scheme is to be of permanent value depends not only upon its being carried out well but upon the outfall being maintained.  I know land that was drained when I was a boy.  Hundreds of yards of good drains were put in and the land was good and valuable for a long number of years. The outfall within the last 20 or 25 years was neglected and the land went back to the original state in which it was first drained.  There is no objection to that part of this scheme which enables the Minister to give a grant to the occupier to carry out improvements.  The occupier will accept that grant in the hope of some immediate benefit to himself.  If, however, instead of accepting a grant he allows the Minister to carry out the work and accepts a charge upon that land, whether the land will be enabled permanently to pay that will depend on the action of that occupier in keeping the outfalls free.</P>
      <P>I think it would not be advisable to allow an occupier who will not put any of his own effort or money immediately into the improvement of land to mount charges against the land.  If he carried out drainage by way of increasing the charges on the land we can depend upon him less to keep the outfalls in proper shape.  I think the Minister should go back to his original doubts upon this matter.  It is not going to stop 100,000 people or 100,000 holdings from being improved.  The scheme of giving the grant is available to a 100 per cent. of the holdings just as the land improvement scheme was.  I think that Deputy Smith, in fighting for the right not to have permanent charges accepted for a holding except by the registered owner, is very wise.</P>

      <P>I heard this Bill described a few days ago as one of the best Bills that has been introduced in the memory of people living in the country.  I think this is a very vital part of it.  I am quite sure that if this debate was carried on in front of the farmers in a parish it would not take them two minutes to make up their minds to support the Minister's idea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1012" /> The whole principle at the back of the Bill is being lost sight of.  The Bill is called &ldquo;Land Reclamation Bill&rdquo;.  The whole object is to improve the land so that it will produce more crops.  That is an essential thing in the interests of the community as a whole because the land of Ireland was put there to feed the people of Ireland and we have the responsibility to see that it is made as fertile as possible so that it can feed the greatest number of people.  I think that is a principle which should not be lost sight of.  We cannot allow technical points like registered owners and disagreements between brothers to prevent the carrying out of work that ought to be done.</P>
    <P>Ownership of land in this country is not absolute.  The owner and the occupier have a responsibility to the community at large.  The community says in this Bill that through certain machinery, which will be mainly of a co-operative kind between the Minister and farmers, we are going to improve the land so that it will produce more crops and more food.  For that the land will carry for 60 years a small charge.  If we make the land more fertile it is well able to carry that charge no matter who the owner happens to be.  I can see another objection.  This amendment suggested by Deputy Smith envisages only one type of land being dealt with by the Minister and that is registered land.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;No occupier other than the registered owner shall be entitled to authorise under this section any increase in the charges on the holding occupied by him.&rdquo;  There are other types of land to be dealt with under this Bill.  I would suggest that Deputy Smith, having heard the unanswerable argument that has been put forward, should withdraw that amendment. I am quite sure that in the County Cavan that the Deputy represents there are probably thousands and certainly hundreds of farmers or occupiers of land who are not the registered owners within the technical definition of registered owners.  As the Minister has said, the receivable owners may be the fathers or the <Col N="1013" /> grandfathers.  The present occupiers are not necessarily the registered owners.  I am quite sure that if those hundreds of farmers in County Cavan were to be told that, because of this amendment pressed by Deputy Smith and accepted by this House, they were deprived of the benefits under this Bill there would be a considerable amount of trouble.  I suggest, therefore, that, since the Minister, in this Bill, is doing something that is going to improve all the land of the country, the technical objections mentioned by Deputy Smith and Deputy Aiken should not be allowed to prevent the work being done properly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister must see the necessity for giving some safeguard to a reputed owner.  I am sure the Minister and his agents are not going to go in on any holding where there would be an objection.  It would be very unwise to send his machinery in on a holding where objection was raised because this is a voluntary scheme.  The position is that, while the occupier may want a certain job done, the reputed owner may object. The Minister should keep that difficulty in mind.  I agree that in the case of many holdings the actual registered owners may long since have passed to their reward.</P>
      <P>The position of the reputed owner should be considered by the Minister if an objection is lodged.  That brings to mind the necessity that the Minister by publication in local papers or otherwise, should give notice that he proposes doing a job of work on a particular holding.  That danger is there and it needs further consideration. There may be cases where the actual occupier to-day may not be any relation of the owner of a holding at all. Therefore, if the Minister were to consult only the wishes of an occupier he may be doing an injustice because the occupier may be no relation of the actual owner.  There is that possibility. Further consideration should be given to instances of that sort.</P>

      <P>May I beg the House to reflect that all this solicitude is being worked up to provide against the <Col N="1014" /> danger that someone will come home and discover that for every 8/- he is called upon to pay out he is being presented with a £1 note.  Now, I must, and of course I shall, pay respectful attention to any representations made by the Opposition, but here I have had to listen to a debate for half an hour calling for a better and a surer safeguard lest an odd citizen might return and find that a cruel wrong had been inflicted upon him, because under the flagstone of the Dáil, nailed irretrievably to the ground, was a golden sovereign for every 8/- he is asked to disburse over the next 60 years.</P>

      <P>Nobody knows better than the Minister the extent to which he has been talking nonsense in advancing the argument which we have heard from him for the second and the third time.  I want to make this clear. Under this amendment, I will take upon myself the responsibility of all the risks and dangers of going before any body of small or large farmers to justify it.  I am prepared to take the knock if I am unable to justify the principle that underlies it.  It is a strange thing that I and my colleagues should have to fight so strenuously for the acceptance of such a principle against a Minister who has so often, so loudly and so lucidly protested his interest and his desire to protect private ownership and so on. Deputy Cowan's argument was that so long as the purpose the Minister has in mind was to increase the productivity of the land, and to do a whole lot of other useful things, that, so long as the objective from the social point of view was desirable, then the Minister and this House could take unto themselves any powers they liked.  I know, of course, that there are hundreds of holdings of land&mdash;so do other Deputies &mdash;that are not being properly worked to-day.  Is the argument to be advanced that, because that is so, we should have the right to walk in and do what we like to them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with the argument advanced by Deputy Cowan <Col N="1015" /> that if, in any particular case, we can show that the fertility and productivity of the land can be improved, then we are not to have any regard to the finer points which we have heard so much all down the years from the present Minister.  I reject <i>in toto</i> that policy which, not to-day but on a number of occasions, has been advanced in this House by Deputy Cowan.  For example, we all know business people who, perhaps, are not making a success of their business.  They may not be making as great a success of it as other people might if the premises were handed over to them.  Yet, those business people have the right to continue to go on making mistakes against themselves. That right does not apply only to the ownership of land.  There is a recognition of the right of an individual to make mistakes even where his own interests are concerned.  Therefore, the arguments put forward in support of the attitude taken up by the Minister and Deputy Cowan are not acceptable to me.</P>
      <P>The Minister must admit that in a case of this scheme there are two parts. Let us take first the case of the owner and the occupier.  The occupier may be an outsider.  I could be the owner of a farm of land, but some other person might for the moment be in occupation of it.  That occupier might not be any relation of mine.  I think that we should not give to such a person the right to impose, in a long-distance sense, a charge of the kind that is visualised here against that holding. If, however, that occupier sees fit to carry out certain works himself, or through any organisation that he may establish, he has the right under Part I of the scheme to do so. Therefore the number of cases cited by the Minister that could be affected by this amendment could be greatly reduced. The Minister mentioned that it is in the case of the smaller holdings that the work would most likely be carried out by the owner or occupier. Therefore, the fears that he has expressed as to the inability to get work done if this amendment were accepted would not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister cannot have it both <Col N="1016" /> ways; we either accept this principle or we do not.  The principle is a good one.  It has been in operation all down the years.  It must have been introduced as a result of serious consideration and by people who knew it was a wise principle.  We are now departing from it and this argument that you are giving a golden sovereign, placed under the flagstone of the door, for 8/- does not counteract the argument I have advanced here.  I am pleading with the Minister to reconsider this matter and, however much he may stand up to become a little bit frivolous along the lines of Deputy Cowan in this matter, I know that at the back of his mind must lurk a very strong notion that this is a good principle and we would not be doing an injustice to anybody but we would be preserving something of value by inserting this amendment. Anyhow, I have no doubt as to my competence to meet any group of farmers and justify my attitude in urging the acceptance of the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is extraordinary that we have had such a statement from the ex-Minister for Agriculture. We have the very same obstruction to this Bill as we had to the Local Authorities (Works) Bill.  We saw what happened in the case of that Bill.  The obstruction ceased as soon as the verdict came from West Cork, showing that the farmers there were not taking so kindly to the tactics of Fianna Fáil. The obstruction ceased immediately. We observe the same obstructive methods here.  If there was another by-election the obstruction would probably cease and the Bill would be allowed to go through.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand the attitude of Deputy Smith.  He says that we all know perfectly well that there are farmers with land that they do not cultivate properly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>You used words to that effect.  You said there were hundreds of acres that were not properly worked and that it was the right of the farmers to use their land any way they liked, irrespective of the common <Col N="1017" /> good.  For the last five or six years you got up on their backs, as it were, and you said: &ldquo;I will send an inspector here, there and everywhere if you do not work the land.&rdquo;  How does the Deputy reconcile that attitude with the attitude he is now adopting?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Smith takes a strong line on this principle of the farmer's right to do as he pleases with his land.  He has gone so far as to describe my action as blackguardly at the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis&mdash;my action in restoring that right to them after he so successfully took it away.  He nods his head in affirmation.  How he reconciles that attitude with his attitude when he was Minister for Agriculture I really do not know.</P>
      <P>I agree entirely with Deputy Smith about the sacrosanct quality of the true owner of land to determine his disposition, but I am faced with the practical difficulty that 100,000 holdings are rendered inaccessible to the scheme if I honour that principle in the letter.  I appeal to the experience of Deputy Smith when he was Minister. Did he not find that one of the things that completely hamstrung the Agricultural Credit Corporation was the statute under which it operated requiring it to take a mortgage on the borrower's land and that in an amazing number of cases, when it came to prepare the mortgage instrument, it was found that the proprietor had not taken out letters of administration, the land could not be charged with a mortgage effected by him, and that he would not take out administration for the purpose of allowing a mortgage to attach?  Fully 40 per cent. of the failures to provide credit by the Agricultural Credit Corporation arose from the fact that the title to the borrower's land is obscure for the want of successful administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there was any question under this part of the project of charging upon land the full value of the benefit to the farmer, then I would take Deputy Smith's view; but even though in all human probability if the owner were at home he would be prepared to pay over 60 years for the benefit which he was about to enjoy from this day forward, there would be a sufficient remnant of doubt to justify the claim that <Col N="1018" /> it would not be done.  When the proposal is to nail a sovereign to the absent citizen's property in consideration of his property accepting the liability to pay back over 60 years 8/-, I find it hard to believe that Deputy Smith is serious.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with the discussion on the Committee Stage of this Bill on the assumption that however difficult it may be for me to understand the proposals that are made, I am bound to argue them.  Frankly, I find it hard to feel that a rational argument has been made when we are asked to exclude 100,000 holdings from Part II.</P>

      <P>Rather over 100,000.  I am asked to exclude them from Part II of the scheme in order to provide against the possibility, in one, two or a dozen cases, of an absolute owner finding that somebody has charged him with a liablity of 8/- over 60 years in order that they may give him a pound here and now.</P>

      <P>I would like to put a question to Deputy Smith in order to ascertain from him if he means the true owner when he speaks of the &ldquo;registered owner&rdquo;.  If he does not mean that, then the amendment is futile because, as Deputy Captain Cowan pointed out, &ldquo;registered owner&rdquo; has quite a different meaning from that which is commonly attributed to it.  If that amendment were accepted as it stands, therefore, many people would be excluded from the benefits of the scheme because they could not describe themselves as the registered owners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">

    <Speaker pid="JohnJosephTimoney" hpid="Mr. Timoney Mr. Timoney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timoney</NameTxt>
      <P>Even in reference to Part II of the scheme, &ldquo;registered owner&rdquo; has a certain limited meaning and does not include all owners.  The argument can be pushed further than that.  Deputy Smith put a question to <Col N="1019" /> the Minister as to the exact number of people and the Minister mentioned a figure of 100,000.  Deputy Smith pressed for the exact number and the Minister said it was over 100,000.  In more than 50 per cent. of the cases where people are registered as owners they are not the true owners.  As the Deputy knows, most holders of land in the Land Registry are registered subject to equities in order to protect other interests in the land.  There have been several cases where the persons registered as owners were found, on investigation of title, to be entitled to less than half of the ownership.  I have one particular case in mind where, on investigation of title, the court found that the registered owner was entitled to 33-80ths of the full beneficial ownership of the land and that people who did not appear on the folio and whose names were not mentioned anywhere were entitled to 47-80ths.  The fact, therefore, that a man is registered as owner does not mean that he is the true owner and Deputy Smith's object would be defeated by the acceptance of this amendment.</P>

An effort has been made here to contrast my approach to a certain national problem at a particular time with my attitude on this present measure.  I may say that I have no objection at all to entering into an extensive discussion on the entire matter on any occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will admit that at a time when we were faced with a grave national <Col N="1020" /> emergency I was prepared to authorise the officials of my Department to go in upon the land in order to provide food for our people.  The provision of food took precedence over the finer points and over the consideration that we are bound to extend to problems such as this in different times and under different circumstances.  It is one thing to go in upon the land for a year or two and insist upon a farmer doing a certain thing in a time of grave national emergency.  It is another thing to make provision in an Act of Parliament authorising a man who is not the owner of the land to consent to having that land charged, not for one, two or three years, but for a period of 60 or 70 years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the idea behind the amendment I am asking the House to accept.  That principle has been operated by the Land Commission. The procedure is established and that is the procedure I want followed in regard to this matter.  The Minister has said that 100,000 would be affected by this and he admitted that most of these would be the occupiers of small-holdings. Even if that figure is accurate, I contend that the number of those who would proceed under Part I of the scheme would leave a very small balance who might want work undertaken under Part II.  When they would find that, because they were not owners of the land, they would have no right to charge the land they would set about doing the work themselves, if necessary.  In order to preserve the principle to which I have referred one must pay some price.  I say that the price is so small that we must accept this amendment.  I urge the Minister to reconsider the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise one matter on the section.  The section provides for charging land and in so far as it applies to registered land I see no difficulty whatsoever because the charge with regard to registered land would be registered on the folio; I see no difficulty with regard to the other land that is held under temporary agreement with the Land Commission or unregistered land subject to a purchase annuity, but I see a certain difficulty with regard to other land.  I would ask the Minister to look into the point whether land will be charged in favour of the Land Commission or of the Minister or in whose favour the <Col N="1023" /> charge will be registered.  I want to know that.  The next point is that where moneys are advanced, say by the Agricultural Credit Corporation, it is done by means of a charge by which the owner charges his land and a search in the Registry of Deeds where that charge is effected by the owner will discover the fact that the charge has been registered in the Registry of Deeds.</P>
      <P>If this charge is a charge in favour of the Minister or of the Land Commission in the Registry of Deeds and particularly as the work may be done for an owner who is not the real owner, a technical legal difficulty may arise, in a search on the title in the Registry of Deeds.  I would like to ask the Minister to have that matter examined between this and the Report Stage, and it may be that something of a change may be prescribed by which the name of the owner of the land may be registered in the Registry of Deeds so that on a search against that name, all the charges and all the acts done by the particular person will appear clearly. That is something that crops up every day.  There is no difficulty in discovering mortgages or charges because they are effected by the owners and a search of the name of the owner discloses those transactions.  I want to ask the Minister to make sure that whatever machinery is adopted in the Registry of Deeds it will not be simply a charge in favour of the Minister or of the Land Commission because it would be impossible, or very difficult at any rate, to discover against the Minister or the Land Commission in the Registry of Deeds whether particular land that a person was interested in was charged under this Act or not.</P>

      <P>If that conduct were consistent with rational procedure, I do not think the Minister should take up the position <i>vis-á-vis</i> the occupier that he is to command as to how he should get his land rehabilitated.  On the other hand, if the conduct of the occupier was such as to suggest that he was an eccentric person and wanted to get what manifestly should be done in one, two or possibly three stages for a whim done in 50 stages, the Minister would, of course, decline.  The primary consideration, however, in fixing the procedure would be the wishes of a rational owner.  The Minister should have no dealings with an occupier who is manifestly mentally deranged, and I can reassure the Deputy that there is no intention of having discussions or contractual relations with a lunatic <i>in potentia.</i>  If that is not the difficulty the Deputy has in mind, I would not be prepared to say that there would not be three charges in a period of ten years but there will not be a million charges in any calendar year.</P>

      <P>The Minister knows quite well that I was speaking on behalf of the owner more than anything else. I asked the Minister simply had he the power under this section to charge each year for a great number of years and to put extra charges on the land. Is there not a certain danger in that? The Land Commission should be consulted as to whether the land could bear charges and whether the land in the future might be considered by the Land Commission as security for the amount of charges that might be put on it.  There is a danger in the section. <Col N="1025" /> I would suggest to the Minister that within a period of ten or 20 years there should not be more than one charge and that the Land Commission should be consulted&mdash;I raised this matter on the Second Stage&mdash;as to the ability of holdings to carry charges.</P>

      <P>I tried steadfastly to assume that the debate was <i>bona fide.</i> Does the House or you, Sir, feel that the primary purpose of Deputy Allen's query is honestly to elicit information or to create in the minds of people down the country the idea that there is inherent in this scheme a danger that charge upon charge will be piled upon them and that if they once become entangled in the mesh of what appears to be a deserving and commendable scheme to rehabilitate the land, they will, in fact, burden themselves and their children and their children's children down with a succession of charges which will, in fact, enslave them for evermore?  I am going to go on believing that the queries addressed to me by the Opposition are addressed in good faith and I assure Deputy Allen that while the limit of forbearance and patience will be shown by the officers of my Department to meet the convenience of applicants, should we once become satisfied that the occupier is not disposed providently to go about his business, we would resolve to deal with him no further and to treat him as a person not competent prudently to enter into contractual negotiations with us.  Always providing, as Deputy Allen says, that the tenant as occupier is acting with care, albeit he may be a little difficult, we will continue to serve him.  There may be a question about the succession of charges, but whatever charge is left it will always be of this character, that for the enjoyment of a pound's worth <i>in toto</i> as from the day of charge the occupier will pay back no more than 8/- over a period of 60 years.  In those circumstances, I do not think Deputy Allen need worry unduly.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 9:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1026" /> To delete sub-section (2) and substitute:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(2) In any case to which this section applies, the occupier's contribution shall be charged by the Land Commission in the prescribed manner upon every interest (including the fee simple) in the land upon which the works are agreed to be carried out and all land held therewith by the same tenure or under the same tenancy, and such charge shall have effect as on and from the date upon which the Minister certifies that the works have been completed, and shall be discharged by means of an annuity (in this Act referred to as a reclamation annuity) payable on the prescribed gale days and calculated at the rate of 4 per cent. per annum.</P>
    <P>This amendment effects two changes in the existing sub-section.  First, it ensures that every interest, including the fee simple interest, in the lands concerned, will be charged with the annuity.  The object is to provide additional security where land is held under a long lease.  Second, the reference to land held for consolidation with the holding on which the works are being carried out is being deleted, in view of the fact that a parcel of land being held for consolidation may not ultimately be vested in the occupier of the holding.</P>
    <P>Now, precisely the same considerations apply to justify the charging of the fee simple at the instance of the leaseholder, as troubled Deputy Smith when he demurred to the occupier charging land which subsequently transpired to be the property of another.  The justification is on the ground that the benefit bestowed is not capable of being severed from the land and therefore accrues ultimately to the owner whether he may be the owner of the reversion of the lease or the absent and unconscious owner of registered land which for the time being is in the occupation of a person to whom it does not belong.</P>
    <P>The second proviso&mdash;in view of the fact that a parcel of land being held for consolidation may not ultimately be vested in the occupier of the holding&mdash; does need explanation.  It means that where there are two parcels, and in <Col N="1027" /> view of the improvement done on one piece of land, there is a possibility of severance, it is safe and right to charge it, because into whose ever keeping it ultimately comes they will have the benefit.  If there are two parcels which might come ultimately into one beneficial ownership, it would not be right that the one to which no benefit accrued on foot of the charge should be liable for the charge, or that a charge should be borne by the ultimate owner on which the part work was done.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No 10:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (4), lines 32 and 33, to delete &ldquo;as on and from the prescribed date&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;during the prescribed period&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is consequential on a later amendment. An earlier amendment of the definitions section made reference to &ldquo;rules&rdquo; and &ldquo;regulations.&rdquo;  There is a distinction between &ldquo;rules,&rdquo; which are made by the Land Commission, and &ldquo;regulations&rdquo; which are made by the Minister for Finance.  The Land Commission will now prescribe by rules the method or methods of consolidation. Those rules have been made in such a way as to give a farmer the choice between having his reclamation annuity consolidated or having it assimilated. I think the point was mentioned by Deputy Timoney and I ultimately determined that the best way to act was to provide the alternative, at the option of the occupier.  Now, if he does nothing, his annuity will be payable in respect of his drainage over a period of 60 years.  The term of his land annuity will remain unaltered, but he now has the alternative&mdash;if he wants, but he must take the initiative&mdash;of continuing to pay the full amount of his land annuity after the final date and shortening the term proportionately over which his drainage annuity will be payable.  If he is paying £10 and charges his land with £4, and he has only five years' land annuity to run, he charges in 1950 and up to 1955 he will pay £14 a years &mdash; £4 drainage and £10 land.  In 1956 he will pay £4 and so on for 60 years.  That is, if he does <Col N="1028" /> nothing but simply makes a charge. That is the ordinary method.  However, he can now opt, on his initiative and at his discretion, and say that up to 1955 he will pay £14, that is, discharging the £10 annuity and £4 drainage, but in 1956 he will go on paying £14, but now the whole £14 will be credited to the drainage annuity, so that, instead of paying £4 per annum for 55 years, after his land annuity finishes he will pay what he always paid, £14, maybe for 12 years, and get the thing off his back.  The third choice is, if he chooses to adopt neither of those, to ascertain the redemption line of the annuity, put down his cash and wipe out the whole thing.</P>

      <P>Or the other one.  I thought the best thing was so to leave the situation that he could do any one of the three.  It is at his own option. If he does nothing, he pays the land annuity and the drainage annuity for the five years, then the land annuity drops dead and he simply goes on paying the drainage annuity until it is extinguished.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 14:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add to the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(6) Where land is subject to a consolidated annuity or a reclamation annuity the Land Commission shall have for the apportionment of the annuity all the powers which they have under the Land Purchase Acts for the apportionment of any moneys charged on or payable out of land, and they may, if they think fit, discharge any portion or portions of land from any further liability for the annuity or any part thereof or any arrears thereof and thereafter the whole of the annuity shall be exclusively charged on the remainder of such land.</P>
      <P>This amendment is to provide that, where the Land Commission may hereafter consent to the subdivision of a holding, it shall have power to apportion the reclamation annuity, as it has power now to apportion the land annuity, a fraction to each part of the land, in accordance with their determination of its capacity to carry the fraction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJosephTimoney" hpid="Mr. Timoney Mr. Timoney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timoney</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say, in connection with the power of apportionment of the reclamation annuity, if the Land Commission have power to compel the redemption by the owner or proposed purchaser of the apportioned part of the land reclamation annuity? The position at the moment is that, if the owner of a holding subject to a land purchase annuity wants to sell part of it and the part he wants to sell is small, it is usual for the Land Commission, when giving consent to the proposed sale and of course to the subdivision, to apportion the land purchase annuity between the part retained <Col N="1032" /> by the owner and the part sold by him, and, where the part sold is small, it is usual for the Land Commission to impose an obligation to redeem the apportioned part of the annuity on the part sold.  I think the Minister is aware of that.  I should like to know if the Land Commission will have power to insist upon redemption by the purchaser in respect of the small part of a holding subject to a reclamation annuity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Land Commission has at present power, under certain conditions, to stipulate for redemption of the annuity or simply to refuse to allow the subdivision.  They sit tight on that.  Personally, I should like somebody some day to try out in the courts whether the right which the Land Commission claim to determine the right of a tenant purchaser who has discharged his annuity to subdivide his holding is sustainable in law, because the Land Commission does claim the right in certain circumstances, if the purchase-annuity is discharged, to exercise a discretion in regard to subdivision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJosephTimoney" hpid="Mr. Timoney Mr. Timoney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timoney</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that that applies to certain holdings purchased under certain of the Land Purchase Acts, and it was a discovery that astonished me when I first came across it, but I do not think that is quite the point I have been making.  The point I have been making is that if the owner of a holding of, say, 60 acres, subject to a land reclamation annuity of £20, enters into a contract for the sale of ten acres&mdash;we will assume that one-sixth of the reclamation annuity would be apportioned to the ten acres to be sold&mdash;does the Minister contemplate that the Land Commission in that case would ask that the apportioned part of the annuity, one-sixth of the whole annuity, be redeemed by the purchaser of the ten acres?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will recognise that it would not be becoming or appropriate for me to forecast Land Commission procedure in the collection of annuities, because the Land Commission is not within the province of my Department, but I am recommending <Col N="1033" /> quite deliberately to the House that the reclamation annuity shall partake of all the incidence and liabilities of a land purchase annuity, and the detailed effect of that is a matter which I think I may fairly ask Deputies to take up with the Minister for Lands on the broad general question of the administration of land annuities.  I am asking for the general consent of the House to the proposition that we should identify the two as being disposable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment does provide for the apportionment. That is reasonable but the amendment says that after that apportionment the whole of the annuity shall be exclusively charged on the remainder of such lands.  That makes it perfectly clear that there is no apportionment of the reclamation annuity.  It seems to me to be perfectly clear in its intention and I think it covers the point raised by Deputy Timoney.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may explain it, I think the point is this: that there is apparently a practice in the Land Commission, if you have 52 acres of land and you want to sell a tail of one and a quarter acres of land to round off your holding and the subdivision partakes of that kind, it is not infrequent to discharge the one and a quarter acres from any apportionment and leave the whole annuity resting on the balance, which is deemed to be as good a security as the whole parcel was before the subtraction was made.  I think it is to enable them to do the same thing with this kind of annuity.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his lecture, but I must insist on my democratic rights as a member of the Opposition to ask the Minister for information, particularly if I know that the information which he must give will completely disprove his assertion that Deputy Allen was &ldquo;bats&rdquo; when he said the Guarantee Fund was filled principally out of the agricultural <Col N="1036" /> grants in the relief of rates.  That is all.  Deputy Allen asked that question. I did not know he was going to put it.  All I want to say is that I think Deputy Allen was largely correct, that the effective pool out of which the Guarantee Fund was filled in the absence of the collection of the annuities by the Land Commission or, hereafter, if they fail to collect the reclamation annuity, is the agricultural grant in the relief of rates.</P>
      <P>That is the fact and Deputy Allen was right in having a little poke at the Minister that when the 1933 Land Act was going through this House the Minister who was then Deputy Dillon denounced right, left and centre the idea that if the Land Commission did not do the work, the Minister for Finance should get this money from the ratepayers.  I believe that as in the matter of the land annuities the State is giving the farmer a very big present in half the land annuities, the State is entitled to get it back out of the agricultural grant if they fail to collect.  That does not relieve the Land Commission from the responsibility of doing everything in its power to collect in the first instance.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is mistaken in his memory.  Since he desires to recall the history of this matter I will refresh his memory.  My demurring to resort to the rates to replenish this fund arose out of the activities of his disrepuable friends, when they were rambling around this country under the pseudonym of John Brown, robbing their neighbours, and when they sought to consolidate their position for the depredation they were doing on honourable farmers in this country by having recourse to the rates in order doubly to injure them, I stigmatised that conduct as disreputable, disgusting, and thoroughly typical of the rotten Party that was responsible for it.  That is the reason I demurred to replenishing the Guarantee Fund from the rates.</P>

It would be an error on the part of Deputy Aiken or Deputy Allen to imagine that there is any desire on this side of the House to disclaim the demur that was then made or to minimise the emphasis of the language then employed to tell of John Brown, of his rotten thieving cattle activities and of the disgrace and shame that every decent Irishman then felt that an Irish Government could have been guilty of the conduct that was then the responsibility of the collection which the Irish people in a moment of folly had brought down upon themselves.</P>

      <P>The Minister, in his little recitation of past history, was completely wrong.  Instead of trying to stop John Brown from collecting land annuities, the reason he demurred at the land annuities being taken out of the agricultural grant was that he wanted this country still to be tied to John Bull&mdash;to have here an Oath of Allegiance and a Governor-General in the Park.  That was exactly the reason.  The Minister may be a red-roaring two-gun Republican at the present time but that was his attitude then.  That was the reason why he objected to the Guarantee Fund. Now that he is a royal Republican he has no objection to collecting from the farmers, by means of rates, the land reclamation annuity which some occupier may have imposed as a charge on the land without any justification. The Minister said this afternoon that Section 2 of this Bill was going to put on the farmer's door-step a £ for every 8/-.  But some owner, when he wakes <Col N="1038" /> up, may find one of Wood's halfpence &mdash;not a Wood's halfpenny.  That is of some value because of scarcity, but a Dillon halfpenny&mdash;on the door-step because of what was expended on the land.  Seeing that there is only a Dillon halfpenny on the door-step the farmer may very naturally object to paying back that 8/-.  The Land Commission will then have a certain difficulty but the Minister for Agriculture is ensuring that under this particular sub-section eight good shillings will be taken from the ratepayers of the county in order to pay for the Dillon halfpenny.</P>

      <P>There was a Guarantee Fund all the time.  But, apart from that, this is 1949, and I do not see why we should be changing front just for the purpose of having a knock at one another.  I do not know that there is any other machinery readily available to deal with this matter and this particular Guarantee Fund.  As the Minister says, the repayments are so small that the amount involved by defaults will be negligible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1039" /> It is not going to affect these grants or the rates in any substantial way.

It is not likely that the Minister will ever become the chief priest of Tibet but it is within the bounds of possibility that the farmers will have to pay something into the Guarantee Fund.  However, that is neither here nor there.  The Minister, in the wisdom of his judgment, thought well of putting it into the section.  It was in previous Land Acts down through the years&mdash;I think it was in every Land Act&mdash;and farmers and county councils all over the country have always objected right down through the years to it.  They had to pay in the past: we hope they will not have to pay in the future.  However, there is a definite objection by the farmers all over the country and by the ratepayers in general to that principle in any Land Act or other Act of this Oireachtas.  I have objected in that respect in this House before&mdash;even when a Land Bill was introduced by the Party which is now on this side of the House.  I am <Col N="1040" /> objecting to its inclusion in this section again on the present occasion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say a few words on this section generally.  This section definitely links up reclamation annuities with the land annuities.  The question arises as to the position of the annuitant in the case of land being acquired by the Land Commission for the usual statutory purposes.  Will the owner be called upon to redeem this annuity in addition to the ordinary land annuity out of the purchase money provided by the Land Commission?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If the right is in the Land Commission to assert that demand in respect of the land annuity it will similarly be in the Land Commission to assert it in connection with the Reclamation Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will realise that it will very much lower the value of the holding to the owner if, in addition to having to redeem the land purchase annuity out of the purchase price he has also to redeem the reclamation annuity.  He will practically have nothing to get unless the law is changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is on the assumption that all the work done does not make the land worth more money.  It would be a poor thing if we were to embark upon the expenditure of £250,000 sterling on the land of Ireland on the assumption that, after our expenditure, the land would be worth no more than when we put our hand to it.  In microcosm then, a farm in which work has been done must presumbly be worth more to the farmer than if it had not been done, and when the price of resumption or compulsory purchase, or whatever the procedure is described as whereby the Land Commission take back land, is fixed, presumably they will determine the value of the holding by the quality of the land.  If they do so, this must enhance the value of the land.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 16:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add at the end the following new sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>() Before commencing to clear a watercourse under this section the Minister shall give 14 days' notice to the Commissioners of Public Works of his intention to do so and if, before the expiry of the 14 days, the Commissioners notify him that in their opinion the river or stream into which the watercourse drains is not capable of carrying extra water the Minister shall not proceed to clear the watercourse until the Commissioners of Public Works certify that the river has been made capable of carrying the extra water.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister to think over the matter between this and the Report Stage.  On the Local Authorities (Works) Bill we had a number of discussions on this whole matter of drainage, not only from the point of view of the benefits that may accure, but also from the point of view of the damages which might accrue. One of my colleagues quoted a letter which the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance who is in charge of the Board of Works sent to some people down in Sligo stating that the Board of Works could not carry out the drainage scheme proposed because the river basin into which the stream proposed to be drained was to flow was not in a fit condition to take that extra water.  They refused steadfastly <Col N="1042" /> to have anything to do with draining extra water into that river basin until it was repaired.  Drainage has been carried out by the Board of Works over a number of years.  Some of us think that they are very slow and unduly conservative.  One of the reasons, however, for the care with which they prepare drainage schemes is that they made mistakes in the past for which the people as taxpayers and sometimes as landowners and occupiers have had to pay through the nose.  I do not want to worry the House by recounting an experience within my own knowledge where they made an extremely big mistake and caused a lot of damage by an ill-considered drainage scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying that the Board of Works know everything about drainage, but they know that they have made mistakes in the past and at least they will not make similar mistakes again.  I want to ensure that we will not have to educate the Department of Agriculture or the Department of Local Government in the same expensive way.  Having paid through the nose for the education of the Board of Works in the higher principles of hydro-engineering, I prefer that we should not have to go through the same experience with the Department of Agriculture.  It is for that reason that I ask the Minister to accept the proposition that whenever he proposes to drain a watercourse he should give the Board of Works 14 days' notice, within which they must reply to the Minister or otherwise he can go ahead.  Give them 14 days' notice within which they can say to the Minister: &ldquo;We know that river, we know the river basin into which you propose to drain it, and we know that if you put extra water into it you will cause floods&rdquo;.  That will <Col N="1043" /> not hold up anybody.  It will not hold up ordinary land drainage within a farm.  It is only where the Minister proposes to go upon a watercourse serving several farms or many town-lands that he would notify the Board of Works of his intentions.  If they say that that particular river basin, to their knowledge, will not carry the extra water without overflowing its banks, then the Department of Agriculture should listen to them.</P>

      <P>May I interrupt the Deputy to say that I gladly concede that the amendment has been proposed in moderate and reasonable terms.  I would, however, very much prefer not to accept it as a statutory duty, but the Deputy may rest assured that constant consultation will be maintained with the Board of Works to obviate the danger he has in mind.  There is no danger whatever of our proceeding without due consideration of the board's opinion, or proceeding in any way calculated to flood the district or do anything of that kind, but to accept it as a statutory obligation is something I would much prefer not to have to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to withdraw the amendment and put it down again for the Report Stage in order to enable the Minister in the meantime to think over this particular problem.  Perhaps he will see his way to introduce an amendment which will provide against the danger I have spoken about.  Civil servants are admirable people in many ways.  One thing, however, that people who have experience of administration in this or any other country know about civil servants as a type of individual is that each Department tends to run in its own groove and forgets not only other Departments but many other things as well.  The civil servants in the Department of Agriculture are not drainage experts and cannot be expected to be until they either make their own mistakes or learn from somebody else who has made mistakes before.  I want to put upon them the statutory responsibility of communicating with the Office of Public Works in regard to the drainage of a watercourse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1044" /> A watercourse may be anything.  It may be, indeed, a rather small stream. It may be a medium stream with a flow of some tens of thousands of gallons an hour.  It may go up to a very much larger river.  If that water is suddenly released from a number of comparatively small watercourses it may do damage downstream.  I will give one instance.  About two years ago we had the case of Kilkenny City.  Two streets were under about two feet of water for about two days and there was the devil to pay about it.  If a number of watercourses which might take three or four months to seep through into the basin of the Nore, are discharged suddenly from the Nore and reach Kilkenny City within a few days, we might have very much greater floods.  There is no reason why that should happen if this job is approached with reasonable care.  The draining of watercourses into main basins should be preceded by consultation with the Board of Works.  In this particular amendment I do not give the Board of Works the power to delay.  They must reply to the Minister for Agriculture within 14 days and say that it is going to do damage or the Minister can go ahead.  I would be prepared, indeed, to shorten that time to seven days if the Minister thought fit.</P>

      <P>The intention is to subdivide this drainage problem into arterial drainage which is the responsibility of the arterial drainage division of the Board of Works; minor tributary rivers, which for the time being do not constitute part of a catchment area operation that is in the process of completion as we have at the moment in the Brosna catchment area, are all left to the arterial drainage division of the Board of Works.  In places where arterial drainage is not proceeding these tributary rivers would be provided for under the Local Authorities (Works) Bill.  Anything then which does not fall within that category but which is in the nature of a common drain is encompassed by this rehabilitation project.  Now, if Deputies were <Col N="1046" /> to press for a precise definition as to where the responsibility began and where it ended there is no precise definition.</P>

      <P>No.  It is perfectly manifest that unless it was the purpose to keep the three groups substantially in groups we would not have three methods of dealing with them.  However, for the purpose of the arterial drainage scheme that is the desire. Most of us, I think, know the difference between what may be appropriately called a common drain and a minor river.  Most of us know in practice what will happen in certain districts. I cannot define it any more closely.  That is the purpose we have in mind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am deeply interested in this matter on which the Minister has just spoken.  During the Second Reading of the Bill I raised a point that had reference to it.  My own opinion is that there is confusion here as to what a common watercourse means.  I think that that confusion will continue.  The Drainage Act of 1945 established a drainage authority and superimposed on that is a Works Bill which purports to give to local bodies certain powers. Superimposed on that again is the Bill which we are now discussing.  Therefore, if a considerable amount of works are undertaken under this measure we are bound to have quite a lot of confusion and not only confusion but worse than that.</P>
      <P>I do not suppose there is any use in our going into this thing much further, but I should like to be as clear as possible as to what would result from, say, an application made by a member of this House to have certain works carried out on his land which could only be effectively undertaken by having work done on a common watercourse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I make that point the Minister replies: &ldquo;Have you in mind the relief of the periodic flooding of certain lands?&rdquo; I have in mind many cases in which, when this Bill becomes an Act, it will be vital to have work undertaken on what the Minister has described as a common drain or watercourse. <Col N="1047" /> Then the Minister says to me: &ldquo;The clearing of that drain or watercourse is not my responsibility under this Act but the responsibility of the local authority.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What I said was that work on a common drain or watercourse, or work on a minor river such as a tributary of an arterial drainage catchment basin, will be done under the Works Bill unless the arterial drainage division is at work in that catchment area as it is in the Brosna, and that the arterial drainage division of the Board of Works will do the big arterial drainage on the river.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister has grasped what he is attempting to deal with now.  I do not blame him for that.  I met a man recently who was threatened by his neighbour with legal proceedings because of his failure to clean certain rivers which would enable the neighbour to obtain the full advantage of work he had done in draining a watercourse which serves his own land.  The neighbour found that if he were to spend his time, energy and money in doing what it was sought to compel him to do legally, the main artery into which those drains or streams passing through his land emptied was not in a condition to take the water, and that if he carried out the works suggested the water would flow backwards rather than forwards.  I found that the attitude of the Board of Works, in the matter of carrying out drainage in a minor or limited sense, in a drainage district was to hesitate to carry out such works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not remember how many drainage districts were transferred to local bodies for maintenance purposes under the 1945 Act.  The point is that these local bodies are obliged by law to maintain the works in these drainage districts in as good a condition as they were in when handed over to them. Suppose you proceed to carry out certain works under the Works Bill or under this Bill in one of these drainage districts that has been handed over what would be the position of a local authority under the 1945 Act?  As I <Col N="1048" /> have pointed out, there is a legal obligation on the local authority to maintain the works carried out under the different Drainage Acts and that have been handed over to it in as least as good a condition as when they were handed over.  Suppose that, as a result of activities of this Bill or the Works Bill, additional water is released which will cause hardship to the owners of land inside a drainage district, then they can seek the protection of the court so as to ensure that the local bodies will not allow their position to be worsened, although the local bodies themselves will have had no responsibility for the works so carried out.</P>
    <P>I must admit that this is a very involved matter.  It is so involved that I have come to the conclusion, from listening to the discussions on the Works Bill and on this measure, that there is not that clarity and clearness which there should be, I think, on the part of those responsible for advocating or recommending their acceptance to this House.  There is not that understanding that is necessary as to what is going to result.  I suggest very strongly to the Minister that he should get, between now and the Report Stage, a clearer definition of what he has in his mind when he talks about a common watercourse, so that there may be included in this Bill protective provisions to ensure that more harm will not result than good from the execution of the works contemplated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite clear as to the Deputy's point.  Is it that liability may devolve on the local authority for the maintenance of a drainage board area that was transferred to it when the old drainage boards, set up under the 1845 Act, were finally done away with?  Is it that the liability of a local authority may be extended or increased?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We can deal with that trouble by the Deputy's own definition in the 1945 Act.  It should allay any fears that he has.  Under that Act, the statutory obligation on the local authority is to maintain the drainage area in the condition in which they got it.  Now nothing that I do, nothing <Col N="1049" /> that the county engineer does, and nothing that anybody does can add to that statutory duty of maintaining the drainage in the condition in which it was handed over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be that the old drainage board apparatus, in the condition in which the local authority got it, becomes hopelessly inadequate to the new burden thrown upon it.  If that is what is worrying the Deputy I want to tell him that the Works Bill was designed to meet that situation to deal with a minor river which menaces an arterial river.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>All of us in this House must feel conscious of the argumentation that has gone on that you cannot drain the remotest field or bog unless a major arterial operation is carried out on the Shannon right up to its sources.  There are two schools of thought about that.  There is the Board of Works school which says that not a drain must be dug and not a cup of water dislodged in the soil of Ireland until the catchment area in which the soil is situate has been arterially drained.  It is true that some of it will not be drained until 2150. Very well then, reconcile yourselves to sitting in the bog until that day. That is a perfect and legitimate school of thought.  Then there is another school which says that the resources of civilisation are not exhausted.  We just do not believe that our people are to live up to their ankles in bog until 2150 and we are going to Equidate the situation in which they are called upon to do so.  If that gives rise to problems so grave as to disrupt our social life in or about the banks of the arterial river, instead of operating one division of the Board of Works arterial drainage, we will operate two, and, if that is not enough, we will operate ten and, if that is not enough, we will organise 20 and, if necessary, we will get engineers from America for anywhere they are wanted.  The <Col N="1050" /> one thing we will not do is to leave our people sitting in a bog until 2150.</P>
      <P>We are as conscious as conscious can be of the alarms and apprehensions in the Deputy's mind, but our means of dispersing them is to wait until they eventuate.  We doubt if they will, but, if they do, we are committed to mobilise such resources as may be required to carry out the arterial drainage necessary to dispose of the evil that has arisen as a result of delivering the people who live in the upper reaches of the catchment basin from the dismal prospect of having their children, their grandchildren and their great-grand-children living and dying up to their ankles in a bog.  I think that is a modest and a reasonable approach and the excessive concern which seems to have laid hold of the Deputy would make progress in this country quite impossible.</P>

      <P>These are fine, noble words we have listened to, but if a local body charged with the responsibility I have outlined should be taken to court&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It has not any legal responsibility except to keep the drainage in the condition in which it got it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It has the responsibility of leaving the drainage districts in a condition not worse than the condition in which they were handed over.  How then does it come that in the past, after applications were made to the Office of Public Works to have drainage carried out outside these areas, from which the water would flow into these drainage districts, they have, from a legal point of view, seen fit not to undertake such works?  Should a local authority go to court and express those beautiful sentiments that we have heard from the Minister, I am certain that the judge undoubtedly would be very much impressed by them, but he would still see that the local authority were not keeping this particular district in the condition in which it had been handed over to them because additional water had been moved in upon the district, as the former Minister for Finance explained, as a result of works carried out under this Bill and the Works Bill.  Additional <Col N="1051" /> water would be permitted to flow into the district for which the county council is now responsible and therefore the flooding would be worse and the court would hold that the position was worsened and the local body would have to pay compensation.  It would be recurrent and it would not be disposed of as easily as the Minister has explained to us.</P>
      <P>There is not in the Minister's mind, nor is there in the minds of those responsible for the other Bill to which I have referred and which is a counterpart of this, an idea of what could result from the operations visualised. Time will establish the truth of the charge I am making.  I am not making that charge because I am so pessimistic that it is not possible to attack this problem in a vigorous way, nor would I be associated with any attempt to approach it in any other fashion, but I recognise you will not easily deal with problems that have baffled 100 years of effort.</P>

      <P>We were all very interested in the Minister's concern to ensure that everyone living adjacent to a bog or marsh would be relieved before the year 2050.  I am afraid we cannot just accept his assurance that that will be so because some floods are caused by over-hasty drainage, and it is not reassuring to be told that such floods will be immediately relieved by the Department, section by section, under the arterial drainage branch of the Board of Works.  If we were so simple as to believe that, then arterial drainage would have been done many years ago.  We were pressed when we were in office to get rid of surplus water as quickly as possible, and it was not out of cussedness that the Fianna Fáil Government in its 16 years of office, or the Fine Gael Government prior to that in its ten years of office, <Col N="1054" /> did not go ahead with the complete arterial drainage of the country. Certain legal difficulties were cleared up by Deputy Smith when he was in the Board of Works.  He introduced the Arterial Drainage Act of 1945.  One must remember that there are physical and technical difficulties involved. Because we stress that there are difficulties to be overcome and dangers to be avoided the Minister need not jump to the conclusion that we are ultraconservative. Recently, the Minister employed a technician to advise him upon the growing of grass and land rehabilitation.  The first advice that technician gave in relation to land rehabilitation was that in order to drain effectively one must start at the river mouth.  If the Minister starts at the other end he may find after all that the New Zealand technician was right. Lands that are inhabited by wild duck at the present time may be turned into ideal places for snipe.  By turning swamps into marshes he may add a few feet of water in Kilkenny.  It will not be all the right to deal with that problem when it comes up.  That will not do any good to the people in Kilkenny who in the past have been swept out of house and home and had their stock and effects destroyed.  I make one appeal to the Minister to consider, between this and the Report Stage, inserting some clause under which people adversely affected will receive some compensation.</P>

That is important from the point of view I was trying to discuss on a previous section in that there is not in this Bill any right given to anybody to claim compensation from the Minister.  Extensive damage may be done and not one brass farthing can be claimed by the people affected.  If the Minister cannot accept this amendment he might consider it between now and the Report Stage.
