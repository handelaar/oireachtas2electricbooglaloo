      <P>It is understood that each week's questions should be concluded within that Parliamentary week.  Deputies will observe that there are 108 questions.  I would ask their co-operation in refraining from unnecessary supplementaries, so that they may be got through in reasonable time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he is now in a position to indicate when the report of the Commission on Emigration will be made available and if, in view of the increase in the number of unemployed, he will take steps to bring this report before the Dáil without delay.</P>

      <P>I cannot state precisely when the report of the Commission on Emigration and Other Population Problems will be made available, but, as I indicated in a reply which I gave in December last, I am hopeful that the members of the commission will succeed <Col N="152" /> in their aim to complete their inquiry by the summer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Did not the Minister indicate, when establishing the commission, that he hoped they would be able to report within three months? Will he say whether any exceptional causes for delay have arisen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Firstly, I made no such statement as that alleged by the Deputy.  His fount of information on that matter is fantastic.  Secondly, the members of the commission are not paid by the State.  They are not on the pay roll of my Department.  They are eminent and busy citizens, and I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that an approach on this matter has got to be a tactful approach.  I cannot instruct the members to finish by a certain date.  Any attempt by me to do so would have consequences which, I feel sure, ought to be obvious to the Deputy.  I am as anxious as the Deputy to get the report as quickly as I can, and I am sure that the members of the commission, who have many other interests, are anxious to complete this task with the utmost expedition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, a member of the commission does not represent the whole commission.  I have no such information at my disposal.  I am not <Col N="153" /> aware that the commission, either generally or unanimously, expressed any such opinion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise this and the Deputy and his Party might as well have the information &mdash; that the Deputy's Government contemplated doing this thing last year but ran away from setting up the commission when a general election was imminent.  Is that denied?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will state when he expects to issue the White Paper on <Col N="154" /> the proposed comprehensive social security scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Considerable progress has been made in the preparation of a new scheme of social insurance and at present a draft White Paper is being prepared.  When completed, it will be submitted to the Government for authority for its publication.  There will be no unwarrantable delay in the issue of the White Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister in a position to give even an approximate date as to when publication may be expected?  I ask that in view of the fact that a large number of workers and employers who are parties to a superannuation scheme, as well as workers who are due to retire because of reasons of age, are anxiously awaiting the outcome of the White Paper so that they may be in a position to make decisions on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's desire to have the paper made available at the earliest date.  In that respect, we are on common ground.  I have had discussions with the principal officers of my Department on the matter and decisions on vital aspects of the scheme have been taken.  Decisions have yet to be taken on certain information available on other aspects of the White Paper.  When these discussions have been completed the other Departments likely to be concerned in the services provided for in the White Paper must be consulted.  I am not in a position to say how long that consultation will take.  I would hope that it would not take an unduly long period. When these Departments have been consulted, the matter will be submitted to the Government for authority to publish the White Paper.  I can assure the Deputy and the House generally that so far as I am concerned, I am most anxious that the White Paper should be made available for public discussion at the earliest possible date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In this case, did not the Minister give a definite undertaking that the White Paper would be published before Christmas and will he state the reason for the delay?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I prefer, therefore, that all the material should be fully examined so that we can get the best possible scheme of social insurance. In the meantime, the Deputy will not have overlooked the fact that last year we made available £2,500,000 for additional old age, blind and widows' and orphans' pensions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

      <P>I never undertook to produce the paper before Christmas.

      <P>The answers to the Deputy's queries are as follows:&mdash; (i) Two factories have been established in County Galway for the treatment of seaweed, one in Galway City and the other at Kilkerrin, Connemara; (ii) in both factories seaweed is artificially dried and reduced to meal; (iii) no true comparison is possible between the quantities of seaweed used and that formerly exported or used for kelp-making, since neither factory is yet in full-scale production. The value to the gatherers of the seaweed used in these factories will, it is hoped, be at least equal to the value of that formerly exported or used for kelp-making; (iv) the Department organises the collection and delivery of the seaweed required by the factories and arranges for the payment of the gatherers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he is aware that there is considerable anxiety amongst growers of barley in regard to the price of next season's crop and particularly of that portion not grown under contract; and, if so, whether he intends to take any action to allay this anxiety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon) James M. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon)</NameTxt>
      <P>Farmers who grow barley without a contract from the maltster this year will do so in the knowledge that unless <Col N="157" /> some industrial user buys it outside Guinness's contracts, his only certain method of cashing his crop is to feed it to live stock.  It is possible that there will be a substantial demand for malting barley of high quality outside Guinness's contract, but the only safe and certain market is live stock and live-stock products.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that, for the farmer who requires a safe cash crop, his only policy now is to grow more wheat?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It depends entirely on what the Deputy defines as a cash crop. I hope, as I know the Deputy hopes, the farmer will grow the most profitable crop for himself, his family and the nation, and on that basis there is a wide variety to choose from.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if, in view of the urgent need for an immediate expansion in agricultural output, he will take steps to provide cheaper and more extensive credit facilities for farmers desiring (i) to increase the fertility of their land; (ii) to improve farm buildings; (iii) to improve and increase live stock; (iv) to reclaim waste land; and (v) to purchase modern implements and equipment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In previous replies to a number of similar questions put to me by the Deputy, I intimated that substantial credit facilities were already available for the purchase of agricultural implements and live stock and for other agricultural purposes; that grants were available under the farm improvements scheme for the reclamation, drainage and improvement of land, and that, under the farm buildings scheme&mdash;to be put into operation in a few weeks' time&mdash;grants will be made towards the erection, repair and reconstruction of farm out-offices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not convinced that creditworthy farmers are unable to get credit on reasonable terms for productive purposes and if the Deputy will suggest any effective method for determining whether applicants are in fact creditworthy and so circumstanced as to derive benefit from credit applied for, <Col N="158" /> there is no difficulty in furnishing whatever credit may be required and is desirable.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he will state the position which now obtains and that which obtained heretofore in regard to payment for cattle sent from Ireland to the British Ministry of Food which are (1) totally condemned as unfit for food; (2) graded down as a result of damage sustained in transit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to July, 1948, when the present revised arrangements in regard to the taking-over of Irish fat cattle by the British Ministry of Food came into effect, the carcase of an animal forwarded otherwise than &ldquo;at owner's risk&rdquo; by the British port fatstock agent would, if condemned, be paid for at the grade price applicable as if no condemnation had taken place. In the case of cattle slaughtered at a port abattoir, the exporter was liable for any loss arising through down-grading of a carcase as a result of damage in transit.  The Ministry of Food was liable for such loss in the case of animals slaughtered at inland abattoirs, except animals forwarded &ldquo;at owner's risk&rdquo; by the British port fatstock agent.</P>
      <P>Under the present arrangements, the exporter is liable for losses arising from condemnation of a carcase for disease or for any other cause or from down-grading in consequence of damage. Previously, however, the weight of the kidneys was deducted by the Ministry of Food in calculating the price to be paid for the carcase, but the kidneys are now paid for as part of the carcase. The payment obtained for the kidneys offsets the liability falling on exporters under the new arrangement in respect of the condemnation or down-grading of carcases, which in the period 12/7/48 to 31/12/48 amounted to less than .7 of 1 per cent. of the total value of the cattle shipped.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The employees of the Office of Public Works in the Phænix Park and St. Stephen's Green are in a different category as regards determination of wages from the sections of lower paid State employees who received pay increases from 29th May, 1948.  The wages of the former <Col N="166" /> are normally determined after consideration by the Inter-Departmental Wages Advisory Committee and, while in April, 1947, they were given, as an interim arrangement, the increases allowed to civil servants under the 1946 revision of pay, they received a further increase as a result of a recommendation by the Wages Advisory Committee in August, 1947, both increases being antedated to 1st November, 1946.  The employees' case was last reviewed by the committee in October, 1948, and when this third increase in wages was sanctioned there was no good reason for allowing it as from the date on which the general Civil Service classes received their second increase, and it was considered reasonable to make the new increase retrospective to 1st October, 1948.</P>
      <P>I have given further consideration to this matter in the light of representations received from the organisations representing the employees concerned, and I have come to the conclusion that, as there was some delay in submitting the application for increased wages to the Wages Advisory Committee.  I would be justified in making the increase retrospective to 1st August, 1948.  I have given instructions to this effect.</P>

      <P>Thomas Crawley, Ballyfarnon, Boyle, County Roscommon, was refused a pension under the Military Service Pensions Act, 1934, because the referee reported that he is not a person to whom the Act applies.</P>
      <P>Mr. Crawley appealed against the findings of the referee in 1944 and again in 1945, but the evidence submitted by him in support of the appeals was not additional evidence which was not available prior to the making of the referee's report.  The appeals were, accordingly, refused.  The question of amending the Military Service Pensions Acts is at present under consideration and in the event of legislation being enacted to permit of the review of cases such as his, Mr. Crawley will be afforded an opportunity of applying to have his claim reopened.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Mrs. Kate Brady, Wilkinstown, Navan, was in receipt of a dependent's allowance at the annual rate of £13 2s. 6d. in respect of her deceased son, Terence.  Payment of the allowance was terminated with effect from the 7th January, 1949, on the grounds that her yearly means exceed the sum of £40.  As from that date, the old age pension payable to Mrs. Brady was increased from 10/- to 17/6 a week, that is, by £19 11s. 1d. per annum.  This brought her yearly means beyond the sum of £40, and consequently the dependent's allowance formerly payable to her had to be stopped as from that date, in compliance with Section 37 of the Army Pensions Act, 1937.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence whether he is in a position to state when he intends to introduce proposals for legislation dealing with (a) military service (Old I.R.A.) pensions, and (b) extension of the time limit for making application for service medals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Defence whether he is in a position to indicate when he proposes to extend the date of application for I.R.A. service medals so as to enable a number of Old I.R.A. men who are disabled and destitute to qualify for the special allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Chinn Chomhairle, I propose to take questions numbered 47, 48 and 49 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards legislation for military service pensions, this question is under <Col N="184" /> active consideration, but I am not yet in a position to state when legislative proposals dealing with them will be introduced. I hope, however, to have it introduced before the end of the year. As regards applications for pre-Truce service medals, I hope to introduce at an early date legislative proposals for an extension of the time limit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that great hardships exist amongst many Old I.R.A. men because the period has not been extended in order to enable them to obtain the allowance under the 1946 Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there are many grievances affecting Old I.R.A. men who were wrongfully refused pensions under the previous Administration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that last summer he promised to consider this matter when the House went into recess?  Is he going to wait until the House goes into recess this summer before considering it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know exactly the point in the last Deputy's question.  I promised to consider the matter during the recess and I have kept that promise.  With regard to the delay or the hardship arising out of the non-reopening of the date for claims under the medal allowance, I have stated in my answer that I hope at an early date to meet that situation by legislation.  With regard to the other supplementary, I am not, nor is any other Minister, in a position to sit in judgment to say whether any pension was or was not wrongfully refused. The thing is, I am endeavouring to reopen certain cases.</P>

    <P>(f) It is not possible to say with absolute certainty how many will engage in the manufacture of goods not previously made here, but in 26 cases, the products contemplated do not appear to have been manufactured here before.  I do not think it desirable to disclose the particular commodities in advance of the production stage.</P>
    <P>(g) I am not in a position to say in what cases, if any, the promoters propose to form public companies or to make public issues of shares. None of the 14 concerns which are in production are owned by public companies.</P>

      <P>I am aware that in certain instances footwear and drapery goods are sold at prices lower than the stamped maximum retail prices allowable under the Orders controlling these commodities.  The stamped prices are maximum prices and include provision for margins arrived at on an average basis.  It is quite possible, therefore, for certain retailers to sell at prices below those stamped on the articles.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if, in view of the fact that decisions of the Labour Court, recommending retrospective increases in wages, have resulted in considerable loss to the industries concerned, he will, if necessary, introduce proposals for legislation to amend the power of the court so as to ensure that recommendations for increases in future cease to be retrospective.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see any necessity for any amendment of the powers of the court in this matter.  The date from which any change in rates of wages should take effect is a normal element in a trade dispute, whether the dispute comes before the Labour Court or not, and if a dispute is investigated by the court and a claim is made for retrospection the court may make a recommendation on this matter as on other matters in dispute.</P>

      <P>The matter of developing bogs for the mechanised production of turf in the areas mentioned by the Deputy has been fully considered by Bord na Móna. The desirability of providing employment in the locality was borne in mind by the board, but it was decided that any increased production would be quite uneconomic owing to the remoteness of the areas from a potential market of any consequence.</P>
      <P>I am informed that Bord na Móna proposes to operate eight semi-automatic machines on Portmagee and Caher bogs during the 1949 season. The estimated output from these machines would be 7,000 to 8,000 tons, and it is considered that this is the maximum that could be disposed of from this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 61 and 62 together, with your permission, a Chinn Chomhairle. These questions relate to matters which fall entirely to be settled by the board of Irish Shipping, Limited, and normally I would not feel under any obligation to give the information which the Deputy seeks, nor would I ask the board for such information.  Lest there <Col N="191" /> may be misunderstanding, however, I think it desirable to make the following statement:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The arrangements for the maiden voyage of the s.s. &ldquo;Irish Pine&rdquo; to the United States were made by Irish Shipping, Limited.  It was represented to the board by the company's American agents that the maximum possible publicity should be derived from the voyage, and that representatives of the company should travel with the ship in order that they could be present at receptions which were to be given in the United States.  At the request of the board, the chairman and one of the joint managers of the company agreed to make the journey; and, in view of the season of the year at which the maiden voyage was made, the company invited the chairman to be accompanied by his wife and daughter, and the joint manager to be accompanied by his wife.  The party were accompanied by a chaplain so that they should not be deprived of the opportunity of hearing Mass on Christmas Day and on the Sundays and Holydays spent at sea.  I was informed in advance about all these arrangements and they had my complete and unqualified approval.</P>
      <P>As I have indicated, the number of non-paying passengers carried on this maiden voyage was six.  I do not think it necessary, even if it were practicable, to give the figures of cost which have been asked for by the Deputy, nor to give particulars of the freights earned from the cargo carried.</P>
      <P>I may, perhaps, add that the chairman, who, I may mention, receives no fees for his services as a director of the company, wished to pay the standard fares for his wife and daughter, but the board refused to agree to his doing so, as it is the settled policy and practice of the company not to carry fare-paying passengers on maiden voyages of their ships.  The chairman paid out of his own pocket all the expenses of his wife and daughter in the United States.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion, I can say without hesitation that, from my personal observation in the United States, the arrangements <Col N="192" /> made by the board were completely justified by the results and that the favourable publicity secured in America was out of all proportion to the comparatively trifling expenditure involved.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he will state whether the Housing Consultative Council has made any plans for the housing of newly wedded couples; if he is aware that many young married people, because of lack of proper housing accommodation, are forced to live apart, and that the Emergency Housing Association has submitted plans to deal with this matter; whether these plans have been examined; whether he is prepared to give sanction to the adoption of these or similar plans; and finally whether he will declare the shortage of housing accommodation to be a national emergency and recommend to the Government the establishment of a Department to deal solely with this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of specially designed houses for newly-married persons is having the close attention of the Department, in consultation with the housing authorities concerned.  Regulations for the preparation of schemes of special houses <Col N="206" /> or flats have been drafted and circulated to Dublin Corporation and certain other housing authorities for comments and suggestions.  They are also being examined by the Housing Consultative Council.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the effects of acute housing shortage on newly-married couples in common with other sections of the community, and I have asked the housing authorities to consider including suitable houses or flats for newlyweds in their schemes.  No plans to deal with this matter have been submitted by the Emergency Housing Association to the Department, or, I understand, to the Dublin Corporation or the Housing Consultative Council. I shall be pleased to examine any such plans if they are submitted.</P>
      <P>With regard to the last part of the question, I think I can safely say that every public-spirited citizen must be aware of the urgency of the housing problem.  To declare the problem a &ldquo;national emergency&rdquo; would not necessarily heighten the public's sense of the gravity of the issues involved or provide a more effective or expeditious solution of the problem.  I do not propose to recommend to the Government the establishment of a separate Department for housing.</P>

      <P>Dundrum area, including Windy Arbour and Stepaside&mdash;130 dwellings.</P>
      <P>Shankill area&mdash;79 dwellings.</P>
      <P>The needs of the Dundrum area, including Windy Arbour and Stepaside, will be fully met by a scheme of 134 houses, for which the site has been acquired and plans approved.  The development of the site will be commenced in the immediate future.</P>
      <P>The more urgent needs of Shankill are being provided for in a scheme of 26 houses, six of which are being put in hands immediately, together with the site development work required for the remainder.  Further sites are being sought in this area.</P>
      <P>As regards the Stillorgan area, negotiations for the acquisition of the necessary building sites are well advanced.</P>
      <P>The Dublin Housing Consultative Council is keeping the County Dublin housing programme under constant review. I do not propose at present to increase the size of the consultative council.

      <P>I propose, with your permission, to take this question and Question No. 96 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The original Road Fund allocation to the Clare County Council for the current year was £99,302.  The allocation was made in July and from then to last month payments amounting to £57,000 were made.  A further payment of £32,800 will issue this month.  A very large supplementary grant amounting to £122,001 was allocated to the council at the end of October.  Claims on foot of the grant have now been received <Col N="212" /> and are being examined.  As the Road Fund grants are paid by the Department in recoupment of expenditure actually incurred by the local authority, issues from the grants must necessarily lag somewhat behind local disbursements. Payments on foot of the agricultural grant to the Clare County Council have issued punctually in instalments at higher rates than in previous years.  In fact 81.4 per cent. has already been paid this year compared with 69.3 per cent. paid at this time last year.</P>
    <P>The Deputies may be assured that I am very much alive to the importance of accelerating as far as possible the payments of these grants to local authorities and that I shall continue my efforts in this direction.</P>

      <P>In the coming financial year a sum of £1,200,000 will be made available as a free grant to county councils for improvement work on county roads and a free grant of £600,000 for main road improvement. The main road upkeep grant will be 40 per cent. of approved expenditure on &ldquo;ordinary road work&rdquo; on main roads. It will be a condition of the grants that councils provide as much out of rates in 1949/50 for ordinary work on main and county roads as they have provided out of rates for maintenance under these heads this year.</P>

      <P>To remove any possible misconception as to the position in connection with works at the site of the proposed sanatorium at Abbotstown, County Dublin, I should perhaps say that work done on the actual site up to the present was limited to survey.  The original decision as to numbers and types of patients to be accommodated required modification in view of the provision, at an earlier date than would be possible at Abbotstown, of accommodation at St. Mary's Hospital, Phoenix Park, and of the decision to provide separately for children at Ballyowen.  The schedule of accommodation for Abbotstown has now been finally determined and the lay-out of the site is under active consideration. When the lay-out has been determined in the near future, the planning of the site works, including roads, water supply and drainage, can commence and it is hoped that these works will be under construction by the autumn.</P>

Consequently, it was decided to proceed with a number of interim measures and to turn the whole forces of my Department on to the provision of these very necessary beds by other means than the regional sanatorium which had been neglected for three years.

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that this Bill be now read a Second Time.  I would like to take the minds of Deputies back to the position here last November when I brought forward a Bill to give the rural community the same facilities as are enjoyed by the people in the cities with regard to the opening of licensed premises on Sundays.  The Dáil, in its wisdom or lunacy, turned down that measure.</P>
      <P>The Constitution of this State guarantees equal rights for all citizens.  I endeavoured to get equal rights for the rural community by affording them the same facilities as are being afforded the people in the cities.  That was beaten in this House by 106 votes to 23.  The reasons given were undoubtedly honest and were largely influenced by the pressure and propaganda that were brought to bear on Deputies by temperance associations and others in this country.  At that time I guaranteed that I would bring in a measure to remove this blot under our Constitution and to secure equal rights for all our citizens, if not by giving facilities to those who had not got them, then at least by withdrawing the facilities from those who had them.</P>
      <P>I was tempted to bring in this Bill by the letters I have received from temperance associations referring to the horrible temptation facing a country boy going along the road on a Sunday and walking past a public-house which would have its doors open &mdash;the temptation there would be to him to go in.  I have got a large number of letters&mdash;about 168 altogether&mdash; and I will give the House one just as an instance.  I give it because it bears on this Bill.  It states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The detrimental effect which the existing facilities for the consumption <Col N="227" /> of intoxicating liquor are having on the people of Dublin City and Cork City is very plainly evident, particularly at week-ends, and the council consider that to extend these facilities throughout the entire country could only result in the widespread loosening of the moral fibre of the population, with consequent unhappy results involving violation of the laws of Church and State.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was from one of the temperance associations.  I got others on the same lines.</P>
    <P>When the 1942 Intoxicating Liquor Act was introduced here the then Minister for Justice told us of various abuses that were at that time going on here, particularly around the City of Dublin.  He said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I know that from the time I went to the Department of Justice complaints have been made by the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána of the growing public scandal created by abuses in connection with the <i>bona fide</i> traffic.  The Guards complained that they were not able to prove that the people who had been causing these abuses were not entitled to be on licensed premises drinking during hours when they would not be entitled to get drink in licensed premises in their own areas.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was borne out by Deputy Dr. O'Higgins who said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is within the knowledge of every one of us that there are houses &mdash;not many, but certain houses within a rifle shot of the City of Dublin &mdash;which have abused the licences they hold.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Those abuses are not ended and they were not ended by the Intoxicating Liquor Act of 1942.  As a matter of fact, they have spread and the condition of affairs that prevailed then has been enlarged by the change in the transport system since.  For instance, the Minister said here:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As the words <i>bona fide</i> connote, the exemption was meant to provide purely and simply for genuine travellers and not for people who could get on a bicycle and ride out into an area where, by doing so, they could get drink.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="228" /> They are not riding on bicycles now&mdash; those days are gone.  They are going out in motor cars and, if I am to believe what I hear, no man's life is safe on any Dublin road on a Sunday night with these fellows coming back from the public-houses.  A lot of them have other attractions, with their arms around their necks in the cars and not having sufficient control of the wheel, being in a more or less drunken condition.</P>
    <P>That is the present condition of affairs, if I am to believe the 168 people who wrote to me about this terrible vice, as they put it, and the danger that would come on the rural community if for the unfortunate rural labourer the pubs were open for a couple of hours on Sunday.  As regards the unfortunate countryman who would pass the public-house going to Mass and going home again, if there is to be a grave temptation for him in having public-houses open two, or two and a half miles away from him on a Sunday, what is the temptation to the unfortunate city man who comes out of his house on Sunday and, walking along a street, finds 15 or 30 pubs with their doors open?  I hold that if 106 Deputies consider that there is a danger and that it is wrong to open public-houses on Sunday for the rural population, then that 106 should be swelled to practically all the Deputies in the House so as to put an end to an awful temptation that is at least 50 times greater in the city than in the country.</P>
    <P>The ex-Minister for Justice, when he was introducing this Bill in 1942, said that he was abolishing all the abuses.  But did he?  At that time I gave here an account of the condition of affairs as I knew them in Cork City and, judging by what I have heard, the condition of affairs in the City of Dublin is ten times worse than it is in Cork.  People in the City of Dublin and the other cities have no work to do on Sunday.  They walk out of their homes at 1 o'clock and stay in the local public-house from 1 o'clock until 3 o'clock.  At 3 o'clock they can adjourn to the &ldquo;Independent Club,&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Grocer's Club&rdquo; or, as it is known in Cork, the &ldquo;Tubs of Blood&rdquo;.  They can drink in these places from 3 o'clock <Col N="229" /> until 5 o'clock.  A benevolent Government then opens again the local public-houses from 5 o'clock until 7 o'clock. At 7 o'clock they can go back again to the &ldquo;Grocer's Club&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Independent Club&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Tubs of Blood&rdquo; and drink away in these places from that time onwards.  That is the law.  The people acting in that fashion are within the law.  That is the condition of affairs as it prevails at the moment.  I would not consider that position so bad because these people do not at any rate do much harm out in the country.  But I can see no equity in the position where gentlemen with motor cars can load up those cars with other gentlemen and ladies on Sunday and start out from the city at 1 o'clock for the rural districts where they can get all the drink they require or can consume while, at the same time, the ordinary local inhabitant in the rural district is prevented by the laws of this State from having so much as one drink.  Those people in their motor cars can go out at 1 o'clock and continue to drink in the rural public-houses from then until 8 o'clock without let or hindrance.  God help the unfortunate labourer who is travelling along the country road when these people are coming home.</P>
    <P>That is the position under the law for certain favoured individuals.  I was induced to bring in this Bill because of the support I got from Deputies Fitzpatrick, Corish and Larkin on the 17th November, 1948.  At column 75 of Volume 113, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government, Deputy Corish, said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have a certain sympathy with Deputy Corry, but I am totally opposed to the Bill.  If Deputy Corry had set out, in the first instance, to tell us that the only thing that prompted him to introduce the Bill was his disgust with the facilities which the drinking public in Dublin, Cork and Waterford have, he would have got much more support.  I am in agreement with him that there should not be these drinking facilities for the people in these three cities.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish saw the evil in the existing situation.  Being a member of the Government he could not, apparently, <Col N="230" /> put down a Bill.  I came to his help. I am prepared to give him all the assistance in my power by putting down this Bill and putting it through this House.  He can have the easier job of walking around the Lobby unless he wishes to say a few words in favour of it now.</P>
    <P>Again, at column 77 of the debate on the 17th November, 1948&mdash;you all remember it, it is only a few short months ago&mdash;Deputy Corish said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Deputy Corry has possibly done the House and the country a great service by focussing attention on the fact that there is a terrific abuse.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>At column 78, Deputy Larkin made the following statement:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am opposed to this Bill and will support a Bill to stop the opening of public-houses on Sundays in the large cities.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I hope that Deputy Larkin will remember those words this evening.  At column 79 he further stated:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If Deputy Corry wants to come in to-morrow with a Bill to control what he thinks is an abuse in favour of this in the city I am quite prepared to take that stand, as I take it to-night.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I shall now deal with Deputy Fitzpatrick. At column 93 he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If Deputy Corry, as he threatened, brings in a more drastic Bill that public-houses should be closed altogether on Sunday and if nobody seconds him... if I am in the House I will second it and support it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am gathering in the clans now.  I am not going to confine this matter to those Deputies who actually spoke here against the giving of these facilities to the rural community.  If any Deputy in this House thinks that it would be wrong for him to vote against giving these facilities to the rural community, then he is bound to vote in equity in favour of taking away these facilities from the people in the urban areas.</P>
    <P>Let there be one law for all.  What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.  That is the basis on which I am bringing in this Bill.  As I have pointed out, there are ten times as many temptations in the way of the <Col N="231" /> city man with nothing to do on Sunday. If he goes out for a walk on Sunday, he has to pass ten or 15 public-houses in every street with the doors wide open and a &ldquo;come-hither&rdquo; smile on the face of every doorman.  That is why in this Bill I have set out:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Notwithstanding anything contained in the Licensing Acts, 1833 to 1943, or the Registration of Clubs Acts, 1904 to 1927, or any other enactment, it shall not be lawful at any time on any Sunday after the 1st day of January, 1949, for any person to sell or expose for sale any intoxicating liquor or to open or keep open any premises for the sale of intoxicating liquor or to permit any intoxicating liquor to be consumed on licensed premises.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do that to embrace the scandal of the clubs and the so-called hotels.  I put these things in in order to make every man equal, and in order that there will not be any special facilities available for the gentleman who has a motor car, who is swanky looking enough to go into a hotel or who, because he pays a &ldquo;bob&rdquo; registration fee, can become a member of the Independent Club, the Grocers' Club or &ldquo;The Tubs of Blood.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want to end all that.  If this Dáil three months ago, in its wisdom, decided that the decent countryman, who has to go out on Sunday morning and milk and feed cattle in order to provide the city drones with supplies of food, is not entitled to have a drink in his own parish on Sunday, I am entitled to ask the Dáil to decide that these drones will not have the facilities which are refused to that worker.  Fair play is fine play and that is the basis on which I bring in this Bill.  I have no intention of delaying the House in the matter.  I think the House is already converted and I doubt if there is any Deputy who is prepared to make the enormous somersault, as between November and February, which would be necessary for him to make, if he were to vote against this Bill.</P>

      <P>As I said on the previous Bill introduced by Deputy <Col N="232" /> Corry, I am a great believer in the principle of one law for all.  I do not think this Bill has any real merit, other than the merit that it is going to bring the city man in line with the countryman. I feel that it would have been better for us all if Deputy Corry's first Bill had been passed, but I say that, in contrast with the myriad, the innumerable, letters which poured into my office before Deputy Corry's first Bill was discussed, the Pioneer Association were extraordinarily silent on this Bill, as indeed were my friends, the licensed vintners.</P>
      <P>My attitude to this Bill is quite simple and I stated it during the discussion on the first Bill.  So far as I am concerned, if the man in the city can get a drink on Sunday, the countryman should get it, and, if the position is reversed, I do not see any reason under the sun why the fellow living in the town should be enabled to walk into a selection of lounge bars, as Deputy Corry has said, lounge bars of all shapes and sizes, within a stone's throw of each other.  Deputies are now getting an opportunity to be either the hypocrites which I think some of them might be or to be honest on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard pratings here about moral considerations on the occasion of the first Bill.  I hope that those who were so&mdash;shall I say&mdash;virtuous and indeed so sanctimonious in their wonderful approach to the moral aspect, to the moral degradation that might flow from the first proposal made by Deputy Corry, will now salve their consciences by seeing to it that all these moral ailments and defects and all this moral degradation will be taken away by this House, as well as the easy facilities which give rise to them, by giving the city boys no drink on Sunday either.  I am not at all sure that it is not going to involve an immense amount of extra work for the Minister and the various officers of the Garda Síochána in trying to enforce this measure.  I have a horrible feeling that the Irishman who wants a drink, no matter at what time or on what day, usually has some way of getting it, but I say that there is something which, to my mind, is sinister, is rather unworthy of the general Irish outlook, in having a <Col N="233" /> differentiation between city and rural areas, particularly at a time when we are purporting to try to make life in the rural areas more attractive and interesting. We are endeavouring to keep people in the rural areas and the way to do that is scarcely by offering a type of counter-attraction in the city which the man in the rural area cannot enjoy.</P>
    <P>I have no particularly strong views on the issue, other than the principle that it will be one for all and all for one.  When I meet any of my friends, if the occasion calls for it, I like to have a bottle of stout or a &ldquo;half-one&rdquo; or two.  I think that drinking, kept within the bounds of common sense and moderation, is not the evil that some of the people in this House in November last seemed to indicate it was, but there is something iniquitous, something pernicious, something which is fundamentally and diametrically opposed to real Irish philosophy in giving to one portion of the country something which we are not prepared to give to the other.  The sale of drink is a privilege afforded to certain types of traders in this country.  These traders pay licence duties because they carry on that trade.  The small publican in the country is often to my knowledge and experience a far better person in many ways than some of his alleged bigger brethren in any city area.  I see no reason why, because of the populous centre where his bigger brethren can grow fatter and richer, they should be given an extra day in every week to get fatter and richer. I am saying quite simply and honestly with regard to this Bill that I hope to find myself again in the same Lobby as Deputy Corry and other Cork Deputies because if we cannot have it for ourselves&mdash;maybe we are dogs in the manger&mdash;we are not going to give it to Dublin and the others.</P>

      <P>When Deputy Corry's previous Bill came up I voted against it.  I wish now to say that it is going to give me great pleasure to support this Bill.  I, like a number of other Deputies, was drowned by resolutions from various Pioneer Total Abstinence Societies who appealed to me to vote against the former Bill and I weakly <Col N="234" /> agreed to the demand.  Since this present Bill was mooted, I have been awaiting letters from the same societies appealing to me to vote in favour of this Bill.  So far I have not received one.  I have also noticed that there has been no &ldquo;pow-wow&rdquo; on this occasion between the P.T.A. and the licensed vintners.  Although I did vote against Deputy Corry's former Bill, I maintain that if there are going to be restrictions on the sale of intoxicating drink on Sunday in this country they must be universal.  If there is going to be opening on Sunday it must be universal.  I see absolutely no reason whatever why it should not be equal rights for everybody.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself in a different boat from the other speakers. As one who supported Deputy Corry's original Bill I find that I desire to be consistent.  I voted because I desired to further facilities for drinkers and I was not apologising for that either. I am not apologising now because if the <i>bona fide</i> traders are closed we are going to have a much worse state of affairs in this country.  We are going to turn all the country public-houses and the city public-houses into sheebeens. It is quite on the cards that the Minister or some future Minister must drastically overhaul the licensing laws of this country.  I stand for every word Deputy Corry said with regard to the last Bill.  It is most unfair to make fish of one and fowl of the other.  I know that people in the country are demanding in many cases that some overhaul of the city licensing trade should take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not true that we, in the country, are unable to conduct ourselves properly on a Sunday if we take a drink.  I am not trying to inflict that stigma on the city people either.  We hear too much talk about the facilities that are given for drinking in this country.  It is grossly exaggerated.  If people have died from drinking in this country there are many thousands who have died for the want of it, too.  The Pioneer organisations have not come out this time as they did on the last occasion.  Why?  I do not know what fate the Licensed Traders' Organisation are planning for the Deputies of <Col N="235" /> Dáil Eireann but certainly they have not opposed this measure.  Perhaps the Dublin publicans are now satisfied that they have a lot of money accumulated and that it is time now for them to close up completely on a Sunday.  If that is true, as I have been given to understand, and if the workers of Dublin have drunk enough in the past, then perhaps there would be a good deal to be said for Deputy Corry's Bill No. 2.</P>
    <P>All this grossly exaggerated talk about drinking is mostly nonsense.  The statistics available to the Minister, and to any Deputy here who desires to see them, as to the amount of drunkenness on Sunday in the country show that it is negligible.  That, I think, is a clear indication that all we hear about drinking on Sunday is unquestionably exaggerated.  I would appeal to the Minister to have a drastic overhaul and to change his mind now and take the country people out of that category that alien laws put us into&mdash; a category that we were the wild Irish and that we were not able to behave ourselves on a Sunday.  If we are able to behave ourselves in the country for six days we are unquestionably able to do it on the seventh.  We have as great a respect&mdash;either publicans or drinkers &mdash;for the Sabbath day as those who have been branding us as people who are drunkards, people who are trying to get more facilities for drunkenness. I am going to oppose the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (General MacEoin)</NameTxt>
      <P>We all know that Deputy Corry is in favour of Sunday opening for the rural areas and that his only reason for introducing this Bill is that his Bill in November for Sunday opening was defeated.  He moves it because the Dáil had not seen fit to take his view of his Bill at that time.  That was a Bill that was to allow Sunday opening.  He knew perfectly well that the Department of Justice were examining and are examining the whole licensing code.  He was told that then, but Deputy Corry saw fit to introduce that Bill and he sees fit for some reason to introduce this one now. Because the Dáil did not approve of his Bill for Sunday opening all over <Col N="236" /> the country, he now moves this one. That may be a natural reaction on his part, but I do not think it is a sound principle of legislation.  He has made no case for the Bill.  Sunday opening in the cities has always been permitted and I have no evidence whatever that there are any abuses arising out of that opening.  In the absence of that evidence, I do not advise the Dáil to accept the Bill and I cannot accept it myself.</P>
      <P>The enforcement of the law, if we pass this Bill into effect, would be a most extremely difficult matter and would lead to far greater abuses than could possibly arise by the present day opening.  It is not for me to judge the reasons why organisations, either Pioneers, temperance organisations or the licensed vintners, have remained silent on this Bill.  I can only suggest that they depend upon the common sense and the wisdom of this House and that they know we will not do anything that is unreasonable or take any line that would be to the detriment of the people.  I am not going to follow the arguments that have been made so far, nor do I intend to intervene at any further stage of the debate; but I ask the House to reject the Bill and to reject it in a very positive way, just as positively as they rejected the Bill that he introduced some time ago.  He would like to pillory every one of us, whether Opposition or Government supporters, into taking a certain line. I am not going to allow Deputy Corry to push me into that position.  Therefore I am leaving it to a free vote of the House.  I think it is a matter that must be decided by the Deputies of this House and I ask them to take my view on the matter, that this is a badtempered, ill-considered proposal by Deputy Corry just to annoy certain people in his own Party and in the Parties supporting the Government.</P>

      <P>I, like other Deputies, had quite a number of letters from temperance organisations protesting against an extension of the licensing laws on Sundays to the rural areas. Possibly they did influence me and I voted against the first measure introduced by Deputy Corry here.  Because of the convincing way those letters <Col N="237" /> were written, I have now come to the conclusion that it would be a calamity on the people of Dublin if the public-houses were not closed in Dublin on Sunday, because it was shown to me quite clearly by those temperance organisations that if they were open in the country it would bring misfortune to the people of the country.  I must naturally conclude that we here are great benefactors and that we are going to remove a big evil on the people of Dublin if we pass this measure.  Consequently, I am in favour of it.</P>
      <P>I think it is most un-Irish that we should approach this question of intoxicating liquor in this way.  By this time, we should have some sort of new approach to all these ancient laws. They were originally passed by the British Government for the purpose of getting revenue and they are still being passed for that purpose.  I hope the Minister for Finance did not prompt the Minister for Justice in order to continue that rotten system.  Every one of us knows that the licensing laws were purely and simply to get money. There were hundreds of public-houses all over the country with all sorts of supervision; in other words, inducements to people to drink more.  The contention was clear&mdash;that otherwise this country would go mad with drink.  That was not the case.  There were very few people who could afford a lot of money for drink.</P>
      <P>We have had control of the licensing laws for a long time and public-houses are doing a fairly weak trade, as the money is short and there is a great deal of unemployment.  Therefore, the revenue is going to suffer anyway.  I agree with Deputy Corry and I think it is only right that we should open all of them if we open some of them.  I did not vote to open them all, due to the fact that these letters really convinced me that we should not do so. Consequently, the letters have convinced me that the public-houses in Dublin should be closed on Sunday and that is the reason I am voting for Deputy Corry's measure.</P>

      <P>There were very few Deputies who were as disappointed as I was when Deputy Corry produced his <Col N="238" /> Bill last November.  Personally, I am of the opinion that there should be no differentiation between the rural and the urban areas.  For once in my life, I felt somewhat proud to find myself on the same side of the House with Deputy Corry.  We do not agree at all times, but we are very good friends.  I admired the 23 who supported his original Bill.  There is no use now in going back over what has happened, but I was glad to hear the Minister state a few moments ago that the whole licensing question is under consideration by him and I hope he will report to the Government in due course.</P>
      <P>It was with a great pang of regret that I found, when the original Bill was introduced by Deputy Corry, that there were only 23 members in favour to 108 against.  At the same time, I will not find myself in the same lobby with him this time.  There is a lot to be said for the Bill.  In some respects, I agree with what Deputy Corry has said, but my statement in this will be the statement of a very famous Irish gentleman in days gone by&mdash;&ldquo;What I have I hold, and not an inch.&rdquo;  That is my view on this liquor question.  If Deputy Corry gets his way in the division which will subsequently take place, it is his intention to close every licensed premises in Ireland from 10 o'clock on Saturday night to 10 o'clock on Monday morning.  I wonder if he realises the seriousness of that and the very grave situation which would ensue, particularly where seaside towns are concerned. Deputy Corry, like myself, represents Cork East, where there are many seaside towns.  In my own town, Youghal, which is one of the largest towns and the biggest seaside resort in the constituency, the trade that comes in there on Sunday, by people from Cork and the various places down the line, leaves a lot of money there.</P>

      <P>And in other places as well.  It would appear that there is an idea prevalent amongst some Deputies in this House that every man who takes a drink on Sunday is a drunkard.  I should not like to subscribe <Col N="239" /> to that view.  Personally I detest a drunkard though, like other Deputies, I enjoy a drink now and again.  Perhaps I enjoy it on Sundays more than on any day of the week. In my opinion it would look very bad if we were to brand ourselves as drunkards generally.  Undoubtedly you will get black sheep in every flock but looking round my own town, as I have often done on a Sunday, when you have seven or eight trains bringing in 5,000 or 6,000 visitors, I do not see anything in the nature of general drunkenness.</P>
      <P>Occasionally you will get an odd fellow &ldquo;under the weather.&rdquo;  I do not blame him for that; there are very few Deputies in this House who have not been &ldquo;under the weather&rdquo; on a few occasions.</P>
      <P>I was certainly glad to hear the Minister state that the licensing laws were under observation.  I have a feeling at the back of my mind that the rejection of Deputy Corry's Bill last November instilled into his mind a desire to get something back on those who voted against him on that occasion. I do not blame him for that but I do not think it is a sufficient justification for the introduction of this Bill. Deputy Corry laid a good deal of emphasis on the fact that certain people owning cars leave cities and towns at night time.  Many men own cars for the purposes of their business and I do not think it should be suggested that such men use their cars for the purpose of taking a &ldquo;skite&rdquo; around the liberties of Cork and Dublin to get drink at night time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that the man who can take a drink and control himself afterwards is a man to be admired.  As I said a moment ago, there are black sheep in every flock but personally I should be very sorry to see this Bill passed by the House.  I know that it would react detrimentally on all the seaside resorts in Ireland.  Most of the people in these seaside resorts have to earn sufficient from the 1st June to the end of September to keep them from October until the tourist season starts again. Deputy Davern has made a strong case in opposition to this Bill.  I am glad that the Minister is leaving the measure <Col N="240" /> to a free vote, but I sincerely hope that it will not commend itself to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A.P. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I also oppose the Bill and I sincerely ask any Deputy who is wavering on the matter to join me in my opposition to it.  I oppose it principally on the grounds that two wrongs do not make a right.  It is certainly very wrong to deprive a man living in a country district of reasonable facilities for refreshment on his only holiday in the week, but it would be also very wrong to deprive the Dublin working-man of his couple of pints if he feels that he needs them on a Sunday evening.  On these grounds I hope the Dáil will reject the Bill. The Minister said that the law, as it applied in the county boroughs, had not led to any grave abuses.  Perhaps not, in the sense that it has not led to any great drunkenness; but I would ask him, when he is considering the position generally, to think of the abuse arising from the fact that hundreds and thousands of men after Mass go into a public-house&mdash;perhaps not immediately after Mass but an hour or two afterwards, at 1.30&mdash;when they should be at home eating their dinners.  They do not reach home until about 3.30.  I think that is not fair to our Dublin housewives.  Neither do I think that evening hours are suitable as they occur at a time when these men should be at home at their tea.</P>

I am glad that the Minister has announced his intention of giving early consideration to our licensing laws generally because there is certainly great room for improvement in them, especially with regard to the <i>bona fide</i> laws.  The <i>bona fide</i> law is now a farce.  There is no longer any necessity for it, and I think the time will come shortly when the <i>bona fide</i> traffic must be abolished completely.</P>

It is remarkable that some of those who claim to have been influenced by resolutions from the Pioneer Organisation on the last few occasions are more or less tilting at the organisation because of its silence on this occasion.  I do not pretend to speak for the Central Council of the Pioneer Organisation nor do I know why it is that they did not take the same steps on this as on the last occasion but it appears to me as if the remarks of certain Deputies were more or less a tilt at the organisation.  I think the Pioneer Organisation can afford to ignore these remarks.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>For another reason I should be anxious to support the present Bill in that I think it is not right that the Sabbath should be used as an occasion for personal indulgence but again I fear the consequences I fear the consequences of an illicit trade in intoxicating liquor.  If closing became general on Sundays, I fear we might have a repetition of what is now a matter of history&mdash;the conditions that existed as a result of complete prohibition in the United States some 20 years ago.  At the same time, I quite <Col N="242" /> agree that the present licensing laws are out of keeping with present conditions. I do not know at what period the <i>bona fide</i> regulations were introduced but, with the present facilities for travel, there can be absolutely no control under the <i>bona fide</i> laws.  If we had the same conditions as obtained 100 years ago when most people had to get around on foot, the three-mile limit would be a very considerable deterrent to people who wished to indulge in drink.  Three miles is nothing nowadays, even on a bicycle.</P>
    <P>I think that some very serious effort should be made to amend the licensing laws so as to either absolutely abolish the law or to make it very difficult, even for the man with a motor car, to evade the ordinary law.  Again, I would say that I certainly am for the one law for all.  I do not want to see any facilities given to the city and borough population that are not made available to the rural population also. I would consider the present advantage which the city has as helping to accelerate the drift from the rural areas into the cities and larger towns. At the same time, as I have already pointed out, the danger that we might get worse is still present.  I am glad to hear that the Minister is considering proposals for amending the existing laws.  I would suggest that he should invite representatives from all Parties in the House to set up some sort of a Select Committee to consider in detail any proposals that might be put forward for the amendment of the existing legislation.</P>
    <P>With those suggestions I will leave the matter to the good judgment of the Deputies of the House.</P>

I was one of those who, before Deputy Corry introduced his last Bill, advocated, on the passing of legislation some years ago, the same right for persons in the country to have a drink at particular times as that available to those in the city.  That was and is at the present time my own private opinion.  I do not think that there should be any differentiation whatsoever between <Col N="243" /> people who reside in the country areas and people who reside in the towns and cities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite prepared to admit that that is exactly what I am quoting&mdash;that I did, on a previous occasion, speak in favour of the proposition that the same facilities should be given to people in the country as were available at that time to those in the city.  That is still my own private opinion.  However, I represent a rural constituency and, on the occasion when Deputy Corry introduced his recent Bill, I received numerous representations from responsible people and responsible organisations in my constituency to oppose the Bill.  I did not receive a single representation from a single constituent asking me to support it.  My purpose in speaking now is to point out to Deputy Corry that not only is he taking away from the country people what was sought to be gained in his last Bill, but that he is driving the knife even deeper because he wants to remove entirely from country and city alike the entire <i>bona fide</i> trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot see consistency in the attitude of the mover of a Bill of this kind and the attitude adopted by him on a previous occasion.  Deputy Corry is perfectly entitled to say that my name is in the &ldquo;Bible.&rdquo;  I repeat, however, that that is my own private opinion.  I have my own views on the question of drink and drinking in licensed premises.  I believe that too much nonsense is talked in this country about drink.  I believe that there is too much putting of decent respectable citizens who run licensed houses in the dock&mdash;making them potential criminals &mdash;and I believe that the entire licensing code needs to be overhauled.  I am glad to hear that it is going to be overhauled.  I do not see how any Deputy who has the interests of the rural districts at heart can support this particular measure.  If there was a grievance, and if the reason for introducing the last Bill was that the same facilities should be given to those who <Col N="244" /> reside in the country as are given to those in the towns and cities, the only thing left to those people who live in the country is the use of the <i>bona fide</i> trade when they are passing through towns and cities.  Deputy Corry has obviously introduced this measure in haste.  It has obviously been introduced without consideration for the welfare of those whom it is intended to benefit.  I am perfectly certain that Deputy Corry will agree that the measure has been introduced with the idea of telling the country that Dublin must be put all-fours with the rest of the country.  I think his object is: If we are not going to have it, you will not have it either.  I represent a rural constituency.  I could not possibly support this Bill.  It would be doing away with a very profitable <i>bona fide</i> traffic which is of very great value to the tourist industry of this country.  If we pass this Bill we shall place ourselves in exactly the same position the United States of America was in, except that we shall keep total prohibition for one day of the week and the opposite for the other six days of the week.  I would ask the Deputy (1) if it is his intention to do away with the <i>bona fide</i> traffic of this country, and (2) if it is his intention to change every licensed house in this country from a seven-day licensed premises to a six-day licensed premises, thereby reducing an enormous revenue to the Exchequer.  Has the Deputy considered these points? Deputies of this House, especially Deputies of mature experience, have a responsibility when they introduce private Bills of this kind and no Deputy should use his position and his experience here for the purpose of paying back in like coin something that he sponsored before.</P>
    <P>Finally, I am all in favour of people having drinks in properly conducted licensed premises any time of the day or night they may desire to do so.  I believe that a great deal of nonsense is talked in this country about the licensing code.  However, one often finds one's views in the minority, and public opinion has willed a certain course.  I know I am voicing the opinion of my constituents, who enjoy <Col N="245" /> a certain tourist traffic, when I say that it is my duty to oppose a Bill which seeks to do away at one fell swoop with the <i>bona fide</i> trade of this country.</P>

      <P>I think this is the type of Bill on which people should express their opinions.  I am opposing this Bill because I believe it is essentially dishonest, stupidly spiteful and foolishly childlike.  I believe that those were the three motives which inspired Deputy Corry to put down this Bill.  I know that I am right in believing that, because Deputy Corry with a fanfare of trumpets and with headlines in the <i>Irish Press</i> announced that this Bill was going down and that it was going down to spite the Deputies of this House who defeated the last Bill he introduced here.  I want to say, if it gives him some consolation, that I believe a lot might be said for this Bill.</P>
      <P>I believe that, from a great many points of view, a lot could be said in favour of the principle of this Bill.  I differ from my friend, Deputy Sir John Esmonde, in that, but I am not going to stand up in this House and support any Bill which I know is inspired purely by motives of spite and dishonesty. I am being quite blunt about it.  I think it is a disgrace that any Deputy should be allowed to utilise the floor of this House for the purpose of spite and dishonest publicity.  I know that Deputies opposite, because they are where they are, would like to see this Assembly coming into disrepute. If by silently acquiescing in it or by actively supporting it, we allow this type of manoeuvre to be carried out in this House, then the Assembly will come into disrepute.  It is for these reasons that I oppose this Bill, not because I do not believe that there is a great deal to be said for it.</P>

      <P>I do not think he has any right to set himself up as a judge of Deputy Corry's motives.  One's approach to this measure or any measure should be to examine it for what it is worth without regard to the considerations which inspired the mover.  This Bill of Deputy Corry's should be supported for a reason different from any reason advanced by anybody else so far.  If the Bill is carried, it will put the Department of Justice in this position, that it will have to introduce legislation to reopen the public-houses on Sunday all over the country.  Then Deputy Corry will have achieved his object.  This seems to me to be a perfectly logical Bill and not at all inconsistent on the part of Deputy Corry.  He failed the last time when he introduced a Bill to give the same facilities in the country as there are in the city.  He has now to adopt this method, which, in my opinion, cannot fail to be effective.  Deputy Corry realises as well as everybody else that complete prohibition on Sundays here would simply be unworkable.  I can find no complaint with him if he adopts this means of achieving his end and forcing the powers that be to give facilities in rural areas similar to those enjoyed in urban areas.  If those people who have now expressed regret for their opposition to Deputy Corry's first Bill are sincere in their expression of regret and if they are convinced that they were then in error, they ought to support this Bill.  Some Deputies have said they were wrong the last time but apparently they are going to stay wrong on this occasion also.  They have now a means of correcting the error which they made and they ought to use the opportunity which Deputy Corry, with great courage, has given to them.</P>

      <P>I oppose the Bill.  I have listened with interest to the various reasons given for and against the Bill. I agree that the Bill has been brought in in a fit of pique.  Deputy Corry was <Col N="247" /> defeated in his first Bill which, he claimed, was to do justice to the people in the areas that he represents and, now, in fit of pique, he says: &ldquo;If you will not give these facilities to the people for whom I want these facilities, I will take them from those who already have them.&rdquo;  That is the attitude in which the Bill is introduced.  I suggest it is a most inconsistent action on the part of any public representative. It may be a means to an end.  It may be that the votes for and against the Bill will induce the Minister to bring in a measure that will give something that was suggested in Deputy Corry's first Bill.  If it has that effect, I am sure Deputy Corry will feel that something has been achieved by the discussions to-day.  On the last occasion Deputy Corry used the expression &ldquo;decent workman&rdquo; and pleaded that the decent workman is entitled to these facilities.  Surely he does not want to deprive the decent workman who enjoys his Sunday refreshment in moderation? It is not legislation to stand up one day and plead that the decent workman should get certain facilities and on another day to plead that, because he did not succeed the last time, others should be deprived.  I hope the House will not be driven into the Division Lobbies, although it is an open vote.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  For the last 40 years we have been hearing of licensing Bills, and certain things were done that brought about the present position. I would suggest that the reason why the Pioneers or the licensed trade did not interfere in this measure is that they relied absolutely on the judgment of Deputies.  To-day, we have not been asked to increase facilities for drinking but we have been asked to remove facilities already in existence.  I suppose these people do not wish to press their arguments until something has been done.  Does Deputy Corry take into consideration the compensation claims that might come in from the licensed traders for the loss of so many trading hours?  Is he going to take from the <Col N="248" /> very people for whom he speaks, the people who come from the country and who put their money into trading concerns, liberty to carry on a decent trade?  I want to be clearly understood. I hope there is no intention on the part of anybody of attacking the licensed trader.  The licensed trader despises the drunkard.  The greatest nuisance that ever came to the licensed trader's door is the man who spends too much money and drinks too much. While he is there the trader and his staff are a mass of nerves.  It is good, clean business.  They want to carry on the business as it should be carried on. Before a licensed trader obtains his licence, there are investigations as to character.  If he has not a good character, and if he is not honest and upright and capable of conducting his business in the way it should be conducted, he will not get a licence.</P>

      <P>I can assure you that it is not purely formal, that any Superintendent of the Guards has the right to oppose on the grounds of character, and if there is the slightest thing against the individual applying for the licence, he will not get it.  If he conducts his house wrongly or in a shady manner during the licensing period, a Superintendent of the Guards opposes his licence.  Any citizen in the area has a right to complain and have the licence opposed.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corry ought to be satisfied with the type of speeches which have been made for and against.  He has drawn from the Minister a statement that the whole licensing code is going to be overhauled, that something is going to be done.  What it is, I do not know.  But I want to say on behalf of the licensed trade that you ought not to take from any person what he has paid a handsome price for, namely, the right to trade on seven days of the week. Deputy Corry is old enough to remember what happened in America when prohibition was brought in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Illicit spirits were made and sold at a fabulous price, spirits that drove the people mad when they drank them. Such stuff was sold at a price which <Col N="249" /> made fortunes for the rum-runners, as they were called, when they brought it into America illegally.  Those who were able, paid a big price for these spirits.  Surely Deputy Corry does not want to have spirits sold here illegally. If Deputy Corry has his way, the licensed trade will go and that kind of illegal trade will be carried on.  The decent workmen in the cities and towns should not be deprived of the facilities they have simply because Deputy Corry's other Bill was defeated a couple of months ago.</P>

      <P>Whatever motive actuated Deputy Corry in bringing in this Bill, the Bill is now before us. Quite a number of Deputies have made very strong charges, if I may use that word, against the Deputy with reference to the motive that lay behind the introduction of the Bill.  Last November Deputy Corry introduced a Bill providing that public-houses in rural areas should be allowed to open at certain hours on Sundays in order to give those in the rural areas an opportunity of getting a pint or a bottle of stout or a &ldquo;small one&rdquo; like the people in the City of Dublin and other cities where Sunday opening is in operation. I opposed Deputy Corry's Bill for certain reasons which I am not going into now.  I am one, however, who stands for equal rights for every individual in the community and, because I stand for that, I am prepared to give a certain measure of support to this Bill.  I consider, however, that the Bill is a little too drastic.  If Deputy Corry had confined his Bill to doing away with the hours of opening that already obtain in the City of Dublin and the other cities on Sundays, he would be meeting the situation from my point of view at any rate because he would be putting every individual in the community on the one basis.  But his Bill is far more drastic.  It does away with the <i>bona fide</i> law completely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can visualise a position in the City of Dublin during the months of July, August and September when there is a big hurling or football match at Croke Park and an influx of anything between 35,000 and 40,000 people from the country. Provision must be made for these people so that they can get refreshments. <Col N="250" /> Deputy Corry's Bill would do away with that.  I, therefore, could not support it fully from that point of view.  I am prepared, however, to support it on Second Reading and, if the Bill gets a Second Reading, I hope Deputy Corry will amend it on the Committee Stage to meet such a situation as that which I have mentioned.  I have only mentioned the City of Dublin, but the same thing would apply to the other centres throughout the country where big football and hurling matches are held.  I hope the Deputy will be prepared to amend his Bill to meet the situation to which I have referred if he gets it through the Second Stage.</P>

      <P>As a rural Deputy, I am surpised that the time of this House should be taken up discussing this Bill introduced by a Deputy whose Government had a majority in this House for 16 years during which he never thought of the people in the rural areas or of closing the public-houses in the cities on Sundays.  If the duties imposed in the last Budget brought in by the Fianna Fáil Government had continued in operation, the public-houses in the rural areas would be closed long ago because the people in the rural areas have not that much money to spend on drink.  I think it was a shame and a disgrace that that Bill was brought in last November when we were honouring the men of '98, and that we should have had the slogan: &ldquo;If we fail to beat them it was drink that brought us down.&rdquo;  It is all purely a stunt and there is no sincerity in the man at all.  I am surprised that men on this side of the House should bother about his Bill because he knows well enough that it is not going to go through.  The Minister for Justice said that the licensing laws were under review and I hope they will be better. To my mind&mdash;and I come from a country area&mdash;men have not the money to throw around on Sunday.  A thing that may happen occasionally is that a man may go in for a drink on Sunday because he is sick after Saturday night and then a Guard might catch that unfortunate man.  There is no demand for drink in the country.  Take a man coming up to the City of Dublin from <Col N="251" /> County Wexford to a football match, as Deputy Brennan said; what would happen if he could not get refreshments? How many barmen would be unemployed if they could not carry on that business on Sunday?  How many would be unemployed in the bottling stores?  We hear a lot from the Opposition about unemployment but are they looking to close down the licensing trade on Sunday here in Dublin where the biggest population is in the country and where there are so many people passing through?  I think that Deputy Corry is wasting the time of this House and that he should not bring in this Bill at all.  It is only play-acting because he is in opposition now.  For 16 years he never thought of the man in the country or the man in the city.  It is simply because he is in opposition.  Why did he not bring it in when he had the Government and why did he not embarrass the Minister for Justice then?  It is all play-acting and our talking here is no good to the country.  I would prefer to talk about unemployment than about drink because the working class people have not the money to drink but I will make this statement: We should control the lounge bars where there is mixed drinking going on.  That is not for the good of the country.  I think that should be looked into and that some laws should be brought in to control that mixed drinking.</P>
      <P>If Deputy Corry were serious he would have thought of the men down the country 16 years ago or whenever he came into this House&mdash;he came in years before that&mdash;but he never thought of the man in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to take the unusual step of voting for the Bill <Col N="252" /> and speaking against the mover. Deputy O'Leary said that there was a lot of &ldquo;cod&rdquo; and most of the &ldquo;cod&rdquo; is attached to Deputy Corry.  Deputy Corry is worried because his earlier Bill to open the public-houses in rural areas on Sundays did not receive the support of the House and now he feels as a good politician that he should close them in the cities.  I am not supporting this Bill for any of the reasons advanced by Deputy Corry.  On many occasions I had the pleasure of listening to Deputy Corry in this House advocating one course on the floor of the House and voting for another course in the division.  I am supporting this Bill because from a personal viewpoint&mdash;and I am speaking purely in a personal capacity&mdash;I do not like intoxicating liquor or the effects of intoxicating liquor.  When I say that, it does not mean that I wish to interfere with other men's enjoyment or with other men's abuses, except to wish that they may be induced by reason and education to remedy the abuses.  Deputy Corry's Bill is not going to remedy the defects of the drink trade.  Closing the public-houses in the city is not going to bring about the improvement that many of us in this House want to see.</P>
      <P>I have had sad experience of the abuses of drink.  Because I feel so much on the question of drink I think that some of us must take a standard principle.  Though I realise that there is no hope of this Bill being carried, I know that if it were actually carried it would not merely impose a hardship on the people in the city but would be ill-advised and against the best interests of those who want to see a reduction in drink.  I do not want to be associated with any extension of the facilities for drinking.  The people as a whole and those who speak for the people in this House must exercise their judgment and reasoning powers with regard to the control of drink.</P>
      <P>In dealing with this particular problem&mdash;it is not a problem but an evil&mdash;these cheap political tricks of Deputy Corry's not only make a farce of the matter but, as Deputy O'Leary said, make this House into a farce also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="253" /> In spite of all that, I am going to vote for this Bill, not out of respect for the motives of Deputy Corry in bringing it before the House, but for reasons of personal conviction.  Anybody who has any knowledge of the effects of drink&mdash;and possibly those of us who have to exercise our abilities in the working class movement come up against them more than anybody else&mdash;knows very well that you cannot legislate the evil out of existence.  It is a question of raising the standard in the country, a question of education, of giving a new outlook and a new viewpoint to the people and of filling a gap in their lives.  The average working man who goes into a public-house does not go in to indulge himself nor does he&mdash;though unfortunately some do&mdash;go in to make a beast of himself, but as a result of a system of society which denies the working man an opportunity of developing his abilities and of filling his leisure time in a proper manner.  If we are going to tackle the question of drink we must tackle it from that angle and dissociate it from the idea of socialibility, company and recreation.  We must replace it by something else.  It has been done in other countries and sometime, perhaps, we will realise that we have to do it here.</P>
    <P>Although I am voting for the Bill, I am not supporting it because of the motives of Deputy Corry and still less am I supporting it out of respect for its mover.</P>

      <P>Briefly I would like to say that I am supporting Deputy Corry's Bill.  I am sorry that it is Deputy Corry's Bill by reason of the way he has behaved as far as this Bill and his last Bill are concerned.  I expressed my sentiments regarding the opening and closing of public-houses on the last Bill.  Deputy Corry imagined that he was a good political scrum half and that he had caught me and Deputy Larkin on the wrong foot.</P>

      <P>I can be very brief in concluding on this Bill because I have nothing to answer.  Deputy Sir John Esmonde told us he was in favour of it.  He reminded me of the fellow long ago who came up in the middle of a row and gave one fellow a blow on the jaw that knocked him out.  The Deputy was in favour of the Bill that I brought in last November and then solemnly walked into the Lobby to vote against it&mdash;to show how much he was in favour of it.  Deputy Alfred Byrne is very much like Boyle Roche's bird.  He can be in two places at the one time.  When I looked up the Division List on the Bill that I had here in November I found that there was a Deputy Alfred Byrne in each Lobby.  One was for it and the other was against it, so that if there was any question about it afterwards down the country one or other of the two pages in the Dáil debates could be pulled out.</P>

      <P>I have been accused of various motives.  I was accused by Deputy O'Leary, but I would remind the House that in 1942 I made the very same statement in this House that I made on the Bill that I introduced last November.  Furthermore, in November, 1947, I brought a deputation from the Licensed Vintners to this House to interview the Minister for Justice. That was an all-Party deputation. Deputy Halliden, who walked in sanctimoniously to vote against my Bill, Deputy Dan Spring and all of them were there ready to pledge their support to a Bill.  They wanted an all-Party measure that would give the rural population a few hours on a Sunday to be able to have a drink in <Col N="255" /> peace in their own parish, the same as other people can have.  I am aware that the same deputation interviewed the Minister for Justice 12 months ago this month.  He promised them the sun, moon and stars and a bit of heaven along with it.</P>

      <P>They told me.  When I brought my Bill into the House it was postponed time and again.  Why? Because the Minister for Justice was preparing a new Bill.  He was preparing it until the pronouncement of the Hierarchy came out and then he ran. Fair play is fine play.  My motives in bringing in this Bill are above board. I want equal rights for every citizen in this State.</P>

      <P>I am well aware of the O'Higgins' tactics, and the Deputy had better not draw me on that.  I want equal rights.  If this House decides that the decent countryman who has to work on a Sunday is not entitled to a drink in his own parish, then it should equally decide that the city man who has no work on a Sunday and who, in 99 cases out of 100, has all Saturday evening to drink all that he wants, should not get facilities that are denied to the ordinary worker.</P>
      <P>I heard any amount of piffle from Deputy Alfred Byrne in connection with this matter.  That was all thrashed out. They are appealing now to the worker. What did they do for the rural worker last November?  I have heard various excuses given for the change of front. Here is a verse that was sent to me the other day:</P>
      <P>Martin Corry, for you we'll pray</P>

      <P>It is something that I got in connection with the Bill, the same as the Pioneer list, that Deputies have admitted here to-day drove them against their will into the wrong Lobby in November last.  As soon as I brought forward this Bill, I put a public letter in the Press appealing to the Pioneer Associations and the Hierarchy, saying that if it was a bad thing that facilities should be given to the countryman on a Sunday it was a far worse thing to put greater temptation in the way of people in the cities.  The members of the Pioneer Association in the town of Cobh were the only ones to open their lips on that I wonder why? We might find reasons for their silence that Deputy O'Higgins would object to.</P>

That is all that I did with Deputy Larkin and Deputy Corish and I do not think that I went out of my way to take advantage of either of them.</P>
      <P>I brought in this Bill to try and straighten out the laws of the State.  If Deputies say to me that the Minister is bringing in a new Bill, my reply to them is: &ldquo;If you want the Minister to bring in a new Bill, vote for this one; then you will see him move in a hurry and this is the only way in which you will get him to move.&rdquo;  That is the way to get the Minister to move.  Vote for this Bill, carry it, and then you will see the result.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move the motion standing in my name:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Eireann is of opinion that a council of education should be established as a permanent advisory body to the Minister for Education.</P>
      <P>For years past the members of the Irish National Teachers' Organisation, through its branches, its committees and its congresses, have consistently demanded the establishment of a council of education.  On one or two former occasions, when a motion similar to this was moved, members of the Parties now forming the inter-Party Government were at all times in favour of the setting up of such a council. It was only the present Opposition Party, including the ex-Minister for Education, Mr. Derrig, who always vehemently opposed the setting up of such a council.  I wonder, now that they are in opposition, what their attitude will be on this occasion.</P>
      <P>Our demands up to this have been for a body which would act simply in an advisory capacity&mdash;a body without any executive power whatsoever.  Recently we have had some examples of Ministers setting up such bodies.  The Minister for Health has set up a Health Council; the Minister for Local Government has set up a Housing Board; so, likewise, have the Ministers for Industry and Commerce and Social Welfare set up bodies to advise and assist them in their endeavours to carry out efficiently the various problems confronting their Departments.</P>
      <P>It now remains for the Minister for Education to set up such a council as is proposed in this motion.  The Minister has already stated, both in the House and at the Teachers' Congress last Easter, that he would make provision for the setting up of a council of edution. The fact that I am moving this motion does not mean that I doubt in the slightest degree that the promise he then gave will not be implemented. I am perfectly certain&mdash;and so also are the members of our organisation&mdash;that the Minister will honour his word.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The idea underlying this motion is that this council of education would be representative of the various bodies <Col N="260" /> who have the interests of education at heart.  I shall deal first of all with the managers.  Some managers have an idea that if such a council were set up it might interfere in some way with the present managerial system.  I can assure the House that it never was the intention of the Irish National Teachers' Organisation that any such interference should take place.  I am satisfied that if this body is set up, instead of being in opposition to the managerial system, it will perhaps be of assistance to the managers in enabling them to carry out their duties in the future more easily and more efficiently than in the past.  We realise that managers have real difficulties connected with the upkeep of their schools and so forth.  Perhaps this council would be in a position to devise means by which that could be done more effectively.  Then there would be representatives of the teachers' organisations&mdash;not only the members of the Organisation of Primary Teachers but also the Organisation of Secondary Teachers.  There would be of course, representatives of the Department of Education.  All these bodies are organised.  It is quite obvious that such organisations would choose the members they wish to represent them on the council of education.  The Minister, of course, would select those from the Department of Education.  There may be some difficulty about selecting representatives of the parents because they are not organised.  However, I am sure that all difficulties in that respect can be easily overcome.  I am sure the Minister himself could perhaps devise some means in consultation with the organised bodies that I have mentioned. I would suggest to the Minister, however, that whoever selects the parents will ensure that they will be representative of parents in the municipal, urban and rural areas.  I would make a further stipulation that such parents as would be represented on this council of education would be those who would have children in attendance at school.</P>
    <P>The Minister has already intimated his intention of setting up this council. There is, therefore, no need for me to <Col N="261" /> delay the House at any length because I feel perfectly certain that the motion should be accepted unanimously.  I would ask the Minister to carry out his promise at the earliest possible moment.  This is really the one promise that he has made to the teachers which has not already been put into operation.  I hope that before he attends the Teachers' Conference in Arklow next Easter this council of education will be set up.  All his promises will then be fulfilled.  I shall, perhaps, ask him about further demands which I am sure he will do his best to put into operation.  We teachers have found him at all times since his appointment as Minister the best Minister for Education that this country has had, the best Minister since the establishment of our native Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Palmer in proposing this motion spoke to it from the point of view, from the knowledge of a person interested in the profession. I want to deal with it in an entirely different way.  One of the particular reasons why I am anxious that a council of education should be set up is because I do not consider myself in any way qualified to advise the Minister on how the problems can be solved.  It is because I think that there are others in this House in the same position as I am that I think it is entirely desirable that there should be a council away and apart from politics in the ordinary sense of the term, away and apart from Party adherents.  I think that a council would be in a position to bring to the assistance of whatever Minister may be in power at a particular time that body of specialised knowledge in regard to the problems that face us. Anyone who has any experience in interviewing and selecting people for jobs in recent years&mdash;it is not only my experience, I have discussed it with others and they have told me the same&mdash;will find that unfortunately the standard of education in regard to the ordinary matters of reading, writing, spelling and of ordinary arithmetic is far from what it should be in regard to the ordinary day to day work that is required in any <Col N="262" /> ordinary office.  Similarly, for many years we are likely to be primarily an agricultural country and one of the most amazing things about us in that position is the great lack of real facilities that there are in regard to agricultural education.  There is another problem.  Any time anyone mentioned this problem there used to be a torrent of abuse and one was accused of being entirely anti-national for mentioning it.  I refer to the problem of teaching through the medium of Irish.  These are all problems that would be far better discussed away from the Party atmosphere of this House.  They are problems that are undoubtedly there and they are problems that must be solved.  Any Minister who had the advice of a competent advisory body able to give him their views on these problems would be very well strengthened in whatever proposals he might from time to time wish to put before this House.  It is not suggested at all that this council of education should take from the powers of the Oireachtas. It is suggested that it would be an advisory body to advise the Minister on the proposals that he wished to bring before the Oireachtas.  Neither is it suggested that it would have any executive or administrative powers. These powers would and must in the ordinary nature of things be left to the Minister and the Department operating under him.  One of the things that this Government made quite clear when it was being set up was that they felt they had not got all the knowledge in the country, that they were open to advice and that they were open to get help wherever help could be produced.  One of the best ways in which that can be done is through advisory councils in every shape and form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not a new idea that there should be a council of education.  It was stated at some length and with some considerable force in the report of the Vocational Organisation.  Even that was not the first time it was stated.  In the report of the Vocational Organisation the view was summarised somewhat succinctly.  The view was stated with great stress that the members of that commission recommended <Col N="263" /> the establishment of a council as a permanent institution, an institution that was going to act in an advisory capacity to the Minister and yet acting in that capacity would have, so to speak, the responsibility attached to the fact that it was accredited as such a body.  It would be able, in a better way than perhaps any political Party or any political Minister or the head of any Department, to get the ready cooperation of all concerned in education to make fully effective the national educational policy that the Government of the day might want to put into operation and that the Government of the day would receive sanction for from this House.  I have no doubt whatever that from the way in which the Minister for Education has started on the round on which he commenced tomorrow year he is going to bring to this problem the same energy, the same clear thinking as he has brought to the other problems with regard to education about which we have heard during the past year.</P>
    <P>While Deputy Palmer, as I say, proposed the motion from the point of view of a person who knew something about the problem from the inside, it is precisely because I and others like me know that there is a problem there but do not know sufficient about the matter to be able ourselves to propose the solution that we think it desirable that there should be a council like this to assist the Minister in the task he has undertaken of reviewing our whole educational position and making certain that the children who will go out into the world in the years to come will go out better equipped mentally, through education, to take their places there and better equipped, as a result, to give to the country the prosperity, the hope and the culture which we all of us would wish it to have in the days that lie ahead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I am correct in saying that this matter was one of the matters on which the various parties supporting the Inter-Party Government found they were able to agree without any hesitation and in a very short space of time, when they drafted the ten-point programme at the <Col N="264" /> time this Government was established. I am not surprised that the establishment of a council of education should have occupied a prominent place amongst those ten points, because, for one reason or another, the whole question of education has been agitating the public mind for many years back and agitating the public mind in a way which has compelled interest not only from those directly concerned in teachers' organisations, from school managers and even from those concerned from the point of view of the spiritual welfare of the pupils, but from the ordinary parent, the ordinary person who took no interest in politics. One of the reasons for that undoubtedly was the very tragic teachers' strike which took place when Deputy Derrig was Minister for Education.  I believed, at the time that strike was in progress, that if a council of education had been established some years previously, even though it might only act in a purely advisory capacity to the Minister, the existence of such a council would in all probability have succeeded in avoiding that teachers' strike and the consequences for the children which flowed and flowed naturally from it.</P>
      <P>This motion suggests that a council of education should be established as a permanent advisory body.  I agree wholeheartedly, and in that connection &mdash;I have referred to the fact that it has been agreed on by the parties supporting this Government&mdash;I should like to say, with regard to the word &ldquo;permanent&rdquo; in the motion, that I am very glad the Minister did not rush in immediately to establish any kind of hotchpotch advisory body which came into his head.  I am glad that he was rather cautious in his approach, because the necessity for such a council will probably be admitted by all parties to-day &mdash;I know it was opposed by the Fianna Fáil Government in the past&mdash;in the light of experience and with memories of the tragic teachers' strike and such matters.  It will probably be agreed in these circumstances that a council such as this is necessary now, but that should not blind us to the fact that there are and must be difficulties involved in the setting up of such a council and the selection of the personnel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="265" /> I believe it is absolutely essential that some method should be found whereby parents, who are perhaps the first people concerned in the matter of the education of their children, will receive adequate representation on the council.  I know that that must be a very knotty problem for the Minister and it may be one of the reasons why the council has not been established already.  As Deputy Palmer said, there are not, unfortunately, what might be termed recognised parents' bodies in existence for any great length of time. I think that some effort is being made at the moment to get some kind of organisation amongst parents from the point of view of education.  I do not know whether that effort will amount to anything or not and the whole question of representation for parents must be a difficult one for the Minister. I believe that the churches, the universities and the teachers themselves must be represented on the council, and that, whenever it is established, it must be established with the intention of keeping it as a permanent advisory body.  It would be a mistake to set it up and to dub it from the start an experiment that might not be continued. That is one of the reasons why I am glad the Minister did not rush in to set up any kind of council.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman gave his reasons for supporting this motion and he pointed to some of the matters which could be brought under review by the council, when established and working. He also touched on the question of compulsory teaching through Irish.  I do not want to express very strong views one way or the other on that matter at this stage.  I have expressed them in the Dáil and outside already, but I want to ask Deputies to bear this in mind when coming to a decision on the motion, that the question of compulsory teaching through Irish is one of the matters about which there seems to be a great deal of confusion and contradiction.  In any discussion on the Department of Education in this House, it is not uncommon to hear a dozen Deputies from different sides of the House expressing contradictory views with regard to what effect compulsory teaching through Irish has on the children in the schools and, not <Col N="266" /> only that, but the reception which that system gets from parents and their children.  Some Deputies say that the experience is that the parents are proud if their children know Irish, even if, through knowing Irish, as is claimed in other quarters, they are not up to the mark in other subjects.  My own experience, and I have stated it before, is that the average Dublin parent is definitely against what is known as the compulsory teaching through Irish system.</P>
    <P>The opposition to that system has been expressed from teachers and when the question was discussed here on the Estimate for the Department of Education the Minister stated that he was making an inquiry into it.  If the council of education was established, such a council, if it were properly representative of the parents, teachers and ecclesiastical authorities, would be able to advise the Minister in a very short space of time as to the all-over view on compulsory teaching through Irish.  I think that is a problem that must come under review by this council when it is established.  My experience is that the average Dublin parent is definitely against that system and would like to see it modified or altered in some way.  Various other questions would probably spring to the minds of different Deputies which could be properly submitted to a council of education.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the opposition which was voiced to the establishment of such a council as this, by Deputy Derrig when he was Minister and by Deputy de Valera when he was Taoiseach, withdrawn now, as I believe there is a very general demand from all sections of the people for the establishment of this council.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BridgetMRedmond" hpid="Mrs. Redmond Mrs. Redmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Redmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that the time has come now for clear speaking on the matter of education.  As Deputy O'Higgins has just said, there is a great deal of controversy in most people's minds here in Ireland as to the present system of education.  I welcome this council which our Minister proposes to set up.  It is up to every Deputy who feels any responsibility to his constituents, to voice their opinion or what they might term their <Col N="267" /> grievances, so that the council may be enlightened as to what is really wrong with the present system, in the opinion of various people.  Certainly, throughout the country there is no unanimity of opinion, in clapping ourselves on the back and thinking that everything is all right.  On the contrary, people regard the present system as something to be looked on with a very wary eye, since we are not advancing, though a good deal of money is being spent.  For that reason, I welcome this council.  I believe that, when there are people looking at these matters from an unbiassed point of view, much can be done and great help can be given to the present Minister.  We all realise that he is a man of great energy and we all appreciate his anxiety for the Department he is now guiding.  At the same time, we feel that something must be done to help him a little bit further and to help on our system of education, so as to fit our young people to take their part in the world which is advancing every day.  These are just a few words, first of all to compliment the Minister in setting up this council and, secondly, to put some points which may be of help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have spoken on many occasions, on the Estimates here, regarding the waste of money in the teaching of compulsory Irish.  Only last week I was in a district which is an Irish-speaking one known as the Gaeltacht, and a few weeks ago an advertisement appeared for a postman, an ordinary job, where a man was being looked for with ordinary intelligence and ordinary education. There was not one in that particular district who could be found to take it up, even as a temporary position, as there was not one suitable person capable of reading English from the envelopes.  I ask anybody, in all sincerity, if that is education, and if that is what we are collecting taxes and spending money on.  By all means, if people want to have Irish, very good, it is our national language and let it be taught as a language; but let our people at least be educated and be allowed to fit themselves to earn their living in any way, in whatever role they may be called upon to fill in this life after they leave school.  There <Col N="268" /> is no use in hoodwinking ourselves any longer.  The time has come to get down to clear thinking.  We have got as far as having a council.  We have an excellent Minister for Education and now we want to put the people's wishes into force.  I do not think anyone can object to that.  The people have to pay the piper and they are not inclined to have their children brought up in a state of ignorance, So much for compulsory Irish.  Let it be taught as a language and let us not have this compulsory business, having everything through Irish.  We do not want our children to be turned out as illiterates.</P>
    <P>On the question of examinations, heretofore under an alien Government we had several big examinations throughout the summer term and in all cases the heads of the school were able to have the results before the children were due to return in September.  Now we have less examinations and the results are not known to the heads until the children have returned in September.</P>
    <P>That is quite wrong; it is quite clear to everyone that it hampers the various heads of the schools not to have the results of their pupils' examinations before returning time.  They cannot just act on chance, but now it is purely a question of chance whether they put a boy or girl up to the correct class or not, according to the result of the examination. It would help the various headmasters and those in charge in convent schools, if the results were out in the middle of July, or at least by the end of July.  It seems an extraordinary thing that we have less examinations now, possibly more examiners, certainly more money spent, yet less efficiency. It is a very important point, firstly to the children, and secondly to the masters.  They feel very keenly on this and it has been mentioned to me on a few occasions.  We all remember that when we were at school ourselves we saw the results hanging up when we went back after the holidays and we knew long before that the results of the various examinations.  I see no reason, now that we have an Irish Government and an Irish Minister for Education, why we cannot have the same efficiency.  There should be even <Col N="269" /> greater efficiency now and for that reason I believe this council can be of the greatest help to our Minister.  I hope that the Deputies here will throw their weight behind the council and make our system of education one of which we can be proud, and one on which we can justify the spending of so much of the people's money, in present hard times.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy asks why an advisory council on education was not set up by me earlier than this, that is, sometime during the last year.  For a very good reason.  I am going to set up a good council of education, representative of first-class educational thought and the first-class educational work that is <Col N="271" /> being done systematically and quietly in the schools of this country.  I am going to set up a council of education that will be worthy of the people's capacity and of the people's ideals in education and when I am setting up a council of that kind, I want them to be working with a Minister who would be up to their standards.  I felt that, until I had some experience of the Department of Education, some intimate and detailed knowledge of its functioning, some knowledge of the work that was being done in the schools and of the personnel doing that work, I would not be worthy to be associated, as Minister, with the council of education that I propose to set up.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cormac Breathnach said he is in favour of the council and I think Deputy O'Higgins asked Deputy Derrig whether he was in favour of it or not I do not know whether it is worth while going into these questions at all. From my general experience of the Department I am quite satisfied that the last Government, in response to the outlining of the situation given by the Vocational Organisation Committee, in face of the examination carried out and the opinions expressed then, and the general expression of feeling in the country, would, in time at any rate, have set up a council.  I indicated that I was going to set up a council.  That is one of the things that is foremost in my mind at the present time but as I say there is a very considerable amount of work to be done in the Department. I have been learning quite a lot.  One of the things about which I want to learn is the question of personnel.  I want to assure Deputies on all sides of the House&mdash;I do not want to make a precise promise but just to tell them what is in my mind&mdash;that I expect by September or October of this year, I shall be able to give a decision with regard to the personnel of the council I would wish to set up, and the terms of reference given to that council.</P>
    <P>Both Deputies Palmer and O'Higgins have spoken as if this council were going to be a representative council. The Vocational Organisation Committee, in making its recommendation, recommended that it would be a council <Col N="272" /> built up in a representative way.  I think I have said in some place or another, if not here, that I was not going to appoint a council as an advisory council that would be built up by representation from various bodies here, that if I did, its personnel would be as numerous and varied as the contents of Noah's Ark and that I did not think that you would get advice on the subject on which we want to get the advice of the council&mdash;and that is educational thought and educational ideas&mdash;from such a council.  That is, we would not get the best type of direction from such a council.</P>
    <P>Without saying that I have found complete agreement in every direction in which I have discussed this matter, on that point I do want to say that in the early days when I took up the Ministry one of the first things, in the early months at any rate, I particularly wanted to do was to discuss the problem of our council of education, the work of the council and the best means of getting such a council set up.  I discussed that with nearly every type of representative and important body and with many others.  I explained to them that, having gone into the matter, the council of education I contemplated as the best type would not be one for which a number of bodies throughout the country would be asked to nominate representatives.  I would ask Deputies to understand that that is what I have in mind at the present time and that it is along that line I feel that I will ultimately go.  I would ask them to withhold their judgment in these matters until I actually put my proposals into operation.  In the meantime I do not think it necessary to go into all these other detailed questions that were mentioned.  I would even ask Deputy Ó Briain to withhold his judgment too.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman has spoken of the necessity for better and more widespread education in matters affecting rural parts of the country.  Nothing in my experience in the Department of Education has so stimulated me or so raised my courage and my hope for education in the country as the work which I have seen done at the periphery, the vocational and technical education work where it touches on the <Col N="273" /> rural districts.  I have met in various groups representatives of the committees dealing with vocational and technical education in a number of counties.  I have met them in contact with some of their principal officers, their chief executive officers and some of the principal teachers, and with some of the inspectors of the Department of Education who deal with these matters, and I am perfectly satisfied that there is work being done in rural areas under the vocational education committees that is of the highest possible value to the country, educationally, spiritually and economically. I feel that the contact between the doing of that work and the teachers on the one hand and the representative committees on the other is one of the most valuable contacts we have.  I feel that without the active interest, the patronage and the help of these committees that are supervising that work the teachers who are carrying it on and the inspectors who are supervising it would not be able to do the magnificent work they are doing.  I feel that these committees are providing in the various rural areas an atmosphere of interest and help for the carrying on of that work of such a kind that it would be impossible to carry on the work if they were not there.</P>
    <P>I look forward to a council of education creating an atmosphere for educational matters here in Ireland that will encourage those who are working in educational fields.  There are very many different educational fields in the country divided between the educational work of the cities, the educational work of the glens and the educational work of the technical, secondary and primary classes.  There are very many fields of educational activity in which we want active workers to pool their thoughts, their theories and the result of their work, and I feel that the council of education that I contemplate we shall be able to set up will be one which will create an atmosphere which will inspire and bring into active operation a number of committees and councils on various aspects of educational work from one end of the country to the other.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="274" /> I think everybody who looks at the work of the educational organisations in the country so far as their proceedings are published is disappointed that there is not a sufficient amount of thought and talk given to the problems of education and to the working of education.  I know some counties where clinical associations have been formed by doctors, where dispensary doctors come together once a month and one of them reads a medical paper and they discuss it.  They have visitors from neighbouring counties and from Dublin and they raise the practice of and the approach to medicine to a very much higher point than would be reached without these assocations.  I should like to see the same thing happening throughout the various districts in the country in connection with educational matters as regards primary, secondary and technical schools.  The energy and the thought are there for it and only require to be stimulated into action.</P>
    <P>What I want particularly is that an advisory council with high qualifications and experience, in touch with the people and representatives of the people, shall be brought together to define the educational objectives of our people and to assist in improving educational methods.  If there has been delay in my taking action in this particular matter, it is in order that I may be better able to help them in their high work, that I may be better able to explain to them what the Department of Education and the various teaching organisations throughout the country can be expected to do to help them along the road to a higher idealism, higher and better education, and more successful application of the training and the education in the schools in order to increase productivity, increase happiness and increase culture in the country.</P>
    <P>I would ask Deputies who are interested in the Irish language not to think that an odd person here and there or small bodies here and there are the custodians of the Irish language. The people of this country from Donegal to Waterford will decide and determine to keep, and successfully <Col N="275" /> do it, the language that was handed down as our language for thousands of years, that has enriched itself as the years went by, being the only language in Europe outside Latin and Greek that was the written language of the people from the time they began to write and is still with us in the glens, the valleys and the bogs of the West of Ireland.  The Irish people to-day, from Waterford to Donegal, whether they can speak Irish or not, are not going to allow that to be lost.  The people who are of such cailbre, quality and achievement in the educational world that they are going to be selected for the council of education, above any others are not going to allow that language to be lost.</P>
    <P>There are things that could be said to-day without any council of education as to what could be done and what could not be done at this stage in the educational programme to help Irish back as the vernacular of the people.  If we are going to talk about these things&mdash;as we are&mdash;all the people will not be guided by what the council of education may say in the matter. We ought to talk about these things as if we were all deeply interested and in such as way as to get a chance of seeing one another's point of view and of knowing the facts of the case.</P>
    <P>I welcome this motion to-day as a guarantee to me and a reminder to me that this council of education is wanted and that I am not going to be allowed to sleep on the job of setting it up.  I am not.  I have been thinking a lot about it and did a lot of inquiry and examination in the earlier months after coming into the Ministry. I have been doing other things since to prepare me better to be able to select the council and work with the council for the benefit of education generally in the country and that will include the saving, the spreading and the keeping for all time for our people of our national language.</P>

      <P>I do not think that the proposer or the seconder of the motion can have been in any way disappointed in not hearing from the Opposition Front Bench because, although they were not present in the House when these matters were under discussion before, they have an idea of the views that I, for example, have upon this matter.  The position is now entirely different and neither the proposer nor the seconder nor the other speakers to the motion really felt it necessary to make clear the grounds upon which they consider the council to be necessary since the Minister, both before and after the election and in this House, pledged himself to the establishment of such a council.  They took it for granted, I presume, as I did, that he would have some statement to make regarding it on this occasion.  The Minister has now stated that until next September or October this council will not be set up. For a good many years past we have had this question on the annual Estimates, and I cannot avoid pointing out to the Minister that in the estimates which will be under discussion in a few months' time it is very likely that this question will crop up again.  Certainly, we have not got very much additional information from the Minister as to the progress he has made. I entirely agree with him that if this council is to be set up, a council which would work with the Minister should be envisaged.  A council which would be likely to clash with ministerial policy or which would attempt to arrogate to itself administrative duties or which would interfere in policy appertaining particularly to the Government &mdash;matters of finance, for example&mdash; would not, I think, be advisable.  I have expressed that view before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think there is a great deal of confusion about this matter because the proposer of the resolution suggests in reply to certain objections which managers&mdash;some managers, at any rate&mdash;&mdash;may make to the setting up of this <Col N="277" /> council of education, that it is likely to help them to perform the work entrusted to them more efficiently.  Perhaps I may not be interpreting Deputy Palmer entirely correctly.  He may have meant that the council would, in effect, see that the work of primary education would be carried out more efficiently, if possible, than at present. One can see that if managerial responsibility is to be limited by the advice given by the council regarding matters which managers consider to appertain to them, it is obviously going to raise delicate questions.  I am not going into that any further, but since Deputy Palmer has mentioned the matter it seems clear to me that he has taken a rather superficial view.</P>
    <P>The Minister made it clear, with regard to the second point that was made by the Deputy in proposing the motion, that organisations such as presumably the Irish National Teachers' Organisation should not be represented.  Everyone would like to see all the organisations connected with education represented, but that is not feasible and the Minister is quite right, I think, in determining that he is not going to be bound in that way to give representation to organisations on the basis of what we might presume to be delegates appointed by these organisations.  The Minister has expressed his view about that and on these two points which the proposer mentioned I doubt very much if the expectation he has from the setting up of the council of education will be realised.</P>
    <P>I presume the Minister has good reasons for not giving us more information. He says that he is still considering the question and that he wishes to put up the best body possible and secure the best possible representation. I am sure we all hope that those who will be appointed will be worthy in every way of the high honour which will be conferred upon them and we all agree with the Minister that they should be eminent and well known in the educational world and that they should have the reputation of being persons of understanding <Col N="278" /> and experience in dealing with educational problems.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go back over past matters, but when Deputy O'Higgins says that there has been a great deal of agitation about this matter and that there seems to be a general demand for the setting up of the council of education and when somebody else says that people have felt in their minds that there is something wrong with the system, it seems to me that if there were really all this agitation and demand it would surely have made itself more vocal and be of such a character that it would have compelled the Minister to do something&mdash; if that were possible for perhaps the Minister is a strong man&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and when he wants to carry out a certain policy he insists in doing it in his own way.  It seems to me that if there is any foundation for the claim that there is a widespread demand for the council&mdash;that there has been an agitation and that parents generally want it&mdash; we have seen very little proof of that during the last 12 months, apart from the putting down of this resolution.  If this resolution had not been taken for another 12 months, I do not know that there would have been any dreadful upset in the country or that anyone would feel that the educational system was going to the dogs in the meantime.</P>
      <P>With these few words, I think I can sit down, except to express the hope that, when the Minister has a further statement to make, it will be of such a character as to enable us to say that it means a step forward in securing greater efficiency in our educational system.  I hope that whatever step the Minister takes will be a cooperative one, one that will bring all classes and all the different interests connected with education together to work harmoniously, and that in that way the country generally will benefit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move on behalf of Deputy Belton and myself the following motion:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Eireann is of opinion that modern swimming and bathing facilities are urgently required for our cities and our towns.</P>
      <P>I move the motion specifically to bring to the notice of the Government and the Dáil the rather pathetic and lamentable state of the swimming and bathing facilities that exist throughout the length and breadth of the country. A good deal of capital and a good deal of play has been made from time to time in this country on the question of cleanliness and health.  It is an admitted, and indeed a universally agreed fact that one of the most beneficial exercises conceivable, from a medical point of view, in health-giving qualities is that of swimming.  But the problem goes a lot further.</P>
      <P>I do not know if the Dáil realises that, in fact, in this country we have not got one decent indoor swimming pool or one decent outdoor pool, one of a standard to which you could invite people by way of competition or in which you could properly or adequately train swimmers.  I speak from considerable personal experience of the whole problem of swimming and swimming facilities.  It falls to a person's lot in his lifetime, I suppose, to become proficient in not more than one or two sports.  The one that appealed most to me in my not so distant youth was that of swimming.  I found the pathetic and miserable situation that, despite the best endeavours and despite the earnestness of enthusiasts in the swimming arena, the facilities available were so antiquated and inadequate that it was impossible even to allow a person to get himself fit enough to be ready, by proper training, for competitive swimming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People talk a good deal in this country on many subjects.  There is one startling reality in this problem of swimming baths and swimming facilities, and it is that while in this <Col N="280" /> city of Dublin, with its teeming population, there is not available a proper swimming pool of any type, the city of Belfast can provide at least seven good-class indoor swimming pools for its population.  The miserable contribution to swimming in Dublin is the Tara Street baths, which may or may not have a water supply according to the fuel situation or a water supply at any particular time.  What are alleged to be swimming baths serve many purposes, including the very necessary one of being available, on certain days of the week, to the women of Dublin for the purpose of doing their washing. We had one other swimming pool in Dublin which was of some small value to this extent&mdash;that there the youth in the schools were able to avail of it during certain hours, evenings and days of the week to train.  I refer to the Iveagh baths, but in recent years it became, far from being a swimming pool, a de-lousing centre for people going to England.  That has been the contribution of Dublin City to swimming efforts in this country.</P>
    <P>It is many years ago since a little band of real enthusiasts started, developed and worked up the Irish Amateur Swimming Association, an organisation which, incidentally, must commend itself very earnestly to this House in that it is an organisation that knows no border and never has.  That organisation addressed repeated exhortations to Government after Government to give it some kind of swimming pools, in some part of the country in which it could do some of the necessary work of preparing swimmers, divers and water polo players for international competitions.  One can say that in archaic conditions, and in impossible weather conditions, there has been, in the last seven or eight years, an amazing stride made, an amazing and creditable national effort made by swimmers in this country to improve the standard of their performance: to improve it to such an extent that they were able to complete in various international competitions and, indeed, to send swimmers to complete in the Olympic competitions.</P>
    <P>Think of the position that would have existed had there been available <Col N="281" /> in this country, only for one year before the Olympic Games, one swimming pool that would provide facilities so that swimmers and divers could train throughout the year.  I say that in at least one sphere, in the diving sphere, Ireland would have made its mark in both the high-board and spring-board diving championships of the world.  The position exists in swimming that swimmers have been able to obtain a high standard of performance in a short season in cold water in a small pool&mdash;the main pool is that inadequate one at Blackrock, where the main competitions in swimming in this country are held.  When swimmers, divers and polo players can in those conditions build themselves into the standard of efficiency that they have achieved, what would happen if we made one genuine effort to provide in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway an adequate swimming pool?</P>
    <P>I urge this motion upon the Dáil in a very earnest way.  I feel that  and basically it would be a tremendously sound idea to develop a proper swimming complex throughout the country.  It is a clean, decent, wholesome sport; it is a healthy sport and it is a sport in which the indications are that with any kind of facilities this nation, small as it is, could take a proud place in the athletic world.</P>
    <P>I must confess that I have been severely disappointed with the Department of Local Government.  I urged upon them in a very special way that they might, even as an interim and expedient measure, make available, before our teams went to complete in the Games, the Iveagh Pool, so that we could train them for three or four months.  I felt that this country, sending out into international competition a team of swimmers and divers, might have bestirred itself to make that effort.  I feel sorry for the whole amateur swimming association and for all the people who are enthusiastic about swimming that that gesture could not be made.  Now, with the tremendous drive to house our people, with the tremendous development of built-up areas, the <Col N="282" /> Department responsible must keep in front of them in all their plans the necessity for giving in all those very populous areas adequate swimming and bathing facilities.</P>
    <P>Apart altogether from the element that would appeal to us in the glamour of competition, we have to remember that it is essentially a healthy sport, a sport that will build up in a very pronounced and effective way the body of the child.  It is a sport that will give the growing child a confidence and manliness that few other sports will give.  It is a sport that encourages a feeling of courage and faternity that few other games encourage.  It is something that will solve many of Dr. Browne's burning disease problems.  I feel that we are not making proper use of preventive measures when we consider the building up of our boys and girls.  We do not make adequate use of our normal resources in the training, in a normal physical way, that will enable them to build up their bodies so that there will be a far more effective resistance to any disease that might threaten them.</P>
    <P>Swimming is something that I love. There is something about it that to me has a particular charm and appeal.  It is a sport that I have spent a very considerable time at.  I have devoted a good deal of my energy to it.  But there is more in it than that.  There is a cleanliness about it, not only because water is one of the component parts, but there is a cleanlines about it in so far as it develops the muscles in a coordinated kind of way.  It keeps the growing boy or girl clean in body and, as well, it keeps them clean in mind.</P>
    <P>I have nothing but a complete contempt, an unadulterated contempt, for the lack of appreciation, in the minds of county councils throughout the country, as to the necessity of swimming and bathing facilities in their areas.  It is something that can be developed in a not terribly expensive way.  To provide adequate pools for the purpose of training or developing our competitive swimmers would not involve any colossal sum.  You would need only a fair-sized pool in four or five populous centres.  We could easily develop ordinary swimming pools.  We <Col N="283" /> could at a reasonable expense provide fresh water swimming pools in the river districts and improve swimming and bathing facilities along our coasts. At the moment these things are shamefully and disgustingly neglected by our local authorities.</P>
    <P>I think the time has come when the Dáil should record its appreciation of the urgent need to construct adequate swimming and bathing facilities in this country.  The time has come when the work of people like Eddie Heron, for so many years our diving champion and who was at one time referred to by Pete Desjardins, when he was on tour in this country, as the greatest diver he had ever seen, should be properly appreciated.</P>
    <P>Eddie Heron won the championship of the British Isles.  He was sought after by the United States of America to complete for them on their diving team in the Olympic Games.  When a man of that calibre is willing and anxious to train younger people in this excellent sport he should have at his disposal an adequate pool in which to train them and give them the benefit of his mature knowledge and mature coaching.  MacCartney of Belfast and Hynes and Brady of Dublin have made startling advances in this sport and have lowered in a quite phenomenal way Irish swimming records over the last few years.  These men are now reaching the prime of manhood.  They should be given swimming pools of adequate length and accommodation in which they could train the younger people in this magnificent sport.  The time has come when the whole country must be awakened to the necessity and the desirability of providing adequate swimming facilities and proper bathing pools.  Because of the beneficial effects of swimming on health and physical development everything possible should be done to make the people conscious of the importance of developing this particular type of sport.  In its concept and <i>de facto</i> it is the one sport which teaches selfreliance. There is no other recreation to compare with it in that respect.  If the young people are encouraged to learn swimming we shall have in this <Col N="284" /> country a stronger, healthier and more courageous youth.  The G.A.A. has built stadiums.  The Rugby Football Union has built stadiums.  Practically every type of sport in this country is catered for to a much greater extent than is swimming. Some of the games played have made us internationally famous.  Swimming, water-polo, spring-board and high-board diving can make us equally internationally famous if they are developed.  The Irish Amateur Swimming Association deserves some recognition of their repeated efforts to get something done to develop aquatic sports in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I second this motion.  I think that the provision of public baths and proper facilities would be of the greatest possible benefit to the country from the point of view of the health of the general public.  Such a provision would fill a long-felt want. Around the Irish coast there are numerous small inlets and coves suitable for conversion into swimming pools.  Most of these are conveniently situated from the point of view of the urban dwellers.  Their development and improvement could be achieved at a relatively small cost.  Such a development would be attractive from the point of view of the tourist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Dublin there are three sea-water baths&mdash;Clontarf, Blackrock and Dún Laoghaire.  There are two indoor swimming pools&mdash;Tara Street and the Iveagh Baths.  Certainly the people of Dublin have no reason to be proud of the facilities available at the present moment.  There are numerous seaside resorts where the local authorities could carry out development works for the improvement of swimming facilities generally.  There is Red Rock in the Howth area.  With very little expenditure that could be made every attractive from the point of view of swimmers and bathers.  You have the area between Malahide and Portmarnock. The Dublin County Council has already built a jetty in that area in order to afford facilities for deep-water swimming. But the requirements provided for fall far short of what is desirable. There is Dalkey, Seapoint and the coast right along into Bray where <Col N="285" /> deep-water swimming pools could be constructed at a comparatively small outlay.  About ten years ago I paid a visit to Weston-super-Mare.  In comparison with Dublin it is a small town. There I inspected a glorious swimming pool.  Here in Dublin we have a population of some 700,000 people and there is not so much as one decent pool available for them.  The best swimming pool in this country was constructed in four weeks.  That is the pool at Butlin's Camp.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support this motion wholeheartedly.  For many years the members of the Irish Amateur Swimming Association have been crying out for assistance for the establishment of both indoor and outdoor baths.  It is a tribute to that organisation that they have brought the facilities to the pitch at which they are even at the present moment.  At the same time everybody must agree that the facilities offered are anything but adequate.  Around the coast there are outdoor baths.  In my opinion the most pressing need is for indoor baths. Because of climatic conditions our swimming season is relatively short. Most people do not commence swimming until the middle or end of June and they finish the season by the end of August.  The season in this country is, therefore, approximately some two and a half months in duration.  It is generally agreed that the maximum of training should be given to people when they are young.  Because of the paucity of indoor swimming pools it is impossible to train the youth of this country.  The school holiday period coincides with the best swimming period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The result is that there is no means whatever available to the schools to teach the young people how to swim. Year after year we read in or about the months of July and August of the alarming number of drownings.  I think it cannot be denied that if swimming were made more popular, if the art of swimming were more widely indulged in and, in particular, taught in the schools many of these drownings would be avoided and I am sure in a very short time they would be down to <Col N="286" /> the minimum.  However, without indoor baths properly heated where people can go in winter time and where school children can be taught by experts, the teaching of swimming on a proper basis will not be possible.  I mentioned the perseverance of the swimming association in trying to maintain and improve the swimming facilities that are already available.  In that connection the residents of Templemore and Dungarvan deserve great credit.  Due to local enterprise, energy and effort they have provided themselves with swimming baths.  The one in Dungarvan particularly compares very favourably with other swimming baths all over the country.  I am told that was as a result of local effort but I am open to correction on that. The local authority might have financed it to a reasonable extent.</P>
    <P>Stress has been laid on the absence of swimming facilities in and about Dublin.  In Cork, also, even though we are probably relatively better off than Dublin, swimming facilities are still inadequate.  Possibly the best of the swimming baths in Ireland are situated in Cork.  Judging by the appearance of them I am sure these were built 50 or 60 years ago.  If it was possible to make a start in providing indoor swimming baths such as the Eglinton Street baths in Cork and the Tara Street baths in Dublin surely we should not have to stop there.  Surely we could have kept up the progress and not only provided extra indoor swimming baths but improved the existing ones.  So far as I know the swimming baths in Cork have not even had a coat of paint in the last 20 or 30 years.  In Cork winter swimming facilities are available at the present time, and I can tell the House that they are being most eagerly availed of by a large section of the swimming fraternity.</P>
    <P>I feel that one of the answers the Parliamentary Secretary will make is that with the lack of building materials and the constant shortage of housing it would be very difficult for his Government to devote any money to the provision of swimming baths. Everybody here knows how necessary it is for each and every Government to concentrate on housing but nevertheless <Col N="287" /> we must not lose sight of the fact that people cannot live all their lives in houses.  They have to go abroad and seek exercise, refreshment and entertainment and as Deputy Collins said, what better way can they find of exercising themselves, particularly in summer, than in properly equipped swimming baths.</P>
    <P>I have not been abroad to see any of the swimming facilities they have in other countries but a well-known Dublin swimmer to whom I was speaking recently told me that in the past few months he went on a tour in Denmark, a country which corresponds to a large degree with our own as far as resources, population and so forth are concerned.  He found there facilities such as put him to shame when he reflected on the swimming facilities that there were available in his own country.  So much so that when out of ordinary politeness it came to their turn to invite the people back here, they were ashamed to do so.</P>
    <P>When the inter-Party Government came into power they put a nail into the coffin of the Irish Amateur Swimming Association when, in their policy of retrenchment, they withheld the provision of £25,000 for athletics that was provided by the outgoing Government.  That, I am sure, was a severe blow to all athletically minded people.  Twenty-five thousand pounds certainly would not have provided anything like the facilities that swimmers and other sportsmen needed but it would have at least made a start and a start in the right direction. However, the start was not made although as far back as December, 1947, the then Minister for Local Government, speaking at the annual dinner of the Blackrock Swimming Club, promised faithfully that his Party would bear more than half the capital outlay of any swimming baths that were to be built or provided in any part of the country, provided the local authority raised the balance by way of tax on the rates or voluntary subscriptions. There again not only have the swimming community been discouraged by this policy of retrenchment, but they see no hope whatever other than <Col N="288" /> by voluntary subscriptions of providing the requirements necessary.  I do not say that by way of seeking political Party advantage but I am speaking to the Parliamentary Secretary of the Department of Local Government, who, to my own knowledge, is a sportsman. I am asking him to use any influence he may possess with his colleagues in the Government or in his Department to revert to the policy that they found before them when they came into office of starting to make provision for athletics and to extend them, side by side with ordinary field athletics, to swimming.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins made reference to the normal health of the people.  I agree with him that swimming probably is more capable of adding to the health of the normal individual than any other sport.  We must not lose sight of the fact in all our health programmes that what an old wise man said&mdash;I do not know his name&mdash; summarises the position as I see it. He used the words, &ldquo;Mens sana in corpore sano.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaSnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>In supporting this motion, I should like to say that I am in full sympathy with the case made in relation to the efforts of the Irish Amateur Swimming Association to train our promising swimmers for the bigger international events.  Reference was made to the position in Dublin, and, while the position in Dublin&mdash;I suppose this is the only way to describe it&mdash;is deplorable, there is a much worse position throughout the country.  Galway is a great seaside resort, but, in Galway and Salthill, we have not one indoor bathing pool of any description, and the one outdoor pool there is is one into which only a very experienced swimmer could venture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are people throughout the country who are prepared to help to establish swimming pools, and, as Deputy Lynch said, the previous Government had a scheme whereby they would contribute something like 50 per cent. of the cost.  In one case, however, a bit of a damper was thrown on such a proposal by, I suppose, the Department of Finance.  In the town of Tuam, a committee got together with a view to seeing what might be done <Col N="289" /> towards having a swimming pool erected.  I made the necessary inquiries for them and found that a local contribution of a certain sum would be required, that the county council would be asked to pay an additional sum and that then the Department would see what they would be prepared to contribute. The committee collected the money and had it ready; the county council did their part; and the Local Government Department were prepared to do theirs.  But what happened? All was ready for starting work three or four years ago, but the work could be undertaken only on the basis of the unemployed register.  If any other schemes were available in Tuam, the work would not be undertaken and it could only be done by the unemployed. That was a complete damper on voluntary effort which was prepared to do its part in putting up whatever sum was required.</P>
    <P>That position should be changed and the Department should come to the assistance of any people who are prepared to make such facilities available by removing these obstacles.  It is a terrible position that middle-aged and elderly people who go to Galway for a few weeks' holidays cannot go into the water there.  I hope this motion will receive the sympathetic consideration of the Department, that every encouragement and assistance will be given to these people and that any barriers which may be in the way of local authorities or local people speeding up the work of erecting swimming baths and bathing-pools over the country will be removed.</P>
    <P>As has been said, swimming has tremendous health benefits, and it is not necessary to refer to its value from the point of view of cleanliness.  In many ways, it is one of the activities that will help to improve considerably the health of our people and one of the sports in which the younger element should be encouraged to indulge instead of playing pitch-and-toss at some street corner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government (Mr. Corish) Brendan Corish">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government (Mr. Corish)</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody can doubt the sincerity of the mover and seconder of the motion in urging that facilities for <Col N="290" /> swimming and bathing be provided. There is no necessity to go over the ground covered by Deputy Collins who is himself a very keen swimming enthusiast.  He has pointed out the benefits of swimming from the point of view of health and hygiene, from the point of view of the morale of youngsters and of teaching them independence. He stressed especially the facilities which we should provide for our champion swimmers and divers so that they may be able to compete with swimmers in other countries and, in turn, to invite foreign swimmers here. I am especially sympathetic towards this motion, but I cannot say that I would make the same case as Deputy Collins made, because, in my opinion, he placed far too much emphasis on the suggestion that we should or might provide such facilities for champion swimmers and divers.  My idea would be that, if we were to provide these facilities at all, the emphasis should not be placed on these people but that these facilities should be available for the broad masses of our people.  The main work, and indeed I might say the entire work, in that respect will fall on the local authorities, inasmuch as the demand for such facilities will not be the same in every area.  It will, therefore, be a local matter, and, consequently, is mainly a problem for the local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This seems to a large extent like a pious resolution.  I do not mean to be critical of the motion but it seems pious when one considers in present circumstances what the difficulties are, especially for the local authorities.  Even before they think about the cost at all, there are many matters to be considered. There is the question of the provision of the site; there is the question of the type of facilities which ought to be provided; and there is the question whether these facilities, when provided, will draw in sufficient income for their maintenance from year to year.  In the case of the city of Dublin particularly, there is the problem of whether there should be one central establishment for swimming and bathing, or whether it would be more desirable to establish smaller swimming pools and bathing-places in the different congested areas.  I have in <Col N="291" /> mind that, if these were to be provided in Dublin, it would be a matter of opinion whether, for instance, a swimming pool or bathing place should be established in Crumlin, Drimnagh, or whether there should be one central establishment to cater for the entire residents of the city.  These are the problems, possibly small problems, with which the local authority has to concern itself, but the big problem&mdash; as, no doubt, Deputies will appreciate &mdash;is the cost; and, I stress, in present circumstances.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lynch anticipated a point which I intend to make now.  Local authorities are, at the present time, engaged in such works of national importance as the building of houses for the working classes and the provision of water supplies and sewerage. Of necessity, there must be a list of priorities and I think every member of a local authority in the House will agree that the provision of swimming pools or any other type of bathing facility would not rank very high on the list of priorities.  In addition to the initial cost of the provision of these swimming pools, whether in the cities or in the smaller towns, especially in the inland towns, there is the question of the maintenance of such establishments. I have here some figures which go to show that in any place where such baths or pools exist, the expenditure is out of all proportion to the income derived from them.  I do not hold up Tara Street as an outstanding example because I must confess that I do not know a lot about that particular establishment.  I merely point out that the Tara Street Baths are a concern which it is not at all profitable for the Dublin Corporation to maintain.  I have some recent figures here.  I quote first of all the year 1940 in which, it would appear, the expenditure exceeded the income by some £3,000. In 1944, the expenditure exceeded the income by £8,650 and in 1946, the figure had jumped to nearly £10,000.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lynch mentioned the baths in Cork.  I should like it to be known that the cost of maintaining these baths also is out of all proportion to the income derived.  In 1937-38, the <Col N="292" /> excess of expenditure over income was in the region of £1,500.  Tullamore has often been quoted as a place in which there was local initiative by the urban council in the establishment of a swimming pool.  I think it was one of the first, or may I say one of the very few, established in the country.  While it might seem to Deputies that the Tullamore establishment was a very successful venture, it still presents a difficulty for the Urban Council there.  It is not at all a paying concern, even so far as ordinary maintenance is concerned, excluding the repayment of the loan charges.  In the year 1942-43 the excess of expenditure over income was £184. This loss may appear somewhat low but it is considerable when you realise that the valuation of the urban district is only something in the region of £12,000 and the maintenance of these swimming baths in Tullamore represents a rate of 3.6 pence in the £.</P>
    <P>I merely quote these figures to show that local authorities, apart from the capital cost involved in the establishment of such pools will have a further problem, a problem which, I am sure, they will be reluctant to face, especially, as I stated in the beginning, having regard to the difficulties in the provision of houses, water supplies and sewerage with the consequent charge on the rates.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Lynch who stated that some years back the former Minister for Local Government announced that a certain sum would be given to the Dublin Corporation and the Dún Laoghaire Borough Council, something in the region, I think he said, of a contribution of 60 per cent, towards the cost of providing swimming pools in these two areas.  It is true that the previous Minister did make this announcement but it is very funny, even though he did announce to the local authorities that he was prepared to give a grant of 60 per cent., that in the following year, when the Estimates were presented, there was not a penny provided for the making of a grant to the Corporations of Dublin or Dún Laoghaire.  To give Deputies an idea of the cost of such a project in the City of Dublin&mdash; Deputy Collins mentioned that there <Col N="293" /> had been a proposal to provide such facilities in Dublin&mdash;I think it is only right to remind the House that in 1943 the establishment of a centre for swimming and bathing would cost something in the region of £700,000.  Again, I think, considering their housing programme and the other important works of development which the Dublin Corporation have in hand, they might be reluctant to engage in a project which would involve them in such expenditure.  It was £700,000 in 1943 and I venture to say that the figure would be something in the region of over £1,000,000 now.  That would mean an increased charge on the rates of 3.6 pence in the £, and again I think the local authority would be reluctant to provide such facilities having regard to the cost.  Incidentally, I should like to say that there is a proposal from the corporation in this respect.  I am not in a position to say how far advanced it is at present but it will receive the sympathetic consideration of the Minister when the scheme has been fully examined.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lynch also mentioned that Dungarvan had provided an admirable swimming pool.  I have had an opportunity of seeing this swimming pool at Dungarvan.  Undoubtedly it is an advantage in the area and it is widely used by the residents of Dungarvan. I should like to remind the House that Dungarvan in that respect did show a certain amount of initiative which I think local authorities similarly circumstanced might be able to show in future.  I refer to the fact that Dungarvan found it possible to establish this swimming pool by way of a grant from the annual Special Employment Schemes Vote.  They did this work for a period, I think, of two years.  I would suggest to the House or to local authorities that this is one way by which it might be possible for them, if they so wish to provide swimming pools or bathing places in their particular areas.  Again I should like to remind Deputies who have a particular interest in swimming, diving and bathing that local authorities might be very reluctant to devote a Special Employment Schemes grant to work of this kind when it is considered <Col N="294" /> that the necessity exists for such things as the repair of footpaths and other works of general town improvement. It is not possible for me to say what State assistance might be forthcoming for proposals of this kind. So far as the Minister and I are concerned, I may say that any proposal from a local authority to establish such facilities will receive very sympathetic consideration.</P>
    <P>He realises, as every member of the House realises, that such facilities will be a decided advantage to the community generally&mdash;not so much in regard to the provision of another form of amusement but, as must occur to every member in the House, from the point of view that it will improve the health of the young people, and one might say, of all sections of the community. I do not want to appear too pessimistic but I think most members will agree with me when I say that the building of swimming pools or the establishment of bathing places is not urgent.  There is no use in thinking that because certain other cities in other countries have these facilities that we should have them in this country too.  It should be remembered that these facilities were, possibly, established before the war or during some other period when conditions were not as unfavourable as they are now.  I think the House will agree with me in that.  As long as local authorities build houses, provide water supplies and sewerage schemes, they will have a full programme for many years to come.</P>

      <P>I asked the Parliamentary Secretary for information which I have found it impossible to get.  I think the case made by the Parliamentary Secretary was a very bad one. I want to say, however, that I have very considerable sympathy with him. He may not believe that.  I should hate, myself, to be sent into the House by colleagues to make such a rotten case.  I cannot believe that the Parliamentary Secretary had his heart in it.  He said what he was told to say and realised himself that it was likely to be regarded as a very depressing pronouncement by everybody in this House, including the Deputies sitting <Col N="297" /> behind him.  I want, particularly, to contest the point of view which he put forward that there is no urgency for the provision here of facilities of this character.  I cannot understand in the least why there should have to be any list of priorities where there is no obvious conflict in the performance of such work.  The Housing Department of the Dublin Corporation will not, surely, be called upon to undertake the construction of swimming pools whether on the sea coast or indoor and, in any event, if there is a strain upon the resources of that Department of the Corporation&mdash;and I hope there is&mdash;the resources of the country are adequate enough to provide some additional engineers and supervisory staff to enable more work to be done.  As I understand it, the Dublin Corporation, the Dun Laoghaire Borough Council, and a number of other local authorities throughout the country are willing to undertake a proportion of the expense of providing swimming pools in their areas.  Most of them are reluctant to undertake the whole of the expense.  There was considerable pressure upon the Government for the granting of financial aid in the form of capital grant which the previous Government had received sympathetically and it resulted in a decision to make such assistance available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister is trying to build up an argument on that, I would point out that it would be quite impossible for any Minister or Government to come to the Dáil with an estimate for an unknown amount.  As the Parliamentary Secretary has very rightly pointed out, the cost of constructing swimming pools in Dublin or Dún Laoghaire could not be determined until the plans had been completed and approved.  What was done was that a token vote was submitted <Col N="298" /> to the Dáil in order to get from the Dáil approval of the principle of the provision of State funds for that purpose. I gather that they will not be made available for that purpose&mdash;that the Parliamentary Secretary's instructions are that the offer made by the previous Minister is withdrawn, at any rate, for the present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Anybody who listened to the Parliamentary Secretary must certainly have understood him to say that there will not be a capital grant and that, in fact, the Government would rather disapprove of local authorities undertaking works of this character when other schemes should be receiving their attention.  I would agree at once that if there was the slightest risk to them that the construction of houses, the repair of footpaths&mdash;which, I think, the Parliamentary Secretary mentioned&mdash;or the provision of public amenities of any kind for general use were to be impeded or delayed by the undertaking of work in connection with the construction of swimming pools, then he has a case.</P>
      <P>I do not think that may be so. Deputy Belton referred to the fact that the only respectable swimming-pool in the country at the present time was constructed in a very short period by private enterprise at Butlin's Holiday Camp.  Surely the energy and the organising ability that went into that work could be reproduced by local authorities or by voluntary associations interested in the development of swimming, assisted by local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I say, also, that I was not in the least impressed by the figures read by the Parliamentary Secretary concerning the difference between income and expenditure at Tara Street Baths or the Cork City Baths or at certain other places?  The objection to these places is that they are unsuitable for general public use.  They are not likely to attract the patronage which would ensure revenue likely to be equal to the expenditure.  I do not want to widen the scope of this debate beyond the particular form of sport mentioned in the motion, but if the speech made here by the Parliamentary Secretary indicates a general attitude to purely <Col N="299" /> cultural developments such as Deputy Collins and Deputy Belton had in mind in this motion, then the outlook for them is very bad indeed.</P>
    <P>The Government should give some positive indication of its desire to encourage local authorities and voluntary organisations to go ahead with this work.  If they do not think they can afford to give the 60 per cent. capital grant which the previous Minister for Local Government offered, even 10 per cent. or 20 per cent. capital grant would at least constitute a sign of definite and positive encouragement that would be worth something.  To speak in the purely negative way in which the Parliamentary Secretary has spoken&mdash;in which, no doubt, he was instructed to speak&mdash;indicates an approach which is contrary to that which we think the Dáil would like to see.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I would urge upon the Parliamentary Secretary that he should go back to his Minister and to the Government and ask them to reconsider their whole attitude to this matter. I think that the amount of money which the Government would be likely to be called upon to provide this year or next year because of a more positive policy would not amount to very much but, whatever the amount, I think the Government can assume there will be no opposition in the Dáil to its provision and, in so far as it may involve any additional charge upon the people, I think the people would very gladly accept it.</P>

I and other members of the Fianna Fáil Party had been agitating for the provision of swimming pools in built-up areas.

It is very petty on the part of the present Government to say that priority must be given to housing. Are they going to leave the residents of Drimnagh and Crumlin without bathing facilities?  They should go ahead with the plan that had been mooted by the Dublin Corporation and implement the promise made by the former Minister for Local Government to subsidise it.

We want to bring these facilities to their door in the built-up areas.  The records of the House will show that I have repeatedly spoken on <Col N="301" /> this matter.  I would appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to ask his Government to reconsider this matter. These facilities are essential to the health of the people.  If these facilities are provided, it will give the Amateur Swimming Association an opportunity to produce swimmers who can compete in international events.  There are several swimming pools in built-up areas in English and Continental cities. We should take an honest view of this matter and stop this small talk about priorities.  The Dublin Corporation have acquired two sites in Crumlin and Drimnagh.  I regard this matter as of public importance.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary took pleasure in deliberately distorting what I said.  He seemed to imply that I stood up here to advocate the case on the basis of the Irish Amateur Swimming Association.  I should like to disabuse his mind of that and tell him what I did say&mdash;that it would not be difficult to satisfy the essential needs of the Amateur Swimming Association in places such as Dublin, Galway, Cork and Limerick where you have a big population and where a swimming pool could be used in many ways other than for purely competitive training.  But I did say that every local authority, every county council <Col N="302" /> and every corporation should be made to envisage a swimming pool and swimming facilities in every scheme they have for built-up areas or for the development of built-up areas as they at present exist.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lynch took up the point that I inadvertently missed in moving my motion.  Life-saving could be readily and simply taught even to the most inefficient swimmer.  You do not want to be a proficient exponent of the crawl or any competitive type of swimming to be made an efficient and effective unit in the saving of life around our coast or on our rivers.  But a miserable, niggardly, narrow conception both in mind and outlook on this problem, which says that this is a matter that should be on the priority list, is something that I refuse to stomach. The sooner we realise in this country that when we are dealing with the planning and development of areas swimming pools and swimming facilities for the people are as essential as any of the other services that have to be supplied the better for ourselves, and when comprehensive schemes are contemplated the Parliamentary Secretary or his engineers or all his Departments need not try to put across me flamboyant and exaggerated ideas of expense.</P>
    <P>In seconding this motion, Deputy Belton spoke of the swimming pool in Butlin's holiday camp at Mosney.  I have said many hard things about that camp, but I will say that for £2,000 there was provided in that camp an outdoor swimming pool the like of which is not to be seen anywhere in this country.  Where there is a water supply available or any kind of a reasonable seashore, the local authorities with little expense could provide reasonable and adequate swimming facilities.  Talking astronomically of millions made Deputy Belton smile.  As a builder, he turned to me and said: &ldquo;If they gave me a million quid I would give them a national stadium for every game that could be played.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I urge on the Parliamentary Secretary and on the Government that the finding of one gleam of virtue in a decaying Fianna Fáil system, finding one gleam of hope is something that they <Col N="303" /> should cling on to.  No matter what Deputy MacEntee's failings might have been, and I am one who considered them manifold, whether great credit is to go to him or not, at least we should stick to his idea of trying to encourage local authorities to develop swimming pools and swimming facilities by making available a 60 per cent. grant, and more if possible, in order to encourage the provision of these facilities. If there is no more hope to be held out for the future of swimming in this country than that held out by the Parliamentary Secretary, I say that he is going to have many a thorny argument with me on every opportunity that I get on this subject, because I think the Government are failing in their national responsibility if they do not realise the necessity for the immediate encouragement of local authorities to provide these facilities in order to ensure a better standard of health, a better spirit in our young people, and above all, the courage that will obviate loss of life by drowning.</P>

    <P>Remember, I asked the Minister if he could be more precise about the date when the announcement would be made because I got the same reply from the Minister last November and the Garda Síochána, as I have said in my question, are bearing untold hardships. In November, 1946, they got their last increase in pay, two years and four months ago, and during those two years the cost of living was rapidly rising.  The cost of clothing for their children and of foodstuffs was just as much for them as for the people who were getting more than one increase a year since 1946.  Some got two and three increases.</P>
    <P>If the Garda were a stronger body, if they were eligible to be members of a trade union and took up the attitude that they could embarrass the public or embarrass their employers, then the trade union leaders would bring very forcibly to the notice of the employers the grievance of the men.  But their case was not taken up forcibly by a well-organised body though the Guards have a representative body of splendid men who are used to discipline, who have kept discipline in the Guards for many years.  I think that the Government and the Minister have been told that the Guards were getting uneasy. There have been very many resignations of younger men who know that there is no prospect of getting a decent livelihood in the Guards.</P>

      <P>How many?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know the number but if the numbers who threatened <Col N="305" /> to resign are small we should be told that there is no reason for alarm.  That is no reason, however, why the worst paid body of men in the country should not get an immediate increase.</P>
      <P>Another member asked a question and I found that in reply it was stated that other State employees got an increase on the 29th of last May to meet the increase in the cost of living.  The Labour Court's award of 11/- was made last February while this other body of State employees got their increase last May&mdash;not too long I agree.  I do not know what Department they belong to. Why is it necessary to bring over the Garda Force from February of last year and then give increase to other employees in May?  Why pass over the Guards and tell them that they will get 11/- from the 1st January this year? That is the statement which I protest against and which I understand the Guards and their representative body have expressed dissatisfaction at.  I thought the Government, in its graciousness to a loyal body of splendid workers, would at least go back to February, 1948 and not February or January of 1949.</P>
      <P>The 11/- was never accepted, but suppose it was, if they were to get 12 months' back pay it would be some consolation to the Guards' wives and families who in November thought they were going to get an increase with a substantial Christmas box.  I told the Guards in early December that they were getting their increase in pay and a Christmas box.  It was a big blow when Christmas came and when some of the Guards with very large families were left without the beautiful substantial Christmas repast that most people have.  As a result of their disappointment they had to do without the Christmas fare that was on the table of nearly every workingman in Dublin City.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider the fact that it is almost two-and-a-half years since the Guards got an increase, but I want to say one thing for the Minister.  I have spoken to those Guards who approached me, men with large families and long years of service, and told them that I was aware <Col N="306" /> that the Minister's heart was entirely for them.  I told them that his heart was in the pressure he was putting on to get the money but that he had got a disappointment and could not get the money with which he had hoped to fulfil his promise to the Guards.  There are other things in the country that I think might wait so that the Guards could get that little increase which was promised to them and for which they have waited so patiently.  All other organised bodies have in 1946, 1947 or 1948 been able to get an increase in wages&mdash;most of them through the pressure of trade unions.  There is something to be said, therefore, for well-organised bodies and representatives of labour in being able to fight the cause of the men but we should not in this House take advantage of the fact that these men are not allowed to be in trade unions.  They should be treated according to merit and equally as well as those who are in a position to embarrass their employers and the public.  If it were transport or anything else that could cause a hold-up, I guarantee that an immediate effort would be made to meet the reasonable requests of those who were suffering hardships.</P>
    <P>I have said almost more than I intended.  I had not intended to say much because I believe I am pushing an open door when I am speaking to the Minister for Justice.  I believe that his heart is in this affair and that he is as anxious as I am about them, if not more anxious, because he knows the loyalty of these men, how easy it would be to create uneasiness and of the threat of the resignation of most of the younger men.  The older men cannot give up because they are near the pension period.</P>
    <P>Any organised group of labourers in this city has better pay than a ten-year member of the Guards and that is not right when they are encouraged across the water.  If a man can resign from the Guards in this country, get a ticket to England and get into the English police, he will get better wages.</P>
    <P>I earnestly hope the Government will see that the threat of resignations will be brought to an end by satisfying the Guards and showing them that we have <Col N="307" /> an interest in them, that we wish to show our thanks to them in a practical way for the work they have done in the past and so enable them to meet the rapidly increasing cost of living. We know how discontent can be created when they see organised bodies of workers, with representatives in this House, getting decent increases in their wages because of the fact that they can cause embarrassment to their employers.  While that is so, our decent and loyal members of the Garda Síochána have to wait until the Minister can succeed, by putting pressure on the Government, in getting money. I know it is hard to get money.  The Minister might be able to ease the whole situation if he were to make a statement, but that might be disloyal to his colleagues.  He might be able to say that the money that we need to give the Guards, to the teachers and to the pensioned teachers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am not a carping critic, but I do earnestly appeal to the Minister to keep up his pressure in the hope that, at an early date, he will be in a position to tell us that the Guards will get their pay, and that it will be made retrospective from the date of the Labour Court award in February, 1948.</P>

      <P>I wish to support the plea that has been made by Deputy Byrne, that the case of the Guards should get consideration immediately. I do so because it has been brought to my notice that a number of our young <Col N="309" /> Guards, after being trained, are leaving the force.  I am also aware that a number of the Guards are very badly paid.  We all know that, even during the last 12 months, the cost of living has gone up considerably.  Deputy Byrne made a very fine case for the Guards, but he is part and parcel of the Government that is responsible for keeping the Guards in the depressed condition they are in at present.</P>
      <P>If we want to have the country properly governed and properly ruled, and if we want to encourage a decent type of man to join the force we should pay those men and look after them properly.  We should not leave them in the position in which they will be anxious to leave the police force of their own country and seek employment elsewhere.  We have the position that the Guards have been told that if they go on strike or make any public protest, disciplinary action will be taken against them, or at least such has been implied.  I realise that the Minister possibly is sympathetic towards the Guards, and that he has to get the money, I suppose from the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>The Guards, who are the parties concerned in this, know that they have somebody as Minister for Justice who is very anxious to assist them in every possible way. Everybody knows that.  They are a body of men who have served this country faithfully and well in difficult circumstances.  It is true that Deputy Alfred Byrne has always been one of their champions, though I do not know that he was too happy when he found Deputy Burke so enthusiastically supporting him.  I regret, Sir, that a former Minister of this State saw fit to leave the House.  I am not going to dwell on that, but the Civic Guards deserve well of any Government that this country will ever produce and, in so far as I can assist them, I shall do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Byrne has put down many questions within the last 12 months.  I may have been a little bit optimistic at times.  It is true that before Christmas he had a question down and, as I thought, unofficially he put a question to me from one side of the House to the other.  He asked was there a chance of a Christmas box, and I said I thought so.  Alfie put an interpretation on that which I thought was also a little bit optimistic, and I regret what I said to him in an aside.  He conveyed that to the Gardaí as if it were an official declaration.  It was not, but it was an indication of my sympathy and my intentions as far as I was able <Col N="311" /> towards the Gardaí.  It is just as well to clarify that position.</P>
    <P>I have informed the representative body of a decision that could be given now, and that is that they would be paid 11/- as from the 1st of January this year.  I do not think that that is sufficient, but if the issue is forced I can give that decision now.  But that would do more harm than good, because that would be a final decision. When the question was put to me to-day I said that I hoped to be in a position to make an announcement at an early date.  I was trying to postpone a positive decision and I appealed to Deputy Byrne not to force the issue at this stage because it would be easy to force a &ldquo;No.&rdquo; A &ldquo;No&rdquo; can be easily said, and then it is very hard to say &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; I could say &ldquo;No&rdquo; without the slightest hesitation, but that would not be what I would like to do, nor is it what I think the Government would like to do.  Therefore, <Col N="312" /> I was not in a position to say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo;, and I think, even with the best intentions in the world, Deputy Byrne has not helped me in the object I have in view.</P>
    <P>Pending the advocacy that I hope to put forward, if I might use that term, with the Government, on behalf of the Civic Guards, I appeal to Deputies to see that this matter will be left to me. If I fail, then indeed you can pillory me and I shall have to take up an attitude of defence, but I am doing everything I can because the Civic Guards deserve well of the people of this country.  As far as I am concerned as a Minister, their interests always will be my interests because my interests are the interests of the State which they have served so faithfully. That is all I can say now.</P>
