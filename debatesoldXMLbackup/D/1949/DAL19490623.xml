      <P>In examining whether an applicant for unemployment assistance satisfies the statutory condition which requires him to be genuinely seeking employment suitable for him the courts of referees have regard to all the material facts of the case including such matters as age, physique, education, normal occupation, place of residence, family circumstances, opportunities of employment, and personal efforts made to obtain employment. Each case is considered separately and sympathetically by the court of referees and the applicant is given every assistance in presenting all the circumstances of his case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcCann" hpid="Mr. McCann Mr. McCann">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCann</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that during recent months there have been numbers of men cut off unemployment assistance in the City of Dublin? Actually, in the city at the moment there are not, and during the past few months there have not been, opportunities of employment for those men.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>How can an unemployed man give any proof of seeking work to the officers?  The person he seeks work from will not give him a letter to say that he is seeking work and that he cannot employ him.  We have numbers of letters saying that they cannot prove that they are looking for work.  I think Deputy Lehane has the same experience.  There seems to be harsh treatment under that heading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I explain to the Deputies concerned that these cases are dealt with by a court of referees which consists of representatives of the employers and representatives of the workers, with an independent chairman, a man who stands apart from both and endeavours to hold the scales evenly as between the viewpoint of the employers and the viewpoint of the workers' representatives?  That court is not interfered with in any way by the Department.  It has complete and absolute jurisdiction in the matter of determining whether an applicant is or is not genuinely seeking work.</P>
      <P>In order to give Deputies a picture of the real position, and so that they may not be carried away by any extravagant statements made on this matter, it might be well if I were to give them some information.  In the year ended 31st March, 1949, 3,176 cases of this type were considered by the Dublin Court of Referees and disallowance was recommended in 221 cases only during that period.  That does not bear out the allegations which have been made.  As I say, the final discretion in this matter rests absolutely with the court of referees. That court has full power to allow the claims and full power to disallow the claims.  However, even after that, there is still an appeal to the umpire if a representative of the insured worker desires that there should be an appeal to the umpire who, again, is a statutory officer subject to no departmental control whatever.</P>

      <P>As I explained to Deputy McCann in answer to his original question, each case is considered separately and sympathetically by the court of referees and the applicant is given every assistance in presenting all the circumstances of his case.  In other words, the court of referees has full power to say whether it is satisfied that the applicant is genuinely seeking work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say to the Deputy that the production of a document is deprecated by the court because it establishes nothing?  The absence or presence of documents does not enter into the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>Why do they put the onus of proof of that nature on the applicant, the person who appeals to the court?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no obligation on the applicant to prove that he cannot get work.  He goes to the court, and tells of his efforts to get work. The court have regard to the factors to which I have just adverted and then a sensible person &mdash; the chairman &mdash; I do not know whether it is any use to Deputy Lehane to say that in this case the chairman is a lawyer &mdash; comes down one way or the other, in favour of the applicant or against the applicant. He has complete authority to come down on either side.  I take it he is influenced in the long run by what the facts are, having regard to all these factors.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcCann" hpid="Mr. McCann Mr. McCann">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCann</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if, having regard to his recent statement that there is a surplus of milk being supplied to Dublin <Col N="1233" /> City, he is prepared to introduce proposals for legislation to subsidise the retail price of milk in cities and towns, so that the poor and lower wage-earning groups can buy milk in sufficient quantity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon) James M. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon)</NameTxt>
      <P>The increase in milk production which has taken place this year has, as the Deputy says, resulted in the very gratifying situation in which there is a superabundant supply for the city's milk requirements.  Doubtless, the chronic conditions of shortage which obtained during the last 15 years discouraged the then Administration from considering the public spirited proposal now brought forward by the Deputy, and, accordingly, the occasion for dealing with it arises now for the first time.  In principle, any device designed to lower the cost of essential foodstuffs is entitled to most favourable consideration, and if the Deputy would indicate what amount of subsidy he has in mind, his proposal can be examined realistically.  In the meantime, he will be gratified to know that while the retail price of milk last year was 3½d. per pint in May and June and 4d. per pint from July to September, this year the retail price will be 3½d. per pint throughout the corresponding period.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that the annual retail sales of milk in cities and towns in Ireland amount to 50,000,000 gallons, so that each penny of subsidy on the lines suggested by the Deputy may be estimated to cost £1,700,000 per annum, and this will, of course, engage the Deputy's attention when formulating the precise proposal he has in mind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice whether he is aware that under sub-section (2) (g) of Section 11 of the Rent Restrictions Act, 1946, a serious abuse is growing up, as under this section a landlord can now spend money substantially in excess of normal repair requirements and thereby bring about an unreasonable increase in rent which, if unchecked, will defeat all rent restrictions; and, if so, whether he is prepared to consider introducing proposals for amending legislation to deal with this abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1236" />
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that in certain cases landlords have been able to avail themselves of the provisions of sub-section (2) (g) of Section 11 of the Rent Restrictions Act, 1946, to bring about disproportionate increases in the rents of their tenants. A similar provision was a feature of the 1923 Rent Act, and, so far as is known, did not lead to any abuses. How far the new situation may be due, on the one hand, to any inherent defect in the provisions in question or to the manner in which these provisions have been construed and applied by the courts or, on the other hand, to the failure or neglect of tenants to exercise the right conferred on them by sub-section (5) of Section 20 of the Act to challenge in the appropriate court the increase of rent when demanded by the landlord is a question upon which I do not feel warranted in expressing an opinion without further inquiry.  The matter is a difficult and complex one, and is receiving urgent and careful consideration.</P>
      <P>If it be true that abuses of the kind suggested have recently arisen (and I am bound to say that there is some evidence that this is the case), I think it right to put all concerned on notice that I shall not hesitate to ask the Government to authorise legislation, if needs be of a retrospective character, rather than allow the rent restrictions code to be reduced to a futility by the existence of a state of the law which permitted increases of rents out of all proportion to existing rents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, I take it, is aware of three cases which were before the courts recently.  Is he aware that in the case of Stephens v. Carroll where, as a result of the Dublin Corporation making a demand that certain repairs be carried out, which they estimated would cost £250, the landlord, over the head of the corporation and of the tenant, expended £1,250 on the house?  When the case came into court the judge held that under the Act he had no alternative but to permit an increase of the rent from £55 10s. 0d. to £245. There are two other similar cases of <Col N="1237" /> which I am sure the Minister is aware. The answer which the Minister has given meets the case in a satisfactory way.  I would be glad if the Minister would take the earliest opportunity to make it publicly known that, if he is satisfied that abuses are taking place, not only will he introduce amending legislation soon to deal with them, but that he will make such legislation retrospective in its effect.  I do not know whether the Minister is aware that, now that the precedent has been established in three cases in the law courts, this matter is taking on very widespread proportions and will affect numerous tenants in our areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know the names of the cases, but I am aware of cases in which the landlord failed to carry out any repairs to a house for a certain number of years.  He then carried out all the repairs at one set time, which involved very big expenditure. That enabled him to qualify under the section that has been referred to.  In the case, however, of the good landlord who does a certain amount of repairs each year he does not qualify.  Therefore, the person who is a good landlord is being penalised whereas the person who is a bad one gets off.  I am having the matter examined and if the facts are established as they appear to be&mdash;again, I am not to be taken as judging&mdash;but if they are established I will not hesitate to ask for further legislation, even of a retrospective nature, so that this matter can be dealt with.</P>

      <P>Though the matter to which the Deputy refers is not one in which the Minister for Industry and Commerce has any function, inquiries regarding it have been made from Córas Iompair Éireann.  I understand that there is an arrangement of long standing with a cinema organisation under which that organisation takes week by week substantial space in buses for advertising places of entertainment and the arrangement provides that space in the buses in which the organisation is advertising will not be allotted at the same time for advertising matter relating to other comparable forms of entertainment.  About two months ago application was made for space to advertise an entertainment in buses but it is understood that under the arrangement to which I have referred this application had to be refused.  I propose to ask Córas Iompair Éireann to examine this arrangement again and to consider the justification for its continuance.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that when vacancies arose for control officers, permanent and temporary, under his Department a number of sergeant pilots now on reserve applied for these posts and were interviewed; that they were fully qualified with five years' experience of control operations and were conversant with international air legislation; whether it is a fact that although their commanding officer testified that they were capable of filling those positions the vacancies were filled a few months ago by other men while Irish Army pilots are still unemployed; finally, if the Minister will state if any of these posts are filled by ex-members of the Royal Air Force.</P>

      <P>Vacancies for air traffic control officers in my Department are normally filled through competitions conducted by the Civil Service Commissioners.  Appointments from these competitions are made by me on recommendations made by the commissioners.</P>
      <P>An open competition for permanent and temporary posts of air traffic control officer grade III, was held by the commissioners in the period from 27th January, 1948, to 10th February, 1948, under regulations announced on the 15th October, 1947.  In this competition extra marks were given to candidates with approved service in the Defence Forces.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will, I am sure, agree that it does not follow that, because a voluntary organisation such as the N.A.C.A.

      <P>In paragraph (d) (ii), line 14, to delete the words &ldquo;five hundred&rdquo; and substitute therefor the words &ldquo;five thousand&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am not particularly enamoured with this amendment.  It is merely an effort to get the Minister to abate the nuisance which will be caused by the present Section 12 imposing stamp duty on dances in all areas, which include any town or small urban area with a population of 500 and upwards. We had a debate last evening as to the reasonableness of the proposition of raising money by taxing dances.  The Dáil has decided that there will be a tax on dances.  Because that is so, I would like to get the Minister to restrict the tax, as this amendment says, to towns and urban areas and to districts around such towns and urban areas with a population of 5,000 and upwards.  The Minister's proposal to collect a tax on dances in every town, small urban area and district within three miles of such town will cover the most of the country.  The collection of such a tax will have all the social disadvantages outlined last night.  I trust, therefore, that the Minister will accept this amendment.  Perhaps on the Report Stage he will go somewhat further.</P>

      <P>With regard to this three-mile limit, what will be the position of an urban area like Dundalk which has extended its boundaries? Will the three miles be from the boundary of the town or will they be from some point within the town?  Three miles is not going to be of much use. If this is put into operation as it stands, places of amusement outside these towns, which have been built by local initiative and not really for commercial gain, will come under this tax. I suggest to the Minister that the three-mile limit should be similar to that which obtains in the case of the licensing laws.  It should be from the that which obtains in the case of the licensing laws.  It should be from the centre of the town and not from the boundary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that most small towns have a population of over 500 and up to 1,000.  Most of them have fairly well-equipped cinemas which were built by the local people clubbing together in order to provide amusement for the particular area. That population will now be curbed by the three-mile limit.  In the past the cinemas have found it difficult to carry on; if they are brought in under this Bill they will not be able to exist at all.  I think one way out of the difficulty would be to extend the three-mile limit, but I feel that might not meet the case.  Perhaps the Minister would consider giving tax exemptions up to populations of 1,000.  When a population goes beyond the 1,000 mark I think they should be able to stand on their own.  A number of small towns at present have to compete with tax-free travelling shows.  I think he should consider that.</P>

      <P>Immediately it seems to me that we come back to the point on which I spoke on the last section.  This is going to involve a certain amount of administrative perplexity in dealing with this whole problem and I can see that unless this thing is defined legally in some particular way, it is wide open for objections in court.  The Minister has answered my question and possibly from the administrative angle, the Minister's answer is as good a practical solution of the problem as any other, but has the Minister considered it from this angle: a revenue inspector comes along and he finds a dance being held at a house or in some hall that is three miles just plus from the arbitrary point which the Minister has chosen as the centre point from which to measure, but the post-office will probably be in the middle of the street and, measured from that particular point, the house may be inside the three-mile limit?  I should like to know what would be the result of an appeal to the court in that instance.  I see Deputy Sweetman smiling and I am sure Deputy Sweetman and many other solicitors would very quickly seize on that point.</P>

      <P>This is a separate type of legislation.  It is a distinct type of case which may lead to litigation. If the Minister is going to put through this provision, let us at least see that it is workable and watertight.  Deputy Sweetman's mention of the Intoxicating Liquor Acts does remind me that our text-books in regard to the District Courts&mdash; O'Connor and others&mdash;are very full of cases resulting out of that three-mile limit.  I think legislation that even remotely leads to that type of prosecution is bad.  We talked a good deal about this provision last night and I am not going to go over all that now, but if there ever was a code of law that led to evasion, in which otherwise respectable citizens indulged and that could hardly be commended here or elsewhere, it was the licensing laws, particularly the licensing laws relating to the three-mile limit.  This further complexity supplies a further objection to the method of collecting this tax.  As I said last night, even conceding the source, admitting it is a proper tax, that it is a tax on nonessentials rather than on essentials, conceding every point the Minister made, still I am of opinion that it is not the best type of tax having regard to the method by which it has to be collected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We talk about wanting to encourage life in the rural areas.  Undoubtedly one of the problems of the present time is to afford in rural areas the same degree of entertainment, the same interest in life, that the bigger centres of population seem to hold for young people at the critical age at which they emigrate.  If we want to keep them in the rural areas that problem has to be faced and this is helpful.  How far it is harmful, I cannot say.  I do not subscribe to anything that might be an exaggeration in that regard but in so far as it may be harmful, I think exemptions for centres of merely a population of 500 is not sufficient.  With the <Col N="1250" /> modern trend we may have to accept the fact that it is in the sizable towns we may have to concentrate our efforts with regard to supplying amenities which are designed to keep our people in the rural areas to offset the drift which seems to be almost inevitable to the big centres like Dublin and Cork. From that point of view it is undesirable to group a town like Dungarvan in the same category as say a county or other borough.  That, as I see it, would be the effect of the section.  I think the amendment before the House therefore should be accepted.  I also see that if it is accepted it is going to go further to nullify the return of the Minister from this tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to point out to the House how farcical this provision with regard to a population of under 500 is.  It will operate as a &ldquo;kill-joy&rdquo; in rural Ireland.  I strongly object to this red-herring being dragged across the trail, trying to say that rural Ireland would be exempt from this tax. Garristown, which is a small parish in the north-west of the county, might be exempt, but take Lucan, another rural area nine miles from Dublin.  Blanchardstown, Clondalkin and Tallaght, are all rural areas.  You cannot say they belong to the City of Dublin. They belong to the rural portion of the County Dublin.  When the Minister says that clubs in rural Ireland can run dances tax free he is totally wrong. Unless the Minister accepts Deputy Aiken's amendment there will be very few areas exempt.  I urge the Minister to accept the amendment unless he wants to kill all amusement in the parish halls in the rural parts of my constituency.  The various clubs and charitable organisations referred to last night are going to come under the lash again, because the Minister refused last night to exempt charitable organisations. They cannot carry on their welfare work in the areas I have referred to and they cannot carry on in the adjacent areas because there are no halls, except some sheds that you could not call halls.</P>
      <P>In rural Ireland the towns are the centre of attraction for people living within two or three miles of them.  A parish in a rural district extends all round for two or three miles.  But because people live in rural Ireland they are going to be penalised.  This provision with regard to a population of under 500 will not meet the situation at all.  I have given the Minister examples from my own constituency and I hope he will increase the 500 to 5,000.  Deputy Aiken's amendment is a very fair and reasonable one and would enable the people in rural Ireland to carry on their amusements without being subject to visits from inspectors.  Apparently the Minister wants to kill any little pleasure they have in the countryside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to Deputy Burke, I felt that I was agreeing with <Col N="1253" /> him when he said that the section was totally wrong.  When he wanted to increase the 500 to 5,000 I totally disagreed because of the great injustice that can be done to the people engaged in this type of business.  This section is put in here to protect people who always broke the law.  During the discussion last night it was admitted that in these rural areas clubs run dances and do not pay the tax.  The Minister put in this section to make sure that the Revenue Commissioners will collect the tax from the people who run professional ballrooms and big cinemas and to give protection to the people who broke the law.  What I cannot understand is why the Opposition were so dead against this last night and now want to increase the number to 5,000, because if an area is built up to 5,000 it will be very hard to prevent those who have picture houses or ballrooms in the bigger areas closing these down, setting them as cowsheds, proceeding out to areas with a population of 5,000 and taking over hay barns and converting them into picture houses and ballrooms. Deputy Burke said that in some of these places the buildings are hardly fit to be called halls.  If the section goes through and the population increases in the course of a year or so, the people who have inclinations of that kind will take over these halls and convert them into suitable places which will be an added attraction to the district and that will wipe out any incentive to do business in the larger places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that this section is imposing a great injustice on certain sections of the people, especially the owners of ballrooms.  There are a couple of very big centres which the Minister may not be aware of.  Otherwise he would probably have brought in a clause to protect the people who have invested their money in ballrooms in and around the city, especially the Irish Holiday Camp in Skerries and the ballroom in Malahide.  At the present time the general tendency in the City of Dublin is to organise parties to go out to Mosney holiday <Col N="1254" /> village.  It is an extraordinary state of affairs if that syndicate at Mosney is to be exempt from entertainment tax. There is a completely 100 per cent. Irish staff in Skerries and yet they are to be taxed.  I think the Minister should have taken notice of that particular body at Mosney and had some clause to cover places such as that.  I do not agree with this tax.  If the Minister makes any addition I will still ask him to wipe it out altogether.  I think he is only playing into the hands of the people who evaded the tax before.  He is encouraging others to break the law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to put another aspect of the section to the Minister, completely neutrally. Deputy Fitzpatrick seems to suggest that the effect of this section will be to drive people who want to hold dances into these rural areas.  These will be just the areas where there will be least provision.  When transport was available before the war it was a matter of some public interest that certain people interested in the morals of the community were talking about the dangers of people running out of their own areas into other areas with the aid of motor cars.  This seems to suggest that in this case that might be a profitable thing to do in the future.  I think the amendment which has been proposed, to take in a bigger centre of population, would therefore be desirable.  That amendment would at least remove the temptation of rushing out to the rural areas where there is less control.  I merely put that matter to the Minister in case it has not occurred to him already.  It has simply come into my mind as a result of what Deputy Fitzpatrick has suggested. The best way would be to take in a bigger centre of population and would probably do a lot to offset any point that there is in that.</P>

      <P>I would suggest that the Minister take a look at some of the towns which come under this 500 population.  There are many places under 1,000 population where the actual village or town is very small, but because of the way the area is divided, quite a considerable rural area&mdash;in the proper sense of the word rural&mdash;outside the village or town is brought in.  The population is swollen as a result.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, Raphoe is a very small place.  The population is 736, I think, and yet the village itself is very small.  I do not like arguing but you do get a type of township such as that with which the Minister is familiar, Stranorlar and Ballybofey&mdash;two towns that are practically one.  The cinema happens to be built in the larger of the two places and the result is that the tax will apply because the population there is over 700.  If it had been built where it might easily have been, on the other side of the bridge, it would then be in Stranorlar which, if taken separately, has a population of only 460 odd.  No tax would apply although the very same people would be attending the cinema.  It is purely a matter of where it is built.  I would suggest that there are many small towns which are affected in the way I have mentioned by reason of a country district having been taken in for the purpose of determining the population. I suggest that the Minister should consider increasing this figure to 1,000. It would be a terrible thing to see the cinema wiped out.  It takes these small cinema owners all their time to keep going.  I wonder if the Minister has figures to show how many cinemas there are in towns under 500 and how many in towns between a population of 500 and 1,000.  I think the Minister will find that most of them would be in places of a population of over 500. When you get below 500 it is more a village hall rather than a proper cinema.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter really arose last year when the suggestion <Col N="1256" /> was made that I should pay some attention in a sympathetic way to the conditions of life in the isolated areas of the country.  A plea was made for the very small centre of population where the people have not very much in the way of amusement in their lives; where they have either the travelling cinema or the small hall where somebody, either for commercial or for charitable purposes, puts on a show now and again.  There are very few travelling showmen; in the main, it is cinemas or dance halls.  I bore that in mind and, looking at it this year, the standard taken up was a population of 500 or not over 500.  If I were to go to the 1,000 mark I would get well beyond the standard that I was asked to consider last year.  If I were to go to 5,000 the matter would immediately become ludicrous.</P>
      <P>Deputy Burke is very much concerned with the rural areas and he is all out for the amendment for 5,000. The town of Monaghan would be brought in under this.  Surely the Deputy is not so remote from things to consider that Monaghan town is a rural area.  Carrick-on-Suir, New Ross and Nenagh would be brought in for exemption, and so on down the list.  It is clear that this is only a subterfuge for the Deputies who are so enthusiastic to get a way of relieving entertainment of tax.  I can understand their attitude in that.  It is well known that, on repentance, the degree of virtue sometimes becomes nauseating.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Taking the matter of 500 population and the exemption from all entertainment duty, Deputies have to remember that as far as cinemas are concerned, they increased the tax at one time by 60 per cent. and then they doubled that.  That was their attitude towards entertainment in rural areas and elsewhere.  I think I am meeting in a perfectly good way the suggestion which was made last year.  There was a considerable number of appeals from both sides of the House to the effect that, where a small population was dependent on the kind of amusement they could get in their community life or by associating with <Col N="1257" /> one another, that should be relieved. It has come to it now that these areas of a population of 500 or less will be completely exempt from any form of tax in connection with entertainment.</P>
      <P>As regards minor points, Deputy de Valera urged that this was a complicated section and referred to the amount of space that it occupied on the Order Paper.  I ask him, as a matter of interest, to compare it with the amount of space taken by the new piece of legislation which gives a remission of 6d. in the income-tax.  I think he will find that both occupy about the same space.  I see nothing in the way of complication about this. There is a definition under four separate headings as to where the exemption is to apply.  With regard to the area, we are leaving that with some elasticity in it.  If there is going to be any modification of it, it will be modified for the benefit of the exemption and not against it.  If any difficulty should arise we can bring in a more precise definition later.  I do not think there is going to be any difficulty. It will depend on how it is administered.  I should imagine the possibility of a certain amount of resort to the courts if the administration operates on the wrong lines.  There will be none if it operates on the right lines.  If the courts want to have their say we will let them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the boundaries Deputy de Valera brought in the comparison of the licensing laws.  He cannot have much experience of the licensing laws because there has been very little trouble in the courts with regard to the measurement of boundaries. There has been on quite a number of other things but not on that matter.  If this works out as easily as that, I will be quite satisfied.  Deputy Fitzpatrick gave as a counter to Deputy Burke, the matter which I say was so insincerely spoken of last night.  There was a great deal of stress laid on the evasion that was practised.  No doubt the more isolated and the more remote an area is the greater the possibility there is of evasion.  It is partly in an effort to reduce that that this has been attended to.  The main objective is to add to the amenities of rural Ireland, <Col N="1258" /> but there is the background of the other matters.  Deputy Fitzpatrick was right.  Was there any sincerity in the discussion we had last night when it was stressed that there was evasion? If so this tax is going to meet that. Deputies should therefore be in favour of it or be against the whole section if there is any sincerity in them.</P>

      <P>There is only one small point that I want to bring to the notice of the Minister.  The Towns Improvement (Ireland) Act, 1854, applies, I think, to the town of Granard in the County Longford. They have a town commissioner there. The three-mile limit in regard to that town would hit certain rural halls within the three miles.  I would ask the Minister if it is possible to reduce the limit of three miles in respect of small towns like Granard.</P>

I do not want to take the line that the Minister is not doing considerable good.  He is doing a considerable amount of good and is benefiting a big number of people in these rural areas.

What he has done, of course, is to raise the contribution from everybody in the State from £21 14s. 0d. per head to £24 7s. 0d. per head, although, at the same time he had promised to reduce it to £18 7s. 0d.

    <P>The Minister is going to force charitable organisations that want an exemption from tax in these small areas, either to reduce on paper the expenses incurred in running a function or to increase on paper the receipts they had obtained.  I do not think that is good.  I do not think the game is worth the candle for the <Col N="1260" /> sum involved.  If we had an investigation of the yield on dances and Céilis in the past, we would find that a very large percentage of it, practically the whole of it, came from towns with a population of 5,000 and upwards and it was a mere bagatelle what came from smaller centres with a population of 500, and rural districts.  If the Minister would consider the suggestion in relation to dances&mdash;if we cannot get him to go somewhat further&mdash;that he would abolish this particular tax in the case of these smaller towns&mdash;in fact, they are really only villages&mdash;and in the areas adjoining, there would be some feeling of relief.  If he did that he certainly would decrease the temptation to a very large number of people all over the country to arrange their accounts in such a way as to obtain an exemption when they are not, in fact, according to the law, entitled to an exemption.</P>

      <P>To come back again to this question of the boundary, the Minister has given an undertaking that that provision will be construed beneficially.  All the Minister can do is to give an instruction to the Revenue Commissioners, in so far as he is competent to do that.</P>

      <P>The position is that the Revenue Commissioners, a statutory body, will have to construe this legally as best they can.  The absence of a precise definition in the particular cases I have mentioned does create a difficulty and probably it would be desirable for the Minister to clear it up.  In the case of towns with definite boundaries, I can imagine the courts would take the initiative if the question of construction came up.  In these other cases I do not know of any precedent that would enable the thing to be operated.  If there are going to be any doubts of that nature, or if there is something that cannot be readily ascertained, it may involve administrative difficulties.  The Minister misunderstood my point about the licensing laws.  My point is that there are exemptions which tend to give rise to difficulties.  Admittedly, in the case of <Col N="1261" /> the licensing laws the precise question of distance did not give rise to difficulties there because the distance was easily ascertainable, but other things in the provision did.  In this case difficulties which arise under the Licensing Acts will not arise, but I see a difficulty possibly in regard to the precise determination of a boundary and the consequential results will be the same.  That is why I criticised the provision.  The Minister would be well advised to consider this before the Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I wish to draw attention to a remark I made earlier to-day. It was in connection with the holiday camps.  They do not always run public dances.  There are dances every night for their guests, but sometimes they run public dances.  As one of the principal holiday camps in the vicinity of the city is exempt under this section, will the Minister consider applying the same exemption to Irish holiday camps?  I think the population in Skerries would be over 500.</P>

I imagine it would be somewhat complicated for the revenue officers and the management of the camp.  I suggest the Minister should try to give the same facilities to Irish holiday camps as are given to Mosney.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>All this goes to show how unjust is this proposal. Under this section one holiday camp will get exemption and another holiday camp will not.  Just because Mosney was lucky enough to be built out in the country and the other man was unlucky enough to build in the rural town of Skerries, one will come under the Minister's provision and the other will not.  I wonder how many areas in Ireland will be exempt?  Will the Minister give us information on that? <Col N="1262" /> The majority of the halls in rural Ireland are in towns with a population of over 500.  Last night we were out for total exemption, but to-day we are trying to hammer the best job we can on the section.  The Minister turned us down last night.  Deputy Fitzpatrick, with all good intentions no doubt, differed from me a few moments ago. I had in mind total exemption, as I said here last night.</P>
      <P>I hold that this is unconstitutional &mdash; that one section of the people should have one thing and another section should have something else.  So far as this goes, the people in rural Ireland will get only an imaginary exemption.  In fact, they will not get exemption at all, if we except a few isolated districts. The remaining districts and parishes will have to pay the tax.  With one or two exceptions, all the parishes in my constituency have no halls at all.  They are exempt, but some enterprising fellow may convert an old barn in order to carry on dancing.  This whole thing is unconstitutional and the Minister is giving only an imaginary relief to the people.</P>

      <P>The position is that one parish will be graded as a rural parish and another parish outside that will be told that it belongs to the city, notwithstanding that it would be ten miles from the city or from any other centre of population.  The Minister spoke of the town of Monaghan and other big provincial towns.  I am making a case for the areas I have already referred to and I suggest that the whole thing is wrong&mdash;I am sure it is wrong. <Col N="1263" /> If the Minister succeeds in this he need not think that he will also be successful in blinding the people.  He will send out inspectors again to ensure that the people do not amuse themselves and to ensure that there will be unemployment amongst dance hall staffs, musicians and so on.  If the Minister would consider increasing it to 5,000, as is proposed in this amendment, he might then be said to show some concern for the people in the rural areas.  No Minister could say that he was concerned for these people while making the figure 500 of a population in each area.  A few villages make up 500.  Well enough the Minister knows that.

If they have dance halls he will send out inspectors to interrupt the dances in order to find <Col N="1264" /> out if they have permission to dance. Is that not the position?

      <P>Dance halls have sprung up.  Week after week in the local courts we have seen prosecutions against people who ran dances in their own homes because they were not acting in compliance with this particular Act. As a result of that dance halls were built in areas where hitherto there never had been any need for them. The proposition now is to impose a tax on these halls, taking a distance of three miles from the centre specified. <Col N="1265" /> A distance of three miles is a very small matter when one considers modern transport facilities.  Nowadays, buses can even be hired to take people to dances on Saturday and Sunday nights.  These people think nothing of travelling 15, 20, 25 or 30 miles.  In order to evade this tax people will now hold dances outside the three-mile limit.  This problem of dancing is assuming very large proportions.</P>

      <P>The temptation will not be there to bring the people out of the towns into the country districts.  That is where this section will compel them to go as it stands at present.  A village of 500 people is comparatively small. If it is raised to 5,000 the people in the smaller towns will run dances in the normal course in their own towns and there will be no temptation to them to try to evade this tax by holding their dances outside a certain specified limit.  I ask the Minister to consider that aspect of the matter.</P>
      <P>There is another aspect to this matter.  The customs officers find it very difficult to enforce this law.  As a matter of fact I know cases myself where the local post office could not supply the necessary stamps for the tickets.  It is very difficult for these officials to enforce the law and to carry out their duty.  Naturally there is a strong temptation to evade the law in relation to this tax.  If the Minister wants to increase the stamp duty by all means let him do so, but let him do it only so far as commercial dancing is concerned.  I do not believe that if this amendment were accepted, much money would be lost to the Exchequer.</P>

I would far prefer to see the matter done in this way rather than to leave these avenues of evasion open.  I would prefer to see the tax added to the £2 licence fee, if you want to tax the ordinary commercial dance hall.

At least that is so in the parts of the country with which I am familiar.  If anybody goes and draws a line covering a radius of every centre with a population of 500, he will find that virtually every square inch of the map will come within these lines.

I consider that the proposed relief is completely illusory and that the Minister might very well accept the amendment before the House.</P>

I am quite willing to drop the section if the House so desires.  If the Deputy thinks that that is trying to pull the wool over his eyes, I cannot help him, but the Deputy appears so constantly to be suffering from a condition of wool around his eyes that I do not think that the further operation would be possible.  This is a relieving section.  It will give relief of the type which Deputy Little and others asked for last year.  I should be very much surprised indeed if I did not find on looking up the records that Deputy Moran also asked for it.  It does give very considerable relief and if the Deputy wishes to base his reputation for correct statement on his suggestion that if a circle were drawn around the areas in which no relief was given, not a square inch of the map would be left uncovered, I am afraid his reputation for veracity would not be very much enhanced.</P>

Let him go down to the rural areas to which <Col N="1268" /> relief is given by this section and repeat that statement and we shall see how his reputation fares.  There were one or two serious points put to me in the course of the debate.  Deputy Cowan raised a question in regard to Granard.  I would merely point out that this is the first year in which this section will operate and that it is definitely an experimental one this year. The questions of population and the distances from particular areas will be considered in the light of what happens during the present year.  I would not advise anybody, for instance, to set up dance halls during the coming year, on the outskirts of areas which are not exempted or just beyond the three-mile limit of some place with a population of 500.  If he does that, he does it at his own risk and I hope I shall not hear any complaints in future from Deputies who may be defending that type of person to the effect that certain people have invested capital in that type of undertaking.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick referred to the question of holiday camps.  I did not feel disposed to deal with that this year by making any specific exceptions but if Deputy Fitzpatrick thinks that this relief should not apply to places such as Butlin's Camp we might have legislation precisely on that point in order to meet it.  I would rather again give the section a trial to find out what happens.  In certain times of the year, I think it is to be expected that certain people will run combined excursions or combined entertainments at this particular area.  In so far as that takes place in a normal way and can be regarded as an ordinary consequence of the establishment of that place, I do not think we would have any right to complain but, of course, if any definite tendency develops of people going there simply because they can get their entertainment cheaper than it would be in Dublin and if that attracts people away from the city, I think we may have to meet that again by some sort of provision.</P>

This is an experiment for the time being.  I may be able to give a great deal more information about that when I have more experience of it.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  When the financial emergency of the autumn of 1947 came upon various countries in Europe, as well as upon this country, an attempt was made in various countries to stem the very rapid inflationary tendency that showed itself in the latter half of that year.  There was an emergency Budget introduced here and, as portion <Col N="1271" /> of that Budget, I proposed to the Government and the Government proposed to the Dáil that we should increase the stamp duty on property purchases here for the purpose of stopping, if we could, the inflationary spiral.  Everyone had knowledge of the fact that in the six months previous to the introduction of that emergency Budget in the autumn of 1947 many houses and properties had changed hands several times, each time at a higher price.  We had also a situation in which a number of non-nationals were coming in here from abroad and competing with our own people for houses to live in or land to work.  To deal with that particular aspect of the situation it was proposed that the stamp duty should be raised up to 25 per cent. and, in the case of nationals, it was to go up from about 1 per cent., on an average, to 5 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation that that increase of stamp duty on the sale of property was designed to meet has passed, according to the Minister.  The Government propose to spend large sums of borrowed money on various types of capital development or improvement.  For expenditure on land improvement out of money received from taxation they are substituting expenditure from money received through borrowing. We all know that when there is an increase in the expenditure of borrowed money it increases the amount of money in circulation within the country.  When the Minister proposes, after having considered the matter seriously, to spend vast amounts of borrowed money on capital development, particularly on development like drainage, which may not yield a result for many years, that will increase the supply of money in the hands of the people without concurrently increasing the supply of goods.  It will have one result and that is to drive up the price of the goods that are available for sale.  It may be, and it is, a good thing to increase the supply of money within a community when money is short and goods are plentiful.  However, if goods are short and money already too plentiful, the additional <Col N="1272" /> supply of money will tend to add to the cost of those goods.  I should like to know from the Minister early in this debate whether it is his opinion that there is so little danger of inflation that we can afford not to tax in order to provide funds for land improvement.</P>

Not only is he proposing to perpetuate the duties as introduced, but why is he proposing to copper-fasten them?  That is a question which I think demands an answer.  I stated why they were introduced.  The Minister claims that that situation has passed.  He refused to collect any money for land improvement and he is going to spend borrowed money on it.</P>

      <P>If I cannot use two words without your pulling me up on a matter which was described as &ldquo;a dirty fraud&rdquo; by one of the present Ministers, it will be almost impossible to debate this situation.  However, why did the Minister arrive at the decision to bring forward this &ldquo;dirty fraud,&rdquo; as the Minister for Agriculture called it?  The Taoiseach complained at the time these duties were introduced, in Volume 108, column 1065 of the Official Reports:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I believe that this additional taxation will result merely in making house property dearer and the provision of houses for the people who have only limited means impossible.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is that the Minister's opinion?  If that is his opinion has he included these stamp duties in this Bill in order to <Col N="1275" /> make house property dearer and housing for persons with limited means, impossible?  If that is not the reason, what is the reason?  Is the reason just to collect money irrespective of the social or other effects that it may have? There was every case in an inflationary period to stop the inflationary spiral by increasing the stamp duty.  The Minister says that situation does not exist to-day.  Many of the Ministers of the present Government, in denouncing this particular tax, demanded that instead we should reimpose the excess corporation profits tax.  If he did that, he would get £3,500,000 instead of the few hundred thousand pounds that he will get in this particular way.  Why is it that the Minister refuses, in this year, the calls of his colleagues from the distant past to reimpose the excess corporation profits tax, and why, instead, has he decided to institute this system of tax collecting which his colleague called &ldquo;a dirty fraud&rdquo; and which his Leader the Taoiseach said &ldquo;would have the effect of making houses dearer and impossible for poor people to buy&rdquo;?  If the Minister had lived up in any way to the promises that he made to reduce taxation by £10,000,000 he would not have to impose this duty, but, instead of reducing it by £10,000,000, he has increased it by £7,000,000 or £8,000,000, and instead of reducing the amount per head from £18 7s. 0d. he drove it up to £24 7s. 0d. per head from the £21 14s. 0d. per head at which it stood in the last year of Fianna Fáil.</P>

I do not object at the present time to the 25 per cent. being put on non-nationals. I think the situation is such that that particular tax should be continued.  I am quite prepared to assist the Minister in stopping in a reasonable fashion any gaps that may have been found since that tax was imposed, but we object in a situation that the Minister says is deflationary to help him to continue an anti-inflationary tax on house property. There is no excuse for it in the present situation.  There are many other ways in which the Minister could have collected the money, but instead of collecting the money by one of the ways in which they promise by reducing taxation, they are collecting this additional money now in this particular way.  I for one object to that and I hope the House will object to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a few remarks on these sections.  I think the position is that we are entitled to discuss the three sections dealing with the stamp duties.  In doing that I want to say that I am reflecting the views of the Council of the Incorporated Law Society which has suggested to Deputies who are solicitors that they might raise particular points.  I propose doing that. Deputy Little is one of the solicitor Deputies in the House.  I take it that he is in receipt of a similar communication to that which I got from the Incorporated Law Society and that it moved him to notify the Chair that Sections 26 and 27 would be opposed and to move an amendment to Section 24.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think every Deputy will agree that it is very regrettable that Deputy Little did not take on himself the task of opening the discussion on these <Col N="1277" /> sections.  I am sure if he had done so the Minister might have heard some reasonable criticism from the Opposition Benches.  I do not know why Deputy Little decided to stand down in favour of Deputy Aiken unless it be that it is deliberate Fianna Fáil policy that every section of this Finance Bill should be opposed in a manner in which Deputy Aiken and Deputy Aiken alone can oppose these things.  It appeared to me, without intending any reflection whatever on the Chair, to be bordering on irrelevancy from start to finish and to have been done deliberately, because the Deputy persisted in arguing with the Chair whenever he was pulled up.</P>
    <P>I think all Deputies know the history of these stamp duties.  They were imposed in the first instance by Deputy Aiken.  I have not got with me Deputy Aiken's defence of these stamp duties when they were imposed.  I am sure he very bitterly resented the remarks which he quoted here to-day as having been made by the then Deputy Dillon. I am sure that Deputy Aiken did not agree with the descriptions given of the increase in stamp duties by Deputy Dillon as being correct.  I would like to know if he agrees whether they are correct.</P>

      <P>Deputy Aiken thinks he can cycle out of answering a question in that manner.  As far as I am concerned, he cannot.  He has not answered the point, but possibly he will before we finish.  I do not want to follow Deputy Aiken at all.  I think it is the first time that I have found myself even partially standing on the same platform as that Deputy and I hope it will be the last because I find I have to start apologising for doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The points which the governing body of the solicitors' profession suggest should be raised on these sections have, I think, already been brought to the notice of the Minister by a communication from that body.  I think it should be made clear at this stage that that body made it clear to me and to other solicitors in this House that they are not objecting to the rate of the stamp duty.  Any objections which they <Col N="1278" /> have to these sections are due to the administrative difficulties which may arise by reason of lengthening the administrative process of having deeds stamped with a consequent delay in completing house purchase, the leases of houses and things of that sort.  In their communication to him they pointed out that they are not making any objection to the rates of duty which the Minister proposes to continue. I do not altogether agree with them there.  On the occasion of the Budget I pleaded with the Minister that possibly Deputy Aiken had done his work well when he imposed the stamp duty originally and the time had now come to review it with a view to scaling down the rates of duty and flattening them out at a level of 2½ or 3½ per cent.</P>
    <P>With regard to Section 24 (6), Deputy Little has put down an amendment that this sub-section should be deleted.  The basis of that amendment, I take it I am correct in saying, is the communication which he received from the Incorporated Law Society.  The society points out that that Section 24 (6) is a bit obscure and also that the provision contained in sub-section (6) (a) seems to give the Revenue Commissioners a right to come to a decision from which there can be no appeal and to come to that decision at their own discretion and without argument, if they do not want to hear argument.  The sub-section reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Any lease (not being executed in good faith and for valuable consideration) shall, for the purposes of this section, be deemed to be a lease operating as a voluntary disposition <i>inter vivos</i>, and the consideration for any lease shall not for this purpose be deemed to be a valuable consideration where the Revenue Commissioners are of opinion that, by reason of inadequacy of consideration or other circumstances, the lease confers a substantial benefit on the lessee.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The objection taken to that section is that it empowers the Revenue Commissioners, by reason of their own opinion, to come to a particular conclusion and exclude leases of that sort and that there is no right of appeal given in the <Col N="1279" /> section against that decision.  The effect of that on the ordinary work of solicitors&mdash;any solicitor in practice will agree with me on this point&mdash;is that it means that there will be a considerable increase in the number of leases which will have to be lodged for adjudication.  Again, any solicitor in practice will know that the procedure of lodging a lease for adjudication leads to considerable delay and the more instruments that have to be lodged the greater will be the delay.  I should like the Minister to look into that point and see if anything can be done about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1947 Act has nothing to do with it.  Even under that Act you still work from tables and accounts and solicitors or counsel will be able to tell you the rate of duty applicable.  Normally, that was accepted by the Stamp Office and lodged, but in this section there is a departure in so far as the Revenue Commissioners can query an instrument because of the format and say it must be lodged for adjudication. The delay was often considerable.</P>
      <P>With regard to the other sections, I want to say that here I am merely passing on to the Minister, as I undertook to do, the points raised by the Incorporated Law Society.  With regard to Section 26 (4) this provides that as regards a company, 51 per cent. of whose capital is in Irish hands, if, at a later date, that proportion is altered, the Revenue Commissioners may require the company to stamp at the higher rate.  The Incorporated Law Society believe that is wrong and, where the document has been stamped and has been adjudged correctly stamped, that should operate as stamping the deed correctly, because it was stamped correctly under the law at a given time and as the law stood then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another point in reference to Section 26 (4) and Section 25.  The effect of Section 25, as I see it, is this, that where leases have been stamped <Col N="1280" /> perfectly lawfully by reason of a recent court decision at a rate of 1 per cent. stamp duty, this section is retrospective in so far as if the lease was not stamped before 4th May the 5 per cent. stamp duty must be charged.  I am talking now of the case of an Irish citizen.  I should like to know from the Minister if he has considered the provisions of the Constitution in relation to these sections.  Article 15 of the Constitution, clause 5, says that the Oireachtas shall not declare acts to be infringements of the law which were not so at the date of their commission. It would seem to me, at any rate, that this section is bordering on the unconstitutional, if it is not, in fact, unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>Let us visualise the case of a lease being stamped at the rate of 1 per cent. before this Bill becomes law.  The law as it stands, by reason of the recent decision, is that 1 per cent. is the lawful stamp duty on such an instrument. That law remains unaltered until this Bill is passed.  When the Bill is passed that section, to my mind, amounts to retrospective legislation to create an offence in the case of any documents which were stamped between the 4th of May and the passing of this Act. And it could be done.  I think the correct way of stamping a document might be to bring down a blank form and have it stamped at the rate of 1 per cent. and put your lease on that.  You are perfectly entitled to engross a lease and execute it on a deed paper already stamped.  It is unlikely in actual practice any such case will arise, because the warnings given by the Minister at the introduction of the Budget probably shook people sufficiently to ensure that nothing of that sort would be tried.</P>

      <P>At any rate, I think the Minister might consider the provisions of the Constitution in relation to Sections 25 and 26.  If I might, I would like to make my position clear here.  When I, and other solicitors, are speaking on these sections it would be a great mistake for the Minister or Deputies to assume that we are talking <Col N="1281" /> out of anything in the nature of personal interest.  That would be quite wrong.  It will not make a whit of difference to a solicitor, as such, whether this legislation remains as it is or is altered, but it will to his clients and to the general public.  It will certainly make some difference so far as delays are concerned in the carrying out by solicitors of the work they do for their clients.  These matters have been considered by the Incorporated Law Society and they asked us to raise these matters here.  I want to be quite fair with the House.  When undertaking to raise these matters here I made it clear at the same time that if the Minister for Finance in his wisdom, having obtained all the advice accessible to him, decides that it would be better not to give way to the representations made to him, I have no intention good, bad or indifferent of voting against the Bill.  I have indicated that fact to the Incorporated Law Society. I think it would be unfair to leave them under any misapprehension in that respect.  I think I am perfectly consistent in that because one must look at this in the larger sense.  We may have disagreements with regard to matters of detail on particular sections, but I do not think it is right to condemn the entire Bill because one does not see eye to eye with the Minister on particular sections.</P>

      <P>To deal with Section 24 adequately from our point of view one would have to repeal the relevant section in the No. 2 Act of 1947.  We are against the section on principle.  As it is expressed here it deals only with leases.  We feel, however, that if we could defeat this clause it would render the clause dealing with the transfer of property inoperative and thereby force the Minister to amend the entire section so that he can deal only with the part on which we are agreed&mdash;namely, the 25 per cent. on the transfer of property or leases to foreigners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, I must associate myself closely with what the former Minister for Finance has said.  Having been the author of this section at a time when he had to handle a very difficult inflationary period of which advantage was being taken by speculators, he <Col N="1282" /> dealt here with the question of a very large principle at the point of application. It has now come down to a very fine point, but that does not mean that the general principle making it necessary for that principle to be applied at a certain time cannot be discussed now because the whole situation has changed.  The clause in the 1947 Act was effective.  We all know what happened at the time.  I know one particular case where a house was sold for £3,000 to one man; he subsequently resold it for £11,000.  A lot of that sort of thing was going on.  The imposition of this tax succeeded in bringing house property back to reasonable prices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have to read the entire speech and I do not intend to do that.  I will not take a mere phrase out of its context.  I shall now relate the point of view taken up by the Incorporated Law Society.  It has been stated.  When introducing the original proposal the then Minister said that is was the Government's job to stop speculation in house property.  It was not stated at that time that the imposition was for revenue purposes.  We know very well now that the Minister is in a difficulty because he is maintaining it for revenue purposes.  I do not suppose we shall succeed in shifting the clause this year.  At least we can put up a fight and hope that the position will be remedied next year.  Anybody <Col N="1283" /> who has experience of the transfer of property where people of modest means are concerned knows how difficult it is for the person with modest means to bridge over the amount between the loan and what he has to find himself.  It is 1 per cent. up to £500 admittedly, but no one can buy a house to-day for £500.  Even a quite ordinary house will cost about £2,000. That means that the entire 5 per cent. goes on.  That extra £100 makes it very difficult for people with modest means.  It amounts to a capital levy on a class that can least afford to bear it.  The transfer of stocks and shares involves only a levy of 2 per cent.  Here it is 5 per cent.  I hope the Government appreciates the hardship involved.  I hope that this time next year they will find some other source of revenue. Chaos exists so far as assessing stamp duty, the registration of documents and so on is concerned.  Before December, 1947, it took about a week to get documents stamped.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The particular clause here has been brought in in order to fill up a gap. In opposing this we are opposing the whole principle because we think that if we got rid of this it would be necessary to amend the Act accordingly.  It would be almost impossible for a person without the draftsman and the Revenue Commissioners at his elbow, owing to the amount of legislation by <Col N="1284" /> reference which would be involved, to draft a comprehensive clause of the kind we want, so we decided to oppose the whole clause.  The amendments which I have put down are amendments of detail and of minor importance as compared to the whole question of the principle involved.  I do not think it is necessary for me to go into these details except to say that the Revenue Commissioners are taking all these very great powers.  Deputy O'Higgins read out the particular clause which I propose to delete.  It is entirely in the hands of the Revenue Commissioners to decide what the value of the property is without any reference to the consideration that has been given for it.  Not merely is the matter of consideration involved but &ldquo;other circumstances&rdquo;.  What are the other circumstances?  How are we to know what the other circumstances are?  It gives the most enormous powers to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to discuss matters of general principle so much as matters of particular application. There are some matters in these three sections dealing with stamp <Col N="1285" /> duties that I think are going to cause very considerable difficulties in future &mdash;not difficulties to the solicitors' profession but difficulty to people who have to operate through the solicitors' profession.  I should like to mention a case of which I had personal experience. Section 24, sub-section (4), paragraph (e) follows exactly a similar provision in the Finance Act (No. 2) of 1947, which was introduced by Deputy Aiken.  It provides that one of the classes of people who can purchase property at 5 per cent. stamp duty as against a stamp duty of 25 per cent. are those who are lawfully carrying on business coming within the Control of Manufactures Act but then a rather peculiar point arises.  This section I should say has exactly the same wording as that in the Finance (No. 2) Act of 1947.  Take a case in which I am interested.  The person concerned would be entitled lawfully to carry on business here but he is not carrying on the business at the moment.  He will be entitled to carry on the business when he has purchased a factory in which he intends to carry on that business.  As the section is phrased as he is not carrying on the business at the moment he must pay the 25 per cent. stamp duty but the moment he has bought premises, he will be entitled to get away with 5 per cent.  I must confess that I was rather slack in not putting down a specific amendment on the point but I would suggest to the Minister the point could equally be met by changing the wording of the section&mdash;&ldquo;a person lawfully carrying on business&rdquo; to the words&mdash;&ldquo;entitled lawfully to carry on a business&rdquo;. The difficulty would be obviated in that way.  I think that Deputy Aiken when he was Minister said that the point of the section was to facilitate the establishment of new industries and industrial development.  Certainly I do not think that anybody visualised the point that a man would have to carry on a business before he would be entitled to purchase a factory in which a business was to be carried on at the lower stamp duty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>He could be dealt with in the same way as he could in regard to Section 26 to which I am going to refer in a moment.  The next point which I want to raise has reference to the provisions that are incorporated in sub-section (3) of Section 26. I am not at all quite clear as to the type of case that the Minister is endeavouring to cover in that sub-section. It would assist us somewhat to appreciate the wording of the section if we knew what type of evasion the Minister was trying to get at.  The whole purpose of these three sections is to cover evasions.  The Minister has, no doubt, seen the memorandum of the Incorporated Law Society, to one part of which I take the strongest exception. It seems to me that if we are going to have a law it is our duty as Deputies to try to ensure that whatever the law is intended to be, it should be made as copper-tight as possible.  I very strongly hold that where certain intentions are expressed, the House should do its utmost to make certain that these intentions are carried into effect. Whether certain people's wishes would be carried into effect or not is not the issue, as suggested by the Incorporated Law Society.  The issue is that the law was declared and, being declared, the loopholes manifest should be closed so long as it remains the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in Section 26 (4) has provided a sub-section which will be totally unworkable.  The effect of that sub-section will be that in connection with every conveyance, lease or assignment to a company and by that company, if it has been formed since October, 1947, there must be proof that <Col N="1287" /> 51 per cent. of the shares have been held by Irish nationals since its formation. There is no method of such proof provided in the Bill and the result, so far as conveyancing practice in regard to the acquisition and resale by companies formed since October, 1947, is concerned, will be a complete nightmare to everybody.  The Minister could deal with what he wants quite conveniently by providing, as in other similar Acts, that a certificate by the company that the Act had been complied with would be operative in favour of a <i>bona fide</i> purchaser or transferee. It would leave the Revenue Commissioners their right of recoupment against the company concerned, but it would not leave a blot on the title which it will be impossible for any practitioner ever to deal with except by furnishing in each case a complete list of the shareholders from the date of incorporation of the company right up to the date of the sale, together with a declaration by each individual shareholder that those holding 51 per cent. of the shares were Irish citizens. That is going to be an utter impossibility as regards conveyancing property.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid you would have a perfect answer in this House, but not if a claim came about afterwards.  If the Minister provided a form of regulation or application by virtue of which the matter may be dealt with along the lines suggested by Deputy Timoney, I would agree.  I think it would be easier if we had the same situation as arises under the Irish Citizenship Act.  In that case there is a certificate by the purchaser incorporated in the deed and, so far as it has been a purchase for value without notice that there is any fraud involved, then the certificate is accepted by the purchaser and is not a blot on the title. The Minister could do the same thing in regard to this sub-section and still hold his remedy so that he could chase <Col N="1288" /> the company concerned if there had been evasion or if it should transpire to the commissioners afterwards that, in fact, the charge should have at some time been stamped with the 25 per cent. duty.</P>
      <P>Apart from that matter, I want to mention another matter which does not arise directly, but which does arise in another way.  There is not in Section 24 in regard to leases any similar provision to that in Section 13 of the 1947 Act, which restricted the duty in certain cases to 1 per cent.  Deputy Aiken and I at that time had some very considerable discussion in the other House on that section and sub-section (6) particularly. It seems to me almost nonsensical, if I may use the word, that a person should be entitled to transfer property to his brother, sister, nephew or niece and pay only 1 per cent., while, if he wants even to give a life interest to his wife, he has to pay 5 per cent. on the deed creating such a life interest.  I am not going merely to argue it on that basis.  I want to argue with the Minister on the basis of revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister appreciates as well as I do that almost every settlement that is set up, if it is in a settlement by the husband, gives a life interest in the first case to the husband for life, then to the wife for life and then to the children.  Under the law as it was enacted by the Act of 1947, that instrument must bear 5 per cent. duty.  If, however, a husband, instead of enacting what normally the proper course demanded in a settlement, declared that he would get a life interest and that after his death a life interest would go to his children or to his brother or to his nephews or nieces, but that his wife would have no share at all, then he would only have to pay 1 per cent. on the value of the property passing.  The effect of that has been that there are no settlements being made throughout the country.  Whether that is a bad thing or a good thing is perhaps a matter for argument.  Personally, I think it is bad and unsatisfactory. It is certainly wrong that a man can transfer his property to his brother's children or his sister's children and have to pay only 1 per cent. duty, but if he wants to give his <Col N="1289" /> wife any interest in the property of any kind or description, present, future, contingent or otherwise, then duty has to be charged at the rate of 5 per cent.</P>
    <P>I said in 1947 that I thought it was a great mistake and I certainly have not changed my view on that.  I think the Minister is going to lose substantial revenue by the imposition, because it will merely mean that settlements on which he would otherwise get duty will not be executed in the future.  These sections and this whole code which has grown up since 1947 have made the work of deeding for the public very much more laborious and lengthy.</P>
    <P>It is not at all appreciated by the public that where you have a necessity, as you have at present in many instances, not merely arising out of the 1947 Act, of lodging documents for adjudication of stamp duty, the delay is appalling.  I may have been lucky, but I have found that it has eased up considerably in the last six months. Invariably, however, although there is no blame to be attached to the solicitor, he gets the blame.  If something could be done to ease the difficulties it would benefit not only solicitors but the public, who are really the people concerned.</P>

      <P>I intend to keep as close as I can and to adhere strictly to it.  I want to do it objectively, if the Chair would bear with me.  Let me put myself right with the Chair. This Bill affects, broadly speaking, two types of property, the property of Irish nationals and the property which may be acquired by non-nationals. Generally, the principle of differentiation is that the national will pay 5 per cent.  That was the policy of the 1947 Finance Bill and is the continuing policy of this part of this Bill.  I think that is truly stating the position.  This Section 24 is simply designed to close the loophole which was discovered in the 1947 Act.  Even if there was a case, and many Deputies maintain there was a case, for increasing that tax in the case of nationals to 5 per cent. in 1947, I think that that should not be done now.  Consequently, I would argue against this section in regard to Irish nationals.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The argument is that in the case of transfers of house property at the moment amongst nationals there is no longer an inflationary situation.  I do not think it can operate to reduce the price of houses. In fact, it operates the other way, as it amounts to a tax.  That will attach, as far as I can see, to any type of conveyance.  Without going into the details of the thing it seems to me to be rather illogical that on the one hand we are going to give grants for the building of houses&mdash;and we are very concerned about the housing of the population&mdash;and on the other hand we increase a tax on the acquiring of that title to houses from 1 per cent. to 5 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is that is the position now and you are the responsible Minister now and where a loophole was discovered, to obviate that, you are closing it.  I would rather face the matter in the way I was facing it without chasing the Minister's technique. The fact of the matter is, apart from any debating in this House, that this tax, as the Minister has tacitly admitted here, amounts under present day circumstances to a tax on the acquisition of houses.  A loophole has been discovered in the enactment to date.  There is a provision by which, if this section is not passed, this tax could be obviated and conveyances would be saddled with only 1 per cent. The effect of this enactment in principle is to close that loophole.  Therefore, in so far as our own nationals are concerned, particularly in regard to that type of property, I think the principle in this section is wrong.  On the other hand I will say this to the Minister. I think the Minister is perfectly correct in still maintaining the 25 per cent. on non-nationals.  I would be prepared to consider an area, so to speak, between the householder class that I have mentioned&mdash;which are my specific grounds for imposing this principle&mdash;and the non-nationals class, particularly the non-national company class.  One has the feeling that, having regard to the complexity of this set of provisions and the 1947 Act&mdash;the two must be read together&mdash;this is hardly the best way of doing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That brings me to the second point, having more or less stated where I stand on the principle of the thing.  The question is how could you achieve the desire without following the precedent of the 1947 legislation?  It seems to me the first thing would be to make a totally different method of approach. It should be possible to do it, if the onus of investigation and the onus of <Col N="1292" /> decision were taken by the Revenue Commissioners.  The effect in this is, all along, to try to make the thing automatic and the Revenue Commissioners, so to speak, will want to have everything handed on a plate to them. Would it not be better to try and get a simpler set of provisions?  In order to differentiate between the non-national and the national case, leave the national provisions as they were. On the one hand, leave the Revenue Commissioners with more initiative in investigation whether there has been an evasion or not.  In the second place you could put a specific statutory duty with declaration as to certain facts.  I think the combination of these two things coupled with statutory declarations or some document of that nature would make a person responsible for the declarations there in concerned to be made to the Revenue Commissioners. Thereafter, anything appearing on that could be dealt with by some approach like that.</P>
    <P>I confess that I do not find it very easy to legislate for the border line, but certainly this set of enactments does show that those who felt that evasions were possible under this scheme were justified and one feels that for the future, no matter how tightly the Minister tries to close the gap here and to provide for other matters that still exist by virtue of the very complexity of the thing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be gaps. As a matter of fact, it is rather amusing to recall that to a certain extent the Minister and I, although we were on different sides of the House at the time of the 1947 Bill, more or less joined forces in pointing out some of these difficulties.  If the Minister looks at Volume 108, column 1926, of the Official Reports he will see that he virtually agreed with the people who said at the time that the complexities of the scheme were such that evasion was practically unavoidable.  In reply to me, where I said, &ldquo;You could not draft anything comprehensive enough to do that&rdquo;, the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;There you are again.  The Minister must recognise that argument of <Col N="1293" /> his own Deputies, that if you drafted a bookful of amendments you could not prevent the evasion of the 25 per cent.  Is that not what it comes to?  Then we are going to tax the foreigner.  Before this ends I want to give the Minister a three-mark question: What is an Irish citizen? Can he tell me?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Similar remarks could apply to the 5 per cent. tax.  Here is the Minister, in spite of the fact that he must obviously acutely recognise the difficulties that he is up against, bringing in this very complex legislation.  It is going to increase administrative costs in the sense of the costs of the client.  It is going to increase his legal costs quite apart from the duty.  It is going to make it very difficult, indeed, for him to be certain where he stands and certainly it is going to lead to evasion and to legal ingenuity to achieve further evasion. I think that is indisputable. Coupled with the fact that there is no longer a case for imposing 5 per cent. on our own people and coupled with the housing matter I mentioned, it seems to me to be a sufficient argument to induce the Minister to reject this and to approach it rather from the point of view of leaving the law as it was for Irish citizens and concentrating on the question of the 25 per cent. on the foreigner who might come in to buy a property.</P>
    <P>While I am on that subject a further matter occurs to me.  It follows, I think, directly from what Deputy Sweetman said.  It also follows from the point that I raised on the 1947 Act, a point which I have never quite resolved to my own satisfaction, that is the question of the definition of the word &ldquo;person&rdquo; in sub-section (4) of Section 24, and of the word &ldquo;person&rdquo; in the corresponding section of the 1947 Act.</P>
    <P>When I asked the question before I think the Minister characterised it a a six-mark one, and invited the then Minister to answer it.  May I return the invitation now?  The question is what exactly is the content of the word &ldquo;person&rdquo; in the section?  I need no repeat all I said then.  Deputy Sweetman has also brought in this question of the word &ldquo;person&rdquo; in <Col N="1294" /> reference to the Control of Manufactures Act, 1934.  Not only is there the question of evasion within the terms of this section as it stands, but it brings in the whole question of evasion indirectly within the meaning of the Control of Manufactures Act. Now, on another occasion I think it was to the Minister for Industry and Commerce that I expressed concern. I mentioned a specific case where the Control of Manufactures Act was being evaded under a stimulus that did not exist before the war, a specific instance where by means of certain devices that Act itself was being evaded.  I followed that a step further in relation to this Act.  For the purpose of my argument I take the case of a foreign citizen who, by devices, is evading the terms of the Control of Manufactures Act.  Through that evasion, and under the legal guise afforded him by the Act, he is carrying on business here.  He is, therefore, a person lawfully carrying on business, provided the evasion is legal, which is the case in the particular instance I am thinking of within the Control of Manufactures Act.  By means of this section, in the case of any conveyance or any kind of thing captured by the section, you then have a double evasion.</P>
    <P>Now, where is that kind of thing going to stop?  The root cause of it is the complexity of the section, the setting out to do what is, to some extent, an impracticable job&mdash;at least making that approach to it&mdash;and then the determination to press that impracticality to the utmost limit.</P>
    <P>I sympathise with the Minister in his desire to get revenue.  I agree with him in principle that if there is a loophole in the law it has to be closed.  I have no quarrel with him on that point.  If the desire is to maintain the position under the 1947 Act, then, from that point of view, the Minister did right in bringing in the section.  On the other hand, he might find it desirable, if he wanted to exempt house property of the type I have mentioned, simply to have left that loophole and legalise it, so to speak, by hedging it around and by directing it into the channels where he would <Col N="1295" /> achieve the object he wanted to achieve.  Recognising all that, one has the feeling that if it does not lead to litigation, this part of the Act will lead to expense and, to some extent, will be a brake on the transfers of ordinary house property between citizens.  It will certainly tend, I think, to increase legal costs.  It seems to me that it is going to involve, ultimately, investigations of title and advice on title that normally would not have taken place before.  Again, that is an expense connected with title, and it will not even benefit lawyers, I think.  The additional work and trouble that will be involved will hardly be a compensation for the additional money.  In other words, the client will probably have spent more money and will get more advice, but the amount of work and research involved will hardly pay the people who are giving that advice.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other points that I would like to speak on, but I think it is futile to do so.  I have no intention of delaying the Minister or the House with them.  But, while on the question of houses for Irish citizens and of transfers, there is another aspect of the case that I think should be considered.  I think the 1 per cent. should be reverted to in the case of ordinary house property owned by ordinary citizens.  This is not only a question of initially acquiring a house by a citizen who very often may require it.  The house is his property.  It is an asset the citizen has, and an important item of capital to be realised on certain occasions.  In that sense the value of that property should not be touched at the present time. Take the case of a civil servant, in one of the numerous grades, who owns a house and dies.  The house is probably the biggest asset he has.  The widow may not be able to afford to live in it after his death and she realises that asset.  Why should the conveyance, arising out of that set of circumstances, attract the highest duty in the present circumstances, quite apart from the question of the initial acquisition of houses by people who want to live in them?  The acquisition of a house is <Col N="1296" /> an acute problem to-day.  If such a house becomes vacant and is available to be bought, why should we put up a duty of this nature, and why should the costs of a citizen in respect of that house be increased, especially at a time when we are subsidising housing?</P>
    <P>In the case of house property, anyway, I think there is really something for the Minister to consider reverting to the 1 per cent.  In the case of an Irish citizen who has house property.  I would strongly oppose this proposal.  From the administrative point of view, that type of property should give no difficulty.  It should be the easiest thing in the world to find out who owns it&mdash;the deeds can be got. It will not be owned by a corporation or by people who cannot be checked, and the citizenship can easily be determined and other relevant facts can equally be determined.  There should be no administrative difficulty, no trouble in segregating them into a separate class, if necessary.  True, there is no amendment down to cover that point.  I merely throw out the suggestion as a subject for consideration and as a specific ground why I think this proposal should not pass.  To parse that part of the Bill section by section would be a useless job and it would mean unnecessarily delaying the time of the House.  I do not intend to do it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that one of the worst measures ever enacted in this House was the measure that increased stamp duty on conveyances from 1 per cent. to 5 per cent.  I say that it was irresponsible and that it was done without regard to the social needs of the people.  It was objected to strenuously then and it has had many serious effects on the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the purely social point of view, it is desirable that every person should own his home.  I think that is agreed by every authority, and right up to the period when stamp duties were increased from 1 per cent. to 5 per cent. a real effort was being made by citizens to become the owners of their houses.  Since the war ended and houses became available for sale to private individuals we have had a position <Col N="1297" /> in the City of Dublin where there are hundreds of houses lying on the hands of builders simply and solely because of the 5 per cent. stamp duty. I think it would be a great help to the community if those houses could be sold.  It would be a great help if hundreds of people could purchase these houses now and it certainly would be a wonderful help if, in respect of new houses that have never been occupied, the Minister were to consider reducing this duty from 5 per cent. to 1 per cent.</P>
    <P>I make that suggestion to the Minister. I am not asking him to reduce this stamp duty on all conveyances, but I do ask him, in an effort to enable citizens to purchase and become the owners of houses that are available for them, to see that the stamp duty on these new houses that have never been occupied is lowered to 1 per cent. In the case of a house that costs £2,000 in Dublin&mdash;and the house that is selling at £2,000 is not a very elaborate one; it is the sort of house that the average middle class person is endeavouring to purchase at the moment&mdash;the stamp duty on that transaction would be £20.  At the moment the stamp duty on it would be £100 and, where a deposit has to be paid, where furniture has to be bought and where other expenses necessary to the establishment of a home have to be borne, the reduction in stamp duty from £100 to £20 would be very welcome for those people, in the main young people who have just got married or are about to get married, to enable them to make a start in life.</P>
    <P>I cannot follow the arguments advanced here by Deputy Aiken.  It is a very short step back to 1947, a little over 18 months, since Deputy Aiken introduced the Budget that increased at one fell swoop stamp duties on conveyances for Irish nationals from 1 per cent. to 5 per cent.  Reason had no say at that time. There was opposition to it, reasonable opposition, in this Parliament, but reasonable opposition was unable to prevent that increase being made.  I appealed last year to the Minister to reduce these stamp duties so as to enable transactions in regard to <Col N="1298" /> property to be carried out.  I made that appeal to the Minister on several occasions, but this year I want to limit the appeal to those new houses that have been built within the past couple of years and that are lying idle, although available for occupation. They could be and they will be purchased and occupied if the stamp duty is reduced to the old level.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand the logic of Deputy Aiken's arguments less than two years ago when I make a comparison with his arguments to-day.  There has not been such a wonderful change in the period of two years that would justify Deputy Aiken saying less than two years ago, that it was necessary to increase the duty by 5 per cent., while to-day he says that it is necessary to revert to the original 1 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so. I cannot follow the logic of the argument advanced by Deputy Aiken at all. I would much prefer to get back to some basis of reality.  Why should a duty that has stood for so many years suddenly be increased by 500 per cent.?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>5 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>500 per cent.  That was an enormous increase in duty.  If the increase had been 100 per cent., 150 per cent., 200 per cent. or 250 per cent. it would have been had enough. To increase it by 500 per cent. at one fell swoop could not be justified on any reasonable basis at all.  I know the Minister is tempted, as any Minister for Finance would be tempted, to maintain this duty in order to get revenue. Naturally any Minister for Finance getting revenue from a particular duty or tax is tempted to maintain it.  The position may alter in a year or two. For the moment I would urge the Minister to make the variation that I have suggested in regard to new houses which have never been occupied.</P>
      <P>I, too, have been asked by the Incorporated Law Society to put forward their proposals to the Minister.  These proposals have already been mentioned by Deputy O'Higgins and Deputy Little.  The Incorporated Law Society has written to the Minister.  In a two-page document the society has set out their observations in regard to Section 24 (6) and Sections 26 and 27 of this particular Act.  If I were to repeat the case made by the Incorporated Law Society to the Minister and by Deputy O'Higgins and Deputy Little here to-day, I would merely be wasting the time of the House.  As requested by the Incorporated Law Society, I want the Minister and the House to know that I support the recommendations contained in the document sent by that society to the Minister on the 7th June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>The attitude adopted by Deputy Captain Cowan seems to be <Col N="1300" /> a somewhat foolish one.  He has criticised Deputy Aiken for having introduced this tax in the 1947 Act.  In that Act it was specifically laid down that the tax was confined solely to transfers and conveyances of property.  Now the Minister wants to impose an extra duty on leaseholds.  He may try to get away with it.  He may try to pretend that it is as a result of some decision.  The fact remains that he wants to impose extra taxation under this Bill.  Let no Deputy on the Government Benches labour under any delusion in regard to that, Leaseholds were not included in the 1947 Act.  They are included in this Act.  Is it not quite clear that the Minister is trying to impose extra taxation on those who are concerned with leaseholds?</P>
      <P>That is not the worst that can be said about this section.  The section also gives the Revenue Commissioners absolute power.  It sets them up as the highest authority to deal with this matter.  It makes them dictators.  When I was a member of the Government I remember a certain suggestion coming from the Revenue Commissioners in relation to putting square pegs into round holes in order to anticipate decisions that might possibly be given by the court.  I remember telling the Minister for Finance at the time that if the Revenue Commissioners got their way it would be tantamount to putting in a clause stating that &ldquo;Where the Revenue Commissioners are concerned, no defence will lie and no defence will avail.&rdquo;  If such a proposal had got through as far as this House it would have been laughed to scorn.  It would have been thrown out by the House.  Now the Government is endeavouring to get away with that. Section 13 of the Act of 1891 states that where there is an assessment of stamp duty one can appeal to the High Court within 21 days and there is a further seven days after that to state a case.  There was always appeal to the High Court.  I understand the Minister stated that there is an almost identical section to the present one in the Act of 1909.  That certainly surprises me.  Between this and the Report Stage I shall certainly compare the two in order to confirm that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1301" /> Companies were mentioned.  It is a rather peculiar thing in relation to companies that after stamp duty has been assessed they can come back when 15 years have elapsed; the possibility is that they may find some flaw or discover some way in which they did not conform with the Act.  So it is that from year to year a budget is introduced and passed by the House to limit the operation of that section. But there is no statute of limitations here.</P>
    <P>We are mainly concerned because this proposal was first introduced by Deputy Aiken when Minister for Finance with reference to conveyances and transfers of property alone. That was bad enough, but the present Minister wants to make it ten times worse.  He wants to introduce leaseholds as well.  We should not allow ourselves to be imposed upon in this way.  This is an additional tax on people who are already heavily taxed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly we may be wasting our time here in endeavouring to reduce the 5 per cent., but at least there should be some form of differentiation between the people on the lower scale and the people on the higher scale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That principle of differentiation has been recognised in other revenue Acts. For instance, as far as death duties are concerned, people with small estates have to pay so much less.  As the amount of the estate goes up the death duty is progressively increased.  Under Section 24 of this Bill the same rate applies, in accordance with the amount of the purchase money, on any property where the amount exceeds £500.  Formerly, as the House is aware, up to £500 the rate was 10/- per cent. and then it went on to the 1 per cent. scale.  If the Minister is not prepared to consider going back to the old scale, I think he should make some differentiation on the stamp duty in cases up to £1,500 or £2,000.  Generally, you find that where there is a sum of £3,500, £4,000 or more involved the people concerned are in a much better position to find 5 per cent., or £200 or £300, in addition for stamp duty than the struggling small farmer who is <Col N="1302" /> endeavouring to increase his holding by buying another small farm costing, say, £400 or £500.  So far as these small sales in the country are concerned, this 5 per cent. is a very grave imposition and is a real genuine hardship. In many cases it prevents small farmers from acquiring the little addition or the other piece of land that would make the difference between the economic and the uneconomic holding.</P>
    <P>There are some revolutionary proposals in this Bill to which reference has been made by other Deputies, in particular by Deputy Ruttledge.  In the first place, we are imposing taxation on a type of property under this Bill that never was imposed before.  In the second place, we are abolishing the whole meaning of the adjudication stamp that was recognised for all time up to the present.  This section, getting behind the effect of the adjudication stamp, means that nobody, where the investigation of title is concerned in the purchase of any property from a company, can accept the stamp that is shown on that company's deed.  Even though the deed is shown as duly stamped, the hallmark of evidence of the fact that the proper duty has been paid, the purchasers will be driven back to investigate the position of the company at the time when this property was acquired by the company.  That was one protection purchasers formerly had.  Take the position 50 years from now.  It will mean that purchasers at that time will have to go back to see what was the position of the particular concern in the year 1948 or 1949, when the property was sold.  That is a revolutionary proposal.  There is no limitation; it is a matter that may go on and on for years and perhaps it may be the tenth purchaser who may be saddled with the cost of trying to put matters right and of discovering that the proper stamp was put on the deed in the particular circumstances of the concern at the time.  He will be called upon years afterwards to put matters right.  There may be gaps to be filled, and I venture to say that even after this Bill is passed other gaps will be found.  Gaps are always found in measures of this kind.  I think the wiping out of the effect of the adjudication <Col N="1303" /> stamp is going an extraordinary distance for the mere sake of covering up some particular gap.  These are matters which the Minister should consider before insisting on the Bill going through in its present form.</P>
    <P>So far as the 25 per cent. duty is concerned, I am not quite so sure that the time has not passed when that law should be modified.  The type of people who have to pay the 25 per cent. stamp duty in this country have been buying old mansions through which the crows were flying and which nobody else would buy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that the Minister should consider whether the time has not passed when that provision in regard to the 25 per cent. stamp duty should be rigidly adhered to.  There is another matter in that connection which I should like to put to the Minister. Not so very long ago I came across a case in which a small farmer's daughter returned from England.  She was married to an Englishman and they came back to live in the old home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1304" /> The farm is one of about £5 valuation and the farmer was going to transfer this small farm to his daughter and son-in-law as joint tenants.  It was discovered, as the son-in-law was not born in this country, although he has been living here for the last 18 months, and married to an Irish girl that the amount of the stamp duty under this particular provision would be nearly as much as the little farm was worth. That is one of the deals that did not go through.  When the 1947 Act was going through cases of that kind evidently were overlooked.  I do not say that occurs in very many cases but there are a number of these cases arising in areas in which people are wont to migrate, the congested areas generally.  At all events, there is no precedent I think in taxation for a flat rate of this kind.  I think there should definitely be differentiation say between transactions up to £1,500 to which the old rate should apply and transactions over that figure.  If the Minister is not prepared to go the whole hog, he should go back to the rate of 1 per cent. as far as cases under £1,500 are concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJosephTimoney" hpid="Mr. Timoney Mr. Timoney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timoney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in a considerable amount of doubt as to whether I should deal with the speech made by Deputy Ruttledge or leave the answer to the Minister who, I am quite sure, could deal much more effectively with it than I can.  I am, however, perfectly certain that Deputy Ruttledge had a considerable amount of difficulty in keeping a serious face when he was bewailing the imposition of the 5 per cent. on leases and advanced as his reason that leases were deliberately omitted under the 1947 Act.  The intention at the time was, of course, to cover all sorts of conveyances of property and it was a case of lawyers' ingenuity to ascertain this.  The Revenue Commissioners resisted it and it had to go to the High Court and ultimately to the Supreme Court, and Deputy Ruttledge knows that very well.  Therefore, while the Deputy was quite convincing in his expression, he was certainly not convincing in the matter.  I think he would be the first to concede that.  I should like to say, however, that I think the Minister <Col N="1305" /> must be fairly well aware now that the general view is that, on principle, the increase in the stamp duty in the 1947 Act and the stopping of the loophole now are hardly desirable and certainly not popular.</P>
      <P>I should like to ascertain from the Parliamentary Secretary, in the absence of the Minister, if he considers that the profit to the Exchequer because of the increased duty is something more desirable than the attainment of the social ideal of making houses readily available to the citizens of the State.  I should like him to consider the question as to whether or not the attainment of that ideal can be measured in terms of money. Everybody will agree that the easier we make it for people to acquire houses the more desirable it is.  We are taxing the acquisition of houses for the sole purpose of increasing revenue, notwithstanding, as I am convinced from Deputy Aiken's statement that that was not its purpose.  I do not agree that there was a racket in the type of houses which would be available for the people who should get most consideration from us.</P>
      <P>There is another aspect of this also, and that is the difficulty now of removing the 5 per cent. duty.  The people who paid it will feel that they have been badly used and, at the same time, there are people&mdash;it is just as well the Minister should know it&mdash; who are holding unstamped deeds in the hope that when the stamp duty, as they expect, will ultimately come back to 1 per cent. they will be able to stamp them in 1950 or 1951 at 1 per cent.  There are such cases and the Minister, I am quite sure, is not so innocent that he does not realise that.</P>
      <P>There is one case of particular application. I have already discussed it with the Minister, but, I am afraid, without effect.  I had in mind putting down an amendment in connection with it, but, while I would have attempted the matter, I had not the time.</P>

      <P>For the information of other Deputies, I think I ought to <Col N="1306" /> mention the case.  We know that property transferred to a lineal descendant is liable to the old rate. Here is a case which occurred recently. The owner of a property made a will, and his intention was, I understand, to create a trust in favour of his children. On the construction of the will it was held that the expression was merely a held that the expression was merely a pious thought and that there was not a trust created, that, in fact, there was an intestacy created.  I forget how many children there were in the family. The widow and the children worked on the place together, and ultimately it was decided to have the place made over on one of the sons, with a view to his getting married ultimately.  The only manner in which that could be done was by the preparation of a conveyance in which the widow, in respect of her one-third share, and the children joined to convey their interest.  It happened that some of these children had got money out of the land prior to this and the consideration stated in the deed for their joining in it was the money which they had got ostensibly from the transferee.  The deed was sent up for adjudication and the conveyance was held by the Revenue Commissioners to be subject to 5 per cent.</P>
      <P>From the social point of view, I think it is most desirable that these transfers ought to be at the cheapest rate possible.  I do not know whether the Minister could consider changing his mind in the matter at a later stage. It is an interesting point, however, from the social point of view.  The object in bringing the case was that the widow's share, apparently, would only attract 1 per cent. and that the interest of the brothers and sisters attracted a higher rate of duty.  I am not certain whether that was fully adverted to when the 1947 Act was being debated.</P>

      <P>Sub-section (6) of Section 24 corresponds to a certain sub-section of a section of the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1947, to prevent evasion which would occur if voluntary dispositions were made by way of lease instead of by way of conveyance. Voluntary dispositions by way of lease <Col N="1307" /> are comparatively unknown.  However, there might be a diversion to this particular system of transfer if we did not have this protection.  The sub-section places the existing practice beyond doubt.</P>
      <P>Comment has been made on this&mdash; and I think this is the real trouble&mdash; that the Revenue Commissioners appear to be taking greater power than they ever had before and that that power is unchallengeable.  That is not the case.  I stated that the power that the Revenue Commissioners get under this sub-section to pass judgment on the inadequacy of the consideration is exactly similar to a power already given in respect of conveyances by the Finance Act of 1910.  Deputies doubt that.  I should like to put on record what that section is.  The Finance Act, 1910, Section 74 (5) reads in this way:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Any conveyance or transfer (not being a disposition made in favour of a purchaser or incumbrancer or other person in good faith and for valuable consideration) shall, for the purposes of this section, be deemed to be a conveyance or transfer operating as a voluntary disposition <i>inter vivos</i>, and (except where marriage is the consideration) the consideration for any conveyance or transfer shall not for this purpose be deemed to be valuable consideration.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;shall not for this purpose be deemed to be valuable consideration where the commissioners are of opinion that by reason of the inadequacy of the sum paid as consideration or other circumstances the conveyance or transfer confers a substantial benefit on the person to whom the property is conveyed or transferred.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Will Deputies compare this with the text to which objection has been made.</P>
      <P>That is further subject, of course, to this: that anybody who is dissatisfied with the amount assessed by the Revenue Commissioner has an appeal to the High Court.  That has not been interfered with.</P>

      <P>If everything done by that individual was revolutionary it may merit the term.  With the safeguard of the right of reference to the courts the sub-section cannot be considered as anything out of the ordinary. That is my answer to the points raised on sub-section (6) of Section 24.</P>
      <P>Sections 26 and 27&mdash;sub-section (4) in each of these sections&mdash;do contain certain drastic provisions.  We consider that we must have drastic provisions in place of what the courts have found by way of a flaw in the legislation which Deputy Aiken enacted. The Incorporated Law Society argue that there will be considerable trouble caused if property is sold by a company to a purchaser many years after the formation of the company.  They allege that an investigation would mean a considerable amount of trouble.  Those sub-sections apply only to companies that are within very special limits.  In Section 24 (4) (f) you will see that sub-section only applies to companies &ldquo;incorporated in this State after the 15th day of October, 1947&rdquo;.  It is not a question of going back over any long period.  The starting date of the incorporation is after the 15th October, 1947. The date of the formation is the date of incorporation or a date near it.  That should not present any great difficulty. The difficulty will increase as the years go back.  I want to make the point that as the years roll on, if this is going to remain, then the number of years that can be brought under review will be difficult.  I hope that it will be possible to dispense with this tax eventually. It is a tax I would aim at getting rid of.  I am thinking of the prior claims that there are as regards this taxation; take the income-tax code alone, such as increased allowances bringing them more into some sort of consonance with the present value of money and in particular reducing the general level of taxation particularly on the income-tax side. While I express the view here that this tax should disappear and I should like to see the day when I can get rid of it, that ought not to prompt any expectation of giving a very near date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1309" /> With regard to the other matters, companies within the Control of Manufactures Act are entitled to 5 per cent. benefit.  If Deputies will look at Section 24, sub-section (4), paragraph (e) they will see that any company that comes within the Control of Manufactures Act is not affected.  The companies who will be affected will, in the main, be private limited companies where the shareholders are few and where transfers of shares are, in the ordinary case&mdash;not where evasion is being attempted&mdash;very infrequent.</P>

      <P>I would rather let this run for a year and see what is discovered in the meantime.</P>
      <P>There is another question in regard to Section 26, sub-section (3).  That is intended to cover cases where property is purchased by a company, with a majority of the shares held by Irish citizens, but where at a later date the company sells or transfers the whole property, or any part of it to, say, an alien who has provided the purchase money.  Now if a person, having been an alien, is an Irish citizen at the date when the original purchase was made that person is all right.  If a purchase is made at a particular time, because say the moment is ripe to purchase, for an alien, if the alien secures the purchase by a company qualified under the terms of the Act with the intention of transferring to a person, not properly qualified&mdash;at a later date that person may have hopes of becoming an Irish citizen before the date of the transfer is effected to him&mdash;we think we ought to date the impact of the tax to the particular moment of the original purchase.  That is the purpose of sub-section (3).  It is somewhat involved and it may appear to be drastic.</P>

      <P>That point was not raised with me and I have not had time to study it.  This is an extremely technical matter and I do not move at <Col N="1310" /> all easily in this area.  I am confining myself to the points put to me.  I think these were the points that were raised mainly in detail.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ruttledge raised the point that this is a new tax.  It is not a new tax.  When the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1947, was passed it was definitely understood that the heading &ldquo;conveyance or transfer or sale of any property&rdquo; covered everything.  The courts discovered that it did not.  The courts discovered that the draft that was made in Deputy Aiken's time did not carry out Deputy Aiken's intentions. I am putting Deputy Aiken's intentions into effect and I should possibly say &ldquo;God forgive me.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The situation with regard to this tax has been discussed in general.  With regard to the 25 per cent., my personal view is that it is a bad tax.  It possibly runs counter to the views that have been expressed otherwise in the House.  Discriminatory taxation of this kind is bad, and there ought to be some special reason to justify a tax of this kind.  The whole trend of international opinion as seen in various treaties, as well as the opinions expressed at international gatherings where tax matters are discussed are all against discriminatory taxation. I believe that, even if we desired to carry on the tax, the pressure of world opinion and of our association with other international units, would drive us away from this tax.  At a fairly early date, apart altogether from being driven away from it by pressure, I hope that we will get rid of it on our own, if there was not a scandal that had to be met or any abuse to be countered though I think those days have passed.  This 25 per cent. tax is not very valuable from the point of view of revenue.  There is a certain onerous duty in administering it.  We would be well rid of it, but for the time being we are carrying it on to see whether the yield so far associated with it may not have been lessened to an extraordinary degree in the peculiar circumstances attendant on its imposition and on the early years of its trial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the 5 per cent. tax, it has been suggested that I have quoted <Col N="1311" /> certain remarks of Deputy Aiken, but that I did not quote the whole speech. I would refer the Deputy to Volume 108 of the Dáil Debates, at the bottom of column 1070.  I intervened and I asked: &ldquo;To cheapen houses?&rdquo; Deputy Aiken's reply was:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Not to cheapen houses&mdash;to get money from the vendors of houses. It will not cheapen houses.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Lest anybody might think that the Deputy was there inadvertently giving expression to his views, I would ask them to read what is contained in column 1182 of the same volume. There, Deputy Aiken was replying on the Financial Resolution dealing with the matter.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I did not say in the Budget statement, or at any time since or before, that this was going to have the effect of reducing the price of houses.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Could anything be clearer than that? It was not intended to have that purpose, and, in fact, I do not think it had that result.  The cheapening of houses has been achieved, in the main, by what has often been complained of in this House, by the fact that the banks and financial houses, generally in the country, decided in the last 14 months or so that they had possibly extended credit in far too liberal a fashion for the transfer of property, particularly house property, and they decided to restrict advances or accommodation for that purpose.  I think that is the main reason for this result of cheapening houses.  There is no doubt but that result has been brought about&mdash;that houses, if they are going at all, are becoming available at a very much less cost to the purchaser than they used to be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think all that is contained in the quotation which the Deputy himself gave&mdash;that is about the aim being to curtail expenditure on non-essentials.  I did not say at any time that this tax was going to have the effect of reducing the price of houses.  If house property had not gone down in value it would be much more difficult for me to retain this tax than it is at the moment.  There has been a decrease in the value of house property. When I met the deputation from the Incorporated Law Society, I put it to them, in an effort to find common ground from which we might start our argument, that the price of house property had very definitely gone down.  I think it was the chairman of the deputation who gave me an example.  He said that a house that would cost £5,000 a couple of years ago was now open for sale at £2,500, if buyers could be got.</P>
      <P>Let us take a £5,000 house of some years ago at 1 per cent.  The person buying that house would find that there would be other little additions in the way of remuneration of solicitors and others, but it would run probably to £5,050.  That house to-day, selling at £2,500 at 5 per cent., would add on £125 by way of stamp duty.  The person in the market to-day will pay £2,625 instead of £5,050 some years ago.  Other examples could be given.</P>
      <P>If I felt that this was creating a hardship on people who want to buy houses, or if the price level had kept at the old rate, it might be difficult to justify this tax.  But it is a very valuable tax.  The 5 per cent. rate alone is estimated to bring in £600,000. When I mention that figure, I believe it is a complete answer to the main part of the contention made to me by the deputation from the Incorporated Law Society.  They had written previously to say that the effect of the tax was that it brought house property transactions to a standstill.  I think that is ludicrous.  We regard it as a valuable tax, in that it brings in £600,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am told, looking at it in another way, that the number of transactions has not to any great extent decreased, but there has been some decrease, <Col N="1313" /> though it is not of any great significance. I have a feeling, and I think Deputies will agree that it is not an unreasonable feeling, that some of the hold-up in regard to sales of house property was due to this, that it was believed that this tax of 5 per cent. was under investigation and possibly people had the hope that it might disappear.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Cowan asked me to be clear about one thing, to say yes or no to the question: was the tax going to be kept on or would it be remitted?  I think it was the uncertainty that prevailed that led to some small stagnation in the sales.  After all, it is not every day that a Government throws away £6,000,000, the taxes on beer and tobacco, and follows that up by dropping £1,000,000 in income-tax. It is not easy in the same period to cast away a tax that is calculated to bring in £600,000.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), page 14:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  to insert before paragraph II the following new paragraph:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(II)  the following provisions shall have effect if the lease was stamped in respect of the greater amount before the passing of this Act:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  the stamp duty charged as of the greater amount shall be deemed to have been properly so charged and is hereby confirmed,</P>
      <P>(ii)  in determining the greater amount for the purposes of this paragraph, if the Revenue Commissioners were satisfied when the lease was stamped that any such statement as is referred to in Section 24 of this Act could, although not in fact contained in the lease, have properly been contained therein, that statement shall be deemed to be contained in the lease; and</P>
      <P>(b)  to delete the words &ldquo;in respect of the lesser amount&rdquo; in line 35.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 24 imposes certain rates which take effect only as from the passing of the Act.  Section 25 is complementary to that.  It covers various periods before the passing of the Act on or after 4th May, 1949.  As the clause stands it is divided in this way: it is intended to cover those people who either paid less than the amount now chargeable or did not pay anything at all.  On examination, there appeared to be a flaw in the section as it stood with relation to where people had paid the 5 per cent. because it might have been considered by the court that, when two specific things were mentioned and the third was not, the people who paid 5 per cent. were entitled to demand 4 per cent. back. The purpose of the amendment, therefore, is to meet the three cases, where a person has paid nothing, where a person has paid 1 per cent. and where a person has paid the total 5 per cent. If they have paid nothing we charge 5 per cent.; if they have paid 1 per <Col N="1317" /> cent. we charge them an extra 4 per cent., and if they have paid 5 per cent. we retain the 5 per cent.  That is the purpose of this amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As is customary and appropriate, I propose to review the activities of my Department over the past 12 months. <Col N="1319" /> Deputies are aware that the Social Welfare Act, 1948, was enacted and brought into operation during that period.  That Act had two main objects. The first was to make permanent the cash supplements formerly payable in all the schemes dealt with by the Act and merge them in the basic benefits, pensions and so forth to which they were applicable.  The schemes affected were old age and blind pensions, national health insurance, unemployment insurance, unemployment assistance and widows' and orphans' pensions (contributory and non-contributory). In the insurance schemes the contributions were increased so as to restore the insurance basis that obtained before the introduction of cash supplements.</P>
    <P>The second main object of the Act was to provide for the payment of generous increases to the recipients of old age and blind pensions and of widows' and orphans' (non-contributory) pensions.  When I became Minister I realised that something needed to be done immediately for the persons intended to benefit from those two services. My intentions were carried out in the Act by way of increased pensions and allowances and through modifications of the means tests, which, of course, also had the effect of making new claimants eligible.</P>
    <P>For old age and blind pensioners there was introduced a new weekly pension scale applicable to the whole country ranging from a maximum of 17/6 down to 5/-, and the limit of yearly means, above which no pension is payable, was increased from £39 5s. 0d. to £52 5s. 0d.  For blind persons the qualifying age was reduced from 30 to 21 years, and the means test was substantially modified so that any earnings of the blind person up to £52 yearly are now disregarded, as are also a further £39 if the person has a wife or dependent husband, and £26 in respect of each child aged under 16. Payments from local authorities under blind welfare schemes are also disregarded.</P>
    <P>Before the passing of the 1948 Act the weekly pension rates in urban areas, inclusive of cash payments, ranged from a maximum of 15/- down to 6/-. <Col N="1320" /> In rural areas the maximum was 12/6 and the minimum 3/6, with a possibility that the pensioner, if in necessitous circumstances, might get a further supplement, not exceeding 2/6, from the local public assistance authority (who could obtain recoupment of 75 per cent. of their expenditure on such cases from State funds).</P>
    <P>The new maximum weekly pension for a widow without dependent children is, under the Act of last year, 14/- in the urban areas, where formerly it was as low as 7/6, and could not exceed 11/6; in the rural area the same pension is 10/-, where formerly it was 8/-. For a widow with ten children the maximum weekly pension is now 58/-in the urban area, where formerly the rate of pension was as low as 43/6 and could not exceed 52/-; in the rural area the maximum pension for the same class of widow is now 54/- where it was formerly 32/6.</P>
    <P>Under the Act of 1948 there are now only two areas, as against four formerly, for the purpose of relating the amount of the pension to the pensioner's place of residence.</P>
    <P>The means test for widows' pensions was modified by disregarding the first 10/- of a widow's weekly earnings and also any sums, up to a maximum weekly sum of 10/-, received by the widow as voluntary contributions.</P>
    <P>The minimum qualifying age for a pension in the case of a widow who has no dependent children was, by the Act, reduced from 55 years to 48 years. This means that a widow who has her pension terminated when her last dependent child leaves school or attains the age of 16 years will now have her pension restored at the age of 48 years instead of having to wait until she becomes 55 years as formerly. The latest figures available show that 15,324 contributory pensions and 26,278 non-contributory pensions are in payment, that allowances are being paid in respect of 13,704 dependents of contributory pensioners and 10,867 dependents of persons receiving non-contributory pensions.</P>
    <P>The effect of the Social Welfare Act, 1948, is not yet fully reflected in available statistics.  At 31st March last the number of old age and blind pensions in payment was 153,507, and the weekly <Col N="1321" /> cost was £129,508.  These figures represent increases of 4,093 in the numbers of pensioners, and £35,286 (or 37.45 per cent.) in the rate of expenditure over those for the corresponding date last year.  Deputies may be interested to note that at the 25th March, 1949, 132,014 pensioners were receiving 17/6 per week; 9,711 were receiving 15/- per week; 7,796 12/6 per week; 2,485 10/-per week; 890 7/6 per week; and 470 5/- per week.  These figures include 5,516 persons receiving blind pensions. As regards widows' and orphans' pensions, the effect of the 1948 Act as at the 7th January last, when the Act came into operation, was to increase the number of non-contributory pensions in operation by 4,100 or 18.3 per cent. to 26,541 and the weekly value of those pensions by £6,622 or 62.3 per cent. to £17,244.</P>
    <P>During the year the legislation dealing with Workmen's Compensation was amended by the provisions of the Workmen's Compensation (Amendment) Act, 1948, which was brought into operation as from the 1st January, 1949.  This enactment extended the scope of the legislation to non-manual workers with remuneration exceeding £350 but not exceeding £500 a year. It raised the maximum applicable to weekly payments of compensation for both total and partial incapacity from 37/6 to 50/-.  Persons still in receipt of weekly payments of compensation under the Acts prior to the Act of 1934 became entitled under the Act to a supplementary allowance equal to two-thirds of their basic weekly payments, subject to a maximum total payment of 50/- a week in each case. The Act, in addition, empowered the Circuit Court, which is the authority for deciding all claims and questions under the legislation, to review weekly payments being made otherwise than under a court order or registered agreement so as to reflect fluctuations in wage rates; it had been held judicially that, in the absence of such order or agreement, the court could not exercise the power of review provided in the Act of 1934.  The intention in this new provision is to enable the many recipients of voluntary payments, that is, payments being made otherwise than under a court order or <Col N="1322" /> registered agreement, to secure an increase in their payments where the wage rates for the occupation have gone up to the required degree of more than 20 per cent.  In view of the almost universal rise in wage rates in recent years, this is a most important provision from the worker's point of view.  So far as I am aware, the Act is working smoothly and has proved of great benefit to injured workmen.</P>
    <P>During the year I made reciprocal arrangements with the British Minister of National Insurance, and the Northern Ireland Minister of Labour and National Insurance, covering sickness, maternity and unemployment benefits and the special position of mariners.</P>
    <P>The agreement with Great Britain provides for continuation of title to sickness benefit for a period of six months for persons who change their residence from one country to the other and for crediting the contributions paid under one scheme to secure title to benefit under the other.</P>
    <P>The agreement with Northern Ireland is on similar lines, with the additional provision that, where a person is resident on one side of the Border and working on the other, contributions paid under the laws applicable to the place of employment may be credited for the purpose of benefit under the laws applying to the place of residence.</P>
    <P>The reciprocal arrangements with Great Britain and Northern Ireland covering maternity benefit follow the same lines as in the case of sickness benefit.</P>
    <P>During the year I also made a reciprocal arrangement regarding unemployment benefit with the British Minister of National Insurance under which unemployment benefit may be received in either country in respect of certain contributions paid in the other country.  This arrangement was brought into operation on the 6th April last. I may mention that this is the first time that a reciprocal arrangement on this subject has been made between the two countries.</P>
    <P>Under the arrangement, a person who has been insurably employed in Great Britain for at least 26 weeks and <Col N="1323" /> is unemployed here for a period of at least 12 days will have 26 of his British contributions transferred to the Irish Unemployment Fund, provided that the satisfies the contribution conditions for unemployment benefit in Great Britain and has not exhausted his right to unemployment benefit there.  On every subsequent occasion on which a person returns here following payment of at least 26 contributions in Great Britain, a further transfer of contributions will be made on the same conditions.</P>
    <P>Similarly when a person who has at least 26 unexhausted contributions in the Irish Unemployment Fund goes to Great Britain and is unable to obtain unemployment benefit there either because he does not satisfy the contribution conditions for unemployment benefit in Great Britain or because he has exhausted his right to unemployment benefit there, 26 of his unexhausted contributions in the Irish Unemployment Fund will, if he is unemployed for a period of at least 12 days, be transferred to Great Britain for payment of unemployment benefit there up to a maximum of 26 days.  On every subsequent occasion on which a person returns to Great Britain following an interval of at least 28 days here a further transfer of contributions will be made on the same conditions, provided that he has received unemployment benefit in respect of all Irish contributions previously transferred to Great Britain.</P>
    <P>For the purpose of satisfying the British condition for the receipt of unemployment benefit which requires contributions to have been paid or credited, a person who goes or returns to Great Britain and pays 26 contributions there will be given the necessary credits.</P>
    <P>Increased benefit for a dependent wife or husband of a person in receipt of unemployment benefit in one country will be payable even though the wife or husband, as the case may be, is resident in the other country.</P>
    <P>As regards Northern Ireland, I made a corresponding arrangement with the Minister of Labour and National Insurance on the 12th April last, which was brought into operation here on the <Col N="1324" /> 14th April.  This arrangement was the first of its kind ever completed with Northern Ireland in respect of unemployment benefit and ends the position where persons resident on one side of the Border and employed on the other side have never been able when unemployed in their place of residence to obtain unemployment benefit for the unemployment insurance contributions paid by them in their place of employment. Persons who, while resident here, were employed in Northern Ireland and paid their contributions into the Northern Ireland Insurance Fund, and persons who, while resident in Northern Ireland, were employed here and paid their contributions into the Irish Unemployment Fund will, if they so choose, have the contributions paid by them since the 5th July, 1948, transferred from one fund to the other and thus made available for the payment of unemployment benefit in their place of residence.</P>
    <P>The arrangement will also enable persons ordinarily resident here who were employed in Northern Ireland and while so employed were temporarily resident there for a period insufficient to fulfil the condition for the receipt of unemployment benefit which requires five years' residence in the United Kingdom to have the unemployment insurance contributions paid by them into the Northern Ireland Insurance Fund since the 5th July, 1948, transferred to the Irish Unemployment Fund and made available for the payment of unemployment benefit here if, on return home, they are unemployed and desire to have their contributions transferred.</P>
    <P>The agreements concerning the social insurance of mariners provide that, in the case of a mariner employed on a ship trading between Ireland, Northern Ireland and Great Britain, the Irish Health and Pension Insurance Acts, Unemployment Insurance Acts and Workmen's Compensation Acts will apply to the mariner if he is ordinarily resident in Ireland, and the British or Northern Ireland Acts will apply to him if he is ordinarily resident in Great Britain or Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>In the case of a foreign-going ship, however, the position will be that, if <Col N="1325" /> the ship is owned in Ireland, the mariner will be insured under the Irish Acts and, if the ship is owned in Great Britain or Northern Ireland, he will be insured under the British or under the Northern Ireland Acts.</P>
    <P>A radio officer, who is paid by some person other than the owner of the ship on which he is employed, will be treated as employed by that person and will be insured under the laws of the country in which that person has his principal place of business.</P>
    <P>Certain mariners not previously insured against unemployment owing to the absence of reciprocal arrangements may now qualify for benefit either under the scheme in operation in Ireland or the schemes in operation in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The inter-Departmental Committee responsible for examining the trend of employment and unemployment has now completed its work for the years 1947 and 1948.  The report, which will be published as soon as possible, is the fourteenth of a series of booklets on this subject covering the period 1926 to 1948.</P>
    <P>I would like to give the House some figures showing the number of persons in insurable employment for each year since 1938 calculated from the income of the National Health Insurance Fund.</P>
    <P>In 1938 the estimated average number employed weekly was 416,000; 1939, 417,200; 1940, 406,000; 1941, 401,000; 1942, 399,100; 1943, 397,600; 1944, 405,800; 1945, 416,900; 1946, 442,600; 1947, 468,500; 1948, 485,900.  As will be seen, the estimated average weekly number of persons employed in insurable occupations in 1948 exceeded the number for 1947 by 17,400.  For the purpose of this comparison due allowance is made for the extension of the scope of insurance to non-manual workers whose income exceeds a rate of £250 a year but not £500 a year.</P>
    <P>The Committee of Experts of the International Social Security Association met in Dublin in January, 1949, under the chairmanship of Senator Jauniaux (Belgium).  The meeting was attended by representatives of Belgium, Switzerland, Czechoslovakia, France, Denmark, Holland, Italy and Ireland.  In addition, my Department <Col N="1326" /> was represented by an observer.  Each representative was asked to supply national monographs referring to the two items on the agenda, namely, the collection of social insurance contributions and the financing of social security. The International Labour Office participated in the preparation and organisation of the meeting.</P>
    <P>It may be necessary that the integration of the National Health Insurance Society into the Department should take place at a date earlier than I contemplated in my speech on last year's Estimates.  Deputies will understand that this integration is a complicated matter, involving varied points of organisation and procedure.  Essentially the problem is ancillary to the main problem of bringing the new scheme into operation, so that no question of principle would arise if the integration took place beforehand.  If that course were followed I can see that it would obviate many administrative difficulties at the inception of the new scheme. There is no need to go fully into this matter at the moment.  If I do proceed on the lines I have indicated, new legislation would be necessary, and the opportunity will then be given of discussing details.</P>
    <P>I referred last year to the difficulties arising out of the scattered location of the Department's offices in Dublin. Some progress has since been made towards easing these difficulties, but there is little prospect, in present conditions, of achieving in the immediate future the ideal of a central headquarters office in Dublin.</P>
    <P>During the past year the staff of one of the headquarters branches, which had previously been spread over three different buildings, were brought under one roof with a considerable gain in efficiency.  Some progress was also made in furtherance of the policy of housing in one building local staffs of the Department in certain provincial towns.</P>
    <P>As a result of a survey undertaken in my Department early in 1948, it became apparent that the voluntary institutions working for the benefit of the blind were finding it impossible to meet the increased cost of maintainance, education and training of the blind on <Col N="1327" /> their restricted income.  That income consisted principally of annual contributions paid by local authorities in respect of blind persons admitted at their request, and grants from the Exchequer in respect of each blind inmate, pupil or worker in the institutions.</P>
    <P>I appealed to the local authorities to assist the institutions by raising the amount of their contributions, and I am glad to say that, without hesitation, they agreed to increase the amount from £30 to £40 a year for each inmate for whom they were responsible.  In addition, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, I was able to give substantial increases in the different State grants.  These were £40 a year for each workshop employee and for each pupil in a school residence, instead of £20, and £20 a year for each blind worker in a hostel and each inmate in a home, instead of £5 and £13, respectively, which were previously payable.</P>
    <P>Arising out of the survey already mentioned, it became apparent that there was a lack of uniformity in the methods adopted by the different institutions and associations dealing with the welfare of the blind.  The functions of the existing organisations overlapped in certain respects, and it was considered advisable to establish a new body which would aim at the centralisation of their activities and the promotion of uniformity in matters relating to treatment, education and training, and which I could consult on relevant matters as the occasion arose.</P>
    <P>With the consent of the Minister for Finance, I set up a consultative council on blind welfare under the chairmanship of Alderman Martin O'Sullivan, T.D.  The council consists of representatives of the National Council for the Blind of Ireland; National League of the Blind of Ireland; St. Mary's Asylum for Female Blind; St. Joseph's Asylum for Male Blind; Richmond Institute for the Blind; the County and City of Cork Institution for the Industrious Blind and the Irish Association for the Blind.  Representatives of the Archbishops of Dublin (Dr. McQuaid and Dr. Barton), together with representatives <Col N="1328" /> of the Departments of Education, Health, Local Government and Social Welfare, were also appointed.</P>
    <P>The council had its first meeting in October, 1948, and appointed from amongst its members four subcommittees to examine the problems relating to the prevention of blindness, education, industry and general purposes, respectively.  Since its formation, the council has met on six occasions, while meetings of the subcommittees have been held as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>An interim recommendation relating to outdoor apprentices and trainees has been submitted to me by the council and is being considered.  I expect that the council will have many useful recommendations to make, and I am looking forward to receiving their first full report.</P>
    <P>The scheme for the provision of meals of a simple nature in schools in county boroughs, urban districts and towns and also in certain Gaeltacht districts was continued during the year.  In the Gaeltacht areas 2,220,497 school meals were provided in the year 1947-48 while 10,408,558 meals were provided in the other areas mentioned. I am satisfied that these meals are beneficial to the health of the children, and many testimonies to that effect have been received by my Department.</P>
    <P>During the past year the variety and quality of the meals have been improved in some areas, and my Department has kept the position under constant review.  I would like to see a more general improvement in the variety and quality of the food supplied, and I hope that the local authorities will do whatever they can towards that end.</P>
    <P>The draft White Paper containing proposals for a new social insurance scheme is now before the Government. When the Government reaches its decision thereon, the paper will, after any necessary amendments are made, be immediately printed and published.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1329" /> Steps are already in train to prepare the legislation to give effect to the proposals. This will be a heavy task, but there will be no avoidable delay in completing it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in giving a very full review of the activities of his Department for the year, did not give us perhaps as much information as we would like to have got on the last point he mentioned.  He did not give us any indication of when he thought the Government would agree or would come to agreement on this scheme and when we may hope to see its publication, whether it would be a matter of weeks or months.  Usually, from time to time, he has said &ldquo;in two months' time,&rdquo; but whether he is sticking to these two months or not I do not know. When this Department was set up, I think that the principal object in doing so was to co-ordinate the various activities in regard to social services. If it was only intended to carry on and do some of the things the Minister has done during the year, such as to increase certain individual social services, that could have been done without creating a new Department.  The making of these reciprocal arrangements that were made could also have been done without going to the trouble and expense of setting up a new Department. The idea in setting it up was to co-ordinate all the social services, the object being to see that the same staff would deal with all social services, and that at the local centres, there would be a unification of the staffs there&mdash;one staff and one inspector to deal with the family concerned, whether it was the case of an old age pension, a widows' pension or sickness or unemployment benefit, and also that there would be one stamp which would entitle the contributor to the various benefits that come under social insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How, as I say, we know very little as to what progress has been made. The Minister, in the last sentence or two, said that he has now sent the White Paper to the Government and was preparing legislation.  There were anomaies that had to be dealt with when this Department was set up.  I do not know whether the Minister has <Col N="1330" /> dealt with them or not.  If he has, well he at least took sufficient time to do it. There is, as we know, a different waiting period for the person who draws unemployment benefit and the person who draws sickness benefit.  The benefits are somewhat different because, in some cases, the family is taken into account and in other cases it is not, and dependents are taken into account and in other cases they are not.  Then the duration of the benefit varies.  For instance, in the case of unemployment, no matter how many stamps a person may have, he can only go a certain distance, and then he stops.  There are various anomalies of that kind which it was necessary to correct.</P>
    <P>That was one of the objects in setting up this Department.  Then, of course, there was the question of applying the best scheme the country could afford. The Minister will undoubtedly claim that he has done that, and that he has put a scheme that the country can afford to the Government, and the Government, we are told, are considering that&mdash;a scheme to include every social service and every social insurance and all those who need it and who can be administratively covered. Administration is a difficulty, we all admit, in some of these cases.  It takes some consideration to decide what particular classes will be put into a social insurance scheme or be left in a social assistance scheme.  We are rather at a disadvantage in discussing this by reason of the fact that the Minister was not able to give us some indication on some of these points because we are discussing, as it were, a Department that was set up two years ago that has not done the duty that it was set up to do in the meantime.</P>
    <P>Now, the last time that we had a discussion on this Vote the Minister, when winding up the debate, gave a very rosy account of what he had done in the time he was there, and he deprecated very much what was done by Fianna Fáil.  It is true, of course, that, in social welfare, whatever Minister is there, it is almost certain he will add on to what is already there, and so it is very easy for the Minister to say: &ldquo;I gave so and so; you gave less.&rdquo;  We have to judge it more or less on the progress.  It would probably take a <Col N="1331" /> Party like the Fine Gael Party to lessen the social services as they did on one occasion, but they are not likely to do so again.</P>
    <P>We may take it for granted that any Party that comes into power in this country is going to progress in the way of increasing and not decreasing these services.  On that basis I would like to remind the Minister that on the very first day the Department started to function there was an Order made increasing all the social benefits on that day, which was the 1st of April, 1947.  When the Minister came along later to increase the old age pensions, and so on, he had to delay their implementation for months and months because he had administrative difficulties. We did not appear to meet those difficulties when we were there.</P>
    <P>We brought in a scheme on 1st April, 1947, the first day that the Department commenced to function, and we increased the benefits on that day, and from that day since, in the case of sickness and unemployment, both unemployment insurance and unemployment assistance, and widows' and orphans' pensions, by 50 per cent.  In the case of disability, I think they were increased 100 per cent.  As Deputies are aware, where a person is sick for a long period and where it looks like a permanent illness, it is called disability. The benefit was increased by 100 per cent.  It was very poor before that and, in fact, it is not sufficient yet.  In the case of old age pensions, they were increased by 5/- in urban areas and 2/6 in the rural areas and the local authorities the Minister mentioned were authorised to give another 2/6, if they thought it necessary, and they were recouped to the extent of 75 per cent. of the amount they gave out under this head.</P>
    <P>The cost to the taxpayer of that Order making all these increases was £2,000,000.  We should, in all fairness, keep these figures in mind when we are comparing, if we want to compare, what was done in the various years. That was done in 1947 and I want Deputies to remember that, roughly, £2,200,000 came out of taxation.  In other words, the contributors to <Col N="1332" /> national health insurance and unemployment insurance, although their benefits were raised by 50 per cent. their contributions were not raised; the contributions were left as they had been before that.</P>
    <P>That was done early in April and then it was announced by me that I expected to be able to publish a White Paper on the comprehensive scheme 12 months from that date&mdash;that would be in April, 1948, about 14 months ago.  I expected it might appear then.  If the Minister is of the same mind now as he was on the last occasion when we discussed these matters here, he will probably say very little was done when I was in that Department.  Well, it was a new Department and the object was to co-ordinate all these services and bring in a comprehensive scheme.  The first thing we had to do was to get the figures on which to base our comprehensive scheme.  Before we could do that we had to get an actuary.  There were other officials needed, too, but we had to get an actuary to examine the number of people of various ages, the number of employed, the trend of employment and to produce the figures on which a scheme could be built.</P>
    <P>That actuary produced the figures and it was before the Christmas of 1947 that these figures were available. It has been said by members of the present Government that one of the delays in this matter was because they had to scrap the scheme that was there when Mr. Norton came in.  I do not know to what they are referring.  The figures were there.  The actuary had calculated that if we were to give 24/-or 25/&mdash; I do not know what figure he took; it does not matter much, and he probably took 20/-, 24/- or 25/&mdash;-and if we were to give that by way of sickness benefit, it would cost so much a week on every person.  The same applied to unemployment.  If you were to give 20/- or 25/- or 30/- a week for unemployment benefit, he calculated it would cost so much on every worker.  The same applied to old age pensions at 65 or 70 and the same applied to widows' and orphans' pensions. All these figures were available.</P>
    <P>That was not a scheme and there was nothing to be scrapped there.  These <Col N="1333" /> figures were ready for the Minister to work upon.  So far as the scheme was concerned, I asked the officials working on it and producing these figures to start preparing parts of the White Paper.  Every Deputy will realise that if they were preparing a White Paper on that subject there would be some introduction.  There would be some reference to the history of social services in this country, how they started and what stage had been reached. There would be a review of social services or social welfare in other countries.  These chapters were being prepared before I left the Department. They could be prepared by a person without referring to the figures that were available or knowing what was going to be done.  The next chapter would deal with the proposals and the financing and that would finish the White Paper.</P>
    <P>Where was the scheme that was scrapped?  The Ministers said they had to scrap the scheme and start all over again.  There was no necessity to scrap the actuary's figures.  They are there to work upon.  If they wanted further figures from the actuary they could ask for them, but there was nothing to be scrapped.  One thing is certain, that the excuse that they had to scrap what was there and start all over again was just nonsense, just pure make-up, a poor excuse for not going on with the work.  The figures were there and I remember it was calculated it would take so many pence to pay out sickness benefit at a certain level.  If any Minister said: &ldquo;I want that sickness benefit 2/6 or 5/- higher&rdquo;, he could have been told what it would cost in two or three minutes, not two or three days.  In fact, he could do the calculations himself in two or three minutes.  In the same way, if he wanted to increase the figure for old age pensions or any other service, it could be done in a few minutes. That could be done for marriage grants, and death and maternity benefits. It could be done for the various services any Minister would like to add to if he could and if he thought the country could afford it.  They could calculate the number of pence that would have to be contributed for every week worked by every person in insurable employment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1334" /> The figures were there and they could easily build on them.  There was no great difficulty in working on that basis.  The only thing was that any Minister might have his own idea as to what the level of benefit should be. He would have at least an idea of the level of benefit he would like to aim at, and if the Minister who is now in control wanted to stick to the scheme put up by the Labour Party in 1947, he could have applied these figures to cover every point in that labour programme of 1947.  His officials could have told him in a day what the total cost of the scheme would be, whether it would be £30,000,000, £40,000,000 or £45,000,000.  That would have told him what number of people it was calculated would be working and what he could get from every worker by a levy of 1/-, 2/-, 3/- or 4/- per week.  He could then make up his mind as to what contribution would be necessary from the Exchequer.  As far as computing the figures is concerned there should be no delay.  It is quite a simple matter and there should be no trouble about it.  I admit that there are matters that would require consideration. For instance, one would have to consider what classes one would take in.  It is easy to take in the classes under the contributory scheme because they are contributing now.  The obligation there can be put upon the employer to see that the card is stamped. That system has been working quite satisfactorily.  To go beyond that would require consideration, because taking in the classes that are self-employed is not quite so easy.  It is not so easy to get the small farmer or the small tradesman to stamp his own or his son's card every week.  The administration of the scheme in that particular respect might be both troublesome and costly.  It is a matter for consideration whether or not such classes should be taken in.</P>
    <P>There are other simple matters involved.  We know what the marriage benefit will cost.  It is easy to make up one's mind as to whether or not we can afford to include that with the other benefits.  When I was in office I was very keen to have that included. If the Minister is of the same opinion <Col N="1335" /> now as his Party was in 1947 he would also include that particular class.  He should have no great difficulty in making up his mind.  The cost of all these different schemes is available. Practically every time the Minister was asked about this White Paper since February, 1948, he replied that it would be ready in a couple of months' time.  Apparently he did believe it could be done in a couple of months.  I also believed that.  It is done now at any rate and we are finished with the &ldquo;couple of months' time&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave us a review of what was done during the year on the last occasion we discussed social welfare. He gave a very rosy account of what he had done for old age pensioners.  I think everyone would agree that the Minister should do everything he possibly can for the old age pensioners.  It is no use the Minister thinking that we are disappointed because these old people have got some increase.  When I was Minister it never dawned upon my consciousness that the then Opposition would be disappointed if we did something for these old people.  The more we can afford to give them the better it will be.  I am surprised that the Minister should try to make so much capital out of what he has done for them.  I want to draw his attention in this connection to the fact that in the year 1947, when I was Minister for Health, old age pensions were increased by 5/- in the urban areas and by 2/6 in the rural areas with liberty to the local authorities to grant a further 2/6 where they thought fit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Everyone who made application for that extra 2/6 got it in the City of Dublin without any inquiry. Old age pensioners in the urban area were brought up by 5/- per week and by half-a-crown in the rural areas.  The Minister has brought those who got an increase of 5/- up by half-a-crown and those who got an increase of half-a-crown up by 5/-.  Let us split the difference.  He has done just about as much as we did for the old age pensioners.  He did the same for the widows and orphans, but he left the other classes.  We increased both the sickness and the unemployment benefit&mdash;insurance and assistance&mdash;and the Minister has left them where they were with regard to benefits.  Not only has he done that, but he has worsened their position to a large extent by taking contributions from them.  We did not take contributions from them when we increased the benefit in 1947.</P>
      <P>I suppose the Minister is entitled to make the best case he can, even if he does not believe in it himself; he has made the case that they are better off by paying these increased contributions because they are thereby better entitled to their unemployment and sickness benefit.  But, simultaneously with doing that, he gave increases to the old age pensioners and to the widows and orphans without asking for any contribution at all from them.  He knows as well as any Deputy that once old age pensions reach 17/6 they will never again become less.  The same applies to all other social insurance benefit.  Once they reach a certain level they will never again go down, no matter what Government is in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister did not increase the sickness and unemployment benefit, but he did increase the contributions. Because of that the increases that he gave to the old age pensioners and to the widows and orphans did not cost the Exchequer nearly so much as did the increase we gave in 1947, because the total cost of what the Minister did in 1948 is, roughly, about the same as what we gave in 1947.  Our increases came through the Minister for Finance from taxation.  Half the cost of what the Minister has done comes by way of contributions from those who are insured <Col N="1337" /> against sickness or unemployment. That, of course, is divided between the employer and the employee. Any deficit that appeared was taken out of the widows' and orphans' pension fund.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>You might add also that it was the first increase for 16 years and you gave no increase of any kind during the war years.  Complete the picture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <P>In the 1932 election part of the Fianna Fáil programme was the introduction of an Old Age Pensions Bill which had been defeated in this House by the Cumann na nGaedheal Government and its friends.  That Bill was one of the first introduced in this House when we took office in 1932.  It is a pity the Minister was not so quick to implement his promises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Between 1932 and 1948&mdash; 16 years&mdash;you increased pensions by 2/6.  We increased them by 5/- in 11 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows that in that period the amount contributed to social services from taxation went up from £4,000,000 to over £12,000,000 per year.  When the Minister has increased his social services by £8,000,000 he can begin to talk.  If he does what he promised to do in 1947 he will increase it, not by £8,000,000 but by £40,000,000.  We are all glad to see the old age pensioners get an increase, but it is pitiable to see the Minister reduced to the position of bragging about what he has done for these old age pensioners in bringing them up to 17/6 a week when one compares that figure with what was promised to them in 1947.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1947 we were told that if the Labour Party came into office, which they did&mdash;the Minister has now the Department of Social Welfare in his hands&mdash;they would give the old age <Col N="1338" /> pensioners at 65, 25/- a week, but if he did not retire at 65 and went on working, for every year he worked, he would later get an additional 2/- with his old age pension.  The Minister, however, put a limit on that.  He was afraid that a man might go on working until he was 90 and so he said that the total addition would not exceed 10/-. So if a man went on working until 70 and then took his pension he would have 35/- a week.  If his wife had not reached the old age pension age she would get 20/-, and if they had two children, which of course they might, under 16 they would get 7/6 each.  That is what the Minister thought in 1947 when he was in the irresponsible position of making proposals to the country and did not know what they might cost.  Now he knows what they might cost.  Now he knows how hard it is to get a few pounds out of the Minister for Finance, but he comes along here and proclaims to the House, to the country and to the world, that he has done more for the old age pensioners than Fianna Fáil had done in 16 years which, of course, is true because he added to what was done by Fianna Fáil, but yet all the pensioner now gets is 17/6.</P>
    <P>Take again the man I have already spoken of, the man of 70 years of age whose wife is not getting the pension and who has two children.  Under the Labour programme of 1947, he was going to get £3 10s. a week; he is actually getting 17/6.  Is that not a measure of the difference between the Minister's promises when he was leader of the Labour Party in opposition and of his performances now that he is in charge of the Ministry?  He promised a certain person in certain circumstances £3 10s. a week; that person now gets 17/6.  I would not mind if he came to the House and said: &ldquo;It is not too much but it is as much as we can afford&rdquo;; he does not do that but tries to make out to the country that there was no Minister in this country ever like him because of what he had done for the old age pensioners.  He boasts that he has done more than any other Minister had done or is ever likely to do for these pensioners.  I suppose he is taking a chance on it that old age pensioners will forget what was <Col N="1339" /> promised to them in 1947 and perhaps it is as well that they should forget.</P>
    <P>Of course it is not every old age pensioner who would have a wife, who was not herself pensionable and two children under 16.  It was an exceptional case but, although exceptional, it was the case that got into the labour programme because it was a rosy case. Imagine a man like that saying: &ldquo;If the Labour Party get in I will get £3 10s. per week and I am only getting 15/- now from Fianna Fáil.&rdquo;  Why would he not vote for the Labour Party?  That was the rosy case quoted by the Labour Party in 1947 when they issued their programme on social services.</P>
    <P>Take the ordinary pensioner who is over 70 and his wife who is also eligible for a pension.  They would get 35/-plus 25/- if the Labour Programme had been carried out.  Now they are getting 35/- instead of £3 a week.  However, we shall wait for the White Paper when I suppose these things will be put right.  I am quite sure that the Minister, now that he is in the position of Minister for Social Welfare, will implement this programme, and carry it to its conclusion.  But he should wait until then, when he will be able to say to the House, to his constituents and to the constituents of the other Labour Deputies that they have carried out their promises before he comes in here to boast to the old age pensioners of what he has done for them.  He should not boast of what he has done already because it is not very much.</P>
    <P>He told you already that to give these meagre increases to the old age pensioner he took contributions off the sick and unemployed, or at least off those who were insured against sickness and unemployment.  I read with interest this programme issued by the Labour Party in 1947 and agreed with everything in it and I said to myself: &ldquo;It is a grand programme if it can be financed.&rdquo;  No doubt the same idea occurred to whoever wrote it and he said: &ldquo;There will be no extra cost because everybody will be working. There will be no unemployment, everybody will be better housed.  There will be better health so that there will be no sickness.  Of course there will be <Col N="1340" /> no widows and it will not cost anything extra.&rdquo;  In fact, it was said in the Labour programme that there would be some small extra taxation&mdash;a very small increase in the income-tax of the very wealthy.  They were not satisfied merely with mentioning the wealthy. They said the &ldquo;very wealthy&rdquo;.  Here is the Minister who promised pounds a week of an increase for old age pensioners, no increases in cost except for the very wealthy and he comes in now with an increase of 2/6 for old age pensioners, and takes 6d. a week off the income-tax of the working man who has a few pounds a week and the same amount off the income-tax of the wealthy.  How can he reconcile these things?  At any rate he should not talk about what he has done for the old age pensioners until he presents his comprehensive scheme.  Of course I do not want to remind the House that he robbed the widows' fund as well.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked about the means test.  The Minister on the last occasion on which he spoke said that when I was Minister I resisted a motion from these benches&mdash;the Fine Gael Party brought in the motion&mdash;to alter the means test in certain respects.  He talks now about altering the means test.  He has altered it to a certain extent.  His alteration means that a person between certain margins of means can now get an addition to the old age pension that he could not get before but the person who could not get a full old age pension before cannot get it even now.  The means test is the same as far as he is concerned.  It is altered only to a very slight extent to give a few shillings to people who were ruled out before.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us about the reciprocal arrangements.  I am glad that they have been concluded but lest anybody might conclude&mdash;I think the Minister did not go out of his way to make the matter very lucid&mdash;from what the Minister said that he was entirely responsible for these reciprocal arrangements, I want to say that these reciprocal arrangements have been discussed with the British for a long time back.  Some time in 1947 the British told us that they were agreeable in principle to it but that they had no power or authority to conclude such <Col N="1341" /> an arrangement until they got legislative sanction.  That legislative sanction was contained in the Act which dealt with the whole comprehensive scheme in England.  That Act came into operation piecemeal on appointed days.  When a certain part of that Act came into operation, they were in a position to conclude reciprocal arrangements. I am glad that the Minister was able to take the opportunity of concluding those agreements, because they will remove a certain amount of hardship suffered by the people who are passing back and forward between the two countries.  Did the Minister say that he may have to integrate the national insurance scheme into the Department before the comprehensive scheme is brought in, or that he would leave it until the comprehensive scheme would come along?  If it is before, I take it that legislation will be necessary and the matter can be discussed then.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister has given a very fair résumé of the work which he and his Department have been doing in the past 12 months.  I regret that Deputy Dr. Ryan should <Col N="1345" /> have taken the Minister's statement as a challenge as to what had been accomplished by the last Government so far as the provision of social services is concerned.  The Minister simply dealt in a very short and concise manner with the various benefits enjoyed by old age pensioners, blind pensioners, unemployed people, people suffering from tuberculosis and other diseases.  In addition, the Minister referred to the number engaged in remunerative employment at the present time and I am sure Deputies were very pleased to hear there has been a remarkable increase in the numbers of those who have found employment in industrial occupations.  That is a good omen so far as the future prosperity of the country is concerned.</P>
      <P>With regard to the delay in the production of what is known as the White Paper dealing with the proposed comprehensive social welfare scheme, I take the view that matters of that kind which affect materially the economic position of this country should receive great attention and preparation before they are introduced.  I never approved of any Government or any Minister bringing in measures at short notice which they think will be popular.  It may be all right to introduce measures of that sort, but Ministers have to consider the other side of the question&mdash; the capacity of the people to provide these services and to finance them. Because of that, the Minister is right, no matter what may be said to the contrary, in taking his time and examining this very important question from every angle before introducing even the White Paper and making it available to the House.  If the Minister is able to produce the White Paper in a few months' time and if, after examining that White Paper, the Executive come to the conclusion that the country will be able to afford it, well and good, but I do not think it is wise for members opposite to hurry the Minister, so far as the issuing of this White Paper is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say also that I regret that comparisons should be made between what was accomplished by the late Government and what has been accomplished by the present Government.  It <Col N="1346" /> is time we got away from that line of criticism on Estimates.  Rightly or wrongly, wisely or unwisely, the people have decided on a change of Government and this Government is in power through the votes of the people.  Anything they do now is not being done by way of challenge in relation to what was done by the late Government.  I was one of those who, when the former Government was in power, was always ready and willing to give them credit for whatever they did in the interests of the poorer sections, and it is undoubtedly true that many of the increases given to the old age pensioners and other sections of our people were given during the reign of the previous Government.  If the present Government have further increased these benefits, they deserve credit, and, when the Minister read out these increases and made comparisons, he did not do so for the purpose of minimising what was already done by the former Government, nor did he do so in a challenging fashion.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I do not think there was any necessity for Deputy Ryan to refer at all to the promises made by the Labour Party.  As I said here before, every one of us makes promises during general elections and it would be better if all Deputies would forget about what happened at general elections.  People like to make promises, at times and we all made promises, but the only promise I made and the only guarantee I gave was that man will earn his bread by the sweat of his brow and Acts of Parliament will never make this or any other country prosperous.  Therefore, I can afford to talk about these Deputies having made promises.  But let us forget that and let us think of the future.  The co-operation of all of us will be necessary judging by what may happen, because the economic position of this and many another country may not be just as good in the years ahead as it has been in the past and is at present.  Great care will be required on the part of those entrusted with the finances of the country and with the provision of benefits such as are envisaged in this social welfare scheme and those which are already in operation under existing schemes as enunciated <Col N="1347" /> by the Minister.  To keep these going will require all the co-operation the Government can get from all concerned. The Minister's statement on the whole will be welcomed by most Deputies and by the people in general.</P>

      <P>Having heard the very informative and interesting lecture on actuarial science given by Deputy Ryan, I hesitated before addressing the House in the expectation of further improving my education by listening to the deputy leader of the Opposition.  However, he denies me that advantage.  I want merely to take a few points from Deputy Ryan's address and deal with them, as they certainly can be dealt with, in very summary fashion.  I regret that he has been called from the House because there are one or two points in his address which I should like to have clarified.  However, I think I am right in quoting him as saying that his position in regard to the comprehensive social welfare scheme is that he had set in train all the necessary preliminary and preparatory work that was required.  He dilated very much upon actuarial practice and told us how the actuaries took certain statistical information and deducted from that information that the expenditure would reach a certain level on a given scale.  What I gathered from him was that all this had been set on foot 14 months before the Fianna Fáil Government went out of office and that most of the figures&mdash; I think he said, all the figures&mdash;were ready, which any succeeding Minister would require to consult by Christmas, 1947.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears to me then that he promised the Dáil that he would have this White Paper dealing with the comprehensive social welfare scheme by March, 1948, and, if that were so, and if he left in the Department, taking his statement at its face value, all this mass of statistical and actuarial information, he left himself two months to prepare the scheme.  I heard the former Minister for Agriculture announcing very confidently to the House what a great man he was, but assuredly he sinks into absolute <Col N="1348" /> insignificance in the matter of performance when we consider how much greater again was the former Minister for Social Welfare, if he could hope to produce even the draft, the salient points, the guiding principles, of a scheme in such a limited period as two months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoderickJamesConnoll" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but Deputy Dr. Ryan lectured us upon the fact that the preparation of the scheme was a big feat and the extent of the work that would have to be incurred in the preparation of statistical tables showing the whole cost to the Exchequer if the level of unemployment assistance is to be 20/-, 21/- or 22/-; if the old age pension rate is to be reduced in regard to age to 65 or lower and if the old age pension rate is to be increased from 12/- to 15/-, or 17/6 to £1.  You have to make up your mind in regard to these matters and Deputy Dr. Ryan specifically said that these things have to be gone into in the preparation of the social welfare scheme and would have to be set out in relation to the economic conditions of the country as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I, if I regret anything, sincerely regret that Fianna Fáil went out of office before March, 1948, and did not give us the privilege of examining that <Col N="1349" /> masterpiece&mdash;the Social Welfare White Paper.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="RoderickJamesConnoll" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>The British, as far as I remember, with all the apparatus at their disposal and their many experts trained in these matters over a very long period, were not able to decide on some of the salient features in regard to their scheme for a matter of several years.  The question even of interDepartmental discussion on the various aspects of a scheme like that and the preparation of the relevant matters for discussion among the Departments would surely take more than one or two months.</P>
      <P>Be that as it may I personally would very much like to see this social welfare comprehensive scheme White Paper, and I think that for the benefit of the House and the country as a whole it should be speeded up.  In all sincerity, even though there is a certain amount of political manipulation about the White Paper not being produced, I think the Minister should take cognisance of the fact that we are all very anxious to see this White Paper and the sooner we see it the better.  I myself am confident that the Minister is putting all the drive he can into it to bring this paper before the House.  I believe that he personally is to be congratulated on the work he is doing in reference to social welfare as a whole and particularly in reference to this question of the social welfare scheme.  I trust that the members of the House will accord him every support in seeing to it that the paper is advanced as quickly as possible for publication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No one will accept that it will embrace or include, as Deputy Dr. Ryan said: &ldquo;All the very rosy points included in the Labour programme of 1947&rdquo;.  This to my mind is another cheap type of argument and one that carries no conviction.  That the ex-Minister should resurrect the election programme of a Party which promises certain things were it to accede to power and then confront the House with these things simply because a member of one of the Parliamentary Parties has succeeded him in his <Col N="1350" /> Department in a particular set of circumstances, to which Deputy Dr. Ryan makes no reference and regards with no significance whatever, seems unfair. It is, therefore, necessary to bring things back to a sense of reality and to remove, I hope, from the discussion on this particularly important matter this trifling question of the election promises of the Parties composing the present Government.  It is necessary to make it quite clear that the Labour Party programme of 1947 dealt with a social welfare scheme in reference to two main factors.  One was that the Labour Party as such would be the dominant Party in the State which would have acceded to power.  That was the basis of the programme, and economically it would be able to set its feet and policy so as to provide for these promises, and provide what is known as a policy of full employment &mdash;a policy which has been sneered at by members of the Opposition.  Therefore, there is no logic whatsoever in any argument such as was presented to this House by Deputy Dr. Ryan when he submitted certain calculations in regard to old age pensions at 70 and what they might have expected to receive had the Labour Party come into power as a Party and with what they are now enjoying with the Labour Party merely as one of a minority group in a Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party is not in power. The Minister for Social Welfare is not in power.  He is merely sharing power with other Parties.  These other Parties have their own ideologies, their own policies, their own political outlook.  They are entitled to these. There are certain points in common with these Parties and, on account of the common ground they share, they share power but not one of those Parties can hope to implement fully its own individual programme.  That basis of argument is so totally absurd that I think it requires little else to be said in dismissal of it.</P>
    <P>This might be said, finally, in reference to that matter that, instead of the Opposition so often misrepresenting the situation in regard to social welfare, in regard to the limited programme which the Labour Party is able to carry out in the given situation, <Col N="1351" /> instead of harping upon that in the fashion they have done, they might, if they really wanted to give weight to the affirmation of Deputy Dr. Ryan that there would be no reduction in future social services, his affirmation that Fianna Fáil would not reduce social services&mdash;or, that the country would not permit Fianna Fáil or any other Party acceding to power to reduce social services but, on the contrary expects that each succeeding Government will, to the utmost limit of the economic capacity of the country to bear, increase social services&mdash;instead of their carping criticism of the Minister for Social Welfare and the Party he represents, they should lend him support in so far as he is endeavouring to increase social services.  They should make it quite clear to the House that they are behind the Minister for Social Welfare in any possible desires he and the other Parties in the House may have to increase social welfare to the utmost possibility of our economic production, having regard to these other matters which must necessarily be taken into account.  In other words, Fianna Fáil, realising that the Labour Party is not in power and realising that, if they want to prove that there is reality behind their statement that they stand in favour of continued improvement in the social services, should give support to any of the minority groups in the Coalition in order to try to obtain the maximum effects and the maximum benefits possible in social welfare schemes.  If they were doing that, the Opposition could be congratulated upon turning from a record of obstruction, a record of not in any way helping certain of the relatively progressive forces within the Coalition, to a constructive programme of helping the minority groups in the Coalition who are anxious to improve social welfare.  By doing that, they would be doing a good turn for themselves and more particularly and more essentially for the country as a whole.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to refer at any length to this question of the delay in producing the Government's proposals for the co-ordination and extension of our social services, but there <Col N="1352" /> are some matters arising in that connection to which I think I must refer.</P>
      <P>The Department of Social Welfare was set up for the purpose of facilitating the production to the Dáil of proposals for the co-ordination and extension of these services.  That is the reason for the Department's existence. It was established in a formal sense in April, 1947, and the progress which was made towards the achievement of that primary purpose of the Department during the ensuing months in that year made it possible for the then Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Dr. Ryan, to say here to-day that before he left the Department there was available the statistical data which was necessary to enable a decision to be taken on the details of a plan and that the drafting of the White Paper which was to contain these decisions had been commenced.</P>

      <P>The Minister knows that he is in a position in which his predecessor was not, that if he can bring his colleagues in the Government and the Deputies who support the Government behind his proposals, whatever they may be, for the inauguration of a comprehensive social welfare scheme, there will be no opposition in the Dáil to them except perhaps on details.  He knows that, does he not? He knows more than that.  He knows that if there is opposition in the Government, if the delay in producing the proposals is due to opposition in the Government, if there is any barrier to its enactment because of opposition in the Government, he can still get for <Col N="1353" /> his proposals a majority in the Dáil, if he wants it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Connolly says the Labour Party is not in power.  That is not true.  The Labour Party is in power. It is in this position that it can insist upon whatever proposals it considers practicable being adopted by the Government and it knows that, in so far as its proposals are sound in principle, proposals for the introduction of a comprehensive social service scheme, or for the pursuit of an economic policy that aims at full employment and the various things that Deputy Connolly referred to, there is a majority in this House for them.  But, if that majority is not in the Government, then my answer to Deputy Connolly is that he put that Government there and is keeping it there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether Deputy Connolly has joined the ranks of the Rip Van Winkles that have been referred to here in the course of the past week, but I doubt it.  So far as the 1947 social welfare scheme of the Labour Party is concerned, we all know that it is impracticable.  The Minister for Social Welfare knows now that it is impracticable and I think Deputy Connolly suspects it.  However desirable it might be to have social welfare benefits of the dimensions indicated in that programme, the country just could not pay for them and no Minister for Finance would face the Dáil with the Bill required for the financing of these benefits out of the Exchequer.  No Minister for Social Welfare would face the organised workers of the country with proposals for the collection of a weekly contribution large enough to bring in the amount of money required to finance those proposals.  Let us regard these proposals as ideals to be aimed at when the economic development of this country has enormously raised its wealth.  If it is agreed that we should have a comprehensive scheme of protection against social evils&mdash;all these social evils against which the State has endeavoured to make some provision in the past and others against which it has failed to make provision up <Col N="1354" /> to the present&mdash;and that that comprehensive scheme should be so devised that it can be expanded without difficulty, as the Dáil decides that the resources of the country permit of expansion, then we stand upon the same plank.  We have always taken our stand upon that plank.  Is there any Party in this House that does not?</P>
      <P>Why are we getting this suggestion of opposition to the principles to which Deputy Connolly referred? Where is it?  There may be differences as to the practicability of applying particular ideas in present circumstances. The suggestion that these principles are meeting with opposition here can only convey to me that the opposition must be within the ranks of the Coalition group.  If that is so, my answer to Deputy Connolly is that he has the power to end it.  If there is answer to Deputy Connolly is that he has the power to end it.  If there is opposition impeding progress in that direction it is solely because of the decision of his Party&mdash;a position for which the present Minister for Social Welfare must take responsibility.  I had assumed that the Leader of the Labour Party accepted the Ministry of Social Welfare because he had received some assurance that in the fulfilment of the policy of his Party in that particular sphere he was going to get co-operation and help from the other Parties in the Coalition.  If he had not got that assurance it is difficult to understand his still being there. If he did get that assurance it is difficult to understand the delay that has taken place in the matter.  May I say to Deputy Connolly that, in so far as he referred to an economy policy which has for its aim the realisation of full employment and all the social benefits that follow from full employment, the largest Party in this House&mdash;the Party which, with any assistance from any other group in the House, could put such a policy into operation&mdash;stands as vehemently for it as he does.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened to the Minister's speech with some care.  It was mainly a reiteration of statistical data and announcements which were made from time to time by the Government Information Bureau or published in the <i>Irish Trade Journal.</i>  I was far more concerned about what was not in it. <Col N="1355" /> I was particularly struck by the fact that he, having regard to his position and his Party affiliations, did not feel called upon to make some reference to the statements made in recent weeks by his colleagues, the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Industry and Commerce and his Party colleague the Minister for Local Government concerning the attitude of the registered unemployed to offers of work.  We have been told here that there is evidence that workers who are registered at the employment exchanges as unemployed&mdash;who are drawing unemployment assistance on the ground that they are available for, and genuinely seeking work&mdash;have proven either not to be available for work or not genuinely seeking it.</P>
    <P>If the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the Minister for Local Government has any information to support that contention it is information which they must have get from the Minister for Social Welfare who controls the employment exchanges and through whom all information gathered in the employment exchanges must reach the Government.  Did the Minister for Social Welfare convey to his colleagues in the Government any reliable information to justify the statements made in the Dáil and outside by these three Ministers to whom I have referred?  He must be aware and his associates on the benches opposite cannot be ignorant of the fact that these statements have caused an impression to be created in the country that the Government is aiming at the alteration of the unemployment assistance code specincally for the purpose of excluding from the right to receive unemployment assistance single, unemployed men.  That impression does not arise entirely from the speeches recently made by members of the Government.  We know that in 1947, a few months before the change of Government, the withdrawal of unemployment assistance from single men was advocated in this House by the present Minister for Finance, the present Minister for Agriculture and the present Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce. Their speeches are on record <Col N="1356" /> in the Dáil Debates of 1947.  The Minister for Agriculture stated that if ever he became a member of a Government he would urge upon that Government the introduction of that change.  Do the Government contemplate any such change?  I think that the Dáil is entitled to get an answer to that question in view of the fact that members of the Government advocated it before they became Ministers, and that Ministers have recently been making speeches which appear to be designed to prepare public opinion for it.  A clear answer must be given.  I should like the Minister for Social Welfare to go further than answer that question.  Has he, as Minister for Social Welfare, got from the employment exchange managers information that supports the statements that were made by his Ministerial colleagues?  Has he made any inquiry from these managers as to whether there was justification for these statements in which we were told that in particular districts a number of single workers without dependents were offered employment at attractive terms not far away from their place of residence &mdash; employment which was based upon the assumption that free transport would be available to the site from the residences of the workers &mdash;and refused it?  Did the Minister check the accuracy of that assertion? Did he find it to be true and, if not, will he inform the Dáil what he did find when he directed that that inquiry should be made?</P>
    <P>Nobody in this House, and I am sure that this applies to the members of the Labour Party as well as to members of any other Party, will advocate the payment of unemployment assistance or any other contribution out of public funds to people who are unemployed because they will not work.  If there are men who are work-shy and for whom there is work available&mdash; work which it is reasonable to expect them to accept having regard to the nature of the work and its location in relation to their homes and their family circumstances&mdash;and who are refusing work because of a desire to continue to draw State assistance in idleness, there is nobody here who will advocate that they should get benefit. When the unemployment assistance <Col N="1357" /> code was being established in 1933 we endeavoured to ensure that adequate machinery would operate to climinate abuses of that kind.  Has the Minister found that that machinery is inadequate and, if he has, has he any proposals for strengthening it?  Certainly, during my time as a Minister responsible for the administration of that scheme, I found that while there was occasional evidence of slack administration which necessitated official notice there was no solid body of evidence to support a view that a substantial number of people were, over a long period, receiving unemployment assistance who could have got work if they wanted it.</P>
    <P>What is the attitude of the Minister for Social Welfare to the offer of employment to workers in camps considerable distances from their homes, offers of employment which mean that the workers will have to leave their own homes and go to reside in a camp? At the present time offers of employment of that character are being made generally throughout the various parts of the country and those who refuse them are being struck off the unemployment assistance list.  In some cases, it has been asserted, the offers were made to men who, although single in the sense that they were not married, were nevertheless in such family circumstances that it would be a hardship on them and on their families if they were required to leave home.  I know that these men have the right to appeal to the Court of Referees and the Court of Referees must under the Act take into account family circumstances when they are pleaded in justification for refusal of work.  It seems that specific offers of employment were made in these areas as a deliberate policy in accordance with instructions issued to test the genuineness of the unemployment indicated by the local unemployment registers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the Minister for Finance in his observations on that point completely misunderstood the nature of the unemployment problem which exists in the western <Col N="1358" /> counties where there is no very large body of people normally working for wages and completely dependent on wages for a livelihood.  I have often wondered how it is that recruitment of workers in these areas for employment in Scotland and harvesting in England apparently offers little difficulty while the offer of employment to these same workers as individuals even on better terms in turf camps or on camp construction jobs is rarely welcomed. It seems to me that the essential difference between the two types of employment is that in one case the worker goes to a job accompanied by a group of people from his own locality under a local foreman and that it is the group organisation that underlies the system of recruitment that makes that type of employment popular while in the other case the prospect offered to the worker is to go as an individual into the impersonal atmosphere of a labour camp among strangers.  In these areas, for traditional and other reasons, there is a reluctance to take work of this kind. The obligation of the State to the worker is to provide work and the obligation to help him by means of unemployment assistance only begins to operate when it has been made quite clear beyond any doubt that work cannot be made available.  But it has always been recognised that an offer of work must be related to the circumstances of the worker.  We have recognised the right of a worker, say a printer, who is receiving unemployment insurance benefit to refuse work as a manual labourer.  That principle could be extended to other occupations and it could even be extended too far, but I feel that in the particular case to which reference has been made here it is desirable that the attitude of the Government should be clarified.  The Minister for Finance said that he is beginning to come to the conclusion that unemployment does not exist, either generally in the country or in these particular areas, to the extent suggested by the unemployment registers.  He said that he believed that workers were induced to put their names on the unemployment registers for political reasons.  The suggestion is, I take it, that these workers are <Col N="1359" /> members of the Fianna Fáil organisation, that they are not unemployed and are not seeking work, but have nevertheless, in obedience to the orders of Fianna Fáil, registered as unemployed in order to give the political argument that unemployment has reached serious dimensions.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister for Social Welfare believe that?  Has the Minister for Social Welfare carried out any investigations in the local offices of his Department to find out whether that suggestion or allegation is true or not? Is he able to produce to the Dáil one tittle of evidence supporting the suggestion of his colleague, the Minister for Finance?  If that is not so, if he believes, as I believe, that the unemployment register is, taken by and large, a fair indication of unemployment in this country, will he say it?  Will he give the unemployed workers who have been slighted by the Minister for Finance the comfort of getting from him an assurance that one member of the Government realises that they are unemployed and that, whatever the Minister for Finance may say, they regard themselves as being in the position of requiring work, of being willing to take work if the offer is made and of needing work, wishing to get it, perhaps, in their own localities, but nevertheless not in the position that they are well-off people who are not unemployed and not needing work who merely put their names on the unemployment register for a political stunt? I am quite certain that the Minister for Social Welfare does not believe that, but he has by his silence appeared to concur with the view expressed by the Minister for Finance.  Perhaps he will deal with that point when he is replying to this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said that the unemployment registers are, by and large, a reliable enough indication of the dimensions of the unemployment problem, but I have always held the view that it gives us a false picture of the nature of the unemployment problem and particularly to those who conceive the solution to unemployment as lying in the direction of State organised public works.  I know that an investigation which was <Col N="1360" /> carried out in employment exchanges by Deputy Smith when he was Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and in charge of the Board of Works, an investigation which included interviewing every man upon the registers of some of these exchanges, seemed to suggest that not more than one-third or 40 per cent. of the registered unemployed were physically capable of performing the type of heavy manual labour which is usually associated with Government Works schemes.  That being so, it is quite clear that we cannot hope to eliminate the problem of unemployment as revealed by the unemployment registers by any of the measures which have been discussed heretofore except in so far as the discussions related to the general economic development of the country.</P>
    <P>I think, however, that it would help the Dáil, help the Government and help individual Deputies to clear their minds on the nature of the unemployment problem and to make useful suggestions concerning the unemployment problem if some systematic effort were made to analyse the unemployment registers and break them into their component parts, not on a geographical basis, but on a classification basis.  We know that included on the registers are men over 65 years of age who are not likely to be offered employment by anybody, who are never likely to be offered employment by anyone, who are really beyond their labour and who are being carried upon employment assistance until they can qualify for the old age pension.  Is it desirable that these men should appear at all upon our unemployment assistance register? Is it not misleading to the country, deterimental to the interests of the country and impeding the efforts of the Government and the Dáil to produce practical proposals in relation to unemployment?  There are others on it who have never had work who because of some mental or physical peculiarity or family circumstances have in fact never been employed.  One can get some indication of the number of such from the analysis that appears periodically in the <i>Irish Trade Journal</i>, but if we are to tackle this question of <Col N="1361" /> unemployment, as revealed by the unemployment register the first task must be to get some more thorough and systematic analysis of the register. I have always had that in mind and I had hoped that when the comprehensive social welfare scheme came into operation it would be possible to combine with it that reorganisation of the unemployment register which would give us not merely a more reliable picture of the dimensions of our unemployment problem, but one which would facilitate its solution by indicating clearly the lines along which a solution must be sought.</P>
    <P>The Minister has frequently spoken about the comprehensive scheme being based upon the insurance principle.  I want it to be clearly understood that when he is referring to the insurance principle he means that the right to benefit residing in any individual will be a consequence of the payment of contributions in respect of that individual. There has been a good deal of talk here about the means test.  The Minister contradicted me one day at Question Time when I asserted that there is not now and never has been a means test in relation to any social welfare scheme based upon that insurance principle.  I suggest it is misleading to talk about abolishing the means test in a social welfare scheme based upon the insurance principle.  Neither in relation to national health nor unemployment insurance, widows' pensions or any other form of benefit the right to which depended upon the payment of contributions has there ever been a means test.  I have argued here that where the right to benefit was not based upon the payment of contributions in respect of the individual, where the Exchequer has given out of public funds secured by taxation to relieve distress arising from any cause, there is an obligation upon the Government to ensure that that money goes only for the purpose that the Dáil voted, and that is what a means test signifies.  I say here that the Government has no right to take money from me or any other individual taxpayer except to relieve some indicated social evil.  If there are people who are old and, because old, unable to maintain themselves, if there are people who are sick <Col N="1362" /> and because sick in need, if people through widowhood or orphanhood or blindness or any other reason are in need of help from the community, then I am in favour of giving them that help.  I am in favour of giving them help but I have to ask of the Government this&mdash;and every taxpayer is entitled to ask it&mdash;that the Government take precautions to ensure that the money collected from the public should go only to those who need it.  There may be, and no doubt there are, objections to the particular form of means test in operation in relation to old age pensions or widows' pensions or other benefits, but whether it is the investigation of the need for help that is carried out along those or other lines, it is undesirable to create the idea that the Government is ready to take money from one citizen to give it to another except on the ground that that other person needs it and has submitted to some investigation as to his need, before receiving money from public resources.</P>
    <P>There are exceptions to that rule. When I introduced here the children's allowances scheme which was financed entirely out of the Exchequer and where the right to the allowance was given to every family irrespective of means, we had considered whether we could adhere to that general principle I have laid down.  We abolished the means test in relation to that scheme&mdash; first, because it facilitated the administration of the scheme and, secondly, because it was quite easy to carry out a minor amendment of the income-tax code which in fact meant that those who came into the income-tax paying class did not really benefit from it.  But I was astonished to hear members of the Labour Party and of Clann na Poblachta criticise that scheme in public because they said it meant paying children's allowances to the families of millionaires.  Those very same Deputies who criticised that scheme on that ground in the same speches often protested against the maintenance of the means test in relation to other social welfare services. Deputies should make up their minds one way or the other.  They cannot criticise one scheme on the ground that there is no means test in it and <Col N="1363" /> at the same time appear by their speeches to oppose the application of a means test generally.  If the comprehensive scheme is to be on the insurance principle then the question of means test does not arise and never can arise.  If it is going to go beyond that, if it is going to involve taking more money from the general body of workers and producers for the purpose of giving benefits to indicated individuals, then the Government has a right to do that only when they can demonstrate to the Dáil&mdash;and demonstrate as a result of investigation&mdash;that there is a social need there which the community as a whole must meet.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to indicate if his reference to abolition of the means test is to be taken as referring only to a scheme based upon insurance principles or if in fact he is going further than that and is for administrative convenience or political popularity or any other reason contemplating departing from the principle upon which the social welfare services have heretofore been established.</P>
    <P>I am not going to say and do not want to be taken as saying that the methods of administering the means test may not be improved.  One of the difficulties of the past, one of the reasons which led to the establishment of the Department of Social Welfare was that there was divided responsibility in this matter.  The Department of Industry and Commerce operated the unemployment assistance scheme but the Department of Finance had the obligation of deciding who was entitled to a certificate under that scheme.  The Department of Local Government administered the old age pensions scheme but the Department of Finance had the right of applying the means test. The fact that the administration of these services was divided between three Departments led to many anomalies and slowed down enormously the task of removing them and of eliminating the features which were arousing public discontent.  It was a realisation of that fact that created the post of Minister for Social Welfare.  All these services and the administrative functions in connection with them are now <Col N="1364" /> centred in one Department under one Minister, who clearly can progress with greater speed and efficiency towards the improvement of those services.</P>
    <P>Apart from the data which the Minister gave us in his introduction, I would like him to indicate how far he has gone in that direction or how far he thinks it is possible to go, when he is concluding the debate on the Bill.</P>

      <P>In relation to the work of the Minister during the past year, it is fair to say that even the ranks of Tuscany could scarce forbear to cheer.  He has shown tremendous energy and grasp of detail in the administration of his Department and determination in the pursuit of a particular policy.  That energy and grasp of detail was, in my opinion, singularly lacking from this Department while his predecessor was in office. This Minister is due a well-deserved tribute from this Dáil in relation to his activities in the last 12 months.  I know that, when he was appointed, and particularly in the months that followed, both his work and his activity were welcomed by the people of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had from Deputy Lemass an interesting contribution to this debate to-night.  I think that when Deputy Lemass started speaking he spoke rather as a politician; when he finished speaking he spoke more like a sensible contributor to the deliberations of this House.  I was interested to hear Deputy Lemass make references to what Deputy Connolly had said, to the Labour Party policy in relation to social insurance and to hear him inform Deputy Connolly and the House that if he or any Deputy of his Party was in any trouble concerning the solution of their social insurance aims they only had to apply to Fianna Fáil and they were assured at all times of a majority in this House.  That sounds very well coming from Deputy Lemass, and I am quite certain that in his Party's newspaper that will be carried up and down this country.  I am sure it is intended to give a ray of hope to those disappointed followers of Fianna Fáil who were slightly disillusioned concerning Deputy Lemass's Party's <Col N="1365" /> policy in October, 1947, when a motion was introduced into this House in the names of the present Taoiseach and the present Minister for Defence asking for a very limited gesture from the last Administration towards easing the burden of the necessitous section of our community.</P>
    <P>It was a motion that asked that the means test might be modified in three particular respects; in relation to gratuities paid to the pensioner by members of his family; in relation to benefits received other than in cash and in relation to casual moneys earned by the pensioner.  It was a very modified claim made in October, 1947, and was prompted by reason of the fact that in that particular year the last Administration had introduced measures providing for substantial increases in the pay and allowances to various sections&mdash;the better-off sections &mdash;of the community.  It was felt by the proposer and seconder of that motion that if the State was to recognise the rising cost of living and the hardships which rising prices brought to people on a fixed weekly income, no matter how large it might be, their first duty was to recognise those existing on the bare level of subsistence. That motion was therefore introduced. Deputy Dr. Ryan, the former Minister for Social Welfare, was appalled at the cost to the State of the suggestion contained in the motion.  Deputy Dr. Ryan went to the greatest trouble to find out what it would cost the State to modify the means test.  He discovered that to abolish the means test would cost £2,000,000.  Of course, it was unthinkable that the last Administration would spend that particular sum for such a purpose.</P>

      <P>This Administration spent £2,500,000 extra on social services within 16 months of coming into office.  Two million pounds was a figure which shocked Deputy Dr. Ryan.  However, he went further to price what the fulfilment of the motion itself would cost.  He found it would involve a sum between £500,000 and £750,000.  Deputy Dr. Ryan, having been 16 years a member of the last <Col N="1366" /> Government, looked forward with settled conviction to another 16 years. By reason of that confidence which the apparently healthy position of his Government gave him he declared: &ldquo;No, the State cannot afford it, to abolish the means test as suggested.&rdquo; He, as Minister, opposed that.</P>

      <P>The division took place and the motion was defeated by 55 votes to 34.  It was interesting to see Deputy Lemass so confident in his assurance to the Labour Party, or any other Party that might be concerned, that in his own great heart there would always be the support forthcoming. Deputy Lemass, of course, voted against that little gesture to the old age pensioners and widows and orphans in this country.  Deputy Lemass and any other Deputy of Fianna Fáil are quite entitled to make any speech they like in this House.  It is only reasonable to assume that, when the will of the people of this country transferred them from this side of the House to the far side, many of their opinions changed and things which they considered as sinful perhaps 12 months ago became their aim and ambition as Opposition Deputies.  I should like to say this to Deputy Lemass and Fianna Fáil.  The country had no faith whatsoever in their assurances.  The ordinary people of this country recognised that Fianna Fáil, in their social outlook, was a Party which went stale in office.  It completely outlived its usefulness and for that reason the people of the country, in their wisdom, got rid of Fianna Fáil.  The new Administration which has succeeded them, in relation to this Department and this Estimate, have very definite ideas concerning social service.  We recognise that we cannot aim at a social insurance scheme which other wealthier and more industrial countries can afford.  We recognise the limitations which the resources of this country must place upon many of our proposals. Nevertheless, each Party supporting this inter-Party Government is determined that to the utmost of the resources of this State we will fashion and put into operation a social insurance <Col N="1367" /> scheme which will make the lot of those who, by reason of age or sickness are unable to work in this country, better.  I think that is a clear aim.</P>
      <P>I welcome the conversion of Fianna Fáil towards that policy.  I welcome the conversion of Deputy Dr. Ryan and Deputy Lemass and the other members of that Government who not so very long ago were putting a clamp down on the wages of the workers of this country and were having standstill Orders and so forth.</P>

      <P>I think that in this Estimate, at least, we have got the assurance from Fianna Fáil that the very praiseworthy efforts of this Government and the Minister whose Estimate we are discussing will have their support.  I have no doubt that when the social insurance programme is announced and the White Paper is issued, Deputy Dr. Ryan, being wise after the event, will refer to that White Paper and say: &ldquo;We could have done far better.&rdquo;  I have no doubt that that particular line will be followed by the Opposition.</P>

      <P>I know full well the game they are going to play.  There is no difficulty in foretelling the speeches that will be made by the Opposition.  It is, as I say, a welcome fact that there is the assurance to the Minister of support of his policy and his aim.  The fact that the White Paper for the scheme will shortly be issued does show that in the 16 or 18 months the Minister has been in office he has not been idle.  While he has during that space of time given an interim measure of relief to the widows and orphans and to disabled workmen he has not, as perhaps his predecessor might have done, accepted that interim relief as a stand-still.  He has gone on to work towards what is the policy of the Government in relation to his Department.  I trust that the latter portion of Deputy Lemass's <Col N="1368" /> speech will be followed by other members of his Party.</P>
      <P>I hope that, by recognising the difficulties which are inherent in a scheme of social insurance, they will assist the Government and the Minister in hammering out the practical application of that scheme.  Speaking from my own point of view as an inexperienced Deputy, I know it is very easy to announce schemes but that perhaps it is not so easy to issue White Papers on any particular subject.  The difficulty arises in the practical application of praiseworthy notions and ideals. After the Government's intentions and aims have been announed, I hope that we will get from the Opposition co-operation in the implementing of these ideals and in carrying them into effect.</P>
      <P>It is clear, I think, that any social insurance scheme, particularly a contributory one, to be successful must have the support and co-operation of the people whom it is designed to help and assist.  If there be any section of the people which, for one reason or another, does not believe in the benefits which the scheme might confer, then it is possible that the success of the scheme might be endangered.  If Deputy Lemass's speech contains the assurance that the Opposition will support this scheme, then I think this debate has been useful.  If, on the other hand, he has been merely saying one thing here, and then perhaps going back to a newspaper office, thinking of other things and saying something else in two or three months' time, we shall find that Fianna Fáil is just the same.</P>

      <P>Having listened to the last speaker one can hardly be accused of treating his remarks with a certain amount of suspicion when he refers to the conversion of Fianna Fáil to the idea of social services.  Since this Government came into power we have heard a lot of prating and blowing of trumpets about social services, but do they forget that it was the Fianna Fáil Government that established the Department of Social Welfare, and that any benefits that are accruing, and that have accrued to the community are the direct result of the initiative taken by the Fianna Fáil Government?  When Deputy O'Higgins <Col N="1369" /> speaks of conversion, I wonder if he has in mind statements that were made by some of his own Party leaders, in fact more than Party leaders&mdash;some people from whom he takes his line in politics generally?  In Volume 105 of the Dáil Debates, at column 459, the present Minister for Defence, Deputy Dr. O'Higgins, speaking on social services said:&mdash;</P>

      <P>&ldquo;A comprehensive social welfare plan should be instituted without delay.

      <P>The Minister for Finance cannot be so naive as to think that everyone can earn for himself.  Social services are necessary in every country, and when Fianna Fáil set about establishing the Department of Social Welfare they realised that, on the one hand, they had to provide the means of employment, which they did very effectively, and hand in hand with that social services, but nevertheless, Deputy McGilligan said in Volume 104, at column 2278:&mdash;</P>

      <P>I was not here when Deputy O'Higgins made his speech but, if I am not mistaken, he referred to a statement made by the Taoiseach here when there was a motion on the means test in 1947.  The statements I am quoting are much more recent than that.  I can well understand the annoyance of the Deputies on the Government Benches&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is not annoying me.  I am merely pointing out that the Minister for Social Welfare is not responsible for what every member of the Cabinet says.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall make my own case.  It is a well-known fact that before the last general election the Labour Party went all out in their promise to the people that they would abolish the means test.  The Minister for Social Welfare, when he was introducing his Estimate last year said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;It is proper that in order to secure the best value from our present <Col N="1372" /> limited financial resources, money should not be spent in directions where the need is not too great. If we are to go beyond a certain limit of need, the taxpayers' money will be distributed in quarters where it is not wanted.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a far cry from the complete abolition of the means test.  The Fianna Fáil Government had a certain means test which has, admittedly, been modified to a very limited extent.  When the Minister came into office he realised that a means test was essential.  That is obvious from the way in which he expressed himself on this matter last year.</P>
    <P>We have been told that there has been an enormous increase in the amount of money made available for social services by the inter-Party Government.  If one looks at the sayings made in the present Estimate, as compared with the Estimate for 1948-49, one will see that that increase is not quite so enormous as one is led to believe.  Under the old age pensions special benefits there is a saving of £164,000.  Under the abolition of the national health allowances, there is a saving of £358,000.  Unemployment insurance and unemployment assistance have been reduced by £121,000. The raid on the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Fund has resulted in a saving of £450,000.  Other miscellaneous savings on allowances in cash and in kind amount to £145,000.  That represents a total sum of £1,250,000 approximately. If one takes into consideration the increased contributions paid by the workers and employers, that sum reaches a figure of £2,250,000. Naturally, one is inclined to ask where are the wonderful benefits that are supposed to have been bestowed upon the community as a result of the enormous advances made in social services.</P>
    <P>Last March I put a question to the Minister with regard to the payment of national health benefit.  I pointed out to him that there were complaints about the delay in receiving benefits. He asked me, if I had any specific instances, to bring them to his attention. I pointed out that one of the reasons for the delay was because of the duplication of forms served upon <Col N="1373" /> the applicant.  One form is Form 5 and the other is Form 27.  In each of these the claimant is asked to answer certain questions designed to indicate whether the claimant is entitled to workmen's compensation or to ordinary common law compensation as a result of his injury or disablement.  I said then that there was unnecessary duplication.  I still say that there is unnecessary duplication in making these claims.  I ask the Minister to consider the possibility of simplifying these forms in order to facilitate the payment of benefit.  Shortly after I raised that question, the Cork Workers' Council stated publicly that there were no grounds for the suggestions contained in my question and they endorsed the Minister's statement to the effect that the delay was a matter of two or three days.  In the specific case in which I was interested, the man fell ill towards the end of January this year.  Between form filling and visits from inspectors, he was not paid his benefit until the middle of March.  He had to wait for practically two months.  If the Minister requires more specific information, I shall furnish him with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be glad if the Deputy would and I shall have the matter investigated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not permission to give the information at the moment, but I shall get it and furnish it to the Minister as soon as possible.  Another matter to which I would like to refer is the payment of benefit to married women prior to confinement.  As a general rule these women have to work either because their husbands are disabled or dead, or are unable for some reason to obtain employment.  If it is a normal maternity case, the doctor will not certify that they are unfit for work until they are practically within four weeks of confinement. I think it is a very serious charge against our Administration that we should treat these women in that manner.  The period during which they are entitled to benefit should be doubled, if not trebled.  There appears to be rather invidious discrimination as between married <Col N="1374" /> mothers and unmarried mothers, since the latter are able to claim benefit for a considerable period before confinement by reason of various devices.  I think the Minister should examine this matter very carefully and remedy the situation to some extent.</P>
      <P>Another matter to which I would like to refer is the question of contributions and payments of benefit under the Insurance (Intermittent Employment) Act, 1942, which is generally known as the &ldquo;Wet Time Act&rdquo;.  I understand that the rates of benefit are now the same as they were when the Act was first introduced despite the fact that there has been a general increase in the wages payable. I understand that the Department is responsible only for the cost of administration of this Act and that when the Act was first introduced there was an actuarial error.</P>
      <P>When the Act was first introduced there was an actuarial error in the amount expected to be got in in contributions as against the amount to be paid out in benefit, with the result that now there is a big surplus in the funds provided under this particular Act.  I would like the Minister to enlighten me on that.  If that is the case, I suggest that the rate of benefit should be increased to the skilled worker and the non-skilled worker and also, if possible, that the scope of the Act should be extended to include workers who are not engaged in the building trade. There are a number of Acts now passing through the House by which the Government hope to employ men on drainage and other such works and these men will likewise be affected.  I suggest that the time is opportune for extending the scope of the Wet Time Act of 1942.  I do not think I am out of order in advocating this course, because I believe the Minister can do the things I ask by way of Order and not by legislation.  I think the workers, with a Labour Minister in power, expected more from him under this particular legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making my statement on the information supplied to me.  I was also approached with reference to the same Act by unskilled workers.  I think it is a matter really for their unions, but they maintain that the unskilled worker is affected more by the vagaries of the weather than the skilled men, because the skilled men can carry on their trade indoors, whereas the unskilled men, in nine cases out of ten, are forced to give up their employment temporarily.  They suggest that if they were brought up to the same scale of contributions and benefit as the skilled worker they would be prepared to pay whatever increase in contributions is required.  I would say that is a matter primarily for the unions concerned.</P>
      <P>Somebody suggested that the unfortunate employer will have to suffer also, but I think the employer, having been able to afford an increased wage, should be able to afford a slightly increased contribution.  I believe that would be very small.</P>
      <P>There is one objection to extending the scope of this Act.  If there is a surplus in the fund the people who made contributions will object to other people getting the benefit of that surplus, but, nevertheless, some arrangement should be made whereby people working in schemes other than building schemes proper, to which the Act is confined, would be prepared to pay whatever contributions are necessary.</P>

      <P>One matter mentioned by Deputy Lynch was that the Department of Social Welfare was established by the Minister's predecessor.  It is one thing to establish a Department, but it is another to improve social welfare and a statement that the Department was founded by the Minister's predecessor does not justify the argument that it was intended to give better benefits than the present Minister proposes to give under that particular Department.  The previous Government were a long time in office and it is a strange thing that it was only at that late stage they decided to establish such a Department.  Surely the necessity for such a Department existed long before that.  There were unemployed people when Fianna Fáil <Col N="1376" /> came into office and there were still more unemployed when they went out of office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I was surprised by the piece of shameful hypocrisy I heard from Deputy Lemass, speaking on this Estimate.  He appears to be adopting the unemployed as the political child of his Party, but that political child was sadly neglected during the years when Fianna Fáil were in office.  They came into office boasting that they would solve the problem, but when they went out of office it was worse.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be agreed that there were more people engaged in industry, but the fact is that they were regimented and registered and the Government were able to procure statistics which enabled them to say there were more employed when they were in office than when they came into office.  Deputy Lemass wants to know whether there is any change of attitude towards the unemployed in comparison with the attitude of his own Government. I think the statement of the Minister for Social Welfare here to-night speaks for itself.  He said that so far as this Government is concerned the attitude towards the unemployed is sympathetic, practical and helpful and it is not one of neglect, such as existed in the past.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil long ago ceased to be a workers' Party.  It was annoying to hear Deputy Lemass expressing so much sympathy with the unemployed, just as if the present Government was not very much concerned about the problems facing these people and the necessity for giving them employment. The unemployment figure in 1940 was 118,000 and at the present time it is 59,000, just half that number.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaSnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1940 plenty of people could obtain work in Britain.  They were emigrating in vast numbers to Britain, but still that number of 118,000 <Col N="1377" /> was on the register here in 1940.  It is a pity Deputy Lemass was not more sympathetic towards that group at that time.  Now, when he is not in a position to be helpful, he is pretending that he is sympathetic.  The unemployment figure is becoming lower each week and I am satisfied that the present Government will not be content until every able man is put into employment.  The attitude of this Government is certainly better than the attitude of the Fianna Fáil Government.  One example is that in the past year the cash allowance was included in the statutory basic calculation for the unemployment assistance allowance.</P>

      <P>One more example of the efforts of Fianna Fáil to adopt the unemployed as their political child is afforded by a demonstration some time ago in Dublin.  There is no doubt that demonstration was inspired by Fianna Fáil and it is probable that those who participated were paid by Fianna Fáil to act accordingly and to create ill-feeling and an agitation amongst the unemployed people of Dublin and their brethren in the country.</P>

      <P>In the course of his speech, Deputy Lemass said that the unemployed were slighted by the offer of work by this Government.  He considered it was a slight for this Government to offer employment to these men.  I do not think the Government can do any more than to offer employment and to create it.  I do not think it desirable that the Government should force them to accept work if they are not willing to accept it. They should be left to make their own decision but they must decide whether they will take the work offered or not. By signing up at the Labour Exchange, they indicate that they are ready and willing to work and that, in the meantime, they are prepared to accept unemployment assistance.  It was mentioned that the distance from their homes to the place where the work is available, may affect the question as to whether a man is in a <Col N="1379" /> position to accept the work.  Nobody will dispute that but, if the facilities are reasonable, I think it is only fair to suggest that if employment is not accepted when it is offered, there must be some reason for it.  It is possible that the person concerned might not be physically suited for the nature of the work made available to him. He may be a skilled man and, if offered work of a particular type, he may not be suited for that work but if suitable employment is offered and the facilities are resonable it is only right to expect that the man should accept the work offered to him.</P>
      <P>I wonder is it possible that certain exchange managers appointed by the previous Government are not co-operating with this Government in their efforts to make employment available to those who are agitating to get it? I know that these managers are expected to submit lists in accordance with merit.  An examination should be made of the lists submitted to ascertain whether there is any kind of discrimination because if there is, we cannot expect to reduce the figures for unemployment.  If the names of persons ready to accept work are not put up&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>I notice that some of the previous speakers expressed disappointment because the means test had not been abolished but, at least, a very progressive step has already been taken. Old age pensioners who were receiving 12/6 a week are now receiving 17/6. The means test is not as rigid as it was and there is nobody getting less than 5/- a week, whereas under the Fianna Fáil Government they were receiving 1/- and 1/6 a week.  That was a disgracefully low figure.  It was an insult to offer it to any old age pensioner, especially when we consider the strict means test carried out at that time.  The Fianna Fáil Government could not afford £500,000 to modify the means test, let alone to grant an increase.  We have actually <Col N="1381" /> modified the means test and increased old age pensions.</P>

I should like to mention that there seems to be a long delay between the time a widow applies for a pension and the date on which she gets it.  Possibly the investigating machinery has not been brought right up to date.  I would plead with the Minister to examine the possibility of making the pension available to widows sooner than is the case at present.  The Fine Gael Party have been criticised for enabling the Government, through the Minister for Social Welfare, to increase benefits.

      <P>I welcome the Minister's intention to publish this White Paper. I know that when that White Paper is published opposition Deputies will express dissatisfaction with it.  I believe that the persons who will benefit by the proposals contained therein will realise that, had it not been for the present Minister for Social Welfare, these benefits would never have been made available. If the scheme in hands at that time were gone ahead with, the people of this country could never have financed the benefits which will accrue from this White Paper.  My colleague, Deputy Burke, stated on one occasion in the Dáil that on his way from Balbriggan to Dublin 100 unemployed persons stopped him and asked him for work.  I came in that road on the same day only five minutes behind Deputy Burke and I saw none of these unemployed persons.  That is just an example of the talk indulged in by the Fianna Fáil Party in regard to the unemployed.</P>

      <P>I suppose the people over there will say that it was the Fianna Fáil Party who got the employment bureau for ex-Servicemen to publish an advertisement last week in the newspapers asking employers to <Col N="1383" /> give work to ex-Servicemen.  That advertisement gave in alphabetical order the different categories of men who were idle&mdash;labourers, tradesmen and so on.  From A to Z it gave the class of men available for employment and asked employers to employ them. That is at least proof that there are ex-Servicemen of every class idle.  I suppose Deputy Rooney does not read the papers and did not see that advertisement. I should like to know what the Minister is going to do for all these ex-Servicemen who are idle.  Has he work to offer them?  They served the country during the emergency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder what steps the Minister will take to reduce the amount that he has to pay in unemployment benefits.  The best way is to get someone to provide work for these men. I know of no class in the country who had to pay increased contributions while they were working except the workingmen.  They had to pay increased unemployment and national health insurance contributions while they were working and got absolutely no increase in their benefits when sick or idle.  By way of a change, they gave them 22/6 instead of £1 2s. 6d.  The Minister is aware that practically every other class in the country got an increase of 11/- a week on account of the increased cost of living, but those people got absolutely no increase at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At a meeting of the South Cork Board of Assistance last Monday and a previous one a fortnight before we had widows with three children who were receiving contributory pensions of 31/6 a week applying for home assistance. The Minister told Deputy Corry and myself here when we were discussing food vouchers that the board of <Col N="1384" /> assistance should shoulder their responsibilities.  But that is not what the Minister said in his election address as published in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 27th January, 1948:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;For those who may be deprived of regular incomes owing to illness or old age, or because of temporary unemployment, or through the death of a bread-winner, cash benefits must be provided on an adequate scale without recourse to the poor law or the test of pauperism prevalent today.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Yet he told Deputy Corry and myself that the board of assistance should shoulder their responsibility.  I am asking the Minister now to shoulder his responsibility.  I think that no widow with three children, in the City of Cork at any rate, could pay rent and feed and clothe herself and her family on 31/6 a week.  I think the Minister must have got a letter from the South Cork Board of Assistance telling him that his contribution was inadequate.</P>
    <P>For the benefit of some people over there who are talking about the conversion of Fianna Fáil in regard to social services I will give a few of the social services introduced by Fianna Fáil and show the way they increased the social services.  When Fianna Fáil came into power, the total sum for social services was £4,708,378.  When Fianna Fáil were going out, it was £13,881,735.  Deputy Rooney and Deputy O'Higgins and other Deputies over there can swallow that.</P>

      <P>When Fianna Fáil came into power, the provision for old-age and blind pensions was £2,693,105, and, when they went out, it was £5,149,750.  When they came into power, widows' and orphans' pensions did not exist, but when they went out they were paying £1,310,500.  National health insurance was £788,926 when they came in and £1,416,300 when they went out. Unemployment insurance amounted to £580,108 when they came in.  There was no unemployment assistance at that time.</P>

There were no such schemes as the footwear and fuel schemes when they came in, but, when they went out, there was provision in respect of these schemes amounting to £259,000.

I prevented Deputy Allen from raising it on the Finance Vote and told him to raise it on this Vote.  I do not see that very much can be raised, as there is no report, but I suppose the Minister will be willing to say what progress has been made.  The mistake was mine.</P>

      <P>I will give you some idea of it now.  I want to talk about the Court of Referees and the way they act, and I will give an instance of what I maintain was an attempt to cut down wages.  A man in Cork City who was drawing unemployment assistance was sent to work in a rural area on the fringe of Cork City for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  He was offered £3 3s. per week as a temporary labourer, while the other labourers working side by side with him were getting £5 5s. per week.  He refused the work, and he was told that that was what was given to temporary labourers, although permanent labourers were getting £2 2s. per week more for doing the same work.  He went back and was knocked off the dole.  If that is not compelling a man by force of circumstances to accept low wages I do not know what is.  I ask the Minister very seriously to consider it because I do not think any Labour Minister could stand over such an action.</P>

So far as that is concerned, all I have done in the case of Cork was to reappoint twice whatever person was there.  I do not know who he is even.

      <P>When I raised the question of appeals from the Court of Referees last year and the sending of them to Dublin the Minister said in reply:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Deputy McGrath made the point that doubtful claims for unemployment benefit should be referred to Dublin.  I have a lot of sympathy with the Deputy in that connection. It is essentially a service in which we have to try, as far as possible, to decentralise certain types of control. I do not personally admire the system by which everything has to go to a central depot for a decision. It very often happens that the decision is finally made by a person of lower rank than the official who referred the correspondence to the central office.  I have already discussed with my Department the question as to whether it is possible to give greater authority to local managers so as to eliminate cluttering up the head office with local files and at the same time to provide for speedier administration in the matter of claims for unemployment benefit.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think that makes it very clear how appeals from the Court of Referees are dealt with.  I am telling the Minister that within the past two weeks a man was sent out to work for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs immediately outside the City of Cork and was asked to work for £3 3s. 0d. a week while the permanent labourers working side by side with him were getting £5 5s. 0d. a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to know is the Minister going to give us any definite statement as to when this comprehensive insurance scheme will be introduced.  On the 15th April, 1948, he promised that a White Paper would be introduced possibly before the summer.  On the 28th July he promised that the House would have an opportunity in the course of a few months of seeing the White Paper in connection with that scheme.  On the 13th March he said at Athy that the officers of the Department were working on the production of a scheme which would crystallise in the form of a <Col N="1391" /> White Paper in the near future.  I am very anxious to get some idea as to when that White Paper will be introduced because as I said on another debate here, I have been approached by the heads of a couple of industrial firms in the City of Cork who want to review their own superannuation scheme, as they now say it is out of date, and they do not know where they are with the Minister saying he is going to introduce a scheme.  They do not know what value the scheme will have. They do not know to what extent it will penalise the workers, what weekly fines they will have to pay, with the result that these firms are putting off reviewing their own superannuation schemes.  They do not know where they are at all because we are getting from month to month, and I think it will be from year to year, this promise of this great insurance scheme.  On the 13th April last year we were promised it very soon, and so on.  I would like if the Minister would make up his mind either to bring it in or to decide that he will not bring it in and let the people know where they stand, and go ahead with other schemes they have in view.</P>
    <P>There is another matter about which I want to make a complaint, that is, the delay in investigating pension cases and the cases of Old I.R.A. men who applied for special allowances, which are sent for investigation by the Minister's Department.  I had one case recently of a man who applied for the special allowance and for the old age pension at the same time.  They have ordered him an old age pension of 10/- a week.  He had a post office pension of 9/6 a week and he was entitled to about 10/6 more to make up the amount to which he would be entitled under the special allowance. I would like to tell the Minister that that man's means were investigated for the purpose of his old age pension and there was no other investigation of means necessary in that case.  I had to ring up the Department of Defence every week for the last five or six weeks and yesterday I heard that they had received the report.  In that case there was no need for investigation. All the Minister's Department <Col N="1392" /> had to do was to send up the report of the investigation of the means which they made when he was applying for the old age pension.</P>
    <P>That is only one instance.  People are continually coming to me and asking why they are not getting pensions and what is the reason for the delay.</P>
    <P>I have noticed in Government Buildings in Cork for the past week a great change in the attitude of some of the people there to me.  I was always treated well there and was given information when I asked for it but I went to two officials there this week&mdash;on Monday last to inquire.  One case that I was inquiring about was that of a man who got only 10/- a week and who asked me why he would not get the full 17/6.  I saw an official and he said in a very dogmatic manner:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If you give us a written authority from the pensioner, I will supply you with the information.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That may be the regulation.  I went to a second person and he supplied me with all details.  I went to a third and got the information but I was told politely that I would not get it again. If that is a change of attitude, I cannot understand it, because those people were always most polite and obliging when I went to them.  It is only this week that I had a complaint to make. If Deputies who are stopped in the street and asked by people to inquire into pension cases have to get written authority to find out why the people did not get their full pension, I am afraid it will be putting Deputies to an awful lot of trouble.  Another grievance&mdash;which, I suppose, was in existence before the time of the present Minister&mdash;is the stoppage of unemployment assistance to people, say, in the suburbs of Cork during the summer months.  People who have been working all their lives within the City of Cork and who have drawn unemployment assistance in the City of Cork are knocked off their unemployment assistance during the summer months because they reside in the rural areas.  They have then to approach the pauperisation stage again, according to the Minister, and go to the home assistance officer to get relief to tide them over. I appeal to the Minister to remedy that <Col N="1393" /> state of affairs if he can, so that people who are normally employed in urban areas will not be victimised.  It is entirely wrong that such people should be forced to apply for home assistance to the home assistance officer during the summer months.</P>
    <P>Another appeal which I should like to make to the Minister is to consider very seriously increasing the unemployment, national health and widows' and orphans' allowances.  If he looks into the matter he will see that, at least in the cities, it is impossible for people to live on these allowances.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lemass, in one of his points, made what I consider was a very peculiar statement.  He said that old men were on the register and that he believed we have reached the stage when they should not be on the register.  I agree with that statement entirely if there is an alternative. Why were they put on the register? Because no work was available, and if work is available they are expected to avail of it.  If they are taken off the register, what is the alternative?  What category are you going to put them into?  I agree with the statement up to a point.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce recently referred to men who were offered work but who did not avail of it.  My knowledge in regard to the Bord na Móna scheme in Kerry is that the men who were offered work could not avail of it because they were unable to manipulate the machines.  They did not refuse to work.  We have evidence that in South Kerry men in receipt of unemployment assistance were offered work with Bord na Móna but they felt they could not accept it because, as I have said, they were unable to manipulate the machines.  Therefore, <Col N="1394" /> through no fault of their own, when they refused to go on that work&mdash; about which they knew nothing and which they could not do&mdash;they were excluded from unemployment assistance. I submit that that is one of the reasons why some of these men did not avail of the work.  I can instance the case of a man in South Kerry who suffered an injury and was, therefore, unable to manipulate the machine.  I am not justifying the refusal of these men to accept the work, but, at the same time, there is something to be said for their side of the story.</P>
      <P>I should like to know what exactly the Minister's responsibility is in relation to labour exchange conditions and the making out of lists of men.  The Kerry County Council was informed that men in receipt of the highest unemployment assistance allowance were entitled to first preference in regard to work.  Yet we have evidence that surveyors or gangers employed men who were not in receipt of the highest unemployment assistance allowance&mdash;to the detriment of those men who had families and who were in receipt of the higher unemployment assistance allowance.  I should like to know if there is an understanding in the Department that, in so far as unemployment schemes are concerned, men in receipt of the highest amount of unemployment assistance are expected to be given preference in selection. We are not clear on that point and I should like the Minister, if he has time, when replying, to refer to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point which I should like to make concerns the arrangements made by different Departments.  Bord na Móna have a certain responsibility in regard to the recruitment of men and the Department of Social Welfare has responsibility in so far as the labour exchange system is concerned. Recently, Bord na Móna had an extensive scheme in Portmagee in South Kerry.  They applied for men and distributed cards to men in receipt of unemployment assistance.  In the meantime, the Special Employment Schemes Office allocated a scheme for the area and they, too, applied for men.  They could not obtain the required number while Bord na Móna <Col N="1395" /> had these men notified.  It is evident, therefore, that there is a certain dislocation of services, (1) under the Department of Industry and Commerce and (2) under the Department of Social Welfare.  I should like the Minister to clarify that position.  I have approached several Departments in the matter in order to assist the engineers concerned to get the best men possible to carry on their respective schemes under Bord na Móna and the Special Employment Schemes Office.  I should like if that could be arranged, but I do not know which Minister is really responsible for the matter.  I do not know whether Bord na Móna have special powers whereby they can go in and apply for men in receipt of unemployment assistance and compel them to work in certain areas irrespective of whether an engineer comes from the local authority and requires them in another area or not.</P>
    <P>We now come to the subject of old age pensions.  I desire to pay a tribute to the Minister and to his Department for the way the payments have been dealt with.  At the same time, I should like to put forward a few views in relation to the type of assessment. There has been a considerable improvement in regard to the means test&mdash;we admit that and we appreciate it&mdash;and the Minister and the Government are to be congratulated on it.  However, as far as I can see, there are certain anomalies all the time.  I have in mind the case of a woman who applied for an old age pension.  Her husband was in receipt of unemployment assistance and she was assessed for the unemployment assistance which her husband was in receipt of.  That, in my opinion, is contrary to the principle of what we believe to be the modification of the means test.  If the State comes to the assistance of one member of the family because he is unemployed and in the meantime another member qualifies for the old age pension, it is strange to think that this other member is penalised and her means are assessed simply because her husband is in receipt of unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like again to <Col N="1396" /> express appreciation of the great advance the Government has made in making available increased pensions to widows and orphans and old age pensioners and in the improvement generally.  I hope the time will come when the Minister will see his way to fulfil the full measure of his intentions. I understand that it is the intention of the Government to give old age pensions to people at 65 years and increase the allowance.  We know that it is only a matter of time until the Government will do that, but irrespective of that, we appreciate what has been done and I congratulate the Minister.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Social Welfare is responsible for a number of welfare schemes and social services including unemployment assistance and unemployment insurance.  Much controversy has arisen round the question of whether large numbers of genuine unemployed sign the unemployment registers or whether they are not genuinely seeking work.  Personally, I have not known a single case yet of a man who could get work and did not take it.  I am not aware of its happening. I know numbers of men who are seeking work and who are willing to take work if it is offered to them.  We had Deputy Rooney blowing hot and cold on this matter here to-night.  He seemed to agree with the Minister's colleagues, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce, that there are large numbers of such people in the country.  He told the House that he was aware of numbers of unemployed who refused to go out of their area.  He mentioned the Maltese workers who came here and went to the Erne.  The Deputy from Donegal told us that they stayed three days and said that the Minister should look into conditions there.  The conditions were good enough for Irish workers but when the Maltese workers refused to stay there must be something wrong according to Deputy Rooney.  I hope that is not our view about our own unemployed or that it is only when foreigners find out the conditions are bad on a scheme it is time to have them looked up.  There probably is something wrong on these large schemes.  Otherwise I believe that <Col N="1397" /> 99 per cent. of our unemployed, if they were physically fit, would take employment on them.  I have yet to learn of men who are prepared to go to the coal-mines in England or to other very strenuous jobs there and who would not take employment in their own country.  I have never found such men at all.  Men who have homes and families must calculate whether the work will be any use to them and, if they must break up their home, travel long distances, keep two homes and pay for their digs and food, they will have anything to send to their wives and families or sufficient to maintain them.  An unemployed man may have his mother or sister at home and it may be very difficult to break up his home.  As a result of the emigration that took place all through the war unfortunately and especially last year, a big number of those who might travel to take work on the Shannon, in Donegal or on the turf in the West have all gone from the country.  The Minister is pretty well aware of that and it is a sad state of affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That brings us to the commission on emigration which the Minister set up 15 or 16 months ago.  I am sure that the Minister is as anxiously awaiting its report as the country is and the solution which that commission may bring&mdash;I hope will bring&mdash;to end emigration. I have no doubt that the Minister has from time to time inquired of the commission what progress has been made.  Perhaps he could tell us whether it has made an interim report yet.  It is usual after a certain time if a commission has not an opportunity of fully considering a big, many-sided problem to provide the Minister who set it up with an interim report and give its views on some matter of urgent importance that needs his consideration and help even partially to solve the problem.  There has been, however, a cloak of absolute silence over this commission since it was brought into existence.  I do not know if it sits in public; we see no reports anyway.  If it sits in private, I am sure that the Minister is aware of the number of times it has sat, the evidence taken and how far it has got towards a solution of the problem of emigration and the problems arising <Col N="1398" /> from emigration.  If the Minister can do nothing else during his term of office but provide a solution for emigration, he will have justified himself and justified himself very fully.  We all hope and the country hopes for the best from this emigration commission, but certainly people are wondering whether it will provide a solution or not.  I suppose we must only wait and see and possess our souls with patience. During the past year under the Minister's administration as a member of the Government, unemployment increased in rural areas very definitely. I do not say that the Minister is responsible, but he has collective responsibility as a member of the Government.</P>

      <P>The Minister is responsible for miscellaneous social welfare services.  I take it that he will answer for those.  I notice that there is a decrease of £145,000 odd in those services. Perhaps the Minister could explain that.  It occurs under a number of sub-heads.  That sum would do something to relieve the needy&mdash; perhaps many of them unemployed. That amount would be a supplement to many people who are not the best off in the country.  The amount provided for unemployment assistance and unemployment insurance has decreased by £121,000 in the present year.  That also would be an aid.  If it was necessary to have that amount last year, it is certainly doubly necessary this year. Perhaps the Minister would explain why he agreed to cut that by £121,000. He would help the needy, and the unemployed, too, by providing at least as much money as his predecessor provided last year under these two schemes alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Vote for National Health Insurance is much less this year.  That is another way the Minister took, during the course of the last administrative year, to compel the workers and the employers to provide more money for that Vote.  He was enabled to cut the Vote in that way, by putting an extra £1,000,000 on the employers and workers of the country during the course of the year.  The Minister may claim credit for increasing old age pensions and widows' and orphans' pensions.  I do not deny that they were increased, but they were increased also, and doubled, by his predecessors during their term of office.  Some were more than doubled.  The Minister will not deny that, though he was told by his supporters behind him, during the course of the evening, that Fianna Fáil were opposed to the welfare of the poor and did nothing to improve the social services.  As Deputy McGrath pointed <Col N="1400" /> out, the increase was the substantial amount of over £9,000,000 during their term of office.  It was not bad at all. If the Minister is able to increase the social services&mdash;if he is over there, which had 1,000 to one against it, as long as the previous Government were &mdash;by £9,000,000 or £10,000,000, he will not have done too badly.  I doubt very much if he will ever do it, or provide the funds to increase the social services by as much as his predecessor.</P>
    <P>We have been a long time waiting for the White Paper the Minister promised us last year he would bring in a month or two after he came in.  He repromised it in another two months and quite recently he said it was under way.  I wonder if it will be brought in during the term of office of this Government. We would like to hear from him whether he proposes implementing the White Paper during his term of office and providing funds to implement it. It will be interesting to hear him tell us about that.  I am sure he has made such progress with that White Paper now that some of the details might be given to the country.  In some respects, it is an injury to certain people not to have the details of the social welfare scheme we all hope will see the light of day in the near future.  It would clarify people's minds on many things that may arise under the new scheme.</P>
    <P>I hope this question of the unemployed and of people being knocked off unemployment assistance will be dealt with.  We can throw our minds back to the pre-unemployment assistance days, when thousands of genuine unemployed workers had nothing to fall back on.  I hope those days will not come again.  Unfortunately, there is necessity at present for the unemployment assistance code&mdash;and there will be for many a long day.  There are many elements in the community who are only partially employed, because of physique or health, and it is doubtful if they ever could be employed at strenuous labour.  They must be maintained by some State source.  The Minister may say it is the function of the local authority to maintain such people, but it is not.  The State has undertaken that in the past and I have no doubt the State will continue to maintain <Col N="1401" /> such people in the future.  Any indication we had from the Minister for Finance seems to show that he has made up his mind fairly well that such a thing as unemployment assistance should not be in existence.  I am sure the Minister will clear up that point. There is a feeling in the country that there may be some planning to do away with unemployment assistance. I hope the Minister will not countenance such a thing, as, unfortunately, there is need for it, especially in large centres of population.  Even in the towns of small population, there are numbers of unemployed, varying from time to time but usually the same people.</P>
    <P>I cannot see anything revolutionary in this Estimate.  There is an increase in widows' and orphans' pensions and old age pensions, but that was provided for in legislation the Minister brought in.  There are substantial decreases under other headings.  It is about time national health insurance was improved and the sick got an increased allowance.  They are paying increased contributions as a result of the Minister's actions, but they are not getting one half-penny more than they received weekly under his predecessor. The Minister might admit that.  They are a deserving class of the community that he might justifiably help, but they are still waiting for an increase in the sickness benefit.</P>

      <P>I was listening to Deputy Rooney making his contribution to this debate and I must say that that contribution was full of reckless statements and falsehoods.  He followed on the same line that some other people recently have been following. He tried to make the point that it was Fianna Fáil who were getting people to register at the labour exchanges and swell the register, for political purposes. Every responsible person knows that that is not the case.  He also made another point against the managers of the labour exchanges.  He went on to argue that the managers of the labour exchanges were discriminating between applicants for unemployment assistance. Strange to say, the Minister for Social Welfare sat silently by and apparently accepted that because we are told that silence gives consent. The fact of the matter is that a good many of those managers of employment exchanges, if not the majority of them, were there before our time.  So I do not think it can be said that there is any such thing as discrimination in the administration of the Uemployment Assistance Acts.</P>
      <P>Deputy Rooney also went back on what had been done since this present Government took office.  I, for one, cannot see what wonderful things have been done.  I would say that the percentage of increases in the social services that has been brought about by the present Government is less than the percentage that was brought about by us.</P>

      <P>I wonder if Deputy O'Higgins, the person who is a member of the Party that actually went out of office in 1932 for not listening to reason as regards the old age pensions, is serious in that statement.</P>

      <P>I am not responsible for the lateness of the hour.  Deputy Rooney also mentioned the number of unemployed.  He held forth about the reduction that had been effected in the number of unemployed in this country over the past year and a half, since the present Government took office.  Here are the figures as far as I can ascertain them.  In June, 1947, there were 40,483 registered as unemployed, whereas on the 11th June this year there were 59,745.</P>

      <P>Yes, for the fun of it. Of course, the Minister for Finance is not concerned at all with the unemployed. Nor is he concerned, it appears, with the expansion of social services. Nor is the Taoiseach concerned with the expansion of social services when he said on one occasion, as one of the Deputies mentioned here, that all these social services were so many medicine bottles.</P>
