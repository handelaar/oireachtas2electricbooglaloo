      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether he is aware of the long delay in the restoration of the Griffith-Collins-O'Higgins cenotaph at Leinster Lawn; and, if so, whether he will state the cause of the delay and whether the design has yet been approved; and, furthermore, whether he will arrange that the work be commenced at the earliest possible moment.</P>

      <P>The delay in this matter has been due to the necessity for the greatest care in the selection of a suitable design for the memorial and in the planning of the lay-out of the grounds of which it will be the central feature.  The design has been approved, and work on the site has already begun.  I can assure the Deputy that the erection of the memorial will proceed with all possible despatch.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Keyes) (for Minister for Education)</NameTxt>
      <P>Owing to the limited amount of capital expenditure which can be sanctioned for vocational schools at present it was possible to authorise only one of these schools, Mitchelstown, in the current financial year, and approval <Col N="252" /> accordingly was given in April last to the County Cork Vocational Education Committee.  The committee has since submitted sketch plans, and these plans are at present under consideration. The question of Midleton School is being considered in connection with the capital sum to be allocated for vocational schools in the financial year 1950-51.</P>

      <P>I should like to point out that the erection of these schools is in abeyance for the past 12 years. There are two very important industries functioning in these towns and it is an absolute necessity to have the schools built within the shortest period possible and that the Minister should avail immediately of both the material and the skilled labour which are at present in the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands whether, in view of his promise to a deputation which he received in Tullamore in October, 1948, that the lands at Ballyhasson, Walsh Island, Geashill, Offaly, would be divided, he will now say what progress has been made in this connection by the Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>As a result of representations made to me when in this district, these lands were inspected by the Land Commission with a view to <Col N="253" /> resumption, but the Land Commission decided not to resume.  Following further strong representations made to me by the Deputies interested in this case I took the unusual step of having a special independent investigation carried out by an experienced inspector who had no previous official connection with the case or with the district.  This independent investigation satisfied me that the facts and circumstances on which the decision not to resume the lands was based were correctly represented in the first instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that when he visited Tullamore he gave a very definite undertaking to a deputation, of which I was a member, that these lands would be acquired for division? Could the Minister say what has happened since to change the policy of the Land Commission in the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>What happened on that occasion was that I gave a very definite assurance, which was carried out, that I would bring the case to the notice of the Land Commission and do my best to have the Land Commission resume these lands, if they saw fit to do so.  An inspection was carried out and the Land Commission decided not to resume the lands.  Some time later, while the Deputy was indisposed, Deputies O'Higgins and Davin came to me and made a strong case that the Land Commission did wrong in not resuming these lands.  It was then, as I pointed out in my reply, that I asked for a special investigation into the whole case and an outside inspector, who had instructions not to contact the local inspectors and to furnish a purely independent report, carried out an investigation and his report confirmed what had been previously reported. That is the history of the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say how he can stand over 425 acres of land not being resumed in a district where we have a number of uneconomic holders, while the lands are being used for the purpose of raising racehorses? Is it the policy of the Minister to defend a case such as that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>There are something over 300 acres in this holding, and 50 <Col N="254" /> acres of that are moorland, cut-away bog and dangerous ground.  While I agree that there is congestion in the locality, I must say that, from the reports, I fully agree that this is not the kind of land to relieve congestion in the locality.  While the Land Commission will take steps to come to the relief of the congestion that the Deputy has in mind, this is not the kind of land we would acquire for that purpose, because we have enough of that kind of land already.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the unfavourable reply, I propose to raise the matter on the adjournment, with your permission, Sir.  I should like to say that the Minister is receiving a deputation about these lands to-day and, in the event of the result being favourable, there will be no necessity to raise the matter on the adjournment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands whether he is aware that, as a result of the failure of the Land Commission to acquire the house and small portion of land on which Mr. Peter Molloy, Cappincur, Tullamore, County Offaly, resides with his wife and family (estate of Mrs. Grace Davidson, Record No. S.9772), the owner of the house and lands, who resides in <Col N="255" /> Australia, has decided to evict Mr. Molloy and his family immediately in order to sell the property; and, if so, whether he will request the Land Commission to reconsider the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>From the unofficial information I have, I think this is a case which will develop into a dispute between this alleged tenant and the owner.  It seems that this person has not any tenancy and went to live in this house on the suggestion of some person who had no authority to let him into the house and that he pays no rent. If my presumption is correct, this will develop into a law suit between this man and the owner, and it has nothing to do with us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say why the Land Commission excluded from their scheme this small portion of land which Mr. Molloy is interested in, while all the rest of the area was included?  Can he give the House or furnish Deputies with an explanation of the extraordinary action of the Land Commission in not acquiring this house and land?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to point out to the Deputy that the Land Commissioners are absolutely free to take what land they wish and to exclude any particular farm, if they see fit to do so.  There is definitely going to be some trouble about title in this case and the Land Commission do not wish to get involved in it.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture (a) whether he intends to discontinue payment of the subsidy in respect of wholemeal flour, which is an important source of vitamin B and therefore a valuable form of food; (b) whether it is a fact that the saving which would be effected by the withdrawal of the subsidy would be infinitesimal since in such an event persons who now use wholemeal flour would be likely to purchase subsidised flour instead; and (c) whether, in view of this, and of the unemployment and hardship which would be caused in rural areas to small-scale millers and their employees by the withdrawal, he will consult with the Minister for Industry and Commerce before coming to a final decision in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the Deputy's question is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  Yes.  I do not believe that wholemeal flour has the unqualified approval of health authorities as the best source of the vitamin referred to, and it has been clearly established that for children its dietetic value is materially qualified by its content of phytic acid, the effect of which on calcium metabolism is not insignificant. The Deputy will recall that the Government policy in respect of bread and flour subsidy is to ascertain what flour extraction constitutes the best flour from a dietetic point of view and to guarantee to everybody a sufficient ration of that flour or bread at the subsidised price, leaving everybody free to purchase flour of a lower or higher extraction as they may wish on the same basis as confectionery is available&mdash;that is, at the economic price;</P>
      <P>(b) inasmuch as there is good reason to believe that a substantial part of the total production of wheatenmeal is being used for animal feeding, the withdrawal of the subsidy is calculated to relieve the total charge for bread and flour subsidy by from £80,000 to £100,000 per annum, a sum to which I cannot agree the adjective &ldquo;infinitesimal&rdquo; is appropriately applied;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(c) withdrawal of the subsidy will <Col N="264" /> not be made until satisfactory arrangements have been completed to ensure that no worker at present employed in any of the mills to which the Deputy refers will lose his employment.</P>
    <P>If the interests concerned will cooperate with me in securing this important relief on the Food Subsidy Vote, I confidently anticipate that whatever reduction in total output of wheatenmeal may come about will be more than compensated for by alternative work of an economic character which can be made available to take the place of the wheatenmeal milling, in the shape of wheat assembling, maize and compound feed manufacture, milling on commission, and other cereal assembly work, which it is intended to orient to these mills so that the proprietors may suffer no loss and the workers no suspension of their employment permanent or temporary.</P>

This being so, I do not see how this problem could be remedied by legislation or administrative action.  The only possible solution seems to me to be that the proprietors of libraries should try to arrange with their suppliers not to send them any books which are likely to be banned and to accept back books which are banned.  The question of returning the books is, of course, a matter entirely between the purchasers and the suppliers, and the State has no concern with it.</P>

      <P>With regard to the question of rates, I am not aware of any difficulty peculiar to County Dublin. As the Deputy knows, the rate in the £ on agricultural land is very considerably abated by the agricultural grant.  The housing subsidies already available comprise contributions towards loan charges, grants from the Transition Development Fund and the <Col N="271" /> provision of capital moneys at 2½ per cent., repayable over a period of 50 years.  Any further relief must be sought by housing authorities in a reduction of building costs and the adoption of a differential rent system.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, is the Minister aware that the incomes of a number of farmers in County Dublin have been reduced as a result of the agricultural economy pursued by the present Minister for Agriculture?  Furthermore, is the Minister aware that, so far as County Dublin is concerned, this is a double-edged question?  A number of the agricultural workers cannot pay the increased contribution and the farmer ratepayers cannot pay more.  It is up to the Government, which promised to reduce the cost of living by 30 per cent., to do something to alleviate the position because, as it stands at present, there is an increase in the cost of living.</P>

      <P>Allowances payable under the Infectious Diseases (Maintenance) Regulations, 1948 and 1949 are subject to abatement in respect of other income of the persons concerned. Where a person suffering from tuberculosis is being maintained free of charge in a sanatorium by a health authority, the allowance is at a lower rate than that payable to a person receiving treatment at home.  The reduction made in the allowance when free institutional treatment is provided, namely, £1 3s. per week in the case of a person from a county borough or £1 per week in the case of a person from a county, is, in fact, considerably less than the cost to the health authority of providing the institutional treatment for the patient.</P>
      <P>While the allowance payable to a person receiving free institutional treatment is subject to abatement in respect of other income of the patient, I have requested health authorities to administer the scheme in a sympathetic manner, and to refrain from rigorous application of the means test in the case of persons in the low income group.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>During the discussion on this Bill there has been quite a considerable amount of loose talk about nationalisation.  Some Deputies <Col N="278" /> have expressed the view that this Bill brings about the nationalisation of transport.  I say that it does not do so and that, notwithstanding the explanatory memorandum issued by the Minister and the speech of the Minister himself in moving the Second Reading of this Bill, this Bill does not bring our transport under public control.  In fact, as I read the Bill, it puts it out of public control and certainly out of the control of Parliament.  The Bill provides for the setting up of a board and that board is given very extensive powers.  Members of that board may be appointed by the Government but there is a peculiar section further on which provides that if the Government remove from office any member of the board they shall lay before each House of the Oireachtas a statement in writing of the fact of his removal from office and of the reasons for such removal.  The extraordinary thing is that no reason will be given to the Dáil for appointing an individual but if it is proposed to dismiss him then the reasons for that dismissal will be given.  I say that that is a deceptive sop to the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board will be a board of Government nominees.  We have no guarantee in the Bill as it stands that any one of those people appointed to the board will know anything whatsoever about running a transport organisation. When I mentioned this matter on Thursday last Deputy M.J. O'Higgins asked me how I would cure that.  I believe that Córas Iompair Éireann and the Grand Canal Company should both be constituted into one organisation. Every member, official and employee of those two organisations should be brought into one organisation under public control, and that control ought to be exercised by Parliament by having, as chairman, a member of the Government or a Parliamentary Secretary, and the other members of the board should be officials either from Córas Iompair Éireann or the Grand Canal Company who, because of their efficiency and capability, would be fit to control a transport organisation.  That would give us a public control and at the same time it would ensure that the most experienced transport officials in <Col N="279" /> the country, working on transport problems, would control and administer the affairs of the new organisation. The Act of 1944 did retain public control. It vested in the chairman of the time what were described as dictatorial powers.  They were wide powers in an individual.  In fact, that individual was almost a board in himself, but that chairman was in the position of being appointed and removed by the Government&mdash;and the Minister's Parliamentary responsibility was not affected.  In fact, in the administration of the 1944 Act, there was bound to be, and must have been, very close co-operation between the chairman and the Minister and, to that extent, there was public control.  That protection disappears under the present Bill.</P>

I said &ldquo;protection.&rdquo; That protection disappears under the present Bill and, instead of having one individual with some responsibility to the Government, we have a board of five or six persons, apparently with no responsibility at all in vital matters to the Government or to this House.  In introducing the 1944 Act, and again speaking on this Bill, Deputy Lemass laid down certain principles which, I think, are generally accepted and certainly some of them are accepted by Sir James Milne in the report which has been circulated. Those principles in brief are that the management of the transport organisation must be conducted in accordance with the requirements of public policy. There is no obligation on the new board to conduct the management of the transport organisation in accordance with the requirements of public policy.  It may be said that those people will be appointed by the Government and that they will be very anxious to carry out their work and their duties in accordance with what they may conceive to be public policy.</P>

I see, if we do that, no solution within the lifetime of any one of us now living to the transport problem.</P>
      <P>Another of the principles laid down was that the transport management must be so directed as to facilitate the achievement of the economic aims of the Government.  Who is going to ensure that?  How will the board know what the economic aims of the Government are, or if those economic aims of the Government are indicated to the board by the Minister or otherwise, what obligation is there on the board to facilitate those aims?  How are they to do it?  What will their business be?</P>
      <P>Another principle laid down and accepted was that there must be adequate control by Parliament of the charges for transport facilities of all kinds and in all circumstances.  If we pass this Bill in its present form we will have surrendered our right as a Parliament to control the charges and I would like Deputies to face up to that fact.  Are Deputies sent here by their constituents to surrender that very important control, the control of transport charges?  The Minister asks us in this Bill to surrender those rights and hand them over completely to a board that may or may not be efficient, a board that may or may not be capable.  I think that every Deputy should reflect and reflect very seriously before he agrees to hand over or surrender those important rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another principle apparently agreed on by everybody was that the Government must have the power to ensure adequate transport facilities in all parts of the country.  If this Bill is passed we will not have the power or the Government will not have the power to ensure adequate transport facilities in all parts of the country. <Col N="281" /> That will be entirely a matter for the board; the Government will have given up that right and this Dáil will have surrendered whatever control it has over the exercise of that right.</P>
    <P>Two other principles that were laid down were that there must not be discriminatory treatment of individuals using the transport services and that there must be safeguards to prevent discrimination between one individual and another and one area and another and that transport must be made available to all interests.</P>
    <P>In 1944 Deputy Lemass laid down those principles.  They were not new principles laid down by Deputy Lemass; they were principles resulting from experience, principles which are to be found, perhaps in other words, even in the report of Sir James Milne. Those principles and those safeguards will disappear if the Bill in its present form becomes law.  Everybody agrees that cheap public transport facilities are vital to national development.  The Government is responsible for national development and in so far as cheap transport contributes to national development the Government under this Bill will lose its power to contribute to national development by ensuring cheap transport.  It is my submission that if we as a Dáil hand over this vital power of fixing the charges to the new board without control or safeguard we will be doing a bad day's work and one that every Deputy will regret.</P>
    <P>The branch lines have figured in political propaganda over a period. During the last general election and prior to it quite a number of people, many of them now Deputies, had very strong criticism to make of the closing of the branch railway lines.  It seems clear to me that if this Bill is passed the branch lines that are now closed will not be reopened and that other branch lines now operating will be closed, and if that happens then we, as a Parliament, can do nothing about it.  All this Bill requires is that notice of closing be given, that compensation be paid to the railway employees who lose their employment and that road services be substituted, and there is nothing to ensure that the substituted road services will be continued. <Col N="282" /> According to the Minister, in moving the Second Reading of the Bill, the question of the retention or otherwise of a branch line must be judged in the first instance by reference to the public interest.  Under the Bill, who is to decide what is in the public interest?  Is it the Government, the Minister or the board?  Under the Bill, it is the board and not the Minister or the Government.  Therefore, according to the Minister's own speech, in a matter which must be judged in the first instance by reference to the public interest, the board is to make the decision and not the Government or the Minister.</P>
    <P>I should have imagined that, when this Bill in draft form came before the Government, those Ministers who were so vocal in the general election in regard to the branch lines, would have ensured that the safeguards there were, or new safeguards, would be provided in this measure.  I agree that it is inevitable that certain branch lines must be closed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>If a branch line is uneconomic, if its stations are too far away from the towns or villages that it serves and if an adequate road service can be made available, then it may be in the public interest to close that particular branch line.  It is ridiculous to suggest that, if a branch line is losing money day after day, if it is not availed of, either for passengers or for goods, it should be retained in all circumstances. Circumstances may arise when it may be correct to close a branch line; but, as the community is interested, a public inquiry should be held and all interests affected should have the opportunity of coming before that inquiry and putting their point of view, and the decision to close, resulting from that inquiry, should be taken, not by the board but by the Minister, who would be answerable for his action to this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said on Thursday night, and I repeat, that this Bill will not solve the difficulties facing Córas Iompair Éireann.  It avoids dealing with one <Col N="283" /> of the greatest obstacles to the success of Córas Iompair Éireann, that is, the competition of lorries owned by private individuals or firms, whether those lorries are licensed carriers of merchandise, whether they are used for carrying the owner's goods or, as hundreds of them are throughout the country, used illegally at the moment for the illegal conveyance of goods.  If the figures given by Deputy Davin in this debate are correct, that Córas Iompair Éireann and the Grand Canal Company have only 807 lorries and that other interests have over 13,000 lorries in operation, it must be clear to the Minister and the Government that to leave that problem untouched is to do nothing to solve our transport problems.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>It also makes it clear, of course, that Córas Iompair Éireann have not a monopoly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is clear, but if there are 13,000 lorries operating against Córas Iompair Éireann, it is clear that the company cannot be a financial success.  That is the problem that the Minister must face.  I know that it is not popular to tackle that problem, since those lorry owners all over the country are vocal and powerful; but if we are to maintain good employment and an efficient system of transport, we must deal with the problem of those private lorries carrying merchandise.  That is why I feel that this Bill is bound to fail to achieve its object.  Just as the 1944 Bill was a failure, this 1949 Bill, when it becomes an Act, will also be a failure.  I think the Minister is unwise in not dealing with this matter now.  The Dáil is sympathetic and is anxious to give him and the Government such powers as will enable our transport to be put on a sound basis, for the first time in many years.  Every Party in the House will assist him, if he will bring in the necessary provisions to deal with that problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In opening his speech on this reading, the Minister referred to the capital commitments entered into or about to be incurred by Córas Iompair Éireann and he gave these figures: Locomotives, <Col N="284" /> £6,000,000; wagons, £2,225,000; coaches, £3,000,000; making a total of over £11,000,000 which Córas Iompair Éireann proposed to expend on engines, wagons and coaches.  They intended to spend another £905,000 on buses. That makes a total of £12,130,000 that they proposed to expend on providing new engines, new wagons, new coaches and new buses.  I take it that the Minister and the present chairman have examined this problem, particularly in view of what Sir James Milne has said about the numbers of different types of engines that Córas Iompair Éireann have.  May I ask the Minister how much the new organisation intends to spend on engines?  Has the Minister considered it?  Has the present chairman of the board considered how much money they must expend on engines for Córas Iompair Éireann?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but Sir James Milne recommended that we should sell 100.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether they can be sold or not, but certainly quite a number of them could be disposed of because they are out of date.  There are too many types. Their maintenance cost is excessive. The modern idea in regard to machinery of that kind is to get new ones as often as possible and thus reduce repair and maintenance costs. May I repeat the question to the Minister? How much has he been advised by the present chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann it is necessary to expend on the provision of new engines?  We know that the carriages are in a deplorable state, a shocking state.  Córas Iompair Éireann propose to spend £3,000,000 in replacing those coaches.  May I ask the Minister how much he is advised by the present chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann it will be necessary to expend on the provision of new coaches?  May I ask him how much he is advised must be expended on the provision of new wagons?  Finally, may I ask him how much he is advised at the present moment should be spent on the provision of new buses?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is all very well to say that this is a shocking bill, amounting to £12,130,000.  It is very easy to strike <Col N="285" /> a note with a question of that kind. But we know that new engines, new wagons, new coaches and new buses must be provided.  It is a reasonable question to ask how much does the Minister or the Government or Córas Iompair Éireann think should be spent on the provision of this new equipment. Then we could compare their estimate of what should be expended with the estimate of the late chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann.</P>
    <P>This Bill authorises the raising of £7,000,000 for capital purposes.  How has that figure of £7,000,000 been arrived at?  Is it just a figure that has been taken in the dark or does it represent certain works or certain equipment of a capital nature?  What does it represent?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not concerned with what Sir James Milne suggested. What I want to know is what any person about to expend money would want to know: what have I to buy? what have I to pay for it; what have I to erect; what have I to expend on the erection?  I am entitled as a Deputy to that information.  This House is entitled to that information.  Is the £7,000,000 just a shot in the dark? What does it represent?  I want the Minister to tell me how many engines, wagons, coaches and buses he intends to provide; what the cost of those things will be and whether, when he has provided them, he will have anything left out of the £7,000,000 or not. That is a reasonable question to put to the Minister and it is reasonable that that information should be made available to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret very much that the other items of capital expenditure that were mentioned by the Minister in regard to the spring shop, tool shop, plant <Col N="286" /> and all these other matters of development, amounting to approximately £5,000,000, should be just brushed aside and that it should be said that they were proposed by Mr. Reynolds and that that is all that is to be said about it.  Because he recommended them, that condemns them.  Every Deputy is anxious to see moneys expended in this country on capital development.  We would all like to see the improvements and developments that were suggested by that £5,000,000 capital expenditure, if it could be done.  Five million pounds in these days is not a huge sum of money but, if that £5,000,000 helps to give good employment, helps to train technicians and to provide employment for them, it will be money well spent.  One of our great troubles is that we are inclined to be rather small in dealing with the country; we are inclined to run the country in the way a huckster's shop is run.  I do not think we will get anywhere with that mentality.  We want a reasonably big mentality, if we are to develop after the many years in which development was neglected. I hope that the passing of this Bill will not put an end to all these schemes.  I hope that these schemes will be considered on their merits in relation to the transport undertaking and the national interest.</P>
    <P>One of those items of capital expenditure is the Store Street bus station. The Minister says that he agrees that a central station is necessary but he does not agree that Store Street is the right place for it, nor does he believe that the building which has been erected there should be utilised as a bus station.  Each and every one of us should be ashamed of the manner in which for years in the City of Dublin our fellow citizens who travel from the country to Dublin and from Dublin to the country and visitors to our shores have been treated on the quays of Dublin.  They are herded there in a tin shed which is an absolute disgrace to the city, with the stench of the Liffey in the summer time coming right up into the shocking structure which is provided there.</P>
    <P>Everybody agrees that there should be a decent station for these travellers <Col N="287" /> and the idea which was at the back of this Store Street project was a good idea, because it provided a place where these passengers could rest, a place where they could assemble in comfort, a place which would provide certain necessaries and essentials and a place which was convenient to most of the bus services in the city.  No more suitable site than Store Street could have been got for that project.  It combined two things&mdash;it combined these facilities for bus travellers with office accommodation. The Minister says that it is unwise to transfer the offices of Córas Iompair Éireann to that building.  Very well; let us accept that part of it, that it is unwise to transfer the offices. There is extensive office accommodation in this new building.  The Department of Social Welfare wants offices, and extensive and suitable offices are available there for that Department. In addition, there is a bus station where bus passengers can be accommodated and provided with all the amenities and facilities to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>I understand that the idea is for the Government to buy over the whole building from Córas Iompair Éireann and to make it available for the Department of Social Welfare.  I understand that Córas Iompair Éireann were prepared to hand over the office accommodation and to retain the accommodation for the passengers in what I might call the bus terminus part of the building and that the Government would not take the building at all unless they got it whole and entire, from the ground right up to the top. May I ask the Minister for what purpose the Government intend to use the ground floor portion of the premises? What offices of Social Welfare or any other Government Department can be accommodated there?  That part of it is entirely unsuitable as offices, but the Government insist that, unless they get the whole building from Córas Iompair Éireann, they will not take the office accommodation.  The Government suggest&mdash;I take it that it is a Government suggestion because it is now coming through Córas Iompair Éireann&mdash;that they will build another bus station, instead of the one they have, in Smithfield, <Col N="288" /> a place which is inconvenient.  I understand that when plans were prepared for that bus station, they were rejected as being too expensive and, in the end, the idea is to build a sort of hay shed in Smithfield in which our bus-travelling public will be placed while they are waiting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of these rumours are not so far short of the mark.  Will the Minister say why, if all the facilities for a bus station are there, they will not be utilised?  Has the Minister, or has the Government, any purpose in punishing these tens of thousands of passengers by leaving them stranded in the conditions existing on the quays in Dublin?  Why cannot the bus station part of the project go ahead and let the Government rent or otherwise acquire these offices which may be needed for the Department of Social Welfare?</P>
      <P>It has been said&mdash;I heard Deputies saying it who know nothing about the problem&mdash;that the utilisation of Store Street as a bus station is going to create tremendous congestion in the central parts of Dublin.  The plans that are available for the routes of our long distance bus traffic will create no further trouble from a traffic congestion point of view in the centre of Dublin.  I ask the Minister seriously to consider letting that part of the building be completed, so that reasonably decent facilities will be available for these passengers&mdash;and they are very many&mdash;who have to avail of our long-distance buses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another serious criticism of the late chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann made by the Minister was that he proposed to dismiss 3,500 workers.  May I ask the Minister how many workers will be dismissed when this Bill is in operation?  That dismissals will take place there is no doubt.  There are most elaborate provisions in the Bill for compensation for workers who lose their employment as a result of the closing of branch lines and otherwise. Can the Minister say whether the number of people to be dismissed will be 1,000, 2,000 or 3,000?  I take it that the <Col N="289" /> matter has been considered by Córas Iompair Éireann and the present chairman, that they know how many workers are redundant, how many branch lines are to be closed and know how many workers are surplus and how many will be dismissed.  I think it reasonable that the Dáil should have some idea from the Minister of the number of people whose employment will be affected by the Bill and who will be dismissed.</P>
    <P>I should have imagined that the Act of 1944 would have been completely wiped out.  That measure had an unsavoury history, or there was an unsavoury history attached to it, but I find that of that Act two sections, a part of a schedule and a complete schedule will disappear.  Obviously, certain other parts of the Bill will cease to have any operative effect.  I should have liked to see clearly stated in the Bill what sections of the 1944 Act will cease to have operative effect, so that one could make some little endeavour to see where we stand, so far as this Bill is concerned.  It would probably have been too much to expect the Minister to have brought in a comprehensive Bill, but this Bill as it stands is simply an amendment of the 1944 Act, containing quite a number of provisions which would never have been accepted when the 1944 Act was going through this House.</P>
    <P>There are a few other matters to which I should like to refer before concluding.  Section 13 of the Bill proposes to give the Minister power by order to confer additional powers on the board.  The Bill in itself gives the widest possible powers to the board and I think it is only right that the powers contained in this Bill should be amended only by the Dáil and Seanad in the ordinary way.  I think it is objectionable to give the Minister authority to provide powers for the board additional to the many that are given to the board in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 40 provides for the appointment of a standing arbitrator and, for some reason that I cannot understand, the appointment of that arbitrator is to be made by the Chief Justice.  There is nothing in the Bill as to what the qualifications of a standing arbitrator are to be, nothing only a bald provision <Col N="290" /> that the Chief Justice, whenever so requested, shall appoint a person to be a standing arbitrator.  Why should the Chief Justice do that?  It is not one of the functions of the Chief Justice.  The Chief Justice has his own functions and there are very many functions given to him by statute.  He is selected in the Bill to appoint the standing arbitrator. I say that there is no necessity for that. If a standing arbitrator is to be appointed, he should be appointed either by the Government or the Minister. I think it is very unwise to provide that he should be appointed by the Chief Justice.</P>
    <P>Sections 44 and 45 are two sections that perhaps are necessary but the nature of the new organisation is set out in these two sections.  In sub-section (1) of Section 44 the board is to be a railway company.  In sub-section (2) it is to be a canal company.  In Section 45 it is to be a railway company for the purposes of the Income Tax Acts. For the purposes of the Road Transport Act, it is deemed to be a company and it is further deemed to be an authorised merchandise carrying company, for the purposes of the Road Transport Act of 1933.  Just because this is an amending measure, these two sections are probably necessary to give the board certain statutory powers and responsibilities but these sections alone show how necessary it is that somebody should get down to the drafting of a complete comprehensive code to deal with our transport.</P>
    <P>Section 50 provides that all permanent public notices and signs maintained by the board shall be in the Irish language but may be both in the Irish and the English languages, and that all passenger tickets for journeys within the State shall be printed in the Irish language but may be printed both in the Irish and the English languages.  Of course, that really means nothing at all.  It is a sop, I suppose, to enthusiasts for Irish in the Dáil and in the country.  We are to print them in Irish but we may print them in Irish and English.  If we were to print them in Irish only, they might help to familiarise passengers and people generally with the Irish names of stations and with certain <Col N="291" /> other Irish terms that would appear on those tickets and notices very frequently.  The fact that they may be in Irish and also in English seems to me to be a sop to national sentiment.</P>
    <P>Section 55 provides that if there was to be any dispute between this new board and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, it is to be referred to the High Court for determination.  Senior and junior counsel and solicitors will appear on both sides to have this matter determined by the High Court. Why any matter between two Departments of State could not be thrashed out by the Government itself without all this expenditure and all this reference to the High Court, I do not know.  I take it that there is some old statutory requirement there, but I do think that the opportunity might have been taken to simplify the matter and to leave any problems that require to be solved between the new board and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to be solved by the Government as a whole.</P>
    <P>I should not like to conclude without dealing shortly with what I consider gratuitous references to strikes made by the Minister in moving the Second Reading.  The Minister said that labour unrest and unofficial action by workers in withdrawing their services constituted one of the greatest menaces to the success of the undertaking.  In dealing with an undertaking that has been grossly incompetent for many years, an undertaking whose failure has been due to bad direction, inefficiency and incompetency, I think it was gratuitous for the Minister to make reference to the few unofficial strikes that have taken place in that particular organisation.  Workers do not take unofficial strike action unless there are some grounds, anyway, for it.  I think the trade unions themselves and the workers themselves are seriously concerned about those matters and I think it would be better if the solution of these problems were left to the workers and the unions.  Having regard to the fact that millions of money were lost by incompetent management, I think these references to unofficial strikes <Col N="292" /> seemed to be entirely unnecessary.  As I say, the greatest menace to the organisation known as Córas Iompair Éireann was incompetent directors and the failure of successive Governments to take control of the undertaking and to run it in the public interest.</P>
    <P>I hope that the members of the Dáil will give very serious consideration to the matters dealt with in this Bill, that they will take note of the safeguards that are eliminated by the Bill and that they will take special note of the rights that Parliament will be surrendering if the Bill in its present form is passed.  I would ask every Deputy who feels as I do in regard to these matters to impress his views as strongly as possible on the Minister and the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>In approaching this Bill, I think it is rather unfortunate that we are not having regard to the history of railways in this country. We are too prone to throw blame from one side of the House to the other and then to the managements of the immediate past.  It is within the recollection of most Deputies that at one time we had a number of separate railway concerns, each one of which was on the verge of closing down, and that the Government which preceded the Fianna Fáil Government brought about the amalgamation of railways in order to stave off a complete shut down of railways, with the unemployment that would follow and the consequent disruption of internal transport. At the time the Bill was going through bringing about the amalgamation of various railways, it was quite clear that that was a temporary expedient and that in the course of time, with the development of the country under its own Government, it might be possible gradually to bring about a railway or transport system which would be adequate and which would serve the needs of the country from every point of view.  Subsequently, the railway company found itself in a bad situation and an amalgamation took place between the Dublin transport system, that is to say, the tram company, and the railway company and Córas Iompair Éireann was established under the 1944 <Col N="293" /> Act.  A surplus of income from the Dublin City transport more or less helped along the railway side of this transport system and, under the 1944 Act, further development was envisaged and was possible.</P>
      <P>When this Bill was first mooted, I was anxious to find out to what extent we were going to make substantial progress in our approach to solving what appeared to be an insoluble problem. I had hoped that such consideration would be given to the matter that we would try to develop a transport system based on the national needs and that regard would be had to the economic condition of the country.  In relation to that, I find that Córas Iompair Éireann had envisaged the installation of Diesel-electric engines, that the Milne report discarded these engines completely and, so far as I can ascertain, under the proposed expenditure under this Bill there will be no change from the present type of fuel burned. In my opinion, it would be far better for the Dáil to consider abandoning the different types of engines in use in the course of time and, at a certain capital expenditure, installing a type of engine that will be cleaner than the coal-burning one, much cheaper to run and which would give much faster transport to the country.  I believe that if the Minister had come to the Dáil and said it was time to get rid of these old-style engines, some of which were running on the pre-amalgamation small railways like the Dublin South Eastern, and to put in a type of engine that could be used throughout the railway system, engines that would provide cleaner, cheaper and more rapid transport, the Dáil would not quibble at the capital cost of such an installation, particularly as the saving on the consumption of coal from a national economic point of view would justify such an approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to the introduction of this Bill I expected that we would have a Bill to nationalise the railways.  It is quite true that that was announced during the election as something that was necessary in order to get rid of what was then described as the monopoly given to Córas Iompair Éireann.  I was glad to hear the Minister interject <Col N="294" /> to-day, when the figures of the lorries owned by the railway company were compared with those privately owned, that at least that proved that Córas Iompair Éireann had not, in fact, a monopoly of transport.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking of the allegations made during the election that we had a scandalous form of transport because Córas Iompair Éireann had, in fact, an absolute monopoly.  When the 1944 Act was going through the House many objections were levelled at it on these grounds.  The fact is, however, that Córas Iompair Éireann has not a monopoly of transport.  Private concerns can carry their own goods and a certain number of private lorry owners are licensed to convey certain types of goods.  This Bill in no way nationalises railways because, if we were to nationalise the railways, I agree with Deputy Cowan that one would expect to retain control of the railways in this House, even if you had not a Minister for Transport.  But, when this House amends the 1944 Act just for the purpose of taking away from the House the right of control or criticism, then I say we are taking, from the point of view of nationalising the railways, a reverse step.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the objections I have to this Bill&mdash;it has been referred to by other speakers&mdash;is that the Minister has not included in the Bill some section which would retain some sort of control. Before the passing of the 1944 Act there was a railway tribunal and persons who felt aggrieved or felt that there were more favourable conditions given to competitors with regard to rates, etc., could appeal to that tribunal.  Under the 1944 Act there was a right of appeal to the Minister.  Now we are handing over to this new board complete and absolute control of all matters concerning the railways.  They can make their own scale of wages and they can raise or lower them.  They can reopen branch lines or close them, or to leave the ones they have closed <Col N="295" /> completely closed.  If they do that, there is no appeal.</P>
    <P>I would earnestly request the Minister to consider introducing on Committee Stage some section which would give the right of appeal.  I think if that were done it would make the board more careful in coming to decisions.  I am not going to press that the Minister himself should be the court of appeal.  I do say that he could nominate some body before which an appeal could be brought in cases of serious disagreement between the board and the public.  As I have said, I would prefer to see the person who occupies the position of Minister for Industry and Commerce more or less in the background as the Minister for Transport.  I do not know whether the Minister will give any consideration to that.  I take it that he has given consideration to the removal of the right of appeal which was given in the 1944 Act.  I again appeal to him to reconsider that, and say whether he would not be prepared to introduce himself or to accept from somebody else an amendment in Committee for the setting up of some authority to which the public will have the right to appeal if they feel aggrieved.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowan referred to the general bus station at Store Street. I do not quite understand the Deputy's position on this particular matter because, before he came into this House, he was one of a group who attacked the Store Street station as an extravagance and as the work of maniacs.  I remember reading posters in the constituency in which he was standing as a candidate, in which he said that one of the things he was going to do was to stop this Store Street station.  In view of that, one heard him to-day make an appeal that the Store Street scheme should go ahead.  I agree that there is no reasonable argument other, possibly, than capital saving, for not going ahead with that scheme.  I really do not know to what extent a saving will accrue if a suitable type of edifice is erected in Smithfield.  I do know that, before the present site was decided on, a great deal of discussion took place <Col N="296" /> between the various interests affected &mdash;the Government, Córas Iompair Éireann and the Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>It was decided, with an eye to the future&mdash;the possibility of ultimately bringing in that portion of the Great Northern Railway which runs in our territory and which, of course, includes Amiens Street Station&mdash;that Store Street was a most suitable and desirable site for a central bus station. Some suggestion was made that it might, in some way, further adversely affect the congestion of traffic.  As a matter of fact, in connection with the Store Street scheme the Dublin Corporation had considered, accepted and passed the development of new roads &mdash;crescent roads&mdash;in order that they would relieve traffic congestion in O'Connell Street and Westmoreland Street, and so that traffic from the north side to the south side would not have to go through O'Connell Street and Westmoreland Street but could go by Pearse Street.  All that was very seriously considered.  The Garda authorities approved, the corporation authorities approved, and the railway company felt that it would be a good thing for them.</P>
    <P>I do not know anything about the internal economy of the railway, but I do feel that if there is an argument against the transference of the offices of Córas Iompair Éireann from their present location in different parts of the city to this central station, at least there is some sense in suggesting that some Department of State should take over the offices portion of the building, leaving the downstairs portion as a central bus station.  I can assure the Minister that I know something about Dublin and of the situation that confronts our travelling public and visitors.  At present, visitors and others have to take all kinds of alternative transport to get from one railway station to another or from one bus centre to another.  All these points were considered at the time, and so the Store Street scheme was considered to be the best solution of the then problem.  I do not believe that the emergency decision to take an alternative site in Smithfield will help in any way to solve either the congestion of traffic in the city or will mitigate <Col N="297" /> the grievances under which travellers are at the present time labouring.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an emergency decision for Córas Iompair Éireann, because after years and years of consideration and discussion, and having received sanction for it, they decided on Store Street, and now they are suddenly told that they cannot go on with that scheme.  They are told to look for another site.  The travelling situation is worse now than it was when they were first tempted to change their decision. I say that was definitely an emergency decision.  They had no alternative but to try in a hurry and locate some place else.</P>
      <P>We in the corporation are now discussing with them whether the streets adjacent to Smithfield are wide enough to carry the traffic that will have to be carried on them, and whether the cost of widening the roads, if necessary, should be a burden on the rates of Dublin or be borne by the railway company.  We are having all these discussions now and are trying to narrow the matter down to an emergency acceptance of the situation, that is, if the Minister will not change his mind and allow the new railway board to consider the retention of the downstairs portion of the building in Store Street as a central bus station.</P>
      <P>There is one matter which, I suppose, it would not be right to discuss now, but at any rate the Minister should have in his mind the fact that the time is not far from us when we may have to take over that portion of the Great Northern Railway which runs from the Border down to the City of Dublin, including Amiens Street Station.  I do not suppose it would be fair to discuss that now.  It is obvious, however, from what we read in the newspapers that the Minister may have to make some arrangement ultimately.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister give me an indication of what he has in his mind as to what is hanging on Store Street?  I do not know any more than what I have said, that Córas Iompair Éireann wanted to build a central bus station and wanted to have economies in the running of their offices.  They decided, in the interests of Córas Iompair Éireann, that the best way to bring about these economies was to have a central bus station in Store Street.  That site was adopted and plans for the scheme adopted.  We had nothing to do with the cost of the Store Street building, but the corporation had something to do with the type of building that would be erected there.  Naturally, plans of the proposed building had to be submitted to the Dublin Corporation.  All individuals and concerns proposing to build have to do that, so that all new buildings will be in accordance with the town planning ideas of the Dublin Corporation.  I do not know what the Minister suggests about anything else appertaining thereto.  I would like the Minister to help me now by bringing to my notice something which he says I know but I do not think I know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this Bill there has been taken over the section of the 1944 Act which deals with employees who may become redundant.  The pension arrangements are taken over without any alteration, but the Bill does envisage and accept that there is going to be redundancy. In the capital spending plan of Córas Iompair Éireann, with particular reference to the spring factory, the assembly of buses and so forth, there was envisaged increased employment. The numbers who might have been taken on by the railway will not now be taken on and, so far as I can gather, there will be a reduction in the numbers employed.  Before 1932 this Party had as part of its policy and responsibility the putting of the railways in a sound and proper position so that there would be full and constant employment.  From 1932, or shortly afterwards, up to the present time, so far as I know there has been not only full employment and in many cases overtime for great numbers of employees, but large numbers who <Col N="299" /> were unemployed have been taken back and kept in constant employment since.</P>
    <P>I hope those responsible for this Bill will bear in mind that one of the things we must have regard for is the employment of those families who have been, in some instances for generations, employed by the railway company&mdash;people who have no other vocation but employment on the railway. It sometimes may seem good to suggest economies and effect them by putting people on the scrap heap.</P>

      <P>Yes, even in the war years.  For many years the Inchicore workers worked overtime.  In Inchicore many men who were out of employment or were working short-time were taken back and were kept constantly employed ever since.</P>
      <P>I do not think that the Dáil should take the Milne Report as a guide as to how we should run our railways.  If we want to consider our railways from the national point of view, as distinct from running them so as to make them pay, I believe the long-term view is the proper view.  Whatever we do should be related to the country's needs.  We should have some regard for agricultural development and what is required to improve the amenities of our people.  I hope the Minister will indicate that he is quite prepared to consider that and that he will not have this board precipitated into a situation where they will be obliged to take a certain line of action and will be concerned purely with the reduction of any loss that exists without regard to what a certain capital expenditure might bring in the future by way of an improvement not only in finances but also in relation to the services the company can render the nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most important point of objection which I have to the Bill is that to which I have already drawn the Minister's attention.  I earnestly request him to consider it.  I wonder will he be prepared on the Committee Stage to introduce some amendment which will safeguard the control by the Dáil <Col N="301" /> of this board in relation to certain points of principle and policy?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to the debate one was sometimes inclined to the belief that all we are discussing is merely a railway problem and not the type of problem that has faced this country for the past 30 years&mdash;the transport problem in all its aspects.  At the present moment our transport problem embraces railway, road and canal undertakings. The railway section is running at a deficit; the road freight section is in a somewhat similar position, and the same applies to our canals.  So far as the passenger services are concerned, they have been able to subsidise the national system at the expense of local systems, particularly in congested centres of population such as Dublin and Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, the discussion on this Bill should not be regarded as relating purely to the problem that has arisen on the railways.  It is true that even if we never had any mistakes made&mdash;and God knows there have been sufficient mistakes made in regard to policy&mdash;we would still have the transport problem in a larger or smaller degree because of the very technical advances that have been made in transport and because of the development of new forms of traction.  Those problems would have been largely technical problems and if our policy in regard to national transport had been more suited to the needs of the country and more realistic in its approach to our transport needs, the technical problems would have been more easily dealt with.  We are still left in the position where we have not made up our minds in relation to some of the basic problems that face us arising out of national transport.  One of the reasons why we are in this regrettable position now is because it has taken the best part of 30 years to convince, not only the Fianna Fáil Government but the Fine Gael and Cumann na nGaedheal Governments as well, that the combination of public service and private profit earning is a team that will not work. Sooner or later one has to make one's choice.  It is an interesting fact that even the stockholders' directors&mdash;<Col N="302" /> those gentlemen who were crying out because they were not consulted by Sir James Milne but who never once protested because they were not consulted by their own chairman&mdash;have now abandoned their arch-conservatism in these matters and accept the position that, as they said themselves, &ldquo;we are regrettably driven to the conclusion that there is no middle way and a combination of public policy and private profit earning capital cannot succeed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The important point about this debate to-night is the recognition of that basic factor, not from the point of view of economic theories as to whether industry should be a private profit earning machine or a public service, but from the point of view that we are now facing a problem that has confronted us for many years.  Because of the changes in our transport system from the technical point of view we have now finally to make a choice. Transport must be recognised as a service and treated as a service from the point of view of the national economy.  The regrettable feature of the picture is that as far back as 1924, 1929 and 1933 that basic factor was not accepted by those who were in a position then to deal with the problem.  Policy was not directed on that basis.  As late as 1944 when we were discussing the 1944 Act we had again the same refusal to face up to the basic problem.</P>
    <P>In 1944 Deputy Lemass, then Minister for Industry and Commerce, came before the House and presented his Bill.  He said then that he sought to make one big combination in which we would have a notional transport system, operating supposedly on the basis of public policy, and subject in certain degrees to directions from the Minister coupled with&mdash;to use Deputy Lemass's own words at the time&mdash;the interest of private investors who, through their representation on the board of directors, would ensure that that transport system would be run efficiently and effectively.</P>
    <P>The amazing fact is that the very safeguard upon which Deputy Lemass, as Minister, rested his whole case&mdash; namely, the retention of common stockholders and their electing of <Col N="303" /> directors to the board in order to maintain efficient and effective working&mdash;was the very safeguard that broke down in practice because those people failed to look after their own stockholders and failed to ensure that they were given a knowledge of the working of the company and consulted by the individual placed over them by the Minister as chairman of the company.</P>
    <P>The other pillar on which reorganisation of the system was to rest was the transfer into this national transport system of the former chairman of the board, Mr. Reynolds, with almost complete powers with regard to policy and day-to-day control.  We all know that his background was one as operator of omnibus vehicles.  Nobody is going to question his ability.  I do not think it arises.  I do not think it is worth bothering about.  From the point of view of dealing with a national transport system it does seem to me to have been somewhat peculiar to place complete reliance on two such pillars as the supposed ability of the ordinary directors to get the system on to an efficient and effective basis, having regard to the record over the previous years, and the transfer out of the omnibus service, limited in its scope and activities, of the head of that service and putting him in charge of a national transport undertaking.  With regard to the success achieved by Mr. Reynolds in relation to the Dublin bus system, one must remember that any individual with even the most elementary ability could not fail to make a success of the Dublin bus system at that time.</P>
    <P>When the problem arose of co-ordinating the rail and road system and adjusting that system to meet the competition of private traders, we had an entirely different picture.  I think it would be a waste of time to go back over the record of the last five years. No matter what defence is made by Deputy Lemass, or his protégé, in relation to the policy he sought to introduce into Córas Iompair Éireann following on the Act of 1944, we all know what happened in Córas Iompair Éireann during the years that have gone by.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="304" /> We all know that the problem with which we were confronted was an attempt by a group of top-level executives to run a combined rail and road system when their whole policy was confined to the extension of the road system alone.  We had some indications that were typical of that.  We had a train sent down from Dublin to Naas with a capacity of 600 carrying 400 race-goers to Naas racecourse.  When the races were over and the passengers returned to the railway station, alongside that train they found a fleet of 20 buses waiting for them.  Those buses had been taken off the Dublin City services at the peak hours when the ordinary citizens were standing in queues 200 yards long waiting for transport.  That was a small incident but it is typical of what was common knowledge to the men engaged in the manning of our transport system under Córas Iompair Éireann.  The less we say about that deplorable incident the better and the sooner we can get down to a sound basis in dealing with our present problem.</P>
    <P>An interesting feature of the debate is that Deputy Lemass, who started out in 1931 an almost full-blown supporter of nationalisation, ended up in 1943 looking in the opposite direction.  Not only did he want to stop nationalisation, but he went so far as wanting to take the Electricity Supply Board, and hand it back to private control-He has now swung round again because his main criticism of this Bill is that it is not complete nationalisation. The longer I listen to Deputy Lemass the more do I admire his ability to swing round and the more I am convinced that during his whole period in office as a Minister he never had a policy.  He met day-to-day problems as they arose.  He adjusted himself to day-to-day problems when he was faced with them.  When we consider his attitude in regard to transport and industrial development, despite the success achieved, it seems to me quite clear that it was not based on any well thought out or considered policy.  I think our difficulties at the present time are largely due to that. We must recognise his practical ability in regard to the various positions he <Col N="305" /> has held.  But practical ability without a policy has landed us where we are to-day in regard to national transport. That was one defect in our transport system over a long period of years.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe and other Fianna Fáil speakers stated that the railway men, particularly those in Deputy Lemass's own constituency, were working full time and overtime under the policy of Fianna Fáil.  But during that time the Minister for Industry and Commerce and his protégés were nibbling at the foundations of the railway men's livelihood and, had they continued in office, it would not have been a question of the redundancy of 1,000 or 2,000 railway men but the complete collapse of the entire railway system. The sooner those railway men realise that, the sooner they will understand not merely their own problem over the last 16 years but the need of getting away from politics so far as transport in this country is concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is about time.  I have told the truth on many occasions and I shall tell a little more before I am finished.  I am not very enthusiastic about the Bill.  It seems to me that what I said earlier in the debate is quite true, namely, that it is largely a draftsman's Bill, got together in a great hurry to meet an immediate need &mdash;to give some form to a change in the control and direction of Córas Iompair Éireann.  The previous control, which embodied in the chairman most peculiar powers, has come to a sudden halt and we have to have a substitute for it.  We propose to do it now through the medium of a Government-appointed board and to give them certain powers.  That is good so far as it goes.  All we do in the Bill is to formulate an instrument.  The Bill has completely side-stepped some of the most grave questions of policy that should be dealt with and considered by the Government and not by a subordinate board.  I am sorry that in the time that has elapsed since Sir James Milne presented the report the Government did not realise that, so far as <Col N="306" /> transport was concerned, what we required was policy and, having decided policy, that the exercise of that policy would be of secondary importance.</P>
      <P>Our main concern is with the instrument to carry out policy and not with policy itself.  As I gathered from the Minister's statement, the view is that having established this board we shall throw on to the board the responsibility of considering the various problems in regard to national transport; that we shall regard that board as being a body of experts and that they, having considered, will advise the Government and that the Government will take action.  That seems to me to be putting the cart before the horse with a vengeance.  If we go back over the immediate period and consider the difficulties faced by Córas Iompair Éireann&mdash;the problem of the chairman, Sir James Milne's Report and our own knowledge of the situation&mdash;certain factors stand out that require attention. It seems to me that the only body capable of formulating policy is this House and that the only body charged with the responsibility of making decisions is the Government itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I draw the attention of the Minister to questions which are still lying on the Table, such as a proposal from Sir James Milne in regard to a central highway authority.  I am not arguing that his policy in that connection is wise and should be accepted but he has raised the question of the capital and maintenance cost of the railway system as against that of roads; of the use of public roads by private hauliers entering into competition with public transport, and of our whole road policy and what is going to be the future in relation to our capacity to carry vehicles on the road.  It is very easy for Deputies in this House to defend the right of the private trader to run his own lorry or of the private haulier to engage in competition with the public transport system.  However, the members of this House, regardless of local responsibility, have a major responsibility and that is to decide the question of whether we are going to have any system of transport in this country.  If we are, they must decide <Col N="307" /> what that system is going to be based on and whether we are going to make the needs of the individual secondary to the needs of the public as a whole.</P>
    <P>Everybody can see the force of the argument of the private trader who asks why he cannot be allowed to run his own lorry, or to pick up a load if that lorry is coming back to town empty from the country.  There is no reason why, but there is another question to put to him.  Why should he expect to be able to call upon a public transport company at an hour's notice to provide him with a lorry to take his goods if he has not a second lorry or will not spend the money on one, or when he has a load that is not a paying load, or for some other work? If he wants a public transport system not merely to serve the public as a whole but as a fall back for the manufacturer and the private haulier in their times of emergency, difficulty, and when they want to get rid of an unprofitable load, then, having accepted the position that we must have a public system, that public system has to have a right of way over everybody else.  The sooner we realise that, the sooner we can see our way in regard to maintaining a public system of transport.</P>
    <P>In the course of the discussion, questions are raised as to whether or not the Minister has yet given any consideration to the matter of public and private hauling.  It seems to me that that is one of the questions which require consideration by this House in order that guidance might be given to the Minister.  I do not think it would be fair to expect either this or any other Government to decide the policy in regard to that particular matter&mdash; with all this local political pressure behind it&mdash;without first having the advantage of hearing the members of all Parties in this House express their views.  If, having set up a new transport board, we find, say, that in six months' time&mdash;having considered the problem of the competition which a public transport system has to meet&mdash; they make certain recommendations to the Minister, the Minister will still have to come before this House and formulate policy and ask our support <Col N="308" /> for it.  I believe we could very usefully have used the time that has elapsed since last autumn in getting from this House a mandate on policy which would now be available for the new transport board so that they would be free, from the first time they take up office, to apply themselves to the technical problems that may possibly overwhelm them.  Similarly, in regard to the public transport system itself. Have we yet decided on our policy in regard to the rail system and the road system in that company?</P>
    <P>I have mentioned in regard to Córas Iompair Éireann in the past that there was not merely competition between Córas Iompair Éireann as a single concern and private hauliers and traders but that there was competition within Córas Iompair Éireann itself, between the railway system and the road system.  It was not uncommon for traffic to be lost to the railway system &mdash;and not to the private haulier, but to the road section of Córas Iompair Éireann&mdash;without even the rail section knowing the road section was competing. The new board, from the early days when it takes up office, has got to know on what line it is going to pre-pursue its policy.  Is it going to preserve the railways and to use the road system either as an auxiliary system or as a feeding system, or is it going to develop the road system as competition to the rail system?</P>
    <P>Similarly, in so far as competition from private hauliers is concerned, there was a very valuable recommendation in Sir James Milne's Report namely, to give attention to the conditions of employment and rate of wages on which these private hauliers carry on their business.  He suggested that, in so far as they were entering into competition with the public transport system which was required to work on the basis of regulated and standard wages and conditions, there should be a similar safeguard provided in regard to private hauliers.  Again it is a question of policy.  If Córas Iompair Éireann in the future is to be able to maintain itself against this competition, quite clearly they are entitled to an equitable basis of operation in so far as wages and conditions are concerned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="309" /> There was a proposal put forward by Sir James Milne which merited examination not from the point of view of machinery but from that of policy.  So I say that in so far as the present Bill is concerned we are only manufacturing machinery to carry out the policy and leaving the major questions of policy still hanging in the air. I personally believe that it is a mistake to leave those questions of policy to be decided by the new board.  In the first place, I am not one of those who believe that the expert knows the answer to every problem.  Time after time, as every one of us is aware, when the expert had made his final statement with regard to any problem the ordinary person of wide breadth of view, commonsense and a wide appreciation of the social and economic problems of the country has had to step in and apply that expert's knowledge and very often to correct the expert.  I do not know what the personnel of the new board will be at the moment&mdash;I hope to speak on that question later&mdash;but if we appoint it as a board of experts or as a board of experts plus other men and women with a wide grasp of our economic problems I still feel that we are placing a burden of problems on their shoulders which could only properly be decided by this House or by the Government itself.  Until we decide those problems the new board cannot hope to approach the question of providing within the terms of the Act a cheap and efficient system of transport to the public in relation to agricultural development and the needs of the public generally.</P>
    <P>During the course of this debate a great deal of play has been made by the Fianna Fáil Party and by my good friend, Deputy Captain Cowan, because of the fact that the Bill is not full nationalisation.  I think that many of us are not yet clear as to what we mean by nationalisation and I have no preconceived ideas on that question except to the extent that I want to see men and women working, as far as possible, in the service of the community rather than in the service of private individuals for the profit of those private individuals.  What the machinery or administration form may <Col N="310" /> be is a matter for argument and probably adjustment to meet each situation as it arises.  As far as the Bill is concerned, what I notice about it is that, in the first place, we have public ownership.  While we will give the present owners of debenture and common stock guaranteed transport stock, it does not give them a further interest in so far as control is concerned; it is a public concern and the guarantee of interest is limited in so far as it is merely the rate on stocks. The owners may no longer appoint the board of directors, decide policy.  In the second place, it is based on the proposition that the transport system is to be run as a public service and not as a profit-earning enterprise.  As far as I am concerned, that largely decides whether we are dealing with a nationalised undertaking or not.  In the course of the discussion on the 1944 Act many of us who were opposed to that Act were denounced as rather opposing a Bill which was going to nationalise transport.  It was not nationalising transport; rather was it personalising it, but in this case I am satisfied that, in so far as the fundamental approach is concerned, we are dealing with public ownership and control. How it is to be exercised is a matter on which there must be a great difference of opinion.  I listened with great attention to Deputy Cowan and, frankly, I thought that his speech was the best argument against his form of nationalisation and public control.  If we are going to have a nationalised system of transport in which we will have a board constituted of transport experts presided over by a Minister or a Parliamentary Secretary all open to the most detailed inquiry, questioning and explanation on any occasion when any Deputy in this House feels like getting on his feet we may lock up the transport system and bid it good-bye.</P>
    <P>We must by some manner of means retain the right of this House to deal with questions of policy with regard to transport.  At the same time, while I am as anxious as anybody to secure ultimate protection for the individual members of the staff of that concern, I am not prepared to try to utilise this House to do work that can and should <Col N="311" /> be done by the trade union movement with regard to the individual worker. But there are times when questions regarding wage rates and conditions of employment have been dealt with by individual trade unions and then become questions of national policy, and I believe that we have got to find, during the Committee Stage of this Bill, some medium whereby, without crippling or cramping the day-to-day direction of the undertaking, we can find ways and means to make it possible for this House to explain its views on the policy pursued by that national undertaking.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister in this connection to say with regard I think to Section 32 where provision is made under which the Minister lays the accounts and reports of this company on the Table of the House whether he regards that as a reasonable opportunity for discussion on the policy and general operation of the new company. It does, of course, only provide that opportunity once a year.  We have had a similar opportunity in regard to other concerns such as the Electricity Supply Board, the industrial alcohol factories, etc., and as far as I am aware advantage has never been taken of that opportunity.  At the present moment there is a motion down in the names of two Deputies to discuss Bord na Móna and it has now been on the Order Paper for some months, but I take it that if the accounts and reports of the new company to be established by the Bill were placed on the Table of this House and any Deputy or Party desired a discussion on them time for that discussion could and would be made available at short notice as a matter of policy.  I would be glad if the Minister would consider enlarging on that aspect of the matter, whether within the Bill we have sufficient provision to enable this House to retain an overall control with regard to the policy and the broad workings of the system.</P>
    <P>One of the objections I have to the course discussed by Deputy Cowan&mdash;it is not exactly connected with the discussion at the moment&mdash;is that I feel we have now got quite a number of <Col N="312" /> concerns in this country operating on a basis of public or semi-public control and for which this House does carry a very direct responsibility.  It seems to me that we must consider whether discussion in this House as a whole is the best way of dealing with those concerns.  In view of the fact that the number of such concerns may increase in the future we might consider whether machinery in this House by way of committee might be set up for detailed discussion of the day-to-day operations of these concerns and not have every small matter of detail dealt with as a question of political strategy and tactics so that the work of this House is tied up while the merits of the case may be lost in the exchange of brickbats across this House.  That is a matter which could be considered, as to providing machinery whereby the House, through a system of committees, could establish and maintain more direct and intimate contact with the working of these public and semi-public concerns.</P>
    <P>One matter with which I am particularly concerned is the question of the financial provisions.  It is not in respect of compensation.  It seems to me that, with all that has happened in regard to investments in railway stocks and shares over recent years, we have now got to the end of that particular worry and it is not of very great importance any longer.  The question whether they get 3 per cent. or a smaller amount of interest also is not material, although it is interesting to know that, on the occasion of the discussion in this House on the 1944 Transport Bill, one of the members of the present Government waxed very eloquent in opposing the payment of 3 per cent. at that time, but he seems to be overwhelmed by the pressure of the present Government and it is still fixed at 3 per cent.</P>
    <P>What I am concerned about is that as a result of proposals for the compensation for the whole of the debenture and common stock guaranteed to have 3 per cent. interest, the company is required to meet certain interest payments on an annual basis and if they fail to do so the Government guarantee comes into operation.  I am <Col N="313" /> concerned as to whether the requirement to pay&mdash;and provide the moneys to pay&mdash;that interest will be the primary and overriding concern of the company in the same way as the requirement to pay the debenture interest is the primary overriding claim on any public or private company.</P>
    <P>I personally would prefer if, instead of issuing transport stock to the holders of the present debenture and common stock, it were possible to issue Government stock to them, on the same basis, if you like, and completely divorce them from any further connection with the new transport company, leaving the new company in the same position as the Electricity Supply Board, obtaining its finances direct from the Government as it may require them from time to time and paying them an agreed rate of interest.  Why I think that is valuable is that under the present Bill we will have a board charged with transport policy and at the same time charged with the responsibility of finding the necessary moneys to pay the interest on its stock. At the moment I understand that the annual charge for that interest will run to something in the nature of £600,000. In addition to that, we have already a deficit which by the end of the year may be in the nature of £1,250,000. Where they are going to find the money I do not know, so it seems to me that the guarantee will come into operation very quickly.</P>
    <P>Leaving aside the present critical state of the company and considering it from a normal point of view, the normal proposal is that they will require to obtain money to meet that interest. The board will, therefore, be under certain pressure so to order its policy as to make that amount of money available.  If they appear to be following the policy that will not bring that result, I take it that they will be under certain pressure from the Government and the Minister for Finance to mend their ways and so preserve the Government from having to find the money direct and fulfil its guarantee.  On the other hand, if they keep out of the clutches of the Government and the Minister for Finance, and base themselves purely on their own <Col N="314" /> situation inside the company, is the requirement to find that interest going to take precedence in the minds of the board over the needs of the public and over the legitimate claims of the staff carrying on the system?</P>
    <P>That is why, personally, I would prefer if we could remove the question of compensation for the existing stockholders completely out of the realm of the future operations of the company. Let us compensate them, giving them Government stock of whatever type you like, guaranteed 3 per cent., but leave the board completely free to provide the system of transport which is required by the public and is in conformity with the policy given to it by the Government.  Let it obtain its finance from the Government and let its primary consideration as a board be the provision of effective and efficient transport and of reasonable conditions for the staff.  Let it not be concerned&mdash;as it must be under present proposals&mdash;with the annual charge it will have to meet, in accordance with the present Bill, for the payment of interest. It would not require any great change, but it would make a tremendous difference in the policy of the board and particularly in the relations between the board and the staff.</P>
    <P>I dislike intensely looking forward to the day when the chairman of the board will possibly tell the representative organisation of the staff that their claims are quite justifiable but have to be put to one side as the board has a primary responsibility to find £600,000&mdash;or whatever the sum is &mdash;for the payment of the interest on the guaranteed stock.  If we have that situation, we will end up eventually with a discontented staff, which will not feel inclined to give the cooperation for which the Minister has called.  We will have again, in a most peculiar form, a conflict between public policy and welfare and the claims of those who have invested their money in this undertaking, even in this indirect form, through a type of Government guaranteed stock.</P>
    <P>I think we should make a complete break.  Let us establish on the lines of the Electricity Supply Board&mdash;even <Col N="315" /> with all its limitations and faults&mdash;a new type of public board suitable to this problem and free to operate the policy generally laid down by the Government, free to meet the needs of the public and having a contented staff which will co-operate wholeheartedly in the running of the system.</P>
    <P>One matter referred to in the course of the debate is that of redundancy. The present staff is assured that, if redundancy does arise, there are reasonable terms of compensation for them.  Deputy Briscoe, in his usual way, tried to suggest that the passing of this Bill would create a redundancy of 2,000 or 3,000 men.  I suggest that, if Deputy Briscoe thinks over the railway policy of the Fianna Fáil Government, he will realise that, but for the act of God, we would have no railway men left in the country.  Apart, however, from the compensation terms embodied in the Bill, the Minister should realise and impress on the members of the board when they take up office, that redundancy has not to be considered in the light of these compensation provisions.  There is no compensation which could be given in monetary form to a man that will make good his loss of employment.  If we take the case of a young man who happens to get employment on the railway.  After a year or two, he expects to become more or less constant and in good time to become a permanent employee.  He marries, enters into family commitments, establishes a home and so on.  What good is it to him to give him compensation after he has four years' service?  Not only is the compensation completely inadequate in regard to the lump sum of money received by his but there can be no compensation for the almost inevitable break-up of his home, possibly the fact that he has to leave where he has been living for a number of years and has got to re-settle himself and get other employment.</P>
    <P>I think the earlier reference in the Bill to redundancy is the one that the board should be charged to operate, on the assumption that there will be no redundancy and that, where there is a need to reduce staff on any part of the <Col N="316" /> system, the board will regard it as a primary obligation to see that those men are fitted in to some other part of the system with the least disturbance to their working lives and particularly to their home lives.</P>
    <P>In regard to branch lines, I would support the pleas made to the Minister to provide some machinery of inquiry before a decision is taken on the closing of a branch line.  I notice that Sir James Milne in his report takes the view that largely appeals to me, when he says that the closing of a branch line should be regarded in the first instance from the point of view of the public interest.  He goes on to make a further point, which Deputies should consider when discussing this question, that the branch line is not to be considered purely in relation to the local public interest, neither from the point of view of keeping it open nor closing it, but it should be regarded as part of the general railway system. Even though a particular branch line, as far as its separate costing is concerned, may show a loss, as part of the whole railway system it may be very essential as a feeder and as part of the general system.  When charging for transport services no company bases its charges on each separate local division but works them out on the basis of the system as a whole, with due allowance for the differences in the traffic that has to be carried, both in relation to the type of traffic and the concentration of traffic in the various areas.  It is from that aspect, I suggest, that there has been a good case made in support of the proposal that the Bill would be amended so as to provide some form of inquiry before a decision would be taken to close down a branch line and, preferably, it would seem to me, that inquiry should take the form of inquiry by independent persons who live in the locality where the branch line is situated and a public report to the Minister who would then give the proper direction to the board.</P>
    <P>Similarly in regard to the question of the imposition of charges.  I accept a good deal of what the Minister said when he pointed out that, because of the breakdown in what was formerly <Col N="317" /> a monopoly enjoyed by railways in the carriage of goods and passengers, there is no longer the same need to provide the same machinery in regard to the fixation of charges, with one important exception, namely, the case of the ordinary passenger.  The private trader, the large manufacturer, if he is dissatisfied with the charges fixed by Córas Iompair Éireann with regard to any freight he offers them, has an alternative and can use that alternative as a means of defending himself against the charges of Córas Iompair Éireann but the ordinary passenger who travels by train and bus has no alternative and if, to-morrow morning, Córas Iompair Éireann decided to increase passenger fares by 100 per cent, the passenger has either to pay or to walk.  From that point of view, I suggest that, even though the Minister, in the Bill, is giving over power to the new company to fix its charges without reference to any other body, he should, not as Minister for Industry and Commerce, but as a member of a Government charged with representing and protecting the welfare of the citizens as a whole, retain some power in respect of the fixation of passenger fares because that is the only protection the public can enjoy.</P>
    <P>Even though we are dealing with a publicly owned concern, a concern which, supposedly, is to be operated in the public interest, we are all aware that bodies create their own sectional views and sectional interests and it would not be unnatural to expect that on some future occasion the board of the new Córas Iompair Éireann organisation might decide in pursuance of their own narrow sectional interests as a transport concern that passenger fares would have to be raised and would have to carry more than their due share of the total cost.  From that point of view, there should be some protection for the ordinary passenger on the bus and the train.  That protection should be subject not merely to the Minister but, through him, to this House where it was found necessary.</P>
    <P>Reference was made in the course of the debate to certain of the items of capital expenditure proposed by Córas <Col N="318" /> Iompair Éireann and dealt with in Sir James Milne's Report and referred to by the Minister.  One of these was the new chassis shop.  Deputy Lemass waxed very eloquent when he pointed out that one of the reasons why such development should be encouraged is that it would go towards providing a general engineering shop for our national economy.  It is amazing how people wake up when it is too late.  In 1929 the proposal was made that the old Great Southern Railways would spend £250,000 on extending, developing and re-equipping their railway shops at Inchicore, not merely as railway shops but as a central heavy engineering shop for the whole of the Twenty-Six Counties.  That proposition was quite well known to Deputy Lemass.  From 1932 to 1948 he had ample time to give effect to it.  He did not bother to give it a thought until he came to the point where he no longer had power to deal with the matter.  Now he complains, in a period of the most critical conditions for Córas Iompair Éireann, that there is a stop put upon this chassis shop and the argument he advances is that we are interfering with the development of our national economy and denying ourselves a most essential engineering feature.  Deputy Lemass, as I have pointed out, is the darling of the railway men in Inchicore and could have looked after them when he was in office and when he had the power.</P>
    <P>That proposal to extend and equip the railway shops in Inchicore in 1929 was one of the proposals put forward at the time to try to ease the very critical situation that had arisen and which led to 3,000 railway men becoming redundant and being thrown out of the service.  Even at this late stage, I would urge&mdash;not on the basis of the proposals in regard to the erection of a new chassis shop&mdash;that there should be a direction to the new board from the Minister that one of the proposals they would keep in mind would be that Córas Iompair Éireann, through its railway shops, would definitely undertake, as a matter of national policy, the provision of a heavy engineering works attached to the railway system, not merely for the carrying out of railway maintenance and repairs, but that <Col N="319" /> would be available for Irish industry as a whole.</P>
    <P>At the present time quite a large number of our new industries find it necessary to send their machinery back across the channel for even minor repairs because of our lack of a suitably equipped engineering shop to carry on this work.  It would be of tremendous help, not only in normal times, but particularly if we should have a further emergency such as we experienced in recent years, if somewhere in our own country we had a properly equipped and developed heavy engineering shop.  No body in this country is in a position to do that except the body that is charged with the carrying on of our railway system. That is the basis on which it should be erected.</P>
    <P>There are two small matters which I should now like to deal with.  Reference was made here to the personnel of the new board.  I hope the Minister will exercise a great deal of caution and discretion in this matter.  I would be very sorry to see the board constituted of a Government-appointed chairman, possibly with a non-railway background, and five other members whose only background was either the railway system or the road freight system.  I would fear for the future transport system and, above all, for the public.  I hope the Minister will find it possible to get a balance between experts and men and women with breadth of vision greater than that of the average expert, who know the economic, industrial and social problems of our country and who have the independence of view to stand up to the experts, if necessary.  One of the weaknesses that I am aware of in regard to the Electricity Supply Board is the overwhelming weight of opinion on the expert side, so much so that even on technical matters there might have been a better view taken if we had a more balanced composition of the board.  It is important, from that point of view, that attention be given to the personnel of the board.</P>
    <P>I am aware that suggestions have been made that the personnel of the <Col N="320" /> board should include direct representatives of the staff working in the concern. I am as ready as anybody to make claims on behalf of workers in any concern but, in my opinion, if we have&mdash;and I think the Minister must have&mdash;a representative on that board with what we would call a trade union, a labour or a workers' background, that representative must come from a broader section of the working class and the trade union movement than that represented merely by the staff of the particular concern.  It would be a most embarrassing position for any representative of the organisations at present catering for these members of the staff to find himself on that board and expected to represent the interests of that staff rather than the interests of what we would call the working class and trade union community as a whole.  The important thing is that on the board we will have somebody who has an understanding and a background of speaking for and representing workers, both as wage earners and consumers. Through that means, we will get, in association with the trade unions representing the staff, sufficient protection for the members of the staff; but if a claim is to be pressed merely on the basis that because we have 10,000 or 20,000 workers engaged in the concern, they must have the sole right of representation, we are going to run into difficulties not merely in regard to our transport system but in regard to any other concerns that come under public control.</P>
    <P>The question has been asked why the Grand Canal Company should be included in the Bill.  I can see no argument why it should not be.  We seem to forget that we are dealing with national transport and trying to arrive at national policy.  The Grand Canal Company is one of the basis systems of our national transport which works in as a feeding system for the railway system, but, because of lack of an overall policy, the railways and the canals at times find themselves competing with each other.  I am not concerned, however, solely with that aspect, but with the fact that we have on the canal system a body of men, some 500 in number, who, for the past 30 or 40 <Col N="321" /> years, have assisted in carrying on a portion of the transport system of the country and at a cost which only they know.  The canal company has been a profitable concern for the directors.  It has paid dividends and has enjoyed a steady and remunerative income out of its rents and holdings, but it has been able to continue as a concern only because of these 500 workers who, in the words of its own representatives, have never been paid a fair rate of wages or given proper and reasonable conditions of employment.  These 500 men have a right to be regarded as part of the transport labour force in this country and if we are going to give, out of the charity of our hearts, reasonable compensation to stockholders and shareholders, then these men who, for more years than I care to remember, have enjoyed the worst possible conditions of employment and the lowest rates of wages of any type of worker in the country, have a claim not only on this Assembly but on transport as a national concern.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties will be not that of relating the management of the canal company to that of the railway company&mdash;that is very simple because that has almost worked out to-day&mdash;but of deciding how and in what way railways and canals can be fitted into modern transport with its new forms of traction and carrying of passengers and goods.  On the Continent, there has been large-scale development of canal transport, even since the end of the war, with very heavy capital expenditure in the shape of the building of new barges, widening of rivers and erecting of new locks.  On the other hand, in England, the effort to adapt the canal system to modern requirements has not made very much progress. I believe there is still a future for canal transport for certain types of freight in this country, but it is a problem which requires a knowledge of transport and transport needs.  The fact that we are dealing with what appears to be a very slow-moving form of transport is no reason to suggest that, in this day of speed, it cannot find its rightful place.  There are still types of traffic which it is more profitable to carry by canal than by any other system, if we look at it from the <Col N="322" /> point of view that if to-morrow we abolished our railway system and our canal system and threw the whole of our passenger and freight traffic on to the roads, we would have complete chaos.  So long as these canals are open&mdash;they represent probably a capital value to-day of £100,000,000&mdash;they can serve a useful purpose, and the men who have maintained that canal system through the years, and especially through the years of the emergency, as part of the labour force in the transport system, have a rightful claim to, and should be given, due and proper consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of Deputies in referring to this Bill have spoken of the undesirability of introducing politics into the transport problem of the country.  I should like to bring a breath of fresh air into the whole argument, and particularly in relation to the extravagant attacks against the ex-chairman of the board of Córas Iompair Éireann, by simply remarking that all over the world both private and nationalised railways have made huge losses in every sort of circumstances, and we have been talking here, and members of the Government particularly have been talking, as though there were something fantastic about a railway making a loss, particularly in abnormal conditions.  I happened to live in France for four years and I watched the operation of both privately-owned and State run railways, and I observed that they were both capable of making enormous losses, although the density of traffic in every area of France is far greater than in this country.  Anyone who studies the history of the administration of railways will be aware that nationalisation, as a policy, has been found to fail dismally where it has been applied.  It will also be found that, in other parts of the world, railways that have remained in private ownership have also at times failed to make profits, have lost money for their shareholders and have gradually eaten into their reserves until something desperate had to be done for them. On the other hand, there are some exceptions.  In Germany, for example, between the two world wars, where transport was nationalised, the German <Col N="323" /> State railways, in a very dense area of industry, succeeded not only in making profits but in contributing large sums towards European reparations, so that we have a mixed picture &mdash;railway losses and railway profits all over the world.  But for the Government to attack the ex-chairman and board of directors solely because there were losses on the railway seems to me to be grossly unfair.</P>
      <P>I do not want to refer at any length to the political capital made of the sum granted to the ex-chairman when he left Córas Iompair Éireann, but I suppose that most of the people of this country are intelligent enough to know what the capitalised value of a pension is and to know that, if you were to capitalise the value of the old age pension of a man and his wife, it would amount to the sum of £4,000.  I think that has to be related to the amount paid to the ex-chairman because of the fact that he would not otherwise be receiving the pension which he should receive from the Dublin United Tramways Company.  It is easy enough to talk about increasing old age pensions, but if you mention the fact that, in order to produce a sum of £130 per year, which is what the new old age pension will be if the new social security code comes into operation, you have to find a capital sum of £4,000 at 3 per cent.&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is the sort of thing that is not told to the public, but I think it just as well to mention it. The whole question of the pension paid to the ex-chairman is simply bringing politics to play in a most undesirable way.  We might start investigating what the capitalised values of pensions would be to the high executives of Messrs.  Guinness and Company, Messrs.  Jacob and Company or any other big concern, particularly those paying large profits, and find out where we get to and what advantage it would be to the community one way or another.</P>

      <P>So far as the ex-chairman is concerned, I only met the man seven times.  I do not know what his political views are, but reading Sir James Milne's report and the communications between the ex-chairman and the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the first thing that strikes the ordinary man, and that would strike any tribunal called to judge the issue, is the fact that, if, in some way or other, Sir James Milne had had an opportunity of meeting the board and the ex-chairman, a good 50 per cent. of his report would have been substantially amended.  Solely by the fact that he was not able to obtain the reactions of different people, or even facts in all cases, arising from his examination of the operations of Córas Iompair Éireann, it will be noted that he himself made certain errors of fact of a very definite kind in his report, certain errors which are mentioned in the course of the communications of the ex-chairman, errors of fact which cannot be disputed.  I am not saying that the report is not a very valuable one or that the Government should not adopt some of the proposals made. I am simply mentioning the fact that if I were Minister for Industry and Commerce my first reaction would be: &ldquo;Well, some opportunity should be given for Sir James Milne to consult with the board and with the ex-chairman. Even if the time is limited or even if the discussion cannot last very long, such a discussion would be very necessary if I am to give an impartial examination to the whole of the problems of Córas Iompair Éireann.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The main difficulty, of course, which confronted the old board was the fact that long before the second world war began the railways had been facing very difficult times.  The fact that the number of passengers fell from 15,750,000 in 1925 to 11,500,000 in 1938 is an indication of the difficulties which had to be faced.  There is also the fact that this country is a very small one and that people, taken as a whole, prefer to travel by road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is beyond dispute, according to Sir James Milne, that the old board had made a considerable success of road transport and that there could be no very great criticisms of its administration <Col N="325" /> in that regard.  It is beyond doubt true, that at the end of the emergency, when conditions were becoming more normal, the railway system as a whole was unable to bear the expense of the inevitable rise in wages while, at the same time, having to face increased competition from private transport. That is not to say that wages should not be increased but it is to say that the increase in the expenses were so great that the system could not stand it.  The fact that wages which were £4,000,000 in 1945 had gone up by £2,500,000 by 1948 is in itself proof of the difficulties that had to be faced.  I should like to ask the Minister whether it is a fact according to the accountant of Córas Iompair Éireann that even cattle traffic, the most staple traffic of the country, rarely paid a bare profit.  I understand that if the expense of the maintenance of cattle wagons is taken into account, there is a fundamental difficulty before this traffic pays a dividend at the present time.</P>
    <P>Another difficulty that has to be faced is the farmers' need for a personal type of door-to-door transport. Everybody knows that there is now a huge number of transport factors&mdash; people temporarily in the ownership of cattle and farming materials, who go to the farmer's door and who render him a very personal service in the way of messages that can never be rendered by any public transport system.  Very often, they consist of his own neighbours who have undertaken a lorry business apart from their ordinary avocation of farming.  Whatever happens in the future to the railways, there is going to be some compromise between the need for this natural development in the life of the agricultural community and the need for preserving a public transport system.  Therein lies your transport problem.  I am perfectly certain that if that type of transport service were in any way penalised to a noticeable degree, the first people to complain would be the farmer Deputies on the other side of the House.  Everybody knows that the number of these factors, with lorries of their own who buy and sell cattle or buy and sell goods of various descriptions, has enormously increased.  It has increased because of what might be called an <Col N="326" /> inevitable evasion of what the Transport Acts were supposed to effect, in the way of preventing the carriage of goods by people who are only temporarily in possession of them.</P>
    <P>I myself, speaking for my own constituency, know that the average person there wants to preserve the public transport system and knows that a certain price has got to be paid for it, either by way of taxation to provide a form of subsidies, or a certain penalisation or prohibition on the carriage of a certain type of goods but I know that the people in my constituency do not want to change that type of transport which enables a door-to-door service or a door-to-shop service to be secured and which enables messages to be done for the farmers, which brings them into the most intimate touch with the shops and enables them to do their business in the easiest possible way. That is the problem that has to be faced and to my mind the less politically-minded we are about it the better.</P>
    <P>So far as the branch lines are concerned very few people in this House seemed willing to remind the public of the losses made on the existing branch lines, which were given by Sir James Milne as £100,000, representing nearly 1 per cent. of the gross expenditure of the company in the year.  Sir James Milne, it is true, assumed a contribution income from these railways of a value of £325,000&mdash;that they bring in £325,000 to the railways.  Of course, it is beyond the capacity of the average accountant, or the average person who is not an expert in railway management, to know what that means, whether it would be a bad thing to deprive the railway of that income of £325,000 even though there was a loss of £100,000 on these branch lines as a whole.  It seems to me there is no need for people to think politically about the branch lines.  They simply have to make up their minds on a number of simple problems.  If the cost of transporting goods by other means goes up very much, the closing of the branch line is a very bad thing. If the employees of these branch lines cannot be transferred to work on the buses or in connection with road freight, then their interests must be <Col N="327" /> preserved and they must receive pensions. If it is a greater convenience to people to travel by bus and to send their goods by road freight, then it is a good thing to close the branch lines. In a great many cases Deputies seemed to be more impressed by the case made for special interests rather than by what the general interest demands.  I think the best example of that was the case mentioned by the former Minister for Industry and Commerce of a deputation who came to interview him in connection with the closing down of a branch line.  Every Deputy made a vigorous protest against the closing of the line but, when the matter was examined, it was found that only one person had travelled on the line in the previous week.  I should like to hear from the Minister what the loss incurred on the branch lines is as compared with the contribution income and the significance of that because Sir James Milne does not give any decision on it.</P>
    <P>Sir James Milne mentions in his report the principal difficulties in connection with the operation of the railway here, namely, the very short run of the railway, the fact that the standing charge on the railway, the maintenance of the line, hardly varies in accordance with the density of the traffic and the company cannot make a profit on running time in the same way as railways can in countries where there is a greater density of traffic and the actual distance run for the transport of goods is greater.</P>
    <P>My own belief is that even the bus service may be in some considerable danger at a later date, because the habit of going in private cars is growing in this community.  Everybody knows that people band together, that four or five people pay the petrol and oil expenses of some person going in a private car in order to avoid going in buses.  Everybody knows that the small car is becoming a feature of this country, that people are buying cars who never bought them before, and that their number is constantly increasing.  That adds to the problem.</P>
    <P>Again, I do not think, in connection <Col N="328" /> with the criticism of the ex-chairman, that the figures for bus and train passengers have been adverted to sufficiently. In 1948, 275,000,000 people travelled by bus and 10,000,000 by train.  No matter what expert is put in to run the railway, that is a salient fact and the difference is so colossal that it is quite obvious it is going to be difficult to maintain a properly-run railway line without some form of additional assistance.  We all of us see cars manufactured by a well-known company being driven over 100 miles to Dublin instead of being sent by rail. We all of us see stout and porter manufactured by a well-known company being sent by heavy lorry a distance of over 170 miles.  We all of us know of cases where products such as raw cotton are taken by private companies a distance of 60 or 70 miles. Therefore, some of the most profitable traffic that could accrue to the railway is now taken by vehicles belonging to private companies.</P>
    <P>The case has been mentioned by one Deputy of what happened at the Nass races.  According to the ex-chairman of the railway, there have been occasions when special trains have been advertised for running considerable distances to Dublin and the people interested in the athletic event for which the trains were provided deliberately ordered buses instead.  There is something popular about a bus.  It has a psychological appeal for the public which the train has not, and it is going to provide a great problem in the future.</P>
    <P>One of the main points that arose from the Milne Report was the fact that, whether or not the ex-chairman of the board was better at administering the road service or the train service, all the materials became available for the road service more quickly than they did for the railway service. It was possible to get new buses and lorries long before it was possible to start on replacing the wagons and the coaches on the railway.  As Sir James Milne mentions, over half of the coaches are over 50 years old and something like half of the engines are over 50 years old.  The same thing applies to the wagons.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="329" /> One point to which Sir James Milne did not refer was the fact that the Road Funds duties on heavy motor traffic have not been increased in any comparable way with the increase in the cost of repairing roads, that the taxation has not increased, and to that extent they have some advantage as compared with the railway which has to pay the increase in the cost of raw materials for renewals and replacements. That is a fact which the Government will have to face some day. The last Government left office before having to face the problem of what to do about the increased cost of repairing roads and the fact that motor traffic taxation, with the exception of that on passenger cars, remains the same.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that Sir James Milne does not refer to any great lack of efficiency in connection with the road passenger service and that he fully accounts for the difference in the maintenance costs of vehicles in his own report.  It is equally the fact that the road service of Córas Iompair Éireann has been doing much towards maintaining the revenue of the company. I myself was surprised on reading the comparison of the rail fares here with those in Great Britain.  It is quite obvious that if the average third-class fare per mile of Córas Iompair Éireann was 1.5 pence in 1948 as compared with 2.44 pence in Great Britain, the railway, among other things, was not receiving sufficient revenue from passengers to make a profit, quite apart from increases of wages.</P>
    <P>I think the increase in wages is given in the report in another form.  In addition to the general statements that wages have gone up by £2,500,000, in another paragraph Sir James Milne remarks that the increase in wages accounted for £1,134,000 and the increase in staff for £904,000 of the expenditure between 1945 and 1948.  As I have said, it is quite obvious that the increases in wages, plus the fact that fares have not increased to the same degree, and plus the increase in competition with other forms of transport, were what brought the company to a crisis far more than what is referred <Col N="330" /> to in the observations of Sir James Milne with regard to efficiency in running.</P>
    <P>I think it should be stated that Sir James Milne apparently admits that a total of £10,500,000 would be required in the way of new capital for the railway and that that figure should be related to the cost of what the Minister has described as the &ldquo;more extravagant proposals&rdquo;.  I have totalled up what are called the &ldquo;extravagant proposals&rdquo; and they amount to some £3,740,000, that is to say, the proposals listed by Sir James Milne in his report, the principal capital schemes in which he lists the things beginning with Store Street and going on to the chassis shop and other items.  A lot of the public have got the impression that the board were going to spend £17,500,000 without receiving the sanction of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and that the whole of the £17,500,000 was unjustifiable, whereas in fact we know from the report that £10,500,000 was regarded as being required. Even if those &ldquo;more extravagant proposals&rdquo; had all been adopted in their provisional form, the debenture interest on the total cost would be some £112,000 or £120,000, or about 1 per cent. of the gross expenditure on the system in a year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, £17,500,000 was an old estimate.  It would be considerably more now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, all these proposals had to be examined and it is untrue to state that that money was going to be spent if there had not been some drastic change in the character of the board or the person of the chairman. I agree with Deputy Cowan that more imagination will have to be used in order to save the railways.  There will have to be some very big improvements in the comforts and amenities if the railway revenue is to be retained at its present level.  I see no way out of the difficulty, with regard to the heavy cost of replacing coaches, wagons and engines, except spending a great deal of money in order to preserve what revenue there is.  Otherwise, it seems that the bus revenue will <Col N="331" /> constantly increase at the expense of the railway revenue.</P>
      <P>When we come to Sir James Milne's principal proposals, we see that he does not rely on savings effected through better management to any great degree to make the system pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no suggestion in the general observations of the whole report, or of the summaries, that the railway company had been so wastefully managed that enormous savings could be made, and that, by that means, a dividend would be produced or the debenture interest paid.  Most of Sir James Milne's proposals involve some penalisation of other forms of transport.  It is just as well that it should be known to the public what they have to face if Sir James Milne's report is adopted. He summarises the possible results of various changes made in the running of the system in different ways.  It is rather hard to understand them because they are presented as being what is likely to be the effect of changes in the near future.  In another section he deals with what is likely to be the effect of various proposals on the future of the system at some time ahead&mdash;in a number of years.  He does not give the number of years.  In paragraph 477 he speaks of securing a revenue of £400,000 from the central highways authority.  That is really a contribution from road traffic towards the maintenance of railway traffic, and as a contribution by road users towards the preservation of the railways.  He speaks of higher licence duties for private vehicles, resulting in traffic being transferred to the railways.  The increased revenue from that source is put down at £300,000.  He then estimates that there should be an increase in revenue from an increase in fares of £1,000,000.  He states that the maximum economies likely to be effected over a period of years and years would be £600,000 a year.  It is quite obvious that his recommendations amount to a tax on road users in order to preserve the Córas Iompair Éireann system.  He makes the proposal that Córas Iompair Éireann and the Minister and the Government should investigate licences to lorry owners who are only in the temporary <Col N="332" /> ownership of goods.  That raises the whole question whether the type of lorry serving the interests of farmers can be allowed to continue on its present basis.</P>
    <P>He then suggests that buses should not compete with the railways, but he does not give any estimate of the increase in revenue that will come to the railways or of the decrease in revenue that will go to the bus side of Córas Iompair Éireann.  I should like to ask the Minister what is his view on that matter.  It seems to me that there must be some Ministerial view on Sir James Milne's main recommendations which are the protection of the railways through some sort of penalisation of private transport.  The Minister can hardly leave that to the new board of Córas Iompair Éireann to decide.  It is a matter of public policy, and he must give them some directions during the discussions on this Bill.  He must let the House know whether he feels the time has come for private transport to contribute more to the preservation of the railway system.</P>
    <P>Dealing with the question of parallel bus routes the ex-chairman disagrees that there are what could be strictly described as parallel bus services, because quite evidently he feels, as many people do, that a bus service which runs along by the railway line stops at a great many points and serves the interests of passengers in that way, and that to ask passengers to go to a railway station and take a train to Mullingar or Longford and then to get into a bus going in a circular route around the town is asking too much from them.  It means that they have to make a change and that they have to move all their luggage down to the bus.  A parallel bus service is justified from the standpoint of public convenience.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of vital interest to the people to know what the Minister's view is on that matter.  By Sir James Milne's definition, the railway services are paralleled by buses.  The question is, whether the board is going to say &ldquo;abolish the bus services and have circular bus services from Mullingar, Longford and, possibly, some other towns along the route and so force the people to make the journey by train <Col N="333" /> and then change into a bus,&rdquo; or whether the present system is to be preserved.  Surely, it is only reasonable to ask the Minister his view on that.  It is going to make a tremendous difference to the country though it may make only a book-keeping difference for Córas Iompair Éireann.</P>
    <P>I do not follow Sir James Milne's argument, or accept it, that if buses have a smaller turnover they may be able to reduce their costs proportionately, whereas with the railway, when its turnover becomes smaller, most of its standing charges will remain at the same figure.  Does the Minister agree with Sir James Milne on that?  This is a matter of absolutely vital concern to the people living in the country districts.</P>
    <P>I think it should be noted, too, that the economies envisaged by Sir James Milne, after all the proposals that he has made, only amount in fact to .6 per cent. of the gross expenditure of the concern&mdash;that is all the economies in his various proposals which it would take years to bring into effect.  He is careful to state that that is only an approximate figure, and will only reduce the gross annual expenditure on its present basis by .6 per cent.  One has to compare that with the possible adoption of the whole extravagant programme of £11,500,000.  Assuming that the board adopted that, it would amount to about 4.4 per cent. of the gross expenditure of the company.  I think it is time that the whole question of the proposed capital expenditure was related to the gross expenditure of the company so that the public may realise what there is in all this talk about spending £17,000,000.  When you start to examine the whole situation you find that, if such expenditure is justified, it may actually increase the profits of the company, and that the first charge upon the company's balance sheet would amount to about 4.4 per cent. on the gross expenditure in one year.  My own belief in all these matters is that there is some sort of compromise possible in regard to this new capital expenditure.</P>
    <P>There is no need for me to repeat what was said before by a number of Deputies in regard to the desirability <Col N="334" /> of having a heavy machine industry in Dublin.  I would ask the Minister to review the matter again.  The former Government was quite capable of changing its mind if it wanted to.  The present Government will prove itself no better than the former Government except that it may change its mind sooner than the former Government did.  I would ask the Minister to examine this whole matter of having a central workshops and a chassis factory in the light of the requirements of this country, and the fact that we need more heavy industries here.</P>
    <P>I should like to advert very definitely to the fact that, in the general observations made by Sir James Milne, there is no mention whatever of any gross extravagance or any gross inefficiency in regard to the operations of Córas Iompair Éireann.  His general observations summarise the whole position.  Most of the proposals made are in regard to penalising private transport.  One gets the impression that, whatever inefficiency Sir James Milne found in the operation of the railways, the main causes for its failure to make a profit were causes beyond the control of the ex-chairman or the board.  They were the result of the peculiar conditions in this country: the fact that five years of a world war made it impossible to renew plant, wagons or coaches or to carry out a proper reorganisation of the service.  In fact, it was only in the last two years that it was at all possible to undertake renewals.</P>
    <P>I would like to say a few words about the Store Street bus station. Here, again, I would appeal to the Minister to take a second view.  I will be quite honest about it.  I think that up to about three months ago the view, whether Store Street should be used as a bus station, was, roughly, a question of what political Party one belonged to.  I think it is quite true to say that three out of four people in Dublin who are going to use buses would prefer to have Store Street and they have no objection to the Minister taking the offices above for a Department of State, if he thinks there will be ultimate economy in that.  I have not found anybody within the last <Col N="335" /> week who wants to go from O'Connell Street to Smithfield to take a country bus.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been speaking to people who are supporters of the Government in all other matters and they seem to have changed their minds in favour of using at least the bus part of Store Street, no matter what is done with the offices.  Whether or not Córas Iompair Éireann can make economies by moving its offices from various parts of the city and getting nearer to what will be, perhaps, in the future more than its first cousin, the Great Northern Railway Company, is another matter.  A lot of the public see in the proposal to use Store Street the evident fact that there may eventually be some union between Córas Iompair Éireann and the Great Northern Railway and in those circumstances it would be an advantage to have the offices close to Amiens Street.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister a question with regard to Amiens Street. Assuming some arrangement is made to combine the interests of the Great Northern Railway, in so far as the Twenty-Six Counties are concerned, and Córas Iompair Eireann, has he received any report as to the economies that could be effected by using Amiens Street entirely for railway traffic?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I must close by making some observations upon portions of Deputy Larkin's speech.  Deputy Larkin tried to bring this matter back to one of politics.  He spoke about railway workers, some of whom lost their positions through the former Government, owing more to the present Government than they do to Fianna Fáil. He never adverted to the fact that although the number of railway employees remains somewhat the same, there was an enormously increased number of drivers of buses, mechanics, drivers of lorries and so forth, whose interests were safeguarded probably too much by the former Government.  Many of them belong to trade unions, but they were not mentioned at all by Deputy Larkin.</P>
      <P>He also suggested that the new company should be free from the obligation of paying debenture interest resulting from the former operations of Córas Iompair Éireann.  Somebody has to pay the debenture interest and he is asking the Government to assume that charge and pay it out of annual taxation. Would the Minister approve of that?  Ultimately it may only be a matter of book-keeping, but I should like to know if the Minister approves the proposal that the State pay the accumulated charges and debenture interest of the old Córas Iompair Éireann in order to allow the new board to run the company without having to pay commitments undertaken before this.</P>
      <P>I would like to stress this, that whatever decision is made by the Minister and the Government the farmers are not going to see their chance of having a personal door to door service penalised.  The people may be willing to pay some contribution to the preservation of the transport system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think the Minister can place on the shoulders of the board of the new Córas Iompair Éireann the responsibility of making the main decisions arising out of Sir James <Col N="337" /> Milne's Report.  He will have to give some direction.  It would be preferable to give that direction in this House and tell us quite honestly whether he prefers some form of subsidy for the new Córas Iompair Éireann or whether he wishes the public to pay an additional contribution in the form of higher licence duties, have a contribution from a central highways authority, or a penalisation of other members of the community.</P>
    <P>It is only fair that we should have some view expressed in that connection. The issue cannot be deferred, and to give the board an opportunity to make decisions of that kind does not seem to be in accordance with the practice of the Dáil.  The proposal to institute a central highways authority should be a matter of high State policy.  It involves not only a road transport paying an additional tax, but it also involves nationalisation and the transferring from the local authorities of the responsibilities to maintain the main arterial routes. Some Government supporters have already moved resolutions here suggesting that the State should assume responsibility for all the main roads. That would mean responsibility for some 50,000 miles of road.  There have been serious proposals made in that regard within the lifetime of the previous Government and suggestions have been made that it would effect economies.</P>
    <P>The proposal to have a central highways authority to control all the roads is a fundamental one, and the proposal to have a highway authority which would continually subsidise the railway track is also a fundamental one.  Surely we should be able to get some indication of the Minister's views on this matter?  Even if the new board makes recommendations about licences and the distance limit for the use of heavy vehicles by private transport owners, surely it would be a reversal of tradition if they were to make proposals about a central highways authority instead of being told by the Government that they are to include in their plans the assumption that there will be a highways authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Maguire Mr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>I approach this Bill <Col N="338" /> with a good deal of reserve.  I am of the opinion that it is an indication of a collapse of our business capacity to carry on an essential national service. Our transport system would seem to be in the position of a business that is unable to carry out its functions in accordance with ordinary standards&mdash; that is, to pay its overhead expenses, its workers and all the other expenses involved and pay something in the form of a dividend to the shareholders. This enterprise has been unfortunate inasmuch as it has not been able to stand on its own feet.  It has descended into a state of bankruptcy.  In the interests of the community the State, charged with the responsibility of providing essential transport services, has to take over this bankrupt enterprise and thereby lower the credit of the State.  That is a bad thing.  I do not say that the Bill is a bad Bill in itself, but it is bad in so far as it reflects on our internal financial standing.  It is unfortunate that these things should happen.  I do not propose to go into the reasons as to why they happen.</P>
      <P>During the last century we have had many private undertakings providing transport for our people.  People were prepared to come forward and invest their money in these undertakings. They believed that such investments were financially sound.  In this particular undertaking with which the present Bill deals millions of money were invested in trustee stock because people believed there was security in it.  Those millions were not contributed by the well-to-do.  They were contributed by the poorest and most dependent sections of the community. Certain members of certain families were provided for by benevolent parents through the investment of some hundreds of pounds in what were supposed to be guaranteed trustee securities. How have these investments been honoured?  We know that curtailments of capital investment have been ruthless, not alone in this undertaking but in other undertakings as well.  We know that these people have been deprived of a substantial part of their investments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the present Bill, as well as the 1944 Bill, is a bad example to the <Col N="339" /> people generally.  Governments must set a standard and the debt of one Government must be acknowledged by its successor.  If a Government goes security for trustee investments, that security should be honoured by all subsequent Governments irrespective of whether or not they are in agreement with their predecessor.  The Government must set a standard that the ordinary individual can follow.  It will not suffice if the Government sets the example that there is no compulsion upon one to honour one's debts.  If that were to be adopted as a policy it would be better for us to declare ourselves here and now a semi-communist State, and take away all investments regardless of whom one punishes rather than do it in a subtle way by saying: &ldquo;We are doing this in the interests of the nation.&rdquo;  The nation has no right to deprive an individual of what is due to him.  I am sorry that this Bill follows its predecessor in that respect.  The burden will fall upon the poor and the needy and upon those who are unable to make a protest because they lack the voting power to compel a Government to do its duty. The Government must set a high moral standard in the conduct of its business, a standard which the ordinary individual may justly be compelled to follow.</P>
    <P>I do not think the present approach to the transport problem is the right one.  We are merely trying to rehabilitate a bankrupt undertaking established over 100 years ago.  The prime interest then was importing from England and exporting to England. Nothing has been done since except to try to rehabilitate a system which is now entirely obsolete.  Surely the solution is to break up the country into zonal areas based on the ports scattered all round our coast.  A specific limit of 20, 30 or 50 miles could be laid down and our internal transport rearranged accordingly.</P>
    <P>We talk about introducing a new Transport Bill here.  Under this Bill we propose to hand over complete control of our transport to a group of men with full power to charge what they consider the demand allows.  Do not look for experts outside the country. <Col N="340" /> Do not look for experts inside the country.  They are here.  Give power to any group of men to control the entire transport system, to charge what rates they like, to close down what lines they consider ought to be closed down, naturally they must show a profit.  I never thought that proposals so absurd as the proposals in this Bill could be seriously proposed. Our railways have been running at a loss.  We blame the past directors. Absurd.  The past directors or those responsible for appointing the last directors, abused&mdash;infamously, I thought&mdash; the previous directors and made scapegoats of them.  The same thing is happening now.  Probably, when the new rates in the next five years are being fixed, the public will have a word to say in condemnation, too, of a new set of directors but, with the powers given to them, they will be supermen if they do not fall into the trap of providing a transport and a road system applicable to this country that will fleece this country and make it very difficult for business to be carried out in it.</P>
    <P>If the State is taking over this transport problem, as it is, I say first of all, do not deal with the internal transport without taking into consideration the ocean inlets, our ports.  Base your standard from there and do not base it from Dublin alone.  Take in the sea as well as you take in the overland, and take in the internal navigation area.  All form an essential part of any transport system that is necessary to this country or that can be economically worked.</P>
    <P>We are working on a sideline, on an issue, without imagination.  We are bound to fail.  We are giving power to the new board to close down branch lines wherever they consider necessary. Do we not know that branch lines, one after the other until they are all eliminated, must go under this position?  But what about the consequences? The nation and the taxpayer is going to pay for this.  Over the last 100 years towns have been built along railway centres.  They have been built because the asset of transport was at hand.  These will go and fade out as sure as I am saying to-night that, in my opinion, they will fade out. <Col N="341" /> When the branch lines are closed, the small towns in remote parts of the country which are serviced by them&mdash; small towns which had established good fairs and markets as a result of that transport&mdash;will fade away. Withdraw that transport, and the vested interests of the people who put their money and their energy into developing business in these towns will be gone.  Will the Minister consider recompensing these people as he is going to recompense other people whose interests he is going to eliminate under this Bill?  I would give no such power to people as the Minister proposes in this Bill, without strong and serious consideration of the consequences of such action.  If they destroy our branch lines they should be made consider the conditions of the people whose interests or business they are destroying, and the farming community whose interests they have destroyed, too, by depriving them of the close proximity of a market and fair in the a result of a transport rail service and which a few directors are now being empowered to destroy without question. It is an outrageous proposal.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will bear my observations in mind and ensure that protection will be given to the areas where the closing of branch lines may be considered essential.  I come from a county where there are two branch lines.  One serves the area from Enniskillen to Sligo and the other serves the area from Arigna to Dromod.  All the towns involved in those areas will be injured, if this Bill passes, without recompense to those concerned.  It is all very well to say that an equal road service will be provided.  Absurd!  An equal road service will be provided at whose cost?</P>
    <P>Surely to goodness it is obvious that if the county council are asked to provide a road service and a transport line, no matter how the money comes &mdash;from the State or partly from the State and partly from the ratepayers, or even entirely from the State&mdash;the ratepayers concerned will contribute a part of it for the building and maintenance of suitable roads.  However, I would point out that, in the case of the railways, they were charged with the <Col N="342" /> full liability of maintaining their track. We transfer that now to the whole community. To whom would you offer the entire transport system of the country who would not gladly pay some millions of pounds to get it?  These potentialities are now being handed over to a board of directors who are glorified as wonderful experts and who, we are told, are to make a success of this scheme.  I cannot see, first of all, why the necessity should have arisen for this Bill, in respect of a bankrupt concern which was unable to or failed to carry on the essential system of transport in this country on an ordinary business basis.  If we are going to be charged with this State charge for maintenance and continuation of a transport system essential to the needs of the community, let me put this question to the Minister.  Since all members of the community must contribute or take responsibility for this new scheme and this new order of transport, will he secure that the people who are living in remote parts of the country will be charged a rate of transport not in excess of that charged to those living within 15 or 20 miles of Dublin, Limerick, Cork or other such large centres of population?  Remember, we are all asked to contribute.  We are all mortgaged to the extent that we must pay whatever the cost of this new transport scheme will be.</P>
    <P>The past Government and the present Government have indicated their desire that rural industries should be founded. Will you tell me how you can expect rural industries to compete with industries in big centres of population, if they are burdened with the additional and excessive charge of transport on their raw materials and on their manufactures which must be sent to the centres where the goods must be sold and where the population is greatest? Will the Minister ensure, in his fixing of this arrangement, that since we are all liable for the future charges and responsibilities of national transport, in the interests of the nation, transport charges payable by a person living in the remotest part of the country will be equal to those of the person who lives 10, 15 or 20 miles from the market? If the Minister is sincere in his <Col N="343" /> statement that he wants to see industries established in rural areas he will take the precaution of ensuring that the transport charges on goods sent from a point 100 or 150 miles from the centre of consumption will not be in excess of those of a similar industry situated within 10, 15 or 20 miles of the same centre or market.</P>
    <P>We must have some form of equity in this transaction.  It is not a small matter that compels a Government to mortgage its whole responsibility to maintain what is stated to be the essential national transport service. Not being a small matter then, we must assume that there will be equity in its administration and that we are not going to take taxes from a poor farmer down in Leitrim, Sligo, Cork or Connemara to ensure that transport will exist here in the thickly populated areas or in a radius from them.  I should like a guarantee from the Minister that those rates will be fixed with consideration for the poorer section of the community who will be made liable to pay for this new transport concern and a guarantee, with regard to his statement that he is interested in rural industries, that there is to be no disadvantage for them in the transport services.</P>
    <P>I am tired asking Ministers for years back that the transport service which is now to be charged on the whole community should be national to the extent of using a certain amount of national fuel, coal produced in this country.  I am not asking him to make any innovation.  The same coal from Arigna has been used and kept the engines running during the emergency for three or four years.  It was not the most excellent coal.  The engines and boilers were not prepared to burn anything inferior to the best Welsh or Scottish coal, but in a case of dire emergency our coal did keep their wheels running and for four years it kept the trains running with little or no assistance from outside.  But the moment English, Scotch or Welsh coal became available the consumption of Irish coal was cut out almost completely and hundreds of men had to leave Arigna to seek employment in <Col N="344" /> the English or Welsh mines.  If this is a national concern as we are told it is and if it is so essential that the nation must be mortgaged to carry the liability of the cost of transport, why should a national concern not use the produce of our Irish mines which was found useful and capable alone of runing the service for four years?  Are we asked to pass such a thing having regard to our various commitments and to the conduct of the management of Córas Iompair Éireann since the end of the emergency?  They refused to buy even a small portion of Irish produced coal from Arigna and have watched without concern the departure from that area of some hundreds of men who had to leave their families behind them and go to England or Scotland to work in the mines there. What is the answer to that question? If our coal alone was capable of keeping the engines running for three or four years, I will not say highly efficiently, would not the use of a mixture of our coal with the best quality English, Scotch or Welsh coal which we are importing be justifiable from a national point of view?  Leaving out the question of the national point of view, would it not be justifiable as a gesture of goodwill and gratitude for the services we got when no other supplies were available?  If a mixture were used it would satisfy us and it would have kept the workers at home and the industry going, but the proposal now is to mortgage the workers; to set up directors with every control and power they want; to close down railway lines; to compel the county councils to carry out improvements on the roads and let the State pay for their maintenance and then we are to have efficient transport.  Unless there is considerable re-examination of the proposals, I regard them as very unnational and dangerous and as pursuing a line that has proved in the past to be injurious and wrong.</P>
    <P>Individuals are allowed to register and use their own lorries for their private use.  People down the country are engaged in various lines of business and perhaps transport is required from the country to the city for perishable products for export that must be <Col N="345" /> moved quickly, such as fruit.  These lorries are neither made in this country nor use a fuel which is provided in this country, and therefore every time waste occurs it is waste of money which is going out of the country.  If these lorries are enabled to carry goods to the Port of Dublin from the extreme end of Sligo, say, and have no return load, it is a waste of petrol and a waste of the machines. In the interests of efficiency and economy in transport why should not Córas Iompair Éireann be able to employ these private lorries and give them a return load?  Is there not something in that?  But that is not provided for in the Bill.  These lorries are outcasts and must do one economic journey and take out of the profits of that useful journey the cost of the return journey.  We should either withdraw all private licences or ensure that every time a lorry which costs the community something runs on our roads it should carry something useful. Every time a lorry moves from its base in Sligo carrying a load of eggs, for example, it should carry a load back. Why we should have this duplication and national waste beats me.  I submit it to the responsible Minister who has all the technical advice requisite to put these things right.  I must say that the present proposal merely to try to rehabilitate a defunct, bankrupt concern without any new ideas is a bankrupt proposal and no credit to the Government or to the Minister responsible.</P>
    <P>I have said all I intended to say and I hope that when the Minister is replying he will introduce more imagination into the question and give an indication that when the proposals are in operation they will bring a result which the nation wants, that is, more efficiency, more economy and a more equitable distribution of the wealth which must accrue from any national transport system that now or in the future may exist here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear, from the speeches that we have heard from different sides of the House, that there is no great satisfaction over this measure, and, as one can see, sometimes the greatest criticism has not <Col N="346" /> come from this side of the House.  It is, I suppose, contended by the Minister that this is nationalisation of transport.  Reference has already been made to that, but I would agree with the Deputies who hold that it is not. In fact, if anything, it is the denationalisation of transport, because there was control before, exercisable by the Minister&mdash;an overriding control &mdash;and that is now going to be taken away under this Bill.</P>
      <P>I remember that, some months ago, when the debate was on here on the Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce, the Minister was asked if the Government really intended to nationalise transport and no reply was given.  I can understand now why it was not given, as it is clear that the Government had not made up their minds about it.  It appears to me that they are steering between nationalisation, on the one hand, and shedding the responsibilities that should accompany that step, on the other hand.</P>
      <P>What I understand to be the meaning of nationalisation is the putting up of whatever business concern would be in question from private into public hands, bringing it under State control. But that is not being done here.  We all thought, when we heard of nationalisation, that the Government would be answerable to this House for the day-to-day operations of Córas Iompair Éireann and that questions could be asked here by Deputies with regard to the running of that concern, just the same as questions are being asked in relation to the running of the Land Commission or the Office of Public Works, to give two examples.  But that is not the case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>I will tell the Deputy in a minute what I want.  Under this Bill, the Minister will not be constrained to answer any questions as to the running of the transport of this country.  Now, I am not a great believer in nationalisation myself&mdash;if that would satisfy Deputy Timoney&mdash;because <Col N="347" /> nationalisation will not solve any problem that cannot be solved otherwise, in my opinion.  However, there is this about it, that whereas private initiative is stimulated by the desire to make profit and the intention to avoid loss, it is just possible there may, in relation to nationalisation, be the idea that, no matter what would happen, the Central Exchequer would be there to make good any losses.  I do not know whether the Minister and the Government have studied the working-out of nationalisation in other countries, such as in England.  I do not know how nationalisation of transport has been working out there, whether there has been an improvement or otherwise.  It would be very important if we could get some information about that.</P>
      <P>Reference has already been made to the closing down of branch lines and I, too, am interested in that, as it happens to affect the constituency that I represent.  I was surprised to hear Deputy Thomas O'Higgins and others trying to justify the closing down of branch lines on the grounds that they were not paying propositions.  I regard the transport system of a country as a social service and I do not think that the decision to close a branch line should be based entirely on considerations of pounds, shillings and pence. If we were to follow that line of argument to its logical conclusion, we would have no social services in this country, because these social services do not pay for themselves.  They are a burden on the Exchequer or rather on the taxpayers.  If, as in the case of old age pensions, widows' and orphans' pensions, children's allowances and so on, the State is prepared to bear the burden, why should the State not be prepared to bear the financial burden in connection with these branch lines?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hold that people living in isolated parts of the country are just as much entitled to a railway service as people living in and adjacent to the big centres of population.  It is not because of an accident of birth that people living in isolated places should be deprived of the same amenities that people living in the populous part of the country are getting.  Therefore, we should hear no more about this <Col N="348" /> question of economy in relation to these branch lines.  As I said, they are a social service just as much as all the other social services some of which I have mentioned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>Reference has been made to the private haulier.  That is a question which must get the serious attention of the Government or of the board, to whom, it seems, the Minister is delegating his authority.  As somebody has said, it is a very serious question for people living down the country.  It is one that should not be considered lightly.  I know there is a difference between the long distance haulier and the person who owns a private lorry and caters for farmers in his own locality.  There is a very clear distinction between the two.  In my opinion, no consideration should induce the Government, the Minister or the board to put private hauliers off the road in their own locality because these private hauliers are of great service to the farming community in taking their produce to fairs, markets and so on.  They provide a flexible system of transport for the farmers which Córas Iompair Éireann at times may not be able to supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made to the rearrangement of the stock of Córas Iompair Éireann.  I must say that I am not at all satisfied with the way in which the Government has handled this question.  I do not know if it is necessary to recall to the minds of Deputies a certain date in February when an article appeared in the <i>Irish Independent</i> in reference to the Government's proposals to deal with the transport problem.  There was a suspicion in the people's minds that there had been a leakage of information. I am not saying that there was a leakage but the suspicion was there.  In any case, as a result, the common shares of the company jumped <Col N="349" /> from 6/10½d. to 9/6d. &mdash;an increase of about 40 per cent. from the 2nd of February to the 3rd of February.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>Wait a minute.  We will come to that later.  There was an increase of about 40 per cent. in one day.  The Minister for Finance took steps to close down the Stock Exchange as far as transactions in transport shares were concerned but, again, it was like locking the stable when the steed had been sold.  As the Minister has referred to what happened in 1944, I am sure that if it was a Fianna Fáil Government that was sitting over there and the Minister and his colleagues were sitting here a public inquiry would have been demanded into this matter that I am referring to because these people were fond of public inquiries.</P>

      <P>I am not.  I did not say I was.  I am merely telling the House what I think would have happened if these transactions in shares and this jump in shares from one day to another had taken place during the lifetime of the previous Government.</P>
      <P>Apropos of these shares, I cannot understand how it is that the same consideration is being given to speculators who came into the market in recent times as is being given to people who have held the stock for years.  These speculators came into the market to make a profit and they should be regarded as distinct from the genuine investors.  The genuine investors put their money into railway stock at a time when this stock was regarded as a gilt-edged security.  They put their life savings, in some cases, into that stock.  Now we find that people who bought common shares in February last will get the same consideration as the people who have held shares for years and years.  They will get credit for 80 per cent. of their present holdings.</P>

      <P>The Minister may tell me that it would be impossible to segregate one class from the other.  I do not think so because there must be a record of these transactions in the stockbrokers' books.  I do not think it should be impossible.  The taxpayers of the country will be called upon to give these speculators the same financial assistance as the genuine investors of long standing will get.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not a bad nerve sometimes.  Deputies opposite seem to be at pains to try to persuade the country that there has been terrible mismanagement in the affairs of Córas Iompair Éireann.  I do not think so at all because, as has been pointed out, that company never got a fair chance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">

      <P>They had to pursue their business in very difficult and very abnormal times.  During the emergency, they were confined to a skeleton service of two days a week while, at the same time, they had to keep all their men in employment.  In other words, their income had fallen considerably because they were limited to a skeleton service and they had to keep all their hands in employment.  When all is said and done, I think they carried on very well in the face of all these difficulties and it remains to be seen whether the proposed change will bring about any improvement.  I honestly hope it will.  But if so I believe the Bill will have to be drastically amended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion, I would ask the Minister to reconsider this question of delegating his authority to an outside body. This appears to be the kernel of the whole question and Deputies from every side of the House have referred to it.  This anxiety as to the delegation of the Minister's overriding authority to an outside board that will not be answerable to the House or to <Col N="351" /> the people through the House is not confined to any Party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJosephTimoney" hpid="Mr. Timoney Mr. Timoney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timoney</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess that I find it somewhat difficult to understand why this Bill has created such a stir because, with all due respect to the Minister, I do not regard it as a very important measure.  The purposes of the Bill, briefly are: We are buying out the private investors.  To that extent we are nationalising the transport system. We are amalgamating the canal, road and rail services.  We are taking power of administration and management of the transport system out of the hands of one man and putting it into the hands of a board.  We are also, so to speak, taking the Minister's finger out of the transport pie, at his own desire and request, obviously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first thing that strikes one about this measure is the difference in approach of the present Minister for Industry and Commerce and his predecessor, Deputy Lemass, when the 1944 Transport Bill was being debated here.  A perusal of Deputy Lemass's speech on that occasion shows that he regarded the 1944 Transport Act as a cure-all.  He went to it with buoyant enthusiasm and confidence in the future and was going to solve all the transport problems by that Act.  The events which have happened have shown that the confidence which he then had was not justified.  I think the approach of the present Minister for Industry and Commerce is more commendable. It shows prudence and caution and it will not be denied that in dealing with a problem with such an unhappy history prudence and caution are very essential.  The Minister has said that he does not consider it unlikely that this Bill will have to be followed by further measures.  For that reason and because of the purposes of the Bill which I have mentioned, I do not regard this as a measure of very great importance.  If I have read the Minister's mind aright, from the speech he has made, he and I are at one in regarding it in the nature of an experiment, as to the outcome of which he is not certain.  It is an attempt to clear up an unhappy and a sorry mess. I am not so sure that the Minister is <Col N="352" /> certain that this measure will clear up the mess and I must confess that I am not certain that it will.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether or not the question has been seriously considered by the Minister as to whether or not the remedies which this measure provides will be effective.  There is the altogether greater question, one that has not been raised so far in this debate&mdash;a fact which surprises me.  It is a question that I believe may have to be faced some day by Dáil Éireann. Are the railways outmoded?  Has the railway system in this country come to the end of its useful purpose?  We have not a very dense population.  It will be a difficult problem, even at the best of times, to make a railway system by itself pay.  I am merely posing the question.  The system as we know it is a cumbersome, costly, inefficient, rigid system.  From the point of view of our national economy, it is unsuitable.  We are depending on foreign coal to drive our trains and we are depending on steel from abroad to keep our rolling stock supplied.  All, one might say, we can supply here is the labour.</P>
    <P>There is this very important item of coal.  Deputy Maguire dealt with it and thought it a shame that we should not have used our native fuel as it was used during the emergency.  He made the point that we ought to have got our engineers to try to adapt the engines used on the Irish railways to the use of Irish anthracite and should not have been using unsuitable engines for the burning of Irish anthracite. There is a great deal to be said for that point of view and I think it is something to which the younger engineers in Ireland ought to direct their minds; but, as I said, over and above all that, there is, in the light of history, that question mark: whether, in view of the progress of scientific development, we are not coming to the time when the rigid, inefficient, expensive type of railway system we know will become outmoded and unsuited to our purposes here?</P>
    <P>Because of that possibility and because of the possibility&mdash;it may be just a scientist's dream&mdash;that one day there may be electric power stations <Col N="353" /> dotted over the countryside here for the supply of motive power for transport, just as there are petrol pumps to-day for the supply of petrol, a possibility which would give us a much more flexible system, I think the pumping into the present system of an immense amount of capital would scarcely be justified.  I would not at all take up the attitude that we must be niggardly about these important organisations which serve national purposes and needs, but, at the same time, I think everyone will agree that, particularly when one is spending the money of other people, as we here are, one ought to be ordinarily prudent about it and it is very difficult to know, even after spending a great deal of money, having pumped a great deal of capital into an organisation, if you are going to get a reasonable return from it.  You would have to be reasonably certain, as a business man dealing with his own assets would have to be reasonably certain, that the expenditure of more capital was going to bring a more efficient service and give a better and more economical proposition.</P>
    <P>I know that the railways filled a very essential gap during the emergency.  I appreciate that until there is some reasonable prospect of substituting something for them which will give a service as good, if not better, we could not contemplate scrapping them.  I appreciate, too, that, even if they are losing money, we are justified in spending money on them, within reason.  We must spend money, by analogy, on an Army here, although, in peace times, armies in any country are, if you like, an unnecessary expense.  In the same way, to a business man, a safe is an unnecessary expense, but he has to expend the money on it in order to provide for such contingencies as fire and burglary, just as we provide against contingencies by spending money on insurance.  In one way, these moneys spent against contingencies are, of course, well spent.  In that way, I think that the expenditure of money on the railways, even though it may be a losing proposition, is justified.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal briefly with a few of the criticisms against the measure.  The first criticisms is that the Dáil will have no control over transport <Col N="354" /> under this Bill.  I must confess that I do not regard that as a valid criticism.  What Dáil Éireann can do it can undo, and, if the thing gets out of hand, there is nothing to prevent the Minister for Industry and Commerce or his successor coming back here again and introducing another measure which will give Dáil Éireann control over the transport system and give full nationalisation, although I consider that, by reason of the fact that private investors are now bought out and that you have the management of the organisation in the hands of a semi-statutory body, you are as near to nationalisation as is, perhaps, necessary or desirable.  I do not see that any useful purpose would be served by making the transport organisation a Department of State in the sense in which the Department of Industry and Commerce is one.</P>
    <P>How far the criticism that the inefficiency of Córas Iompair Éireann was due to the incompetence of the directors is justified I cannot say.  I was speaking recently to some of the rank and file of the employees of the system, an engine driver, for instance, and he criticised the Milne Report to this extent&mdash;he said that none of his people was consulted by Sir James Milne at all.  He had the idea that Sir James Milne himself or some of his assistants should have gone around incognito and have had talks with some of the railway men.  If he had done that, how far it would have changed the recommendations he made is a matter for idle speculation now.  There was one criticism this worker made&mdash; that the system was overloaded at the top and that the clerical staff was too great in comparison with what, I suppose, are called manual workers.  He told me he had been working on the railways all his life and that that was a criticism he shared with many other men who had a railway tradition behind them.  It does seem that there should be a much smaller number on the administration side than amongst the manual workers.  I do not know what the proportions are but this man told me, in any event, that it was lopsided.</P>
    <P>Finally, of course our difficulties with regard to national transport are <Col N="355" /> not lessened by the continuance of the Border.  I suppose until Partition goes and until the whole country can be brought into one economic unit, it will be very difficult to get, and a rather vain hope to look for, a truly economic transport system.  The whole question will be cropping up repeatedly as part of our national problem.  What is going to be done with the Great Northern Railway Company is a question for the future. I do not know what stage the talks which are going on have reached but it is clear that a real difficulty is created by the partition of the country and the division of the system into two parts.  The Minister, however, I think ought not to hesitate about bringing under the control of Córas Iompair Éireann that part of the Great Northern system which is within our effective jurisdiction at the moment. As I have indicated, until the whole transport organisation of the 32 Counties comes under the jurisdiction of Córas Iompair Éireann, we cannot hope for a truly effective and economic transport system here.</P>

      <P>I think every Deputy will agree that there is a major transport problem in this country.  It is not a problem of to-day or yesterday; it is one of long standing and it will not be solved in a year or two.  If it is to be solved at all, a long-term view, a broad and generous view, is necessary. I did think, when I read forecasts as to the nationalisation of railways, that the Bill would make an effort to deal with that problem.  To my mind, it has not done so at all.  It is simply setting up a board of nominees, giving them powers that were not possessed by the directors of the railways&mdash;in recent times at any rate, whatever their power may have been in the old days&mdash;cutting out safeguards to the public that were embodied in previous legislation and guaranteeing to the shareholders their dividends no matter what way the transport undertaking may work.  I cannot see how that is going to solve the problem so far as this House is concerned.  It is simply passing the <Col N="356" /> question over to this board of nominees in the hope that they will try to do something that this House has not done up to the present.  I do not think that is the way to deal with this question.  As many Deputies have pointed out, there is no guarantee that any of these nominees will know anything about transport.  I think it is our duty here to preserve for the public, at any rate, the safeguards they had up to this as regards maximum fares, adequate services, no differentiation in rates, etc.  Perhaps those five or six men are going to be miracle workers&mdash;something that we have never been able to find before.  Apparently the Minister must think so, judging by the way he has drafted this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HarryColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that anybody who looks at this question without being either pro-railway or pro-road service, but simply with the idea of trying to provide a decent transport service for the people, will have to come to the conclusion that capital expenditure, and large capital expenditure at that, will be necessary to deal with the problem under modern conditions.  It is the easiest thing in the world to attack a programme of capital expenditure when one has not got the job of trying to provide the transport service.  It is the easiest thing in the world to attack any large sum required for any purpose when one does not try to give the alternative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, in his opening statement, gave us a list of proposed capital expenditure works amounting to £17,000,000, but only £5,325,000 of that was authorised between 1st January, 1945, and 31st August, 1948. The Minister himself in this Bill provides for £7,000,000 extra capital, but he has not told us to what that £7,000,000 will be applied.  I am quite sure that, if there is any success achieved as a result of the setting up of this board, in another year or two the Dáil will be asked to sanction further capital expenditure.  He proposes <Col N="357" /> to fool a number of people by running down the programme of works put up and describing them as huge, unnecessary capital commitments and then putting in a smaller figure and in a couple of years bringing in another Bill to increase it.</P>
    <P>In giving instances of &ldquo;unnecessary capital commitments&rdquo; he chose first the central bus station at Store Street and went on to make a laboured case against the provision of offices on that site.  He admitted, however, the necessity for a central bus station. Then he went on to give figures and he quoted the former chairman as stating:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The annual charge for interest on the capital cost of the new building, rents, rates and taxes will be less than the present charge and there can be no doubt that the centralisation proposed will produce much greater efficiency.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He then went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;From the figures supplied by the accountant of the company, I find that the estimated rent, rates, etc., for the new building will be £45,000 per annum, while the estimated saving by removing the offices from the present building will be £3,000 or £4,000 a year.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not know what the rent may be, but is the Minister trying to tell us that the rates on these premises are going to be more than the total rate that Córas Iompair Éireann pays in the City of Dublin?  In the present year the total rates that Córas Iompair Éireann pays in the City of Dublin for bus stations, railway stations, offices, etc., is approximately £33,000 and the Minister wants us to believe that the rent and rates on the new building in Store Street will be £45,000.  I am not prepared to accept that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy ought to check up on that £33,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HarryColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister can check up on that any time he likes and he will find it is correct.  Approximately £33,000 represents the rates for this year for the whole of the Córas Iompair Éireann premises in the City of Dublin.  The Minister then told us that there is no pressing need for <Col N="358" /> further office accommodation.  Only a few weeks ago I heard an official of Córas Iompair Éireann remark that in his office it was a case of the man who got in first getting a seat to do his work.  Can efficient work be done under these conditions?  If there are many more officials like that, there is certainly need for new offices if we are to have anything like efficient work done.  The Minister further told us that they would only save £3,000 or £4,000 a year by vacating the old premises. He did not tell us, however, what these premises would produce if they were let or sold, which is surely something to be taken into consideration if we are to come to a proper estimate of the matter.  He conveniently leaves that out.</P>
      <P>I think this whole question of the loss on the new bus station has been grossly exaggerated.  If the proper figures were ascertained, I think the former chairman would be proved to be correct.  Apart from that, there is the big question of providing a bus station for people travelling to and from the city.  The conditions under which people have to wait for their buses at present are appalling.  When an attempt was made to provide proper accommodation for them, we had all this antagonistic propaganda. Now it is proposed to provide a new site for a bus station and it will be some years before it is available.  In the meantime, people travelling by bus from the city will continue to be exposed to the elements.  I often pity these people when I see them standing for hours on the quays and getting drenched before they set out on their long journeys.  Surely they should not be compelled to wait for another five years before they are provided with proper accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from that, nobody has attempted to put up a reasoned argument against Store Street as a site for the bus station.  There has been a good deal said about the congestion of traffic.  I know what the conditions are in the City of Dublin.  I pass Store Street several times a day, and I know how terrible the traffic congestion is up around Smithfield.  Do Deputies know that if a bus station is put there it will be necessary to demolish <Col N="359" /> several houses and thus make worse the terrible housing conditions in the city?  That will be necessary in order to make that area safe for buses to pass through it.  Again, one of the most congested streams of traffic that we have in the city runs through that particular district.</P>
    <P>Smithfield is not a convenient place for anyone to get to or to come from, particularly if you want to go to a railway station.  On the other hand, Store Street could be made a central bus station for the whole of Ireland. You have the railway already there, and from it you can reach any part of Ireland.  It would be a crying shame if the site at Store Street, apparently through political prejudice, were to be abandoned to the detriment of the travelling public.  Looking ahead, one can see that Store Street is the ideal site for a bus station.  None of the opponents of that site has attempted to try and deal with that aspect of the question.  To the mind of any reasonable man, the alternative site chosen does not compare in any way with it.</P>

      <P>The Minister, when dealing with the new factory which it was proposed to set up to make motor chassis, said when speaking here on the 26th October&mdash;col. 53 of the Dáil Debates:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The company would, therefore, be providing nearly three times as many lorries for its competitors as for itself.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister used that as one of his main arguments for turning down the project.  Deputy Davin, the other night, said that there were 19,000 licensed lorries of which only 807 were Córas Iompair Éireann lorries.  Those 19,000 people must get lorries and must replace them when they get worn out. Therefore, it seems to me that the company would have a good market for the production of three times the number of lorries that it used itself.  The lorries must be got somewhere.  There is no reason why this factory should not supply them.  Of course, if we are <Col N="360" /> to take it that the Minister is silently and secretly going to do away with all these lorries, another position will be created; but, so far as we know, he has not attempted to say that and none of these 19,000 lorries are going to disappear off the road.</P>
    <P>If that is a correct representation of what the position is to be, then one could say that there would be a very good market here for the output of that factory.  What the Minister tried to say was that the production of these lorries by Córas Iompair Éireann would be only helping its competitors. I do not think so.  It would mean the setting up here of a new engineering industry, a thing which is highly necessary in the national interest.  If we are satisfied that it is necessary to do so in the national interest, in what better place could we establish it than in the engineering workshops of Córas Iompair Éireann?  These workshops stand out on their own as being the place which one would select for the establishment of such an industry. Therefore, I say we should look at the project from the Irish point of view.</P>
    <P>I do not think Sir James Milne looked at that aspect of the question. He did so from the point of view of a man with experience of English railways. He was not concerned at all with Ireland.  I think we should look at this project in the way that I have been suggesting.  It was a worthwhile one.  It would have paid for itself.  It would be a national asset, and in a few years' time we might be very glad to have it.</P>
    <P>We have no guarantee that any of the branch lines at present closed are going to be reopened, or even that those which are open are going to be kept open.  Some of these were reopened in 1946 but were closed again in 1947 owing to the scarcity of fuel. That scarcity has been non-existent since the Minister took office, but yet he has taken no steps to reopen these lines as was done in 1946.  I do not think that his is the mind that is going to reopen them if they are not paying.</P>
    <P>Deputy Con Lehane told us the other night that none had been closed since this Government took office.  I make him a present of that.  There has <Col N="361" /> been no fuel scarcity since the beginning of 1948.  I would ask the Deputies opposite to remember what the conditions were during the war years and the terrible weather and fuel conditions that prevailed in 1947.  If they would remember that I do not think they would be so ready to condemn the former chairman and board of Córas Iompair Éireann for what they did or even for what they did not do.  The conditions in those years were simply desperate.  Conditions have been quite different since the beginning of 1948, and yet the branch lines remain closed.</P>

      <P>And for no other reason. If there had not been a by-election, it would still be closed like the rest. Talking about the branch lines, under this Bill the new board is going to have the power to close branch lines permanently without any reference to the people or to this House, but simply by giving one month's notice of its intention, and irrespective of what everybody else in the country may think.</P>
      <P>Looking at the power that is being handed over to the five nominees and reading the sections in the Bill which are supposed to guarantee the workers employment or compensation, one finds that a man cannot be dismissed for redundancy, but he can be transferred. He can be dismissed with compensation for the cessor of railways, so it seems to me that all the board has to do is to transfer a man whom they find redundant to some line they mean to close down and then they can dismiss him legally.  It seems to me to be a desperate quibble, an attempt to fool the workman.  It does not matter to the poor man who is dismissed whether he is dismissed for redundancy or for the cessor of railways.</P>

      <P>Many men were kept on during the emergency, even when the <Col N="362" /> trains were not running.  If the Minister had tried to deal with the problem when it first came before him, immediately after he became Minister, instead of saying that it was against public policy to try to increase fares when there was nearly £1,000,000, if my memory serves me, for increased wages alone, and had taken into consideration the desperate conditions of the previous year, he might have a different story to tell to-day.  Instead of that, apparently he set out to drive the railway company into bankruptcy so that he would be able to make a case against the former chairman.  That is what the Minister did do.  Knowing the position following the crisis it had gone through, he left it there to sink deeper and deeper into bankruptcy. But when Sir James Milne suggested increased fares he went out of his way immediately to meet him, though it was the same thing that the former chairman had said.  It was all right then, but because an Irishman with only Irish experience said it, it was not all right.  He was to be looked down upon; he did not know what he was talking about.</P>

      <P>At any rate, the Minister, for fear he has not given enough in the very extensive powers he has already given to that board, seeks in another section to give them additional powers without specifying what those powers will be and apparently without any question of coming to the Dáil to consider those powers.  I think that is something this House should not agree to.  The powers already specified are too extensive and to give the Minister <i>carte blanche</i> to pass on any other powers he may like is asking too much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think this Bill will do much to solve the problem.  It is not a real attempt to solve it.  I do not think it gets us much further along the road we would like to travel.  The Minister would be wise to agree to a curtailment of those powers that he proposes to give the board to preserve for the public the rights they hitherto had and to <Col N="363" /> give this House some opportunity of being able to question any actions that may be performed by the board.  I appeal to him to reconsider that aspect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOReilly" hpid="Mr. P. O'Reilly Mr. P. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>As a direct representative of the farming community, I must give serious consideration to the implications of the Transport Bill, chiefly because the agricultural industry will provide the bulk of the goods that will be handled by the transport company.  The efficient handling of those goods means a considerable lot to the agricultural producer and, therefore, we must consider very carefully whether the proposal to nationalise transport is in the best interests of the farming community.</P>
      <P>This, I think, is the third attempt to cope with the transport problem. In the 20's of the present century&mdash; although I am not too conversant with the details of that period&mdash;an attempt was made to centralise transport by the unification of the then existing railway companies.  It was then intended that that should lead to greater efficiency and to a reduced cost of transport.  Obviously that did not justify the hopes existing at the time. Later, I think in the 1944 legislation, not alone was there still further centralisation, but there was also an attempt to control and limit alternative transport which, up to then, was unlimited and a serious competitor to the railway transport.  We are faced now with the failure of that attempt and we are about to set up another type of undertaking.  Is there any assurance that this proposal will lead to improvement?  In the earlier attempts there was some hope.  That, I think, is all we can entertain at the moment, because in a few years' time we may be considering another alternative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not propose to go into details. I shall deal rather with the broad principles of transport, particularly in so far as it affects the delivery of agricultural produce to the consumer, and also the transport of the raw materials of his industry to the farmer.  The efficiency with which that is handled will mean a lot, not alone to the producer <Col N="364" /> but to the consumer.  Any mismanagement or any additional charges or undue burdens by the carriage of unnecessary materials or men or anything else puts up the cost of transport and leaves a bigger gap between the producer and the consumer.  It diminishes the income of the producer and increases the cost of living to the consumer. Therefore, we must be very careful to see that we do not bolster up a system that may possibly increase transport charges and not give a better service.</P>
    <P>This is said to be a Bill to nationalise transport but there are some Deputies who say that that is not its object and that its object lies in another direction.  I think we shall have to agree, however, that it is at least an initial step in the nationalisation of transport since its aim is to bring all transport under the one system. We have to consider, then, whether or not that is a wise policy. If we nationalise our transport, it may be said in years to come that our system of transport is the most efficient system we can have.  But by what standard are we to judge its efficiency if there is only the one system?  How shall we make any comparisons?  With what shall we compare it in order to form an opinion as to whether or not it is the most efficient system?  In order to illustrate my point, let me cite the example of the present Post Office.  The Post Office is a nationalised industry. It is carried on as a State service.  It is a paying concern.  Why does it pay? Because people must pay postage on letters and parcels.  That postage covers all the charges of that Department. But there is no alternative by which we can make a comparison with reference to the Post Office.  It stands alone.</P>
    <P>If we nationalise the transport system of the country, shall we not reach the same position in relation to it?  Furthermore, it might be pointed out that in the Post Office there is a Minister for Posts and Telegraphs who is responsible to this House.  Over the transport system there will be a particular body appointed with absolute powers to levy what charges they like on the goods and passengers they carry.  Even the Minister for Industry <Col N="365" /> and Commerce will have no responsibility for that; therefore, this House will have no control of any kind.  What redress will the producers and consumers have in relation to this body with all the powers proposed under this Bill vested in it?  What redress will the people have if charges are increased to such an extent as to become an intolerable burden on the users of transport?</P>
    <P>We must consider in some detail the purpose served by transport.  The railways were built up by private enterprise.  The railway companies built their own permanent way, provided their own rolling stock and so on.  They gave a service to the people at their own cost, if one likes to put it that way.  We could have an alternative road system in competition with the railways.  By that competition the producer and consumer might directly benefit to a considerable extent.  But there might be a qualifying factor.  To a large extent the roads are a liability on the local ratepayers.  The lorry owner has that much advantage over the railways; he has not to maintain the full cost of the upkeep of the roads over which he conveys his merchandise.  That may confer an undue advantage to some extent on road transport in competition with the railways, but some arrangement could be made whereby a heavier burden could be placed on the shoulders of those who convey goods by road.  A limit could be placed on the amount of the load carried. The roads in their present condition are not capable of carrying very heavy loads.  Undue wear and tear on them increases the burden on the local ratepayer for maintenance. The result is that in the long run the bulk of the funds accumulated by the county councils is devoted largely to the upkeep of main and trunk roads to the exclusion of the roads used by people in backward areas.  I am not ignorant of the fact that haulage contractors have to pay a heavy road tax. Without being an expert on the matter, I venture to say that that tax does not nearly recoup the local ratepayer for the amount of wear and tear on his roads as a result of these heavy loads.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the railways <Col N="366" /> have been constructed in such a manner as to render them capable of carrying very heavy loads.  Anything that would tend to divert heavy traffic, particularly long distance traffic, to the railways would be in the national interest ultimately.  It has to be remembered, too, in this connection that the railways bear the cost of their own maintenance.  Loads of eight, 10 and 12 tons are carried by lorries at the present time over roads that were never constructed for that purpose. That is certainly not an economic proposition from the national point of view.  I suggest to the Minister that a limit should be placed on the loads conveyed by haulage contractors and private individuals.  There is a good deal to be said for the conveyance of light and perishable goods by road since road transport in that particular respect is more flexible than rail transport.  A much better service can be given.  In some areas there is no railway in the vicinity and the goods have to be taken first by road to the nearest station.  They may then be conveyed somewhat slowly to their destination.  But where heavy goods are concerned, the ambition of everyone who has any interest in transport should be to have those goods conveyed by rail.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that if we continue with nationalisation we may reach a point where we shall have no alternative, but the one, and that may place a very heavy burden on the State without giving efficient service in return.  If the Minister is determined to go on with the present proposal, side by side with nationalisation.  I suggest there should be a relaxation of the restrictions placed on private hauliers under the Act of 1944.  Prior to 1944 these private hauliers gave a very efficient service to the agricultural community.  They conveyed pigs to the bacon factories and butter from the creameries.  In addition, they had their own load of raw materials for the agricultural industry or provisions for the general community back down the country.  To-day, a flexible service could come pretty near the farm, if not entirely to it, and clear these goods and transport them very quickly and very cheaply.  But once the 1944 Act <Col N="367" /> was approved that, to a large extent, stopped.  We have the competition, still, of a limited number of those private hauliers.  We have, also, the competition of merchants who have their own lorries for the conveyance of their own goods.  But even those could still give a good service to the farming community if they were allowed to convey farm produce or live stock up from the country to the main centres of distribution either for export or for conversion into food for consumption in the cities or towns. Therefore, I would suggest to the Minister that he should give this greater flexibility to the private hauliers so that we will have an alternative system and that we shall never reach the stage that we shall have only one system of transport in the country.</P>
    <P>I understand that, under the 1944 Act, further restrictions were placed on private hauliers for, in making application for the licence then, they would have to enumerate the articles they were anxious to convey.  Thinking it merely a matter of form, they made out a list but, as the years went by they found they had omitted a considerable number of articles that they could convey and the limitation imposed on them by not since being able to convey those goods has been a hardship on a number of people in those areas.  Therefore, I would suggest to the Minister that the limited licence be abolished and that in respect, at least, of those who have held licences, if they are limited, steps will be taken towards removing that limit, thus leaving the holders of these licences in a position to serve the whole community of the area over which the licence extends by conveying every and any article that is offered to them for conveyance.  I have no intention of going into the details but just merely mention the broad principles underlying the difficulties that may confront the whole country in the future.</P>
    <P>There is another consideration that could arise and that might be a serious one, if we had only one system.  It affects the farming community very much.  Under the one system of transport <Col N="368" /> in the country, if we were faced with the position now in a few weeks' time when the turkey market will be on that for one cause or another, or for any cause, there was a hold-up on transport on this one-way system, what position would those who had the turkeys to dispose of be in?  Is it not inviting people who could improve their position considerably when they see they are in a position to hold up perishable goods, to put their foot down at a crucial time to the agricultural industry in an effort to improve their bargaining powers to get better conditions or better income?  I do not for a moment want to take from the workers of any description their bargaining powers.  That is a right, but, at the same time, I do not want to see the alternative to the people who would be the main sufferers&mdash;I do not want to see their right removed by finding ourselves absolutely and entirely dependent on a one-way transport system. I hope the Minister will carefully consider the position that might arise and that, before giving unlimited powers now, or even powers that could be used later, he will take steps to safeguard the general community not now, but in the future, so that, in a few years' time, we may not be faced here again with the same problems that we are faced with at the present time&mdash;endeavouring to apportion blame and to find methods of improvement&mdash;but that we shall still have an alternative so that we may not be put into the position that may leave us very much worse than we are at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to go into the fine points as to whether this Bill constitutes nationalisation of transport or otherwise.  As far as I can see, it is as near to nationalisation as does not matter.  What, in my opinion, is unfortunate, is that a change of Government in this country has more or less coincided with a complete change in the control of Córas Iompair Éireann and of national transport generally. Taking a long-term view and approaching this matter of national transport in an objective and impartial way, nothing could be more undesirable than that the company controlling transport should be closely identified <Col N="369" /> with whatever Party is in power.  I hope that Deputies of all Parties will co-operate in the passing of this legislation to ensure that we set up an organisation in control of transport which will not be at the beck and call of any Government.  It may be a difficult matter to maintain control by this House over a national transport company and at the same time prevent that company from becoming the plaything of politics but, at any rate, that is the ideal towards which we shall all have to strive.</P>
      <P>I am not, naturally, as a farmer, enthusiastic about anything that seeks to extend still further nationalised or centralised control over such a widespread branch of our national life as transport.  I am a strong believe in private enterprise.  It was private enterprise that built up the railway system in this country and, through private enterprise, the necessary capital was provided for that purpose.  I have a feeling that if the railways had been treated properly by the State, since this State was established, and that if the scales had been held fairly between the railway system and the road system of transport, it would not be necessary now to have legislation of this kind going through the House and that it would not have been necessary to have had the legislation that was passed in 1933 and in 1944.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For many years the railway system had to compete with opposition which was in the main, as Deputy O'Reilly pointed out, unfair inasmuch as the railway companies had to maintain their own permanent way and other facilities whereas the rival transport companies on the roads had the advantage of having the permanent way and other facilities provided for them by the general taxpayer and the local ratepayers.  While I say that I believe that a wrong turning was taken when something like Sir James Milne recommended, a national highways body to hold the balance between road and railway transport, was not set up in 1944 or more particularly in 1933 to ensure fair play for the railways and enable them to compete on equal terms with their rivals.  I think that the position is entirely different to-day.  I <Col N="370" /> am sufficiently fair-minded to acknowledge that while we may see that a wrong turning was taken a number of years ago it is perhaps too late now to retrace our steps and we are therefore forced to consider how best we can make Córas Iompair Éireann which has been established as the transport company a workable organisation that will give efficient services over a long period in the future and meet the needs of the community generally.</P>
    <P>As I referred to private enterprise which provided us with the railway system, I must express a view which very few Deputies I think have expressed in this House: that those who provided the capital that established the railway system, those who hold the common stock in the railway companies and subsequently in Córas Iompair Éireann have not got a very fair deal in this Bill.  I fail to see why the common stockholder should have the value of his stock reduced by 80 per cent.; equally I fail to see why a redumption of the stock allotted to him is put back for 20 years longer than is the case with the other stockholders. That seems to me to be fundamentally unfair.  Looking at the matter from a disinterested and impartial point of view, I think that while the number of people penalised in this way may not be very large it is fundamentally the duty of Parliament to ensure that every section of the community, whether owners, workers or of any rank in life, is treated with absolute impartiality and fair play.</P>
    <P>If we are to have an efficient transport service it is a matter of fundamental importance, as Deputy O'Reilly has pointed out, that a reasonable measure of competition be maintained in the future as in the past.  When this company is established and working the only real competition that will remain to it will be the private car and the private lorry, but I hold that as long as private lorries are allowed to operate freely there will be a fair and reasonable measure of competition on the roads.  I think it is absolutely essential that the Minister in his reply should give a definite and unmistakable assurance to the owners of private lorries that they will not be interfered with in any way and that their rights <Col N="371" /> and powers will not in any way be restricted in the future.  It is quite clear that it is in the power of the Government in various ways to restrict the private lorry owner until he is eventually driven off the road.</P>
    <P>I have noticed a tendency during the last few years on the part of State and semi-State companies to compel their customers, the retail traders, to utilise Córas Iompair Éireann services although they had private lorries which they could use to collect their goods.  I think that is true in the case of beer and sugar and of other commodities also.  I think that is absolutely unjustifiable and unfair and I think I could almost say that it is unconstitutional, but in any case it is one of the ways by which pressure can be brought to bear on the ordinary citizen in the exercise of his rights and the carrying out of his own business. Before the Bill passes its Second Reading I think that the Minister should give a clear indication to the House and to the country that the private car and lorry will be allowed to operate freely and will not be restricted or controlled in any way.</P>
    <P>If this company, whether it is under national control or, as Deputy Cowan pointed out, a semi-independent body, is to succeed the basis of its operation must not be either road or rail but a close co-ordination and combination of both road and rail transport, and unless this new company approaches its work with that view it is not going to be a success.  In modern conditions an exclusively rail service cannot succeed.  The citizen wants a service that can carry goods from door to door, from factory to farm or from farm to factory.  The new transport company must be in a position to provide that and it can only provide it by co-ordinating and dovetailing both road and rail transport services.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="372" /> That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that recreation grounds for athletics and the encouragement of physical culture should be provided for youths and adults.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate on this motion was adjourned, I was recommending to the Minister that, particularly in cities and towns, recreation grounds should be made available in all housing schemes so that the children and the youth of the area might have an opportunity of indulging in healthy, physical exercise.  I pointed out that where such recreation grounds had been made available by the Corporation of Dublin in the Marino area, they were acquired during the emergency for other purposes and were not available for the youth of the locality. As a result, we saw from time to time young children brought up in court for playing games on the roads and streets in the area, simply and solely because they were unable to go in on those corporation recreation grounds and play their games there.</P>
      <P>Another great defect in those housing schemes is that no provision is made for halls or gymnasia.  Boxing, particularly, is a very popular recreation in the City of Dublin and we have many very fine boxing clubs endeavouring to carry on the training of young boxers in places that are entirely unsuitable. I would suggest to the Minister that, in addition to the outdoor recreation grounds, there ought to be made available in those housing schemes a hall or gymnasium in which young athletes and young boxers may train.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the part of Dublin with which I, am most familiar&mdash;my own constituency&mdash;I was approached recently by a public-spirited citizen who is anxious to provide facilities for a recreation hall for a number of young boys in his locality.  One was not available and he made the suggestion that he himself, at his own cost, would erect a temporary hall in his own premises, to be utilised for athletic training and the amusement of the young boys of that locality.  The corporation felt that they could not give the facility and the result is that that group of young boys <Col N="373" /> is deprived of facilities that ought to be available for them in the community.</P>
    <P>As I said at the beginning, Deputy Dr. Brennan and Deputy Fitzpatrick are to be congratulated on bringing this motion before the House.  I know it will receive the sympathetic consideration of the Minister but I would impress on him, as Deputy Michael O'Higgins has done, that those recreation facilities, to be provided where new housing schemes are developed, should go ahead at the same time as the house-building, so that when the houses are occupied, the recreation grounds or the local gymnasium or hall will be available for the children and youth of the area. With those words, I recommend this motion to the sympathetic consideration of the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Keyes) Michael Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Keyes)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, let me say that I am in general agreement with the terms of the motion as moved and with the speakers who have supported it.  I have never participated in a more pleasant discussion than that on this motion.  I am particularly keen on the development of athletics and the provision of suitable recreation grounds for the youth of the country.  I am glad to see that that attitude seems to be pretty widespread.  It would naturally be expected amongst Irish people and particularly amongst local authorities and I believe that a good deal is being done in that direction, notwithstanding the fact that we have had some complaints that enough is not being done.</P>
      <P>Very ample authority is already vested in local authorities for the provision of suitable recreation grounds, playing fields for children, and so on, in various localities.  Dublin was stressed here by some of the speakers and I think it only fair to mention some of the things that Dublin has actually been doing. Naturally, the metropolis, with a big aggregation of population, is expected to give the biggest drive.  To my mind, they have been doing pretty well in Dublin and correspondingly well throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Dublin, space for amenities such as we have been discussing has been <Col N="374" /> reserved at Ellenfield and at Crumlin, and lands will shortly be laid out in the Cabra West area to provide for a small park, playground and athletic pitches to serve the large housing schemes in that area.  An open space for a park and provision for athletic grounds is also being provided in the extension of the housing schemes now being undertaken in Crumlin South. Similar facilities are to be provided at Crumlin Road on grounds acquired from the Imperial Tobacco Company and also on sites at Dolphin's Barn. Space for a park or playing fields of about 13½ acres is reserved in the Sarsfield Road housing scheme.  Similar provision is being made at Donnycarney. In connection with St. Anne's at Raheny, very ample provision is being made on that estate for recreation fields.</P>
    <P>That is just a synopsis of what is being done in Dublin.  The development is not confined to Dublin alone and local authorities seem to be very wide awake to the necessity for these amenities.  Sligo deserves honourable mention: they have secured an estate for development as a recreational park and river walks are being provided by the local authorities.  I can say the same for Limerick, where they have provided sports pitches, children's playing fields and swimming baths.</P>
    <P>There is also power in the hands of local authorities to provide recreation halls, such as have been suggested by speakers to this motion.  Power is given to local authorities under various Acts.  In the first instance, they have it under the Town Planning Acts.  The housing authorities also have power to provide recreation and playing fields and open spaces in connection with housing schemes.  Those Acts go back a very long time.  They have been further reinforced by the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act, 1948, which enables local authorities not only to provide these recreation facilities but, in certain instances, let them to suitable committees&mdash;football committees and committees of that kind.  I thoroughly agree that provision ought to be made but I do not think that we ought to create a monopoly of trying, as Deputy Moylan <Col N="375" /> says, to create champions.  The provision of the these recreation facilities for the children by the local authorities ought to stop there, as far as the dictatorial part is concerned, at least. They have an opportunity now to vest these grounds in suitable committees, hurling committees, soccer committees, rugby committees, and things of that kind.  In that way there will be some initiative left to the citizens to develop, the grounds having been provided by the local authority.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins complained that some of the grounds provided at Crumlin and Drimnagh are left in a rather deplorable condition, in so far as they are not developed.  That perhaps is perfectly true.  The main point is that the grounds have been set down into the housing schemes and, as far as housing schemes are concerned, the Department of which I happen to be at the moment in control gives every encouragement to the people who are building the houses and the town planners themselves are very keen about the provision of recreation space.  In fact, as Deputy O'Higgins mentioned, it sometimes comes to a contest as to whether or not we are providing too much in the way of recreation space and too little for housing.  We cannot afford to ignore the fact that the main drive at the moment is housing but I think there still will be sufficient land left to provide the houses we require and also suitable facilities for playgrounds and recreation fields for those who are to be the occupants of the houses.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the period that we have come through, a war emergency period when things were more or less stagnant, we have no reason to be pessimistic about the efforts made by the local authorities to provide the facilities asked for in the motion, with which we all heartily agree.  In the last nine years&mdash;and this is dealing with a period of rather difficult times&mdash;there has been £127,336 utilised by various public authorities for the provision of such amenities. That is not confined to any one particular place.  It includes Cork, Dublin, Limerick, Waterford, Navan, <Col N="376" /> Galway, Wicklow, Kerry, Loughrea, Cobh, Enniscorthy, Templemore.  So, there is widespread recognition by local authorities of their responsibility in this very important matter.</P>
    <P>There is one rather personal instance that I would like to mention. Deputy O'Higgins complained of the lack of facilities for children in slum areas to become proficient in athletics or aquatics.  It is praiseworthy that the Irish Army champion in swimming this year, when being complimented by the Minister for Defence on his prowess in having won the championship, replied to the question as to where he came from that he came from Crumlin and learned to swim in the canal.  The Irish Army swimming champion this year has overcome all the difficulties and disabilities.  I am not putting that forward as a ground for the continuance of these disabilities but as an example of how our Irish boys, given reasonable facilities and opportunities, force themselves ahead and become natural champions without their being shepherded or hall-marked or brought into regular camps.</P>
    <P>I maintain, as I said at the outset, that the best thing is for the local authorities to continue along the lines of providing suitable children's playgrounds and recreation facilities.  I am not so keen about taking over the grounds and controlling the clubs.  Let the clubs be run by committees.</P>
    <P>If there is anything not to my satisfaction, it is the question of athletic sports.  I think Deputy Moylan referred to that also.  That is one point where we ought to make every effort to give every encouragement.  We held a prominent position in the world at one time and I am not so pessimistic to believe that we have lost all that stamina.  Our young athletes would prove themselves if they got an opportunity to develop.  Enough has not been done in that direction.  Clubs that play games and attract gates can do various things that the individual is unable to do.  I would say a word of encouragement to local authorities to provide suitable pitches where sprinters could train.  These individuals are depending on personal initiative and I would like to see them encouraged.  We <Col N="377" /> have reason to regret the departure of the halcyon days when we had our champions winning laurels all over the world in various athletic fields.  While I do not want to take on the responsibility of bringing the athletes to the pink of perfection, if they are provided with the facilities by the local authorities they will do the rest of the job themselves.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan is to be commended for having put down this motion.  I have very little to add to it because I am in whole-hearted agreement with the principle inspiring it.  It is only a matter of degree.  A tempo has been set by the local authorities and there will be continuing attention to the provision of suitable recreation facilities. It is being insisted upon, wherever housing schemes are being erected, that as a <i>sine qua non</i> playing fields and playing grounds must be provided in connection with the schemes.  There is no difficulty in doing that because, as I have said, the people planning the schemes seem to be equally enthusiastic as the Department in this matter. Only yesterday I had the pleasure of opening a housing scheme in Dún Laoghaire, built by the efforts of working men who came together and erected these homes for themselves.  Right across the road, there is a ten-acre field which has been ploughed by the local authority and which will be sodded in the coming season and made available for games.  That is only one of four schemes which provide that facility.  While we may complain that we have not been going fast enough, it is only reasonable and fair to appreciate the efforts which have been made by various local authorities and, in conclusion, I can say that, so far as I and the Department are concerned, Deputies are pushing an open door.  I believe definitely in the development of athletics and in the provision of suitable playgrounds for children and local authorities will get my whole-hearted co-operation in bringing any such schemes to fruition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Brennan and I brought this motion before the House because we wish to see athletics encouraged and to see our young men and women getting an opportunity to <Col N="378" /> take part in healthy outdoor games. It is very encouraging to us to hear speakers on both sides of the House, and, over and above these, the Minister, in wholehearted agreement with the suggestions we put before the House; but I am inclined to think that the speeches made tended to concentrate more on games than on athletics. Deputy Moylan pointed out that games such as hurling and football are fairly well organised.  The clubs are organised and have their own pitches, and, by reason of public support, are able to raise their own finances, but athletics, such as cycling, running, jumping, weight-throwing and general field events, in which we are particularly interested, have not got that public support which enables them to look after themselves financially, and to train and develop Irish athletes so that they will be able to compete successfully at international sports, as Irish athletes of the past were able to compete successfully.  In the past, Irish athletes raised the Irish flag throughout the world and generally put this country on the map, but our young men and women who have taken part in international athletic events in recent years have been handicapped by the fact, that unlike the Governments of other countries, the Government here have not put financial and other facilities at their disposal to enable them to give proper training and instruction to their athletes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are more than anxious that these facilities should be placed at the disposal of Irish athletes.  In addition to the very commendable work being done by local authorities, the Government, we feel, should sponsor the encouragement of athletics in Ireland.  We have all read with pride of the success of the Army jumping team.  The members of that jumping team have not to buy their own horses or provide their own equipment; they are encouraged and, I presume, advertised by the Government.  We feel that athletics, whether running or cycling, should have somewhat similar facilities.  It is deplorable that, with all the facilities which local authorities are providing, such as these parks about which the Minister has told us, if a cycling club, in Dublin want to put on a cycling <Col N="379" /> competition, they have to go out on the public road.  On Sunday mornings, you will find our cyclists on the side of the road at Cabra arranging for the start of a cycling tournament, and you will also find our runners practising on the public road.  They are seemingly not breaking the law, as is the case when boys play hurling and kick football on the streets.</P>
    <P>I feel that some more definite lead and encouragement will have to be given and I suggest that the Minister might consider the advisability of setting up a board or committee, composed of men with long experience of athletics in Ireland, to make recommendations as to the lines along which athletics might best be encouraged. This board could even make recommendations to local authorities and point out that these fields or parks which are provided in the different areas should be under some proper control.  I know that there is a great lack in this respect in West Cabra and especially in that area where, I am glad to hear from the Minister, a park is about to be provided.  There are thousands of young people living there and the only place they have for playing is the street.  There is a field there which was used for this purpose during the past few years, but this field has now been taken over for building, and they have to go back to the streets, where they are a danger to themselves and to passing traffic.  It is encouraging to hear that some move is being made to take them off the streets.</P>
    <P>During the past few years local committees took control of them and organised what Deputy M. O'Higgins has referred to as &ldquo;street leagues&rdquo;.  In some cases, they had to travel from the north side over to Drimnagh and Crumlin, and I am sorry that the Minister did not give us some explanation of why the ground was locked against the people who went there to play.  It was a public ground that Deputy O'Higgins complained about and we should have some explanation.  In my younger days and even recently, I was connected with an athletic club and I visited a number of these places.  I thought it deplorable that they should <Col N="380" /> have to put up with the old shacks provided as dressing rooms.  They were no credit to the city of Dublin.  It should be within the jurisdiction of the corporation, or whatever body is responsible, to appoint stewards to see that these dressing rooms, when built, would be properly controlled and that if these dressing rooms are provided in these parks, they will be properly equipped.</P>
    <P>It would not cost very much to provide facilities for a wash-up and shower.  If boys are to go out there to take part in a hurling or a football game, it is injurious to their health that they should have to dress after these games without having the opportunity of a wash-up or shower.  In the case of the community with which I have been associated for over a quarter of a century, the shop assistants of Dublin, I know from experience that after a match we often had to get out of our togs and into our ordinary clothes and go back to work for a couple of hours without having a shower or wash-up, which, to say the least of it, was not in any way helpful in so far as our health was concerned. I am not satisfied that everything that could or should be done is being done by the local authorities.  I believe that some more central direction is necessary.</P>
    <P>With regard to what the Minister has said about boys learning to swim in the canals, I shudder to think that our youth should be encouraged to swim in our canals in the hope that, by doing so, they may some day become champions. The whole matter will have to be considered on a higher plane.  In this connection, I might refer to the number of drowning tragedies that take place in our canals during the summer season.  These are matters which should be considered not alone by the local authorities but by the Government, because these places are not alone dangerous but absolute death-traps.  If we are to be successful in the athletic field and if we are to regain at any time in the near future the position our athletes held 50 years ago, we shall have to give greater encouragement to our youth who take part in field and track events.  We produced <Col N="381" /> here some great cyclists who, however, were never able to compete successfully at international meetings, not because they were not as good as the other competitors, but because they had not had the facilities for training.  By reason of lack of properly laid out tracks, they were on completely foreign grounds when they completed at these meetings, but, in justice to those boys who have travelled to the Continent and to England, we must admit that in the circumstances they did remarkably well and were a credit to themselves and to the country.  A lot more, however, could be done if there was some general direction and help.  When other countries can give financial assistance in connection with these track events, it is not fair that we should lag behind or leave it all to the local authorities, without any central direction.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said that, as well as outdoor games, indoor games should get a certain amount of attention. Amateur boxing clubs have done remarkably well in this city for a number of years past.  There again these clubs have to rely on subscriptions they get from their own members who, for the most part, have to make a big sacrifice to provide funds out of their slender financial resources.  There is also a very promising amateur wrestling club in the city.  I understand that the European amateur wrestling champion is a native of Dublin but very few people knew that there was such an organisation in the country at all.</P>
    <P>The help which one Department, under Government control, gave to these amateur wrestlers was, for some unknown reason, to compel them to pay entertainment tax on a function which they held here.  I feel that in justice to the Minister responsible and possibly to the Department concerned, I should say that that was an oversight but it shows the interest we have been taking in athletics when one prominent amateur association was overlooked and through some slip of the pen had to pay entertainment tax on this function.  I think that is a shame and it certainly should be set right in <Col N="382" /> the future.  I do not wish to delay the House too long on this subject.  There is no need to repeat oneself, but I do respectfully suggest to the Minister that he might accept the suggestion to consider the appointment of a committee consisting of people who understand athletics to make recommendations to him as to the lines on which athletics should be developed and controlled in this country.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That, having regard to the widespread damage caused to holdings adjoining the rivers Feale and Gale in North Kerry, due to breaches in the embankments of those rivers, caused by recent floods, which have rendered large tracts of land practically useless, Dáil Éireann is of opinion that the Government should regard this matter as one of urgent public importance and take appropriate action without delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is now about 20 months since this motion first appeared on the Private Deputy's Business sheet.  It deals with a problem that affects my constituency very much, the problem of flooding as a result of breaches in <Col N="383" /> river embankments, especially in the case of the two rivers mentioned.  I put down the motion for the purpose of ascertaining from the Government what their policy is, if any, towards this very serious problems.  I should point out to the House that over a number of years a considerable amount of damage has been caused by floods in that part of the country, because of these breaches in the river embankments.  Much damage has been occasioned to people's property and unfortunately in places along these rivers the breaches are so great as to make it impossible for the riparian owners to repair them.  They cannot be repaired, in my opinion, without some State assistance.</P>
    <P>Of course I know very well that what is true of these rivers is true also of other rivers in the country. Therefore it is a national problem that will have to be tackled by the Government.  The sooner it is tackled, the less the expenditure will be in carrying out the necessary repairs.  I have known myself of cases in other parts of the country where breaches occurred in river embankments and if these breaches had been attended to in time, a couple of hundred pounds would have been sufficient to carry out the necessary repairs but because they were not tackled in time, it transpired afterwards that it cost as many thousand pounds to carry out the required repairs.</P>
    <P>There are several breaches along the rivers Feale and Gale in North Kerry. One is a tributary of the other.  I am trying to ascertain from the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary if they have studied this problem in all its aspects.  I know very well that sometimes when applications is made to the Land Commission for financial help to carry out such repairs the answer almost invariably is that they have no responsibility whatsoever in the matter.  They also point to the fact that there is a trust fund from which financial assistance can be got for the carrying out of this work.</P>
    <P>As regards the non-responsibility of the Land Commission, in my opinion that is a false position for the Land <Col N="384" /> Commission to take up, because it should be the concern of the Land Commission to preserve the land in relation to which they expect to collect land annuities year after year.  I submit that if a person's land is sometimes covered with water for a good portion of the year and consequently rendered partially useless, it is wrong to expect the sufferers to keep on paying their annuities to the Land Commission if the Land Commission does not come to their rescue in some way. Therefore, I hold that it should be the responsibility of the Land Commission to repair these embankments and, if they were once repaired, I think it would be quite an easy matter for the land owners to maintain them afterwards.</P>
    <P>As to the trust fund that they refer to when application is made to them for financial assistance, it does not amount to much.  The annual interest from it usually does not exceed a couple of hundred pounds. Therefore it is useless and futile to refer to this trust fund in connection with the repair of river embankments.</P>
    <P>As to the extent of the damage which takes place as a result of the flooding of these rivers, I can recall more than one occasion when people living along these rivers had to leave their homes because of the intense flooding.  The last time that flooding occurred along the River Feale the case was so serious that people had to be taken from their homes and provided with accommodation in the district hospital.  I am trying to point out to the House the seriousness of this whole problem.  I do not know how many other rural Deputies have a similar problem in their constituency.  If they have, I am sure they will have something to say on this motion.  At any rate, I have opened the debate in connection with these two rivers in North Kerry and I hope that as a result the whole problem of repairing river embankments will be tackled by the responsible Minister.  Recently we had another motion of this nature, but the terms of that motion were confined to sea embankments.  No doubt that problem is also a very important one, especially in parts of County Kerry. But if that problem is important, this <Col N="385" /> problem of repairing the river embankments is just as important.</P>
    <P>I should like to know from the Parliamentary Secretary what will be the attitude of the present Government in relation to this problem.  I must admit that certain repairs have been carried out by the Land Commission over a number of years, but they did the work rather grudgingly because they said they did not accept responsibility for it. The amount of work they have carried out on these river embankments, however, has not been at all sufficient. Therefore I ask the House to give reconsideration to this matter, not alone from the point of view of its local aspect but also from the general national point of view.  The land of the country, as I said, is very precious. In this particular case it happens that the land is good, while in many other parts of Kerry the land is bad.  Here, where you have the good land adjoining these rivers, it is a pity to see people's property destroyed by flooding from these rivers as a result of the breaches which have occurred in the embankments.  I therefore commend the motion to the House.</P>

      <P>I second the motion and join with Deputy Kissane in appealing to the Government to carry out a drainage scheme for the Rivers Feale and Gale.  I am aware that the landowners whose land adjoins these rivers have suffered severely through recent flooding.  Therefore I appeal to the Government to treat this matter as urgent and see that a drainage scheme is carried out in that district in the very near future.</P>

      <P>This motion has been on the Order Paper for 20 months and therefore this trouble has not arisen during the present Government's term of office.  My constituency is also affected by flooding, one portion of it very much so.  There are breaches in the embankments on the River Suir and quite an amount of good land has been subject to flooding for years.  As Deputy Kissane pointed out, each year the flooding is spreading.  The county council are losing a large amount of rates every year as they have had to remit rates on these flooded lands, <Col N="386" /> which are soured and are no use for grazing.</P>

When the Land Commission step in, as they did under the 1923 Act, and compel tenants to purchase their land and fix the price, the responsibility is on the Land Commission to see that out of that purchase price sufficient money is held over to maintain these embankments.  The Land Commission are responsible to the State for seeing that the money that was advanced was not advanced in vain, and that there is a stake in the land for which the money was advanced.</P>

      <P>The Government have a responsibility to see, in respect of the money advanced by its predecessors, that the land from which that money is to be collected is not going to be allowed to deteriorate to such an extent that the tenants of it will no longer be able to pay their annuities.  If that were to occur the State would be at a loss.  If the Government, in this case, did not withhold sufficient money to build those embankments and keep them in proper order, then I submit the Government is responsible, and will have to make good whatever loss occurs.</P>
      <P>I suggest that what is proposed in the motion could be covered under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  Under that Act the local authority&mdash;the Kerry County Council in this case&mdash;has the power to prepare a scheme for any land that has deteriorated by flooding. May I quote for the House subsections (3) and (4) of Section 2 of that Act:</P>
      <P>(3)  Where a local authority to whom this section applies are of opinion that&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  any land in their functional area, not being land owned by them, or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  any permanent construction in their functional area, not being a permanent construction which was constructed by them or which <Col N="388" /> they are required by law to maintain,</P>
    <P>has sustained or is likely to sustain damage from flooding, landslide, subsidence or other similar occurrence and that it is in the public interest to afford relief or protection from the damage, the local authority may execute such works as they consider reasonable for the purpose of affording such relief or protection.</P>
    <P>(4)  The works referred to in subsections (2) and (3) of this section shall include, in particular&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the making of drains,</P>
    <P>(b)  the removal of substances or things causing obstructions in watercourses,</P>
    <P>(c)  the widening or deepening of watercourses,</P>
    <P>(d)  the making or repairing of walls or embankments.</P>
    <P>I want to draw the attention of Deputy Kissane and of the House to the fact that the work proposed here could be done by the county council and that if they do it they are entitled to receive under this Act 100 per cent. grant from the Government.</P>

      <P>You do not realise yet all that you are being caught for.  We realised it in Cork and we caught you for a fair bit.  I hope that others will catch you in the same way.  That is the position that I find under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  I suggest again that this matter could easily be covered under that Act if proposals were put in by the Kerry County Council.  I suggest that Deputy Kissane and Deputy McEllistrim should get the county council to put in proposals in connection with these embankments. I did so in my constituency and got a job done there.  Even though these rivers have done no damage to a road or to other portions of county council property, this particular work could, in my opinion, be done under the Local Authorities (Works) Act if proposals were put forward by the county council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="389" /> In my opinion, any land that has deteriorated by flooding can be done under this Act because it is in the public interest to do so.  It is in the public interest to see that land is kept in such a condition that the rates can be paid out of it.  The House is aware that if land is rendered useless by flooding an occupier can get out of paying rates on it.  Therefore, I think the county council would be entitled to go in and carry out repairs on a stream or a river that was causing damage to land.  In this particular case they could build embankments for the purpose of protecting the adjoining land.  I make that suggestion to my two colleagues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>We in Kerry can look after our own affairs very well and we are very anxious that Deputy Corry would stop poaching.  I am quite sure he is not conversant with our problems in Kerry, particularly as regards drainage. We all know that as regards repairs to embankments, such as are mentioned in the motion, they should not be tackled in 1949 or 1950; they should have been tackled years ago. The people of my constituency who are affected severely by the flooding caused through breaches in these embankments have not been so affected for only the past 12 months; they have been affected since I was a very small boy, around 30 years ago.  I believe I am the only Deputy in this House who has voiced the grievances of those people as regards flooding in the various districts.</P>
      <P>The people of North Kerry have been affected by the flooding of the Feale and Gale, but they are also very concerned about the complete drainage of the Brick and Cashen rivers.  We all know about the Arterial Drainage Act that was passed in 1945.  Deputy Kissane knows thoroughly well that before that law was passed he moved into the North Kerry constituency and addressed a big Fianna Fáil gathering and he told the people there that the passing of that Act would bring great benefits on them and great blessings. These people are still waiting for those blessings and benefits and they want these drainage schemes carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="390" /> Repairs of breaches in embankments will bring little relief to the landowners of North Kerry.  They want the big problem tackled.  They want the Board of Works to get down to realities and to tackle the big drainage scheme for which they have been waiting so many years.  It is all right to come in here 16 or 17 years after being a member of a Government and then try to press the present Government, telling them what they should do.  The farmers of my constituency, especially in North Kerry, have received so many promises over the last 16 years that they are now of the one opinion; they will not believe that the Brick and Cashen will ever be drained until they see the machines starting to work there.</P>
    <P>I believe a motion of this kind about repairing breaches in the embankments will do very little to bring relief, so far as Kerry is concerned.  I would ask Deputy Corry to stay in Cork.  We all know that between Cork and Waterford they have enough controversy as regards the building of a bridge there. Deputy Corry should look after his own constituency.  We in Kerry are fairly well able to look after our own districts. If Deputy Corry was really conversant with the Brick and Cashen and the Feale and the Gale, he would not make such statements as he made to-night.  He does not know the first thing about it.</P>
    <P>I will make one appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary and I make it on behalf of the people in the North Kerry portion of my constituency.  They are not waiting so very anxiously for what is in this motion but they are waiting for the day when he will come down there and put the machinery in motion to drain the Brick and Cashen.  When he does that I can say that he will get a big clap on the back from the people of North Kerry.</P>

      <P>It was very laughable listening to Deputy Corry speaking about the Local Authorities (Works) Act, 1949.  The voices of Fianna Fáil Deputies in opposition to that Bill when it was going through the House are still ringing in our ears.  The Lord have mercy on the late Minister, Tadhg <Col N="391" /> Murphy, who brought it in here.  We all know the terrible abuse he got.  We were listening to that abuse for many days because he brought in that very valuable Act that Deputy Corry now refers to as a great instrument and a great necessity.  He should throw his mind back a little and recall the action of his Party in holding us up for quite a long period endeavouring to prevent that Act going through.</P>

      <P>I have no doubt Deputy Kissane was very sincere in his remarks and he knows the great necessity for that measure.  I hope that in the near future we will be able to look after the people in that area. The Local Authorities (Works) Act would not suit at all in this case&mdash;this is for Deputy Corry's information&mdash;for the simple reason that this would be too large a scheme for it to cope with. We have decided that there is only one way in which embankments can be repaired and that is under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945.  I fully agree with Deputy Spring that that alone is the only solution.  We have no statutory responsibility for the repair or the maintenance of those embankments at the present time, but we intend in the near future to be in there.  As a matter of fact, I expect in this coming year to have a sum of money in the <Col N="392" /> Estimates for the starting of that very necessary work.  I want to point out to the House that the Feale, Brick and Cashin rivers constitute a huge scheme.  The catchment area extends from Kerry into Limerick and Cork. It comprises roughly 445 square miles. In the course of the engineering survey about 140 miles of watercourses and 80 miles of embankments were examined. Some 30,000 acres of land were valued.</P>
      <P>I know quite well that Deputy Kissane, Deputy Spring and the other Kerry representatives, as well as the people living in that county, are saying&mdash;as they are saying in other counties: &ldquo;Your engineers are there a very long time; the scheme is very slow.&rdquo;  But one must appreciate that it is a huge undertaking.  The outfall in the Feale area is one of our greatest headaches.  We shall have to use sea dredgers in a large portion of that outfall. We realise that the embankments have broken down.  We know that they will have to be rebuilt.  We hope in the next year to start work there under the 1945 Arterial Drainage Act.  Nearly all of the present embankments are too low.  Many of them will have to be removed; many will have to be extended further back. In portion of the outfall of that river we shall have to cut a channel 100 yards wide and 10 feet deep.</P>
      <P>Now it is no use spurring a willing horse.  Deputies know the position in which we find ourselves in regard to drainage.  We hope to start work in that area during the coming year. The embankments will naturally come under the scheme.  To deal with the position in any other way, other than by the Arterial Drainage Act of 1945, would be nonsense, as Deputy Spring has pointed out.  I am sure Deputy Kissane and the other Deputies interested in this matter realise that. When one is dealing with 80 miles of embankments any kind of patchwork would be a waste of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was really unnecessary to bring in this motion.  As far as the Government is concerned it is our job to push the work forward as quickly as we can.  At one time it was my earnest desire to see three of these schemes going on at <Col N="393" /> the same time.  I looked forward to that.  I believe we may be able to approach that in the coming year.  I believe we shall succeed in having the three major catchment areas dealt with simultaneously.  We are working on the Brosna.  I want to see the scheme in Louth and on the Feale under way as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House that the scheme has been prepared but it must be remembered that the sea comes up there, and that is causing us some difficulty. There are some little technical difficulties at the moment as regards the outfall.  But those problems are having our earnest attention.  We expect to overcome our troubles there. In the coming financial year I expect to have a sum of money which will enable us to drain the Brick, Cashin and Feale catchment areas and build the necessary embankments.  In that way, we hope to obviate the necessity for the outcry that has taken place in the past.  We realise that this work is vitally important to the people in Kerry, just as important as similar work is to the people in other counties where drainage is also necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement made by the Parliamentary Secretary is very satisfactory.  If the bringing in of this motion has done nothing else, except extract that statement from the Parliamentary Secretary with regard to the drainage problem along these rivers, I think it has served a very useful purpose. I agree that the drainage of the Brick and Cashin rivers is of paramount importance.  It has been referred to here several times in the past. At the same time we have to take into consideration the fact that, while the scheme for the Brick and Cashin is being prepared, certain embankments up along the Feale and Gale are being breached and the breaches are getting wider.  It was because of that Deputy McEllistrim and I decided to put this motion down.  A certain amount of work was carried out prior to this. Repairs were made a couple of years ago, but they were not sufficient.  They were satisfactory as far as the particular locality they served was concerned. My chief object in putting down this motion was to direct the attention of <Col N="394" /> the Minister for Lands to the urgent necessity for ensuring that these breaches would be tackled at some stage.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Parliamentary Secretary, that the Brick and Cashin drainage scheme will be a very big undertaking.  Work done on the rivers I have mentioned would bring relief to a number of farmers living alongside these rivers.  It would save thousands of acres of good land.  In view of the Parliamentary Secretary's statement and his willingness to keep this matter under observation and to pursue it during the coming financial year by making provision in the Estimates for it, I have no intention of pressing the motion further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the following motion, which stands in my name and in the name of Deputy Patrick O'Reilly:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That, in order to secure a more equitable system of financing local administration and to promote increased employment and production, Dáil Éireann is of opinion that agricultural land should be completely derated and, furthermore, that rates on houses and other property should be stabilised at a moderate and reasonable level.</P>
      <P>There are certain amendments to this motion which, I assume, will also be moved by those who have tabled them, but, as far as the mover and seconder of the main motion are concerned, we believe that the proposal which we are laying before the House is one that is long overdue.  In 1928, rates on agricultural land were completely abolished in Great Britain and also in that portion of our country over which the British Government exercise authority. During the 21 years that have elapsed since 1928 this question of derating of agricultural land has been a very important issue in rural Ireland, and, not only that, but it has been an important issue in Party warfare in this State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every Party that was in opposition up to the time of the last election, <Col N="395" /> since 1928, has, from time to time, guaranteed to derate agricultural land. Governments, however, or Parties when they become the Government of the country, seem to have some reluctance in carrying those pledges into effect.  However, I may say that, so far as I am concerned, I have been absolutely consistent in this matter, inasmuch as in every Dáil in which I was a member, since 1938, I have brought forward a motion similar to this.  It has always been defeated, but I am hopeful now that on this occasion it will meet with a favourable reception in this House.</P>
    <P>The last occasion on which a motion similar to this motion was before the House was in February, 1946.  At that time, the Fianna Fáil Party, who are now in opposition, had complete control of the Government and had a majority in this House.  Most of the other Parties that are now supporting the Government supported this motion in 1946, and I cannot help feeling that they will continue to do so.  I am glad that Deputy Donnellan is in the House because both he and I were members of the same Party at the time a motion similar to this motion was introduced in 1946 and it was promoted by that Party and had the support of other Parties which are now supporting the Government.</P>
    <P>I do not think that any Party in this House, whether on the Government side or on the opposition side, has any need to be apologetic about supporting a motion of this nature.  The fact that six counties of this nation enjoy complete exemption from rates on agricultural land ought to be an impelling motive why we should consider this matter seriously.  Does anyone seriously think that the small struggling farmers of the six excluded counties will be as enthusiastic as they should be about national unity when they know that in the Republic of Ireland we still have the rate collector collecting rates upon agricultural land &mdash;regardless of how well that land may be worked, of how industrious its owner may be, or of how much employment he is giving on his holding?  The fact that derating was introduced in Great Britain in 1928 is one that should <Col N="396" /> set people, generally, thinking about the incidence of rates upon agriculture and why the British Government decided to make this concession to the farming community.  Surely they must have had some impelling motive for doing so.  A moment's consideration will show they had an impelling motive.  They realised that the land was the nation's most important asset and that the imposition of a direct tax on land, regardless of how well worked or of how industrious its owner might be, was just the same as imposing a form of protection in favour of the foreigner as against the home producer.</P>
    <P>Everybody must acknowledge that it is the duty of a Government to be zealous in promoting the interests of its own citizens and particularly in helping its own home producers.  Yet, this direct levy on land has always been a burden which farmers have found it very difficult to bear in times of agricultural depression and which, unfortunately, tends to increase out of all proportion when there is some little improvement in agricultural conditions. Nobody will deny that there is an improvement in agricultural conditions today as compared, say, with 1935 or 1936.  However, that improvement has not been in any way proportionate to the increase in the burdens which have been placed upon agriculture.  We all know the extent to which farmers' costs have increased&mdash;and rates constitute a very substantial portion of the farmer's overhead charges.  They constitute a charge which has to be met, regardless of whether the year is good or bad, of whether the farmer's cattle thrive or of whether they are afflicted with all those diseases and parasites which the Minister for Agriculture frequently warns us against.  Rates are also a burden that have to be met whether conditions are favourable or otherwise to the farmer.  They are a burden which are levied on the farmer irrespective of what his financial position may be.  Unlike income-tax, no attempt is made to grade rates in proportion to income.  The farmer who may be struggling to maintain a family on a miserable piece of poor land has to meet his burden just the same as if he were prosperous and had good land.</P>
    <P>While this motion has lain very <Col N="397" /> quietly on the Order Paper for the past 18 months, and while its being taken to-day has come as a great surprise to me because I had begun to feel that it would never be reached, I must say that it has come at an opportune time because, throughout the length and breadth of this State, there is a growing <Col N="398" /> feeling that something must be done to relieve the burden of rates.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 3 o'clock on Thursday, 3rd November, 1949.</P>
