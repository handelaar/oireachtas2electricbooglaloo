      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated in reply to a question addressed to me by Deputy P.J. Maguire in this House on Wednesday last, the most effective action we can take is to redouble our efforts to mobilise all the moral energies of the Irish people, at home and abroad, towards bringing Partition to an end, and I do not think I can usefully add anything to that statement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not consider that something more than this mobilisation of opinion is necessary and that some practical steps by the Government are required to deal with this problem?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I entirely agree with the Deputy that practical steps are certainly necessary; and the practical steps are, I believe, being undertaken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the Deputy's question, let me say that there was no scheme in existence when I was appointed to the Department of Social Welfare and anybody who states the contrary is stating something which he knows to be untrue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the Dr. Dignan scheme about which you told us so often when you were in opposition?</P>

      <P>Rule 92 (3) enables teachers of national schools to absent themselves from school under certain conditions to attend meetings of committees of which they are members and which are established under county, borough or urban councils.  The committees mentioned in the rule are scholarship committees, vocational education committees, library committees and school medical service committees, all of which are concerned with issues of an educational nature.  In view of this arrangement, it is not apparent that there is a necessity for a revision of the terms of the existing Rule 92 (2) the purpose of which is to ensure that school work will not be unnecessarily interrupted by the absence of teachers who are members of county councils or other statutory local bodies.</P>

In view of the fact that these five county councillors and the people they represent will be disfranchised&mdash;it is a very important meeting, and I am sure the same thing is happening in other local bodies&mdash;would the Parliamentary Secretary ask the Minister for Education to have this rule revised, so that teachers who are members of county councils or other local bodies will be able to attend these statutory meetings without loss of salary or pension rights?</P>

      <P>The numbers of (a) men and (b) women employed on the 30th June, 1948, as untrained assistant primary teachers were 34 and 484 respectively.  Under existing regulations, untrained lay persons cannot be permanently appointed as assistant teachers, but it becomes necessary from time to time to recognise untrained lay teachers as principal teachers of small schools in very remote areas.  The question of discontinuing the appointment of untrained persons as junior assistant mistresses in charge of the junior pupils in the smaller schools, and the introduction of a new class of trained teacher to be known as junior assistant teacher for these classes, is at present under consideration in my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that it is the policy of my Department that, as <Col N="323" /> far as circumstances permit, all teachers permanently appointed in national schools shall be trained.</P>
    <P>(ii) With regard to the last part of the Deputy's question, as to whether I will arrange that all existing untrained assistants and junior mistresses with ten or more years' services will be placed on the trained teachers' scale, this proposal would raise important issues of policy and finance with which I am not at present in a position to deal.  The whole question of the salaries of national teachers is at present the subject of examination by the representative committee which I set up recently and I would not, therefore, think this a suitable time to consider a matter involving such a major departure from long-standing policy.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Minister for External Affairs (Mr. MacBride) Seán MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. MacBride)</NameTxt>
      <P>Exchanges of views have taken place between the Government of the United States and the Government of Ireland on the question of Ireland's participation in the proposed Atlantic Pact.  I took advantage of these exchanges of views to make clear the attitude of this Government on the matter and I have kept other Governments <Col N="324" /> concerned in the pact informed of our views.</P>
      <P>As I explained in the course of these exchanges, Ireland, as an essentially democratic and freedom-loving country, is anxious to play her full part in protecting and preserving Christian civilisation and the democratic way of life.  With the general aim of the proposed Atlantic Pact in this regard, therefore, we are in agreement.  In the matter of military measures, however, we are faced with an insuperable difficulty, from the strategic and political points of view, by reason of the fact that six of our north-eastern counties are occupied by British forces against the will of the overwhelming majority of the Irish people.  Partition is naturally and bitterly resented by the people of this country as a violation of Ireland's territorial integrity and as a denial in her case of the elementary democratic right of national selfdetermination. As long as Partition lasts, any military alliance or commitment involving joint military action with the State responsible for Partition must be quite out of the question so far as Ireland is concerned.  Any such commitment, if undertaken, would involve the prospect of civil conflict in this country in the event of a crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any such alliance or commitment is equally out of the question from the strategic point of view.  The defence of a small island such as Ireland can be undertaken effectively only by a single authority having at its back the firm support of a decisive majority of the population of the whole country. Furthermore, it would obviously be necessary, from the strategic point of view, that the productive capacity of the country as a whole should be integrated under a democratically-elected central authority; and this is impossible so long as Partition lasts because the six north-eastern counties are the principal industrial area of the country. These practical difficulties are aggravated by the state of feeling naturally created by the undemocratic practices used to maintain and ensure the continuance of the partition of our country.  Our attitude is that neither this Government nor, we believe, any other Irish Government could expect <Col N="325" /> to find the necessary support for a policy involving joint military commitments with the power that continues to lend its sanction, tacit or active, to evils of the very kind which it is the object of the proposed pact to oppose and prevent.</P>
    <P>In explaining our attitude, I made it quite clear that this Government is not actuated by feelings of hostility towards Britian; on the contrary, we are anxious to develop and strengthen our relations with Britain, and there are so many factors and interests making for good neighbourly relations between the two countries that it is inconceivable that, once Partition were removed and once the geographical, ideological and other forces making for friendship between the two countries were given full play, Ireland should ever constitute a source of danger or embarrassment to Britain in time of war.  Any detached or impartial survey of the strategic and political considerations involved must lead to the conclusion that a friendly and united Ireland on Britain's western approaches is in the interest, not merely of Britain or of Ireland, but of all the countries concerned with the security of the Atlantic area.  Every consideration of constructive statesmanship points to the necessity of ending, as soon as possible and once and for all, the centuries-old conflict between our two countries.</P>
    <P>I have strongly urged that it is better to face this question now as a matter of urgency rather than to allow a situation to develop wherein a satisfactory solution might be much more difficult to bring about.  I also indicated that, inasmuch as the solution of the Partition problem would not merely end an undemocratic and dangerous situation, but would also make a vital contribution towards strengthening the internal harmony and cohesion of the North Atlantic community, the matter was one which should receive the active consideration of all the Governments interested in the co-operation of the nations concerned.</P>
    <P>That, briefly, is the attitude of the Government on the question of Ireland's participation in the proposed <Col N="326" /> Atlantic Pact, and, as I have said, I have taken steps to make our position clear to the Governments of all the States immediately concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there is grave danger that our failure to co-operate with the other North Atlantic nations may definitely identify our country with the Com-munist-controlled countries?  That is an alignment which would be disastrous for our nation's honour and interest.  Furthermore, is the Minister aware that the proposed national reunion can be more effectively advanced from inside rather than from outside the North Atlantic or antiCommunist alliance?</P>

      <P>Public telephones will be installed at Kildimo, County Limerick; Ballingrane, County Limerick; Croagh, County Limerick; Cromane, County Kerry; Lissatava, County Mayo; and Rathdangan, County Wicklow, as part of the scheme to provide such facilities to all post offices.  Work on the scheme, however, has had to be suspended temporarily in favour of more urgent work&mdash;particularly the provision of telephones for waiting applicants&mdash; and, accordingly, it is not possible to say at present when the installations will be carried out at the offices mentioned.</P>

      <P>The good yield of potatoes in 1948 has been an embarrassment only to those farmers who have been unable to make use of their surplus for stock feeding or those who habitually grow for sale, and have not yet been able to find a buyer. I have steadily advised farmers to feed potatoes to stock as the most satisfactory means of disposing of them, especially by making potato ensilage for pig feeding, as has been done in South Wexford and elsewhere.  I have already procured a market for 50,000 tons of ware potatoes of the 1948 crop. These have been bought and are being paid for as rapidly as they can be taken up.  They are being moved at a rate of about 2,500 tons per week, but when shipments are expedited in March and April this rate of disposal will be increased, and I expect that most of the surplus will be eventually cleared satisfactorily.</P>
      <P>I have advised farmers to store their potatoes carefully until they can dispose of them, and I regret to observe that a colleague of the Deputy has seen fit to make a speech urging farmers to sell their potatoes immediately.  This advice if acted upon can have no other effect than to depress prices.</P>

    <P>The sanction of the Ministers for Agriculture and Finance was obtained for the sale of the Newmarket Creamery Group including premises, plant, milk supply, motor vehicles, etc., to the Newmarket Co-operative Creameries, Ltd. (Items Nos. 1 and 2).</P>
    <P>Items Nos. 3, 11, 12 and 15 represent small sales or lettings which arose in the ordinary course of business in respect of which specific sanction from the Minister for Agriculture or the Minister for Finance was not necessary.</P>
    <P>The remaining sales (Items Nos. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13 and 14) were part of the general reorganisation of the creamery industry in the area in which the Irish Butter and Exporters' Association, Ltd., formerly operated, some of the properties being sold as going concerns and some as redundant properties.  This reorganisation was undertaken by the Company at the direction of the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <P>The Company did not convey to the public, by notice in the press or otherwise, the intention to sell or let these properties as the transactions were not of general public interest.  In each case the Company was in touch with prospective purchasers or tenants and the Company is satisfied that the maximum amount possible was realised.</P>
    <P>All the transactions set out above were completed by private treaty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that during the past ten years some fishing boats have been lost for lack of shelter at their moorings off Portaleen.  The engineering report furnished to me indicates that the provision there of adequate shelter for the local fishing fleet would entail expenditure of the order of £150,000; and that the best that could be done within a practicable figure of outlay would be the improvement of the existing mooring arrangements under the lee of Mullandoo Rock together with an extension of the spending beach adjoining the present pier and the provision of better facilities for the slipping of boats.  In really bad weather conditions there would seem to be no alternative to the Portaleen fishermen availing themselves of the relatively near Greencastle Harbour as a place of shelter or refuge.  I propose to have the whole matter discussed with the Donegal County Council on this basis.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to answer Questions Nos. 74, 75 and 76 together. The hours of duty of park constables, gatekeepers and relief gatekeepers at the Phoenix Park are approximately as stated in the questions, save that the constables are not, as stated, frequently called on to do extra duty without compensation.  A special and detailed examination has been made of the question of the hours of duty and in this connection the nature of the duties themselves is an important factor.  The duties of the constables <Col N="355" /> and gatekeepers are of a patrol or watching character, necessarily involving unusual hours which are governed by the hours of opening and closing of the park.  The duties of both classes are comparatively light and involve practically no physical labour or exertion.  The gates which the resident gatekeepers have to attend are all adjacent to their lodges.  The conditions of employment of these men as regards hours of duty are on the basis generally accepted for employment of the character in question and it is not practicable to make any concession as regards the hours.</P>

      <P>This matter, of course, is not on the Order Paper, but I can indicate to Deputies the general view of the Government.  It is not proposed to hold or to countenance the holding of a judicial inquiry.  There is a very fundamental principle involved in that matter.  While both my colleagues and myself take a very strong view on that subject and while we have no reason to believe that the matters referred to in the report call for any inquiry, nevertheless if Deputies opposite feel disposed to put down a motion for the appointment of a Select Committee of the House to inquire into these alleged charges, that will not be opposed.  But, in accepting the motion, it must be clearly understood that there is no reflection on my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture.</P>

You will recollect that when these statements were made by the Minister for Agriculture in December last I asked your permission to move the adjournment of the House for the purpose of discussing that.  You informed the House and me that you were bringing these statements to the attention of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  That you have done and the Committee has made its report.  That report, however, is not being acted upon by the Government and, presumably, it is now a matter for you, Sir, to say what action you think is proper for the protection of the rights of the individual Deputy concerned.</P>

      <P>Nevertheless I am anxious to get some information as to the attitude of the Chair in the matter. The Chair is regarded as the protector of Deputies, and in this matter the Chair took the proper action by bringing the incident to the attention of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. The Committee has considered it, and made a recommendation to the Dáil.  The Government, however, is refusing to give the Dáil an opportunity of carrying it into effect.  In the circumstances, it appears to me that the matter requires the reconsideration of the Chair.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I might crave your indulgence, Sir, to intervene at this stage.  The principle involved in this matter is one affecting the privileges of each Deputy.  It is a constitutional privilege.  The principle involved is that no Deputy is responsible for anything he says or does in this House to any person or body other than this House.  That is the principle which we stand.  That is the principle which we believe is embodied in Article 15, Clause 13, of the Constitution.  We are standing on the Constitution and on the rights and privileges of this House. It is very fundamental for us, and I believe for every Deputy, that we should stand on that.  Taking our stand on that, and giving effect to it, we have intimated to you and to Deputies that we will not oppose the appointment of a Select Committee of this House, that being the appropriate body in our view, in accordance with the Constitution, to deal with a matter of that kind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. T. Walsh Mr. T. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That, viewing with alarm the serious reactions which the decision of the Minister for Local Government in relation to road grants for the coming financial year will have on the finances of the local authorities and on employment, Dáil Éireann is of opinion that the decision should be reviewed, so that the grants may be provided on the same basis as in the years 1947-48 and 1948-49.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In moving this motion I am merely putting the views of every public representative in the country before the House.  During the past fortnight or three weeks there have been meetings of county councils in every county in the State for the purpose of striking a rate for the coming year, and in no case have these councils agreed to strike the roads rate, due to the fact that the grants which were made available to the counties during <Col N="367" /> 1947 and 1948 have this year been drastically reduced.  Irrespective of how those councils throughout the country are composed with regard to politics and otherwise, we have had the same unanimous desire to have this question reviewed, and I understand that during the past couple of weeks the Minister for Local Government has been asked to meet deputations almost from every county.  The attitude of the Minister regarding those grants has been the cause of that.  These grants were given by the Fianna Fáil Government for the purpose of restoring the condition of the roads to their pre-war level.  As we all know, during the emergency period, due to the diversion of traffic from the railways, turf haulage and the withdrawal of men from road works, our roads all over the country had deteriorated to an alarming extent.  This year those grants have been cut to an alarming extent.</P>
    <P>In my own county, Kilkenny, where last year we got a grant of £121,000, this year it was reduced to £85,313, and what effect is that going to have?  It means that we are going to have unemployment of road workers.  In a normal year the normal period of employment for road workers is about ten or 11 months, but this year, due to the slashing of those grants, that period of work will be cut by at least ten or 11 weeks.  In Kilkenny we have about 650 men employed and our wage bill runs to about £2,500 a week.  If you take the figure we have been slashed, £35,000, plus the amount of money the council would normally have had to put up to obtain these grants, you will find it comes to some £30,000 in wages which represents 60 per cent. of the total cost, 30 per cent. for materials and 10 per cent. for machinery.</P>
    <P>If these men are to be thrown out of employment&mdash;as they will be&mdash;where are they going to find alternative employment?  Who is going to provide it for them?  We know from past experience that the Minister for Finance certainly will not provide it.  He said that it was not the function of a Government to find work for the people. Down the country his supporters are throwing the blame on the Minister <Col N="368" /> for Local Government because the grants are being cut.  That is the attitude which comes from the other side of the House.  But that is not going to relieve the responsibility or take it from the shoulders of the men who are responsible for having those grants allocated each year to the county councils, that is, the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>During 1947 our expenditure was £161,075 and of that sum we received by way of grants £96,635 while the rates we were asked to bear were £64,440.  Assuming that the same grants were made available this year, Kilkenny County Council, even though it was not a coalition county council but largely a Fianna Fáil county council, gave a promise that the same amount of money would be provided for the restoration of roads and their maintenance as was given last year, so it cannot be said that we in any way tried to hamper the functions of the Government with regard to the restoration and maintenance of roads in our county.  What did we find?  Four days before our meeting was due to be held our grants were reduced from £121,000 to £85,000.  In the case of main roads, where last year we had a grant of £53,666, this year all we were getting for the same main roads is £19,100.</P>
    <P>There was a contingency, however, that if we provided 40 per cent. of a special grant which might be made available we were to get £19,100.</P>
    <P>That was the only grant that we were getting for main roads in Kilkenny. We were getting 40 per cent. of the amount that we put up last year for our county roads.  That was increased all right.  We were getting an increase there because in 1947-48 our grant in that year was £40,272 for county roads. This year it will be something more; it will be £61,000 for our county roads, but in the aggregate the grants in County Kilkenny have been reduced by £35,000.  The net result, as far as employment in the county goes, is this, that there is a reduction in the labour content of £29,000 or £30,000.  These are the actual facts as we find them in County Kilkenny.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="369" /> The same position applies all over the country, as one can gather from the reports which appear in the newspapers of county council meetings which have been held during the last ten or 12 days.  What is the present position?  If we were to provide the same amount of money this year for the upkeep, restoration and maintenance of roads, as we provided last year by way of grants and by way of levy on the rates, we find that the ratepayers in County Kilkenny would be saddled with a burden of 2/0½d. in the £.  That is what the slashing of these grants amounts to.  It amounts, on the one hand, to a loss of £30,000 to the workers, and on the other hand, to a burden of 2/0½d. on the ratepayers of the county.  I contend that the ratepayers in County Kilkenny are not in as good a position to pay that increased rate this year as they were last year.</P>
    <P>Despite what may be said from the opposite benches, the conditions in agriculture are not as good this year as they were last year.  We have had no increase in the price of agricultural produce, even though it may be said by the people on the opposite benches that we had.  What increase was there in the price of beet over the last two years?  There was none.  There has, however, been an increase in the cost of producing it.  No farmer sitting on the opposite benches will deny that. Consequently, the beet grower is not in a position to pay an increased rate.</P>
    <P>The price of wheat was fixed in October, 1947, before Fianna Fáil left office.  The price then guaranteed for the cereal year 1947-48 was £3 2s. 6d. per barrel.  Again, I ask any farmer sitting on the opposite benches to say whether the cost of producing that wheat has gone down.  I say that it has not.  In fact, the cost of producing it has increased.  The price of milk was fixed by the Fianna Fáil Government in 1947, and since then the costs of production have gone up.  If a man is sending his milk to the creamery, he is getting a lesser price for it from the creamery now than he was in 1947, due to the fact that there has been an increase in the cost of the production of butter by way of an increase in wages in the creamery, an increase in <Col N="370" /> the cost of repairs, renewals, oil, salt and the other things that go to increase the costs of creamery production.  On the farm, you have a similar position. There have been two increases given to agricultural workers during that period. As I say, the price of those commodities still remains the same, even though the increases that I refer to have been given.  As regards better conditions in the matter of agricultural produce, the only argument on that that can be put forward from the opposite benches is one&mdash;the mythical increase in the price of cattle.</P>
    <P>What is the Minister's intention in regard to this?  Does he want the ratepayers in County Kilkenny to pay 2/- more in the £ in order to have the same amount of money put up this year as was put up last year?  Will he, in that case, have the support of the Minister for Lands, or of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, or of those other people who claim to represent the farmers here?  Are they going to stand up and support him in that attitude?  Let us not get away from the facts.  What I have stated are the hard fundamental facts.  There are no two ways of dealing with this.  You either have to put up the rates or reduce employment.  Will Deputy Seán Dunne or Deputy McAuliffe stand for a reduction of work on the roads?  Will the Minister for Local Government, who probably has greater experience in this than any of those sitting on the opposite benches, agree to have these grants reduced?  He knows the position.  There is nobody who should know it better, and it is for him to say whether the Minister for Finance will be able to keep the purse closed or not.</P>
    <P>Now, there is another matter which also concerns the workers on the roads. In Kilkenny we have adopted the Local Superannuation Act under which the men who are working on the roads must put in 200 days at work.  At present, our men are getting work for ten or 11 months in the year.  We will take the figure at ten and one-half months.  If we take off a further two and one-half months that will bring them under the qualifying number of <Col N="371" /> days.  They must work 200 days, and if not they will not qualify for superannuation. Taking Church holidays, wet days and the period in which they will be idle as a result of the reduction in these grants, it will mean that the men will not be working 200 days on the roads.  I am sure the Minister for Local Government will not stand for that.</P>
    <P>Again, in Kilkenny we may not be in as bad a position as other counties. We do not produce as much turf as other counties.  Consequently, our men may be working on the roads for a much longer period than they would, for instance, in the turf producing counties.  Neither had we as much haulage on our roads as they had in other counties.  Nevertheless, our county surveyor, who is the best judge of road conditions in Kilkenny, put forward an estimate asking the county council to give him this year the same amount of money that he got last year. It is his contention that it will take two years more before the roads in County Kilkenny will be restored to their pre-war condition.  We did, I know, take a lot of our men off the roads to do harvest work, but it was only for that purpose.  Take counties like Leix and Offaly, Mayo, Galway, and other turf producing counties.  If the roads in our County of Kilkenny cannot be restored for another two years, how much longer will it take to restore the roads in those turf producing counties?  As I have said we have been told that it will take at least two years more to restore our roads to their pre-war condition.  I should mention that our roads in Kilkenny suffered from abnormal flooding in 1947.  In that year the damage done to them by flooding was estimated at £50,000. Several bridges were knocked.  We got a special grant of £38,000 to repair that damage, but the work has not yet been completed.  As I and my colleagues from the County Kilkenny can tell the House, we still have bridges that have not been repaired since the flooding in 1947, and they will not be touched this year unless we get the grants that were given to us in the years 1946 and 1947.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="372" /> In 1946, the first year that the grants were given us, we spent £140,000 on our roads and we increased the rates in order to qualify for the grants that were then, for the first time, being made available.  In that year, 1946-47, we got a grant of £58,840.  In 1947-48 we spent £161,075 on our roads and we got £96,635.  We raised £64,440 by rates, an increase in that case of £9,000, which represents more than 6d. in the £ in the rates, in order to qualify for the grant.  Last year we got a grant of £122,888.  The total grants to the county in the past two years amounted to £278,363.  If we have two more years to go in which to restore our roads to the pre-war condition we have spent £278,363 in three years.  So it is only a matter of calculation to find out how much more we should need to bring the roads back to normality.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any argument for the Minister for Local Government in this case.  He knows the position and he knows what the effects are going to be.  There should be no question whatsoever of having to put down a motion of this kind.  These grants should have been made available in the same way as they have been during the past three years.  The roads are not in a proper condition yet.  There is no county in Ireland where the county surveyor has not submitted to his council an estimate equal to that which was submitted over the past three years.  These are the people on whom we have to rely.  If they, as technicians, are telling our people that we must do this or that to our roads in order to restore them and maintain them, surely it is up to the council, if they are concerned about the roads, to give them the money.  We have done that. I submit it is up to the Minister for Local Government to do his share in this case.  If he does not do it he will have to bear the responsibility of either increasing the rates of the country or denying the road workers the right to get work on the roads.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielORourke" hpid="Mr. O'Rourke Mr. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very sorry that a motion of this sort is necessary.  I have been a member of a local body for a very long time and for some time chairman of the county council.  I may <Col N="373" /> say, candidly, that neither I nor the members of our county council have ever got such a shock as when the Minister's letter came along stating that the grants which we were expecting and on which we based our estimates were being cut down.</P>
      <P>I have to complain, in the first instance, of the delay in the Minister's Department in sending out the details of the grants available.  I understand that our manager had written on more than one occasion to the Department of Local Government asking whether we might expect the grant on the same basis as in previous years and we got no reply.  Consequently, he summoned our roads estimate meeting for the 31st January.  At that meeting we made out our estimate on the basis of the grants that were made available in previous years.  A few days after we had made our estimate&mdash;and I may say we increased our estimate voluntarily by 7d. in the £&mdash;we received a circular from the Minister for Local Government stating what Deputy Walsh has already detailed and which applies in a stronger fashion to County Roscommon than to most counties in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first question that crops up is, have the roads returned to normal, or nearly so, as the Minister suggested in his circular?  I am not merely depending on the county surveyor's report, but also on the large mileage I have covered throughout the constituency. I can definitely say that while the main roads may be approaching normality, the county roads are definitely worse than they were a few years ago.  As a matter of fact, it is becoming impossible with the amount of money available, the increased wages and the consequent unemployment, to maintain the county roads&mdash;or what we call the by-roads.  They are very much worse than they were last year.  That is the position.  Therefore, the Minister's argument about the roads having returned to normality collapses.  We should consider this matter under various heads.  I suggest that the first is the condition of the roads.  I have dealt with that.  The roads are in no way in a normal condition and therefore there is no warrant for a reduction <Col N="374" /> in the grants this year.  It was made plain in 1946-47 that the grants were of a temporary nature, but instead of circumstances improving they have very much deteriorated in various ways.</P>
    <P>The next matter with which I should like to deal is that of the unemployment that will now be created.  Deputy Walsh had rather big figures to give, but I can give even bigger figures.  I am not going to go into all the details, but I can tell you that the net figure that we have been cut in the grant under the various heads, making allowance for all grants that are made this year, is £78,420.  That is to say, making allowance for a certain grant for improvement of main roads and county roads, we still have a deficit of £78,420.  That is a very big figure and it has given rise to alarm in our county. I think the people most alarmed will be those who are depending on road work for employment.  In any ordinary county or constituency that would be very serious, but when you take into account that we in County Roscommon last year suffered a reduction of £90,000 in wages because of the discontinuance of the hand-won turf scheme, and add to that the amount that has been deducted from grants this year, you have a very alarming state of affairs for the working classes.  In the ordinary way I estimate that there are 500 men who would be kept out of employment, but in our constituency hundreds of men are not whole-time employees.  In all the congested areas, of which there are as many in my constituency as there are elsewhere, there are small farmers of, maybe, from £2 to £5 valuation. These people are employed part-time on the roads and they are depending on that.  If they had not that temporary and part-time employment they simply could not exist in this country.  I am sure the Minister and everybody else in this country understands that.  Many hundreds of these people will lose that part-time employment and I am afraid that unless they emigrate many hundreds of them will be in a very bad state during the coming year.</P>
    <P>Let us now take the position of the finances of the county.  The Minister, of course, will tell me that this is not a question of finance in general and that <Col N="375" /> it is just a question of special grants for the roads.  You cannot deny the fact that the financial position of the county councils is much worse than it was years ago.  For example, when the increased grants for roads came into force the rate in our county was about 15/- in the £.  Now, assuming that provision is made for an employment scheme, it will be over 23/- in the £. That is an alarming increase, and there is no use in blinding yourself to that fact.</P>
    <P>We must also consider the effect on employment.  If there was an argument even last year or the year before as regards the cutting down of the grant, such an argument by now would have disappeared, because we are in a much worse position than some years ago. We must take into account all the things that have been piled on county councils.  We have had applications for increases in wages.  We know that wages in rural areas are not what one might call really good.  Then we had circulars asking us to make weekly payments to the men.  That would involve, in our case, an increase of £4,000 for extra staff.  Increases in expenditure of all kinds have been heaped on to the county council.  At the moment, while most of the expenditure under the Public Health Acts is being paid out of Government funds, there is a considerable amount that does not come from that source, and when you come to the time when a fairly big percentage of the increased expenditure is passed on to the county council, I cannot see how the county council finances will stand it.  We must take that into consideration, too.</P>
    <P>It may be that this motion will be regarded as a political motion.  I would like to assure the Minister and the Government generally that politics has nothing whatever to do with the action we have taken.  Many years ago, when we were in a minority on the county council&mdash;Fine Gael had a majority and later Clann na Talmhan had a majority &mdash;in connection with the ordinary business, such as the consideration of estimates for roads and other things, politics never entered into our discussions. That is absolutely true of our <Col N="376" /> meetings in relation to road estimates &mdash;not merely the meeting we held when it was understood we would get grants on the same basis as last year, but at the meeting which was called to consider the altered circumstances.  There was no question of politics at all.  A resolution was passed unanimously asking the Minister to reconsider this matter and allot grants as in previous years.  We even went to the extent of asking permission so that half of the money provided for the improvement of county roads could be spent on maintenance.  The Minister refused that.</P>
    <P>The Minister will point out, I am sure, that in our case there is a grant of £42,000, but there is no contribution from the Road Fund for the maintenance of the county roads.  There is a grant of £42,000 for the improvement of county roads.  My colleagues on the Roscommon County Council, when they saw this item, thought it would make up in a large measure for the loss in grants, but there are conditions attaching to it.  It must be spent in a certain way.  Certain of the county roads are to be improved by side filling, levelling, drainage and perhaps steamrolling. Our county surveyor estimates that the most he could do with the £42,000 would be to improve 30 to 35 miles of road, leaving approximately 1,400 miles of county roads with not a single penny by way of contribution from the Central Fund.  That is our position.  We feel the finances of the county are not equal to it.  We have provided 7d. in the £ extra this year and I am sure the council will stand by that.</P>
    <P>If the Government are so unjust&mdash; I hope they will not do it&mdash;as to refuse to reconsider their decision, I would be in favour of increasing the rates rather than let the roads deteriorate. I am afraid, however, that the members of the county council will not agree to that course.  I am afraid the county council will not increase the rates further.  When rates reach 23/- in the £ it is very wrong.  If we are to allow the roads to deteriorate&mdash;as they must if these grants are not restored&mdash;it will be bad business for the county and for the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="377" /> There were certain periods when the roads were allowed to deteriorate.  We had that experience prior to 1921 and during and after the civil war.  Very little was done to improve the roads in those days.  Then again, during the last emergency, the roads were barely kept in a passable conditions.  As Deputy Walsh has said, the traffic on the roads has increased enormously. That accounts for the road conditions in my constituency.  We had enormous traffic over the roads there because of the conveyance of turf.  We are now faced with a situation which means, if these grants are not restored, a greatly increased rate for the maintenance of the roads.  It will mean 5/3 in the £ if we are to budget for the amount originally estimated.  If we do not do that it will mean that the roads will deteriorate. Even 2/- in the £ would be a big increase in the rates, but it would not meet all our requirements.  I do not think we would get the council to agree.</P>
    <P>It is not a question of political Parties&mdash;Fianna Fáil, Clann na Talmhan or Independents.  It is a question of whether or not we will have to increase the rates.  There is a strong feeling in our county about it.  There is strong feeling among the workers because they will suffer most, and there is strong feeling among the ratepayers. There is bound to be bad feeling because of the condition of the roads, even after a period of six months. There is no need for me to labour the point.</P>
    <P>I am truly sorry for the Minister.  I could never imagine a Minister, a member of the Labour Party, sending out such a circular, unless following a Government decision or a decision of the House.  I hope as a result of this debate that the Minister will agree to the restoration of the grant without a vote.  I would not like to see Deputies on the opposite benches being put into the position of having to vote.  I hope the Minister will see to it that these grants will be restored, at least for this year.  Indeed, it would be very unwise to cut them out altogether.  I hope the Minister will be as generous as he can.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Murphy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be helpful if <Col N="378" /> I were to intervene at this stage to remove the quite considerable number of misconceptions that seem to exist on this whole matter.  Some of them I had heard before this debate opened. Since the debate opened I have heard quite a number of additional ones.  In order that Deputies may have a full opportunity of seeing what the actual position is I propose to go over the whole matter.</P>
      <P>This motion falls under two headings: the fear that the increase in rates that will result from an extended road programme may cause embarrassment and hardship in the various counties; and the problem in connection with employment.  I am confident that before the debate ends and, to some extent, perhaps, before my contribution is completed the House will have entirely removed from its mind any lingering fears or doubts that may exist under either heading.  In order that Deputies may have a full understanding of the method of financing road administration I think it well at the outset to give the history of the payment of grants from the Road Fund to the local authorities since this State was founded.  I assert that at no time during that period of 26 years were grants given to local authorities other than through the Road Fund.  For 26 years, therefore, the Road Fund has been the basis of the contributions to local authorities for road grants, road restoration and road improvement.  In the circular to which this motion relates there has been no departure whatsoever from that position.  Any borrowing that took place was on the security of the Road Fund.  Understanding that, therefore, the approach to the debate should be considerably clearer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a fact that for the years 1946-47, 1947-48 and 1948-49 exceptional and abnormal grants were given to local authorities out of the accumulation of moneys in the Road Fund.  It will be understood that that accumulation of money and the issue of grants accordingly was made possible in certain circumstances.  Deputies can throw their minds back over the years of the emergency and understand that, for one reason or another, because of <Col N="379" /> alternative employment in which the State also undertook with the co-operation of local authorities or local authorities with the co-operation of the State, because of shortage of materials and because of various dislocations and difficulties arising during the emergency road work in the sense in which grants have been applied in the last three years was virtually suspended. That suspension enabled the accumulation of moneys in the Road Fund to be devoted to the purpose of road restoration during the period I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>In 1938/39, the last complete pre-war financial year, the income of the Road Fund was £1,162,000; in 1939/40, it fell to £1,138,000; from 1940/41 to 1943/44 it fell to £538,000 and in 1944/45 the income was £619,000.  In 1945/46 it rose again to £928,000.  It is true that the income of the Road Fund had diminished during that period.  So, too, had the calls on the Road Fund and, at the end of the period to which I have referred, there was accumulated in the Road Fund £1,465,000.  I think it would be fair to say that that was the amount which it was intended to devote to road restoration in this country, because it will be remembered &mdash;I know that Deputies who are members of local authorities are aware of the position&mdash;that when the first issue of those grants at a highly increased rate was intimated to local authorities they were told in very positive and definite terms that the issue of those grants at a special rate would be limited to a period of one year.</P>
    <P>The income in 1946/47 was £1,457,000 so that there was practically £3,000,000 available altogether to start the road restoration programme.  The grants for 1946/47 totalled £1,740,000.  It is a matter of interest that only part of that money was paid during the year so that in 1947/48 there was a still more substantial balance amounting to £1,837,000 to add to the estimated income for grants for 1947/48; and the income of the Road Fund itself had also increased.  It was in those circumstances that the road restoration programme started.  The grants were <Col N="380" /> based on a certain average expenditure in the period 1940/41 to 1945/46.  I wonder if it is seriously contended in this debate that those grants were to continue indefinitely.  The terms &ldquo;restoration&rdquo; is a very precise one. Is it contended that the work of restoration should go on either at the same rate or at an accelerated rate for an indefinite period?  There is nothing in the records of the Department of Local Government or nothing available in connection with the whole history of the Road Fund that would give the slightest degree of corroboration to the view that that was at any time intended.  In fact there is a large volume of evidence to the contrary.</P>
    <P>The then Minister for Finance, Deputy Aiken, very positively expressed his dislike of the idea of making any grants for county roads, and his sanction to road restoration grants for either main or county roads was given on the strict understanding that the revised basis of allocation at between Road Fund and rates would apply for one financial year only.  A circular, therefore, issued from the Local Government Department on 28th February, 1946, notifying the grants for road restoration in 1946-47 and intimated that the issue of the grants for that year was a purely temporary measure confined to that financial year. It is true that the grants were continued for another year.  They were continued on the same understanding and on the same basis, and it is also to be noted with considerable interest, because it throws a good deal of light on the whole position, that, on the second occasion, the proposal to issue the grant was strenuously resisted by the Minister for Finance, to such an extent that the programme was very considerably delayed and the local authorities were in fact faced with additional difficulties because of that delay.</P>
    <P>We now come to the period February, 1948.  The amount of road restoration work undertaken in 1946-47 and 1947-48, and the amount of schemes of a like nature which it was obvious would be forthcoming for 1948-49 made it evident that, if they <Col N="381" /> were to be financed on the same basis as that which had governed road restoration up to that period, some exceptional measures would have to be taken to supplement the Road Fund, because it was clear, at the end of 1947, that the continuance of road restoration schemes on the former basis was not possible and a special submission was made to the then Minister for Finance to supplement the Road Fund. His reply is of some interest.  He expressed his astonishment at the proposal and reminded the then Minister for Local Government that the special grants had been only reluctantly agreed to for the year then current.</P>
    <P>It is true that, subsequent to that date, an approach was made to the Government.  A memorandum was circulated to the Government on 12th February, 1948.  It is a very significant date, as Deputies will remember&mdash;just a few days before the change of Government.  On 13th February, 1948, the decision was taken that a grant of £2,250,000 should be given for this work, but the decision lacked one very important provision.  There was no definite indication as to where this money would come from and, in fact, the matter wound up on the note that further discussions would take place with the Minister about it.  On 14th February, when the previous Government knew quite well that they were unlikely to be returned to office, when, in fact, they were on their way out of office, an unusual procedure was adopted to notify the local authorities of the grants.  They were all informed by telegram on Saturday, 14th February, 1948, of the grants, and presumably the order for that action was given by the Minister for Local Government.</P>
    <P>But the records of the Department contain still more conclusive proof of the view of the then Government, speaking through the Minister for Finance, on this question of the source from which road grants should come, because, on the 4th February, 1948, he stated to the Minister for Local Government:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The position should be faced that grants on the existing scale <Col N="382" /> cannot be continued and that the rate at which new commitments in respect of road maintenance can be undertaken must be accommodated to the resources of the road fund and of the local authority.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In view of that very positive expression of opinion, I am slightly at a loss to understand the horror which a number of members of the House express at the continuation of a policy which was accepted, which was enunciated and which was proclaimed by their Minister for Finance when he was in office and which has not been departed from in the slightest degree.</P>
    <P>To revert for a moment to this question of the provision of a grant for this work and the decision to which I have referred which was taken on 13th February.  When we came into office, we found the position that that decision had been taken and I assert that no matter how peculiar the circumstances in which it was taken were, no matter how significant and how striking they were, we carried out that decision because we did what had always been done&mdash;we provided that money out of the Road Fund.  It is true that certain questions were raised in this House as to whether that was or was not the course that should have been adopted, but the answer is that that course did not depart in any way from the practice and procedure that existed since the foundation of the State.  We were taunted on that occasion with putting a crippling burden on the Road Fund. I can only say in that connection that no Government we have had in this country was entirely free from blame in the matter of withdrawing, when it suited their policy, certain sums from the Road Fund.</P>
    <P>But the greatest offenders of all were our predecessors, who took £1,000,000 out of the Road Fund for other purposes in the period 1932-33.  In the year 1948-49 the total amount available for grants for expenditure on the roads reached a sum never known before&mdash;it amounted to £4,262,666.  In 1947-48 it was £2,660,000 and in the year 1946-47 it was £1,720,000.  For the year 1949-50, the year under review in this motion, the grants will amount to £2,238,412.  It will be understood best by Deputies if I put it in another way&mdash;that the <Col N="383" /> difference between the money which will be made available in the coming financial year and the amount which was made available in 1947-48 is practically insignificant and that the grants for the coming year will exceed by over 30 per cent. those notified for the year 1946-47, which, again, by the way, was the year in which the whole work of road restoration was to have been completed and successfully carried out.</P>

      <P>If that is the case made &mdash;I am not so sure that it is, because both the proposer of the motion and seconder spoke about a number of years &mdash;that expenditure out of the Road Fund in the coming year should be on the same scale as last year, all the facts go to show that that case cannot possibly be sustained.  For instance, what has been the point of view amongst the members of local authorities? I speak with all respect of local authorities; I have still a very high appreciation of their difficulties and I have a very high sense of appreciation of the way in which they approach their problems. Anything that I am saying in this matter must not be taken as a criticism of local authorities, but rather as a reminder that, in this particular matter at least, their policy does not seem to be quite clear to me.  Deputy Walsh, in moving this motion, spoke about the estimated requirements in County Kilkenny as pointed out to the council by the county engineer, but the question I want to try and hear answered is&mdash;&ldquo;When was it contemplated that road restoration in this country would be completed?&rdquo;  The former Minister for Finance said one year, the Minister for Local Government at that time endorsed that view, and issued to the local authorities a circular that it was to be for one year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I was on was that if I could have from any source, before this debate is ended, the approximate period they believed road restoration grants would continue or in other words the approximate end of the period of road restoration in this country, it would be useful, because I have quoted the former Minister for Finance to prove that it was his view that it could be done in one year.  That view was endorsed by the Minister for Local Government and that view was communicated by him, within the knowledge of every local authority in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come to another aspect of this whole matter and that is the local contributions made available for road expenditure in association with road grants.  I think those figures will prove themselves very revealing to members of the House.  In 1938-39, the total amount of money available from rates towards road work in this country was £1,324,000.  In the same year the Road Fund Grant amounted to £737,000.  In 1948-49 the rate contribution was £1,952,000 and the Road Fund Grant was £4,262,000.  In 1949-50, assuming that the county councils accept the basis on which they will qualify for the grants&mdash;and that is that they do not provide a lesser sum than was <Col N="388" /> provided last year&mdash;the rate contribution is estimated to be £1,952,000 and the Road Fund Grant, £2,238,412.  I suggest to local authorities that that is a complete reversal of the ordinary accepted method of financing road expenditure.</P>
    <P>It is true that we could argue that the question at issue&mdash;and it is true that there could be a strong argument on both sides on that aspect of the question on say a motion that could arise or probably will arise in this House&mdash;is that certain responsibilities now borne by local authorities should be taken over by the State.  Leaving the discussion on that whole question to another day, the present position is that the whole method of financing road administration has been entirely changed and in fact the allocations, as between the local authorities and the State, have been practically reversed. In saying that local authorities have not been carrying in recent years the extent of the liability for road maintenance that they carried formerly, I again say that I have a great deal of sympathy with their difficulties and I do not want to make any point against the policy of local authorities.</P>
    <P>In fact, the fact that I believe that is indicated in the circular issued to local authorities in the last few weeks, intimating that, as a condition for qualifying for grants in the coming year, they are not asked to provide more money than they provided last year.  Deputies Walsh and O'Rourke can, therefore, rid themselves entirely of the fear that I am going to extort from the local authorities any substantial contributions that will result in an increase in rates.  It is true that I should like local authorities to do that.  It is true that I have encouraged local authorities to do that but they will not lose one penny of the grants that have been notified because of their unwillingness to do that.  Let it be stated again, therefore, that if the local authorities provide as much money as they provided last year for the works in respect of which grants have been notified, they will qualify for these grants in full.</P>
    <P>At a later stage in my statement, I shall come to the employment position. <Col N="389" /> I think I can confidently hope that when the full story of the employment programme authorised by the Government is revealed to this House, the mover and the seconder of the motion will have their fears on the second heading of their motion also removed.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note that Deputy Walsh referred to an increased grant for certain roads.  That is a feature of the method of calculating the grants which has especially appealed to me.  The issue of grants at a very much higher rate, offered to local authorities within the limit of £100 for every £100 put up for county roads, for those roads that have been neglected so very consistently for such a long period, will be welcomed by local authorities and, in fact, I have already a very clear indication of that welcome.</P>
    <P>Deputy Walsh referred to the fact that the local authority in Kilkenny provided more money than is actually required under the terms of the circular. That is true, but the excess amount is just a few hundred pounds and it is not going, in Kilkenny, to affect the position of the ratepayers adversely even in the slightest degree. County councils have also been informed &mdash;I think this is a fairly important matter also&mdash;that they may supplement their revenue expenditure by raising loans for works of permanent value.  I should hope that the county councils will make arrangements with their treasurers to enable that offer, under the circular which was issued, to be availed of.  I feel that a very considerable amount of good work can be done in that direction if the local authorities are prepared to consider the matter.</P>
    <P>I believe that the term &ldquo;road restoration&rdquo; has almost completely lost its meaning in the last few years. If the matter could be examined in a calm and detached way, and that is not always easy on an occasion like this, I think it would be admitted that it has already been found impossible to confine road restoration work to the categories for which the grants were originally intended.  It has, and let it be said with all respect, developed into an all-out effort to get the highest <Col N="390" /> possible grant under each heading. I am not so sure that the principle of restoration has been adhered to as strictly, or interpreted as correctly, as the term &ldquo;road restoration&rdquo; implies. I do not think it an exaggeration to say that the term &ldquo;road restoration&rdquo; has become pretty largely fictitious. When I hear Deputy Walsh talk about the estimated requirements of County Kilkenny, as ascertained by the engineer, my mind goes back to many a meeting of the Cork County Council &mdash;which some of my colleagues in the House will remember&mdash;when the county surveyor, as he was then described, brought in his road estimate which the council substantially reduced.</P>
    <P>That procedure was then a well-recognised one.  The county surveyor brought in the estimate which he thought, so far as he was concerned, would be a good bargain with the council; the result was a compromise.  I think nobody who has had some experience of local authorities will say that that is an unfair or a distorted picture of what took place over many years, and in the past few years in my recollection, and I have no reason to think the procedure has been changed up to the present time.</P>
    <P>I want to say a word, if I may, on the question of the principles underlying the policy resulting from the issue of the grants for the coming years. I am quite satisfied that the main roads in this country have been overwell done for a number of years past at the expense of the county roads.  I have indicated the first instalment in reversing that procedure.  I hope to reverse it more and more positively as time goes on and to bring up to some kind of decent standard the cinderella of roads in this country, the county road, to which nobody in the past&mdash; officially, at least, so far as I can see&mdash; was prepared to do any honour.  Those remarks do not, of course, apply to local authorities.  I want, therefore, the amount of this grant to be operated on good sound principles and from the point of view of an equitable distribution according to the needs in the various counties.</P>
    <P>To continue the remarks that I have to make in connection with county <Col N="391" /> roads, I want to say that even in the last few years the grants that issued to local authorities were entirely weighted against county roads.  The road grants for the forthcoming year, and this is very important, I suggest, are based on a total allocation higher than ever given before, with the exception of this year's and last year's road restoration programme&mdash;but the allocations are weighted so as to give special preference to the permanent improvement of county roads.  A sum of £1,200,000, or more than half the total allocation for this coming year, is made available for this purpose, and that is double the allocation made available for main roads.</P>
    <P>I have quite a number of figures in relation to past years in connection with this matter, but I do not think I ought to trouble the House with them. They will be available and if they are required or requested at a later stage in the debate they can be introduced.</P>
    <P>I wind up on that particular aspect of road administration by asserting that, in this emphasis that we are now laying on the need for improving our county roads in this country, we are making a departure that is long overdue and one that, on the whole, will be welcomed by the people of the country. But we have done something more.  The allocation for those roads is based on the mileage per county.  Counties with the largest mileage of county road or secondary road and, therefore, with the largest difficulty and the largest accumulation of neglect to make up for, will benefit more substantially than other counties with a lesser mileage of county road.  I think that, in the final analysis, nobody will be churlish enough to complain about any discrimination or anything unfair in that method of allocation.  Thirteen counties in this State will benefit under the new county road grant.  Cavan will gain £14,994; Cork will gain £34,637; Donegal will gain £21,305; Galway will gain £10,382; Kerry will gain £17,304; Leitrim will gain £14,243; Longford will gain £2,381; Mayo will gain £29,063; Roscommon will gain £24,370; Sligo will gain £6,209; Waterford will gain £3,166.</P>

      <P>Westmeath will gain £7,333.  Wexford will gain £13,088.  I am speaking, and I do not want to mislead the House, about the gain in connection with the allocation for county roads.  Therefore, compared with the entirely exceptional grants of 1948-9, the county roads in most need of rehabilitation stand to gain by the grants now allocated.  If the year 1947-8, which is not very far back and which was the second year in which road grants were given, is taken as a basis for comparison, the grants now allocated for county roads are greater in all counties except six.  I come to this question of employment, with which the mover and seconder of the motion and indeed, I would say, every member of this House, are concerned. I am very interested in the fullest possible measure of employment for road workers.  I want to see employment for road workers maintained as fully as possible and also their general standard as an important section of workers improved as rapidly as I can. When Deputy O'Rourke spoke about weekly payments for road workers, I am sure he did not do it in any complaining way because I feel sure that he would entirely sympathise with the view I have that a worker is entitled to get his wages on Saturday.  I am glad again to pay tribute to a number of counties that have agreed to make that change and I hope and believe that a number of other counties will examine and shortly give effect to that reform.  They will find, when they get to close quarters with this particular matter, that it is not at all a serious one from the point of view of expense, which is certainly not at all as high as has been estimated by certain people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to see continuous employment in the country.  I spent the best years of my life advocating that policy.  I am not departing from it now, and I hope I will not depart from it as long as I am in public life.  I want to see the road workers' conditions made as comfortable as possible.  I want to see them, at the end of their work on the roads, secure in the enjoyment of a pension and I want to feel sure that, when the time comes for them to enjoy that pension, they will not be harassed <Col N="393" /> by a means test that will make it difficult for them to get an old age pension, as has been the position of a good many road workers in the past and, in fact, up to very recently.</P>

I believe that at the end of this debate members of the House will be satisfied and, if there are any people whose doubts are not entirely removed, I believe that in a short time they will be satisfied that the programme of the Government aims at providing, not alone the same amount of employment as was provided on roads during the past year but, by supplementing road work and by alternative methods, for many more thousands of people than have been employed for a long time in the rural areas, and not alone for the workers, but to a large extent for those people whose condition and whose difficulties are as numerous as the average worker's&mdash;the small farmers in a number of the remote counties in areas that appertain very closely to the areas controlled and helped in a former generation by the Congested Districts Board.  One of the first steps in that direction decided on by the Government is the rapid acceleration of the programme of Bord na Móna for the provision of machine-won turf.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;namely, the increase in the amount of the rate locally and, on the other hand, if that was not made available, the wholesale disemployment of road workers.  I intended, therefore, to tell the House that the Government considered this particular matter and, in order to remove entirely from the minds of all road workers the fear that there was any possibility of that kind, have authorised me to announce portion of an alternative programme that will enable the unemployment position that may arise from a curtailment of the road grants to be entirely met.  I was proceeding to tell the House that one such proposal will involve putting into employment immediately 5,000 additional men in 15 counties where there may be some controversy at the present time regarding a reduction in the road grant and that it is proposed <Col N="395" /> to examine at least two other counties to see whether proposals of the kind could not also be successfully operated there.  By next July, a widespread scheme of reclamation and drainage, calculated to be able to absorb many thousands of additional workers, will be in operation and I want to make it perfectly clear to local authorities that, if they are justifiably afraid of any time lag in the matter of employment, I have no objection whatever to their stepping up employment in the early part of the year in order that their employees may be able to fit in fully with the alternative work that will be available at a later stage.</P>
      <P>On another aspect of this work, there are Deputies who know the facts. Local authorities for a very considerable time have been hampered seriously in the matter of doing certain work on roads because of their inability to enter, through their employees, into adjoining rivers and streams to clear them.  A ruling to that effect was given to one local authority some considerable time ago and caused a good deal of difficulty and dissatisfaction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received to-day authority from the Government to have a Bill drafted which will enable local authorities in the various counties, through their employees, to go into rivers and streams and clear away those obstructions and, not alone protect the structure of the adjoining roads in future but assist very substantially in helping to bring back into cultivation land that for long stretches of the year is completely waterlogged and useless.  I do not anticipate any great delay in getting that legislative provision through this House.  I feel that Deputies on all sides of the House and local authorities will appreciate the vast possibilities of employment that lies in a scheme of the kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="396" /> In anticipation of the passage of that legislation, in the next few days a letter will issue to every local authority asking them to set their engineers to the examination of such schemes in their county and to send them along with a view to having them examined and approved.  There will be an intimation accompanying that letter that no contribution whatever will be required from the local authorities in connection with that work, that they will be enabled to do that work with the assistance of a 100 per cent. grant.  Other proposals, of which I do not want to speak this evening, are under consideration. It seems to me that it is not an exaggeration to say that there is now in sight an approach to absorbing very largely the unemployed in the rural districts in this country and safeguarding the interests of every road worker. On the question of pensions, I want to say that if legislative authority is necessary to protect the interests of these workers because of any lag which may interfere with their pension rights in future, I will feel bound to take these steps and see that they are protected.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the acceleration of employment in housing. I only want to make a passing reference to that.  We estimate that, at the moment, 5,000 unskilled workers, because this is a matter concerning unskilled workers or workers in any case who are not specially skilled in building work, are employed in housing. We hope to have that number very substantially increased this year.  The number of road workers who would be disemployed as a result of the reduction in the grants, assuming that the county councils do not put up one penny more, would be a very small percentage of the total number of workers who will get employment under these schemes.  Therefore, they need have no fear that their interests are being lost sight of.  I think it is a happy note to be able to introduce in a debate of this kind to be able to tell them that not alone themselves but many thousands of their neighbours who may have been at some time or another competing with them for whatever road work there was will also share in this employment.</P>
    <P>I do not think that anybody in this <Col N="397" /> House who examined the facts has ever thought of road work as a never-ending source of employment.  Each Party in this House, and I think each member of each Party, regarded road work as a stop-gap for a certain period, apart from the number of men required on the staff of the councils all the year round.  I would say that there will be, apart from any schemes I have mentioned, for the coming year in the majority of the counties practically the same measure of employment as was enjoyed in the past.  The reduction in the road grants will affect the extra numbers that were employed in the last year or two and I have shown the House how it is proposed, not alone to absorb their services, but the services of many thousands with them.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to say that I feel very deeply honoured, as a representative of the Party to which I belong, by being able to announce this programme of employment and being able to remove from the minds of the majority of the Deputies any doubts as to the problems which have been raised in this motion.  As I have said, we are embarking on a policy which will produce the nearest approach I have ever seen to full employment in rural Ireland.  I believe that every employee of a local authority who has been depending for his living, fully or partially, in the past on road work will have no reason to fear that in the coming months, or in many cases in the coming years, there will be the slightest danger of continual unemployment for them. In my opinion, the terms of the motion have been more than met by the statement which I have made and, in the altered circumstances, I think that the statements made cannot be sustained.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if any person listening to the Minister has ever listened to a lamer defence of so serious a proposal as that with which the local authorities are now confronted.  The Minister admitted that last year, due to the action of his predecessors in relation to which we have nothing to defend or to be ashamed of, £4,662,000 was to be given to the local authorities to enable them to put the public road system of this country into a proper <Col N="398" /> state of repair and that this year, instead of getting £4,662,000 for that purpose, the road authorities are going to be asked to make do with less than one-half of that sum&mdash;£2,238,000.  If you reduce your expenditure upon the roads by £2,424,000, naturally two things will happen.  Assuming, as we must assume and as we have been told so frequently here, that the local authorities are not able to make good the deficiency out of their own resources, you will have a considerable increase in unemployment on the roads and a considerable deterioration in the condition of the roads.  You can only avoid these consequences by asking the local authorities to provide this £2,424,000 of which they have been deprived this year by the present Minister for Local Government.  It is not within the capacity of the local authorities to find that £2,424,000 and therefore the conclusion is inescapable&mdash;and no amount of sophistry will disguise it &mdash;that the inevitable reaction of this curtailment of expenditure upon the roads will be increased unemployment and a very serious deterioration in the condition of the roads.  We shall, in fact, probably have both.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the remedy that the Minister has suggested he is going to produce out of his pocket before the end of this year?  He has said that the Government have adopted a programme under which there will be considerable expansion in the activities of Bord na Móna.  To whom does the Minister think he is talking?  Most of the Deputies who sit in this House are practical men of affairs and a lot of them have first-hand information about the magnitude and the scope of the activities of Bord na Móna.  He is not talking to a set of ragamuffins at some street corner.  He is talking to practical men who carry on their own businesses and who see other people carrying on theirs.  They realise the amount of organisation, the amount of forethought and of planning, the amount of plant and equipment which must be provided by the board or by any other large public organisation like it before there can be any significant expansion in its activities.  I ask Deputy Keyes or Deputy Davin, who <Col N="399" /> are experienced in another large undertaking, if they think the activities of that undertaking could be expanded within three months or three years to absorb even 500 additional men in present circumstances?  We know that the Turf Development Board has been considerably hampered in the development of its activities over a number of years past by reason of the fact that it cannot get plant and equipment which it requires in order to carry out the programme which was planned many years ago in the face of the attempts made by the then Opposition to crab the Government which was responsible for the establishment of the Turf Development Board.  We know, for instance, that in 1938 and 1939 we had planned to get six large turf-winning machines upon even one bog and it is only in the present year, I believe, that those six machines were finally completed and put to work.  We are asked to believe that by a wave of the wand of the present Minister for Local Government all the men who will be put out of employment by reason of the fact that expenditure upon our public roads is going to be curtailed this year by almost £2,500,000 are going to find employment on machine-won turf schemes.</P>
    <P>Turf as an alternative means of employment is something this Government should keep off because last year we remember when men were disemployed upon the turf-winning schemes in the country we were told that they were going to secure alternative employment upon the roads, and this year when men are going to be put off the roads they are to be sent to the turf bogs.  The unfortunate thing about it was that the men who were sent off the turf bogs last year did not get employment on the roads but were sent to the emigrant ship. As a consequence of that we sent out of this country by sea and by air men and women as permanent emigrants to the tune of no less than 30,000 people.</P>

      <P>What does it matter indeed?  A gentleman who suffers from a megalomania like that might as well have said £400,000,000 or £500,000,000 and the people would be equally impressed by either figure, because it is quite clear that, in the period that this Government have been in office, they could not possibly work out in practical detail a scheme of reclamation which would cost even one-tenth of the figure which the Minister for Agriculture has announced, as I have said, to a wondering world.  But think of what is to happen.  The Minister for Agriculture has a brain storm, and the Minister for Local Government comes along and says to the dispossessed and the disemployed road workers that &ldquo;when the Minister for Agriculture's vast vision is at last realised you will find employment upon it.&rdquo;  The Minister thumps his breast, puts out his chest and takes pride in the fact that he is able to make these sort of promises to the people who were his strongest supporters <Col N="402" /> in the County Cork&mdash;that they are going to find work on schemes like these.  But they are going to find themselves not at work either on the roads or schemes, but tramping the roads looking for work.  I think as I have said&mdash;I have not said it yet but I am going to say it now&mdash;that the Minister treated the House in a very unworthy fashion.  He seemed to think that he was talking to people who are completely ignorant, uninformed and inexperienced in regard to these matters.</P>
      <P>What was the next aspect of his defence?  He tried to defend himself by professing to tell the House what his predecessor would have done if he were still in office.  I think that the Minister is as poor a prophet as he has already shown himself to be a performer because, while the Minister to-day made promises as to the future, we can remember that in the past he made promises as to the present, but among those promises you will not find an undertaking that if he becomes Minister for Local Government he is going to reduce the grants available for providing work on the roads by over 50 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the contrary, he promised then, as he has promised to-day, that if he and his colleagues were in power that we should have a system of full employment. He promised that, of course, 12 months ago.  Twelve months have since elapsed, and since then we are not finding anywhere in this country at the present moment anything like full employment.  On the contrary, there are over 80,000 people registered as unemployed and looking for work, a greater number than has been experienced in this country since 1937&mdash; a much greater number.  The Minister gave the House a considerable number of figures, but apparently the significance of those figures escaped him.  He stated that in 1946-47 there was provided under the Road Fund as Grants-in-Aid to the county councils to enable them to restore the roads a sum of £1,720,000.  Now the Minister made great play to-day in his speech about the fact that a great deal was going to be done for the county roads.  Who first made any Grants-in-Aid to the county roads?  Not, certainly, the present Minister for Local Government.  The <Col N="403" /> first Grant-in-Aid for the improvement and restoration of the county roads was made in 1946-47 under the Fianna Fáil Government.  It was a very significant departure; it was the first time that it was accepted as a principle that the Central Authority had any responsibilities in regard to county roads.  I may say that we were not able to get that principle accepted without a very strenuous fight on the part of the Minister whose duty it is to safeguard the finances of the Central Government. However, we granted £1,000,000 and we would have granted more.  Let me be quite clear about this, that the £1,700,000 which was paid out in grants to the local authorities in the year 1946-47 did not represent the amount which we would have given: it represented the amount which, with the resources in men and materials then available, they were able to spend in restoring the roads.  In 1947-48 conditions had considerably improved in that regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but there were more people coming from Britain, if Deputy Davin wants to know, and there were more people coming from the Six Counties.  There were more men available in this country for work, and there was less difficulty in getting access to work.  In the year 1947-48, with materials available in greater supply, we were able to increase the expenditure upon the roads by almost another £1,000,000&mdash;by £940,000&mdash;so that the grants paid to the local road authorities rose from £1,720,000 to £2,660,000.  In 1948-49, when there were still more men available, when men were being demobilised from the Defence Forces and when supplies of plant, equipment and materials were again much easier than they had been in the preceding years, the amount which we proposed to spend&mdash;I do not know whether it has yet been spent&mdash; rose to about £4,662,000, of which only about £2,400,000&mdash;if my memory is correct&mdash;was, in fact, expected to be derived from the income of the Road Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, the Minister in retailing these <Col N="404" /> figures in detail has endeavoured to convey that this was merely a short-term policy of ours, that we were only giving the grant from year to year.  We were entering into commitments, which is quite a different thing, only from year to year.  Our policy was to get the roads back into first-class condition in this country.  It was part of a coordinated plan of the Government to try to make this country efficient and attractive.  We wanted to have an efficient agriculture in this country long before the present Minister for Agriculture was heard of.  That had been our policy and if we had remained in office agriculture in Ireland to-day would be very much more efficient than it is.  In relation to that matter we were anxious&mdash;and I have said it here time and time again&mdash;to provide the farmers of this country with the most up-to-date transport that could possibly be obtained for them.</P>
    <P>I have pointed out several times in refuting the obscurantist critics who used to sit on this side of the House that there is no section of the community who would benefit so much from having first-class roads as the agricultural population.  Therefore, when we set ourselves to try and restore the roads we set ourselves to do that, not merely as a way of providing employment for the men who were demobilised from the Army, but because we wanted to see first of all that the primary producers of this country would be able to get their produce safely and swiftly to the nearest markets.  Another reason why we were anxious to do it was that we realised that this country had a great economic asset in its natural beauty and in its scenic amenities, and we were anxious to build up a tourist industry in this country.  The benefit and advantage of that tourist industry is not now questioned by anybody, not even by those on the opposite benches who are now sitting there as a Government, but who used to be our sternest critics in regard to it, who used to condemn the hotels we were providing and the other things we were doing in order to attract people over here to our own market, to buy our own produce at our price instead of having to ship it, as <Col N="405" /> now the practice is, at a cut price over to Great Britain.  In any event, these were the deeper reasons which underlay our desire to restore the roads first of all to the proper conditions and then to provide this country eventually with a first-class road system.  That was our long-term policy, and accordingly from year to year as the question arose of what provision was going to be made for financing the works which could be envisaged during the next year we sat down and we considered this financial problem.</P>
    <P>There were two things about it.  It was speedily clear that the resources of the Road Fund, financed as they were in 1946, 1947 and 1948 by the proceeds of the motor vehicles under the rates then ruling, would be quite insufficient to defray the cost of the restoration programme which we had in mind.  We were also faced with another problem.  Perhaps it was a psychological one more than anything else.  I will deal with the psychological side later.  We were also faced with the fact that no Minister under our Constitution can enter into any commitment for expenditure for a longer term than a year unless he is authorised by special legislation to do so, and no Minister, particularly in so far as he hopes to defray that expenditure out of an income over which he himself has only a limited control, like the income from the Road Fund, can enter into any commitments in respect of expenditure from that fund for more than a year at a time.  When he has already entered into commitments with regard to the fund and those commitments have not yet materialised, he must make certain that the resources of the fund are earmarked in order to meet those commitments as and when they materialise.  That is the basic reason why, not only in 1946 to 1947 but in every other year before that, when these road grants were announced they were announced as road grants for one year and for one year only.  That is the fundamental position underlying the circular from which the Minister for Local Government quoted.</P>
    <P>But there was another reason why we stressed the fact that these were special grants and the reason was a psychological one.  In the years to <Col N="406" /> which I have referred the rates of the local authorities were rising.  There was a great deal of unwillingness and reluctance on the part particularly of the supporters of the Fine Gael Party and other elements which were hostile to the then Government, to provide the necessary finances to enable the Government proposals to be given effect to. Therefore, as an inducement to them to raise the money and to get ahead with the work and provide employment, we did suggest that any local authority which did not come in now when the going was good and get its share of these generous grants might find itself disappointed at the end of the year. We said in 1946-47 that these were special grants.  We said it again in 1947-48.  We did not have the opportunity of saying it so formally in 1948-49 but we should have said it then, because after all we are accustomed to dealing with the local authorities and we know that you do want on occasions to give them some sort of inducement to get busy and doing.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>However, it is not what we did in 1946-47 or 1947-48 and 1948-49 that is in question to-day.  We did over these years provide the grants on the scale which the Minister himself has admitted. We provided, let me repeat, £1,720,000 in 1946-47, £2,660,000 in 1947-48, £4,662,000 in 1948-49 and as against that the present Minister proposes this year to cut the grants to a figure below what we gave even in <Col N="407" /> 1947-48, because whereas we gave £2,666,000 in that year, he proposes in this year to give £2,238,412.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me repeat, if I may, for the purpose of recalling the House to the point with which I was dealing when Deputy Davin interrupted, that it is not what a Fianna Fáil Minister said in 1946/47, 1947/48, or 1948/49 that is under debate and review and criticism; it is what the present Minister for Local Government is doing in regard to this matter, it is the amount of unemployment he is going to cause, the amount of emigration he is going to cause, the burden he is going to place, if not on the local authorities, then on the employees of the local authorities, because it is they who will have to bear the cost of this economy which the Minister for Local Government is making, by implication, at the instance of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister tried to make some point&mdash;I could not quite grasp what it was&mdash;out of the fact that on February 12th a submission was made to the then Government by the then Minister for Local Government, pointing out that the programme of restoration had not yet been completed, that for the first time there were going to be more men available for work on the roads, that plant and materials would, it was <Col N="408" /> thought, be comparatively freely available and that, therefore, a real drive could be made to get the roads back into proper condition, but that it would be quite impossible to finance the extensive programme we contemplated out of the ordinary revenues of the Road Fund and, therefore, the Minister for Local Government requested the Government of the day to decide that a free grant would be given to supplement the ordinary income of the Road Fund and enable the work to be carried out.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government, when he tried to convey that this was something which was done abnormally, in view of the fact that the Dáil was meeting on February 18th, was trading on the ignorance and inexperience of most members.  He must have known that that question was not raised for the first time by the Minister, that when he had to go to the Government with this proposal he had to do so because, quite naturally&mdash;I have often been in the position myself as Minister for Finance&mdash;the Minister for Finance was not going to agree readily to accept this burden on the Central Fund.  What is the function of the Minister for Finance?  He is there as the watch-dog of the Exchequer and as the watch-dog of the taxpayer in contradistinction to the ratepayer, When I was Minister for Finance I would not have agreed to a proposal such as was made in 1948/49 without having the whole matter thrashed out in the Cabinet.  It was thrashed out and the Government decided that a free grant of £2¼ millions was to be provided out of the Central Fund to enable this programme of road restoration to be undertaken.</P>
    <P>The Minister has tried to convey that this was a decision taken in view of the fact that the Dáil was meeting on February 18th.  If he looks back on the history of these grants he will find they were won in every year after a very severe tussle with the guardian of the taxpayers' interests.  He will find that, and invariably the announcements were made somewhat belatedly in that year because of that fact.  But when the Minister talks as if we thought on the 12th or 13th February that we were not <Col N="409" /> going to be in office this year he is very much mistaken.  He has raised the issue and let me say that the then Minister for Justice, speaking to the representative of the National Labour Party, had every reason to believe that the National Labour Party was going to conform to the decision taken by the National Executive of that Party and was going to vote for the maintenance in office of the then Government.  It was with every recognition, therefore, that we were going to provide that £2,250,000, that we would probably have to provide that £2,250,000 out of the resources of the Central Fund, that the decision to make that grant was made. There is the history of all this matter and it blows the case which the Minister for Local Government has been making in defence of his policy sky high.</P>

      <P>Including the telegrams, because the Minister for Agriculture should know that there is a statutory date by which estimates have to be considered and by which they have to be made, and it happens to be at the end of this month and, therefore, in order that the road authorities and the officers of the county councils might be in a position to submit proper estimates to their local authorities the telegrams went out.  Of course, the Minister for Agriculture, who does so many things in such a hurry, forgets too that there was a general election in that year during which a certain number of things had to be deferred.  Ministers were not able to give the same attention to these matters as they would have done if they had not been engaged on the hustings, trying to refute the slanders of the Minister for Agriculture in relation to Maximoe and company.</P>

      <P>Please leave the Minister for Agriculture alone; what with critics behind him and in front of him, his seat must be feeling very uncomfortable at the present moment. However, as I was saying, the grant last year was given in the normal way.</P>
      <P>It is quite clear from everything that we have read in the newspapers and from the reports of the proceedings of the local authorities and from what has been said here and from what the Minister himself has admitted that the roads of this country are not yet back to normal.  I can say that if I had been in the position that the Minister for Local Government is in at this moment, far from the grant being reduced by 50 per cent., as it has been, it would have been considerably increased.  After all, I sat in a Government composed of men with a progressive outlook in relation to the development of this country.  I sat in a Government composed of men who were united in purpose and were not at sixes-and-sevens with each other.  We were all working for the team and not for our own particular section and, therefore, I am quite certain that with the assent of the Cabinet and of the Minister for Finance I would have been able to secure an even larger sum than I did last year to assist the local authorities to carry out these necessary works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to this matter let me say that the Minister for Local Government has also tried to make some point about the assumed personal attitude of the Minister for Finance.  Naturally the Minister for Finance, like every other Minister, speaks through many mouths.  Certainly, when these matters are discussed, as the colloquialism now is, &ldquo;at the official level&rdquo;, the officers of the Minister for Finance do their utmost to ensure that when the time comes to face the Dáil with the nation's Budget the Minister for Finance will not be embarrassed by having to raise more money than is necessary.  They naturally try to curb and curtail expenditure and to write these very strong and stern letters. <Col N="411" /> Very often they are strongly supported by the Minister in that.  That is a very difficult situation to resolve. But, in any event, it has to be realised that in the last Government, whatever may be the position of this one&mdash;and the Minister does suggest that the position is very, very different indeed &mdash;the decisions of the Government were conveyed through the mouth of the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government has told the House that the Government in fact, speaking through the Minister for Finance, has said that these grants were only given for one year at a time.  Of course we all of us have believed for a long time that the dominating influence in the present set-up is in fact the Minister for Finance.  We have believed that.  We have now had it confirmed by the Minister for Local Government himself who, trying, as I have said, to induce the Dáil to believe that these grants were given only from year to year used the very significant expression &ldquo;the Government, speaking through the Minister for Finance&rdquo;.  That was never the case with us.  If a Government decision emerged to a Department, it emerged through the mouth of the Secretary to the Taoiseach and not through the mouth of the Minister for Finance.  It came from the Taoiseach representing the Government.  No Minister dare arrogate to himself the functions of the Government.  We were a Government which had a collective responsibility and each of us acted collectively. Our Government was a Government composed of Ministers who were Ministers all the time&mdash;not sometimes Ministers and sometimes private individuals irrespective of whether they were joy-riding in America or elsewhere.  There is the position.</P>
    <P>I did intend to dilate upon some other aspects of this motion.  Perhaps I have kept the House too long, but I do want to remind the House that last year there was a net emigration from this country by sea of 27,600 persons and by air a net emigration of 3,227 persons, making all told a total net loss to this country of 30,827 persons. <Col N="412" /> It is true that there came back over the land frontier approximately 17,800 persons.  But these were people who had never left Ireland.  These were people who had gone to the Six Counties to serve perhaps in some of the services there or to work upon some of the war jobs there.  But they never left the country and that figure of 17,800 persons cannot be used as a set-off against the 30,800 persons who, admittedly, left this country by sea and air last year.  They left Ireland.</P>

How many more are going to leave when the reactions of this economy on the part of the Minister for Local Government and on the part of the Government as a whole begin to manifest themselves in every country district? There is growing unemployment throughout the country due to the policy of the Minister for Agriculture. That unemployment is going to be intensified due to the policy of the Minister for Local Government.  In consequence of that, we shall have an intensified emigration this year as compared with last year.  Let us make no mistake about that.</P>
      <P>The people, however, who are responsible for this position are not only the Ministers who compose the Coalition. It is not merely the responsibility of the Deputy for West Cork, who is now Minister for Local Government.  It is the responsibility of every Deputy who supports the Coalition.  It is the responsibility of Deputy Seán Dunne, who is secretary of the Federation of Rural Workers.  It is his responsibility as well as the responsibility of the Minister for Local Government, even though Deputy Seán Dunne is not here or does not take enough interest in the debate to sit and listen to it.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;The Minister is astonished that your Department should propose that maintenance grants on the present scale should be continued after 31st March, 1948.  These grants were sanctioned for the year 1946-47 as a strictly exceptional measure and subject to the condition that they would apply only for that year.  In approving grants on the same high level for 1947-48, the Minister for Finance emphasises that any proposal for continuing them after that year would not be entertained.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>With that letter on the file, two Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party have the indecent, brazen-faced courage to swagger around this country under the pretence that their hearts are rent and their minds bemused that such a proposal would be made by any rational creature as is made by the Minister for Local Government, when, 12 months ago, their own Minister said that it nearly gave him a stroke for anybody to suggest that these grants should not be made an end of 12 months ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I recoil from the disgusting Fianna Fáil doctrine that Irish working men are a liability and that, when you become conscious of the fact that there is a considerable number of men ready and willing to work in any part of Ireland, the correct reaction is to groan and say: &ldquo;Oh, my God, we will have to find some relief work for them.&rdquo;  That is the spirit in which Fianna Fáil has habitually approached the situation created by the knowledge that there are willing hands anxious and ready to work, if work can be found for them.  This Government does not look on available workers from that point of view.  It has never seemed to us, and does not now seem to us, that the fact that there is a supply of good workers available in rural Ireland should cause consternation to the Government. On the contrary, the fact that they are there and the fact that we have 10,000,000 to 12,000,000 acres of land as the foundation asset of the country creates, in our judgment, not a grim problem taxing the ingenuity of people to devise relief works, but constitutes an immense opportunity which we are about to take to give these men an opportunity which I believe they want to make their own country better than it was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="415" /> When I hear some of the futile farces that the Irish people were afflicted with for the past 15 years as Ministers talking about the present Minister for Finance, it makes me physically sick. The present Minister for Finance during his period of administration has found, out of the resources of this country, money to finance revolutionary improvements in the social services and money to meet the many extra achievements which have marked the first year of our administration and he is the first Minister for Finance since the foundation of this State who has ever expressed his readiness to make it financially possible for any Government in this country effectively to undertake the rehabilitation of our land.  I doubt if there is any Finance Minister in Europe whose record of achievement or vision could compare with his, and whatever schemes, and great schemes, are going to be laid before this House and embarked upon in the country, none of them would be undertaken if the present Minister for Finance were not a member of the Government to which I have the honour to belong, and if his rare genius, conservative but far-seeing, had not been at the disposal of his colleagues to make straight their path on the very radical road on which this Government is resolved to travel.</P>
    <P>It goes without saying, of course, that if there were threatening a deterioration in the employment problem in this country it would be the duty of every Minister to give due weight to that consideration in arriving at any decision he proposed to take.  The fact is that the Minister for Local Government can look back over the past 12 months with pride and I do not think any Deputy will dare deny that the volume of work done on the roads during the past 12 months is remarkable.  I suppose his predecessor must have made a contribution to that by sanctioning anticipatory plans and so forth, and no one wants to deny him credit for it, but great work has been done.  If there is a complaint that I have to make, it is that the measure of the achievement on the trunk roads has not been entirely matched by the volume of work done on the county <Col N="416" /> roads, but I am glad to notice that the Minister has had due regard to that fact, and I think I am right in saying that the grants applicable to county roads this year are higher than they were last year.  Does any Deputy object to that?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>They are the same?  Is it not a sensible thing to indicate to the local authorities that, having mastered the immediate danger of deterioration in the existing trunk roads&mdash;having in many cases improved them but having insured that no irreparable damage can occur to them through destruction of their protective surfaces&mdash; before proceeding to the completion of a long term plan of road reconstruction, reasonable regard should be had to the condition of the county roads, which, in the vast majority of cases, are the roads which the ordinary ratepayer in rural Ireland travels and uses?</P>
      <P>This motion is put down for the purpose of ventilating two apprehensions on the part of Deputies O'Rourke and Walsh.  One is that the ratepayer should be crushed into the ground by vast additional burdens that would be laid upon his shoulders.  I take it that the Deputies have been reassured on that score.  Except in the case of local bodies who want to injure the ratepayers they represent, there is no need to place upon the ratepayers this year any excessive burden as a result of the grant adjustments that have been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the rates in rural Ireland are reaching fantastic heights.  I have said so constantly and I want to repeat it. I think local authorities might do very well to examine their consciences closely, to see whether the local services are being supplied in the most economic and efficient way.  When rates reach the astronomical figures that have been reached, there does devolve on the local councillor a very exceptional duty to scan every penny of expenditure, in order to satisfy <Col N="417" /> himself that those for whom he stands trustee are not being asked to meet any unnecessary charge.</P>
    <P>It is right to remember, when we talk of rates as high as 20/- and 21/- in the £, that, so far as agricultural land is concerned, three-fifths of it or nearly so is accounted for by the Agricultural Grant.  That does not make the charge on the nation as a whole any lower, that does not make it any less necessary to scan every penny of expenditure scrupulously; but, as the Minister charged with the welfare of the agricultural community, it is my duty correctly to evaluate any burden that is laid upon them.  It would be very wrong to represent the burdens which they have to bear&mdash;which, God knows, are heavy enough&mdash;as being greater than in fact they are.  If they are necessary for the maintenance of a decent standard of life for our people in Ireland, I am glad to see them borne by the farmers of this country; and, instead of wringing our hands and gnashing our teeth and weeping and wailing over their sad affliction, this Government, in any case, prefers to take the line that if, to maintain a decent standard of living in Ireland, these burdens have to be borne, then the farmers who have to bear them must be put in a position to bear them and must be afforded an opportunity of earning a living on the land which will enable them to meet such charges as they fall due.</P>
    <P>If we can double the productivity of that land, do we not relieve the burden on those who live upon it more effectively than we might do by denying to the sick or the afflicted benefits without which they cannot live in tolerable comfort, by reducing rates necessary for the maintenance of local service? There is a type of obscurantist person in this country who protests his solicitude for the unfortunate, who is always ready for someone else to go the rail, who is always ready to cry out that anybody but he should undertake a heavier burden.  I have never believed the farmers to be like that gentleman. Rightly, they resent waste of their hard-earned money; rightly, they resent the provision of amenities which in their judgment, are of no value to <Col N="418" /> the kind of people they themselves are; but I have never known them grudge a share of what they had to relieve neighbours less fortunate than they, provided they were afforded an opportunity of earning the wherewithal, by the hard work they have abundantly proved themselves ready to do.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEntee is eloquent about the cohesive thought of the Fianna Fáil Cabinet.  I will not comment on that. I prefer to think of the co-ordinated thought and planning of the Government that at present governs this country.  I think it is a significant and an interesting thing that, at a time when the Minister for Finance&mdash;who is so eloquently assailed by his unworthy predecessor&mdash;is prepared to provide finance for the reclamation of every acre of land in Ireland which requires rehabilitation, only in the light and presence of plans of that character, which will operate this year, has the programme of work on the roads been allowed to contract, even in the restricted measure which is envisaged by the road programme of this year.</P>
    <P>I think it might be as well, lest Deputies O'Rourke and Walsh should unduly worry, that they had a conception of what lies ahead of us.  My serious and considered apprehension is that, having been facilitated by the Minister for Finance for the development of this programme of land reclamation under the authority of the Government, its scope may be restricted by shortage of labour in rural Ireland.  I believe that we may well find that the eight to ten year period this Government has envisaged for the completion of this plan may have to be extended to 12 or 15 years, through man-power not being available.</P>
    <P>I know that, to the limited minds of certain Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party, to say that is like trying to describe the stars to someone who has never seen such things, but the difference between them and us is that they professed to believe that the land is the source of our people's living and did nothing about it.  We do believe that the land is the foundation asset of our people and we propose to stake the existence of this Government on that proposition.  We are firmly convinced that, given that that land is restored <Col N="419" /> to the condition of fertility it should have in the possession of the men who now own it, it will provide an extra income for this nation far more than sufficient to meet the very great sum of money which this Government is going to sink in the land.  Nor is this being embarked upon without prolonged reflection and every conceivable precaution being taken to ensure that the investment of the money&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On a point of order, I have great difficulty in following the Minister.  He is talking about a scheme to employ thousands of people to cost millions of money.  I understood we, in this House, were the people to decide these matters and I have not heard about such schemes. This House has not passed or voted these millions of money about which the Minister is talking and I think this is completely and absolutely out of order on this motion.</P>

      <P>Nor, I hope, would the <Col N="420" /> assignment be visited on me, Sir, to go into the wide details which would adequately describe these proposals, but I cannot imagine that Deputy Cowan would not, in some sense, be concerned to know (1) that it is highly likely that there will be more employment available in Ireland than we are likely to find hands available to do and (2) that it will be of a character far removed from any supposition that there is any suggestion on the part of this Government that we are determined to lay out public money for the purpose of making work for men to do. I suggest, Sir, with respect, that it is desperately relevant to emphasise how categorically we reject the philosophy that the correct approach is the relief work approach.</P>

All sorts of questions will be asked, such as how approval certificates should be given for any form of reclamation grant and how far, in fact, the scheme <Col N="421" /> was in reality a substitution for the increased road work formerly provided. It is a difficult question to introduce.  I am not trying to be cantankerous but it would be most difficult for the county councils to make up their mind on the information which the Minister could give us now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very necessary to make this perfectly clear: that the great development projects promoted by this Government are not promoted primarily to provide for displaced road workers.  Let us get that perfectly clear.  That is not their aim.  These schemes are designed to realise to the full, the value of the land of Ireland and any man who works upon them must not feel that he is a charge on public relief work.  He is nothing of the kind.  For every hour's work he does, this country not only pays him but it is indebted to him for being there to do it and it is important that I should effectively repel the implication of the Opposition that it behoves us to spring to our feet and announce a whole string of relief works to pick up the slack of our employment.  Nothing is further from our minds.  We see in our country an opportunity, profitably and with dignity, to employ every available pair of hands there are.  There is no element of relief work in it and to demonstrate that fact I want to point out to the House that this great development scheme, which will in due course be laid in detail before the House, is not a sudden brain-wave that was pulled out of a hat like a white rabbit to meet a contingency unexpectedly arising.  It begins with the report of Mr. Holmes which was submitted to the Government last September.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>All I want to say is this: <Col N="422" /> Here is a scheme of land reclamation which is designed to do one, two, three, four, five, six, seven specific things, all of which are certified by one of the greatest experts in the world as necessary to be done to restore maximum fertility to the soil of this country.  That the doing of these things, the creation of this wealth, will be the task of the rural workers of this country, that they should spend their every day at work in the realisation that they are sharing our undertaking to increase the productivity of the land of this country by 100 per cent., and that the fruit of their labours is confidently predicted to yield that result not by an optimistie Minister for Agriculture but by a detached observer whose business it was to make an objective judgment and to whom it did not matter two straws what that judgment was once he had recorded it, is true.  I suppose there is a natural disposition on my part to go into too great detail of this plan. I must not trespass on your indulgence by yielding to it.  It is not for want of the desire to expose to the House what hopes are here enshrined that deters me but a desire to conform strictly to the suggestions of the Chair as to the narrowest and most careful path of rectitude through the complications of relevance and order.  But I want the House to know that it means that our purpose and our realisable purpose is to afford an opportunity to every pair of hands in Ireland to share the work of rebuilding this country for the next 10 years and that if we succeed, as I am convinced we can succeed, every economic indicator suggests that the increased production consequent upon that effort is assured of a certain and profitable market.  I would ask the House to remember this fact, which escapes the attention of so many, that if the volume of the total output of our agricultural industry should rise by 25 per cent., the volume and value of our exports will contemporaneously rise by 100 per cent.  To raise the volume of our total agricultural output by 100 per cent. is a forecast no prudent Minister for Agriculture would dare to make.  To fix as our target an increase of the total volume of our production of 50 per cent. is undoubtedly hitching our <Col N="423" /> Wagoa to a star, but I think we ought to do that, and it is well to remember that, if we attain that, it means an increase of 200 per cent. in our agricultural exports.</P>
      <P>The Minister for External Affairs to-day expressed regret that in certain regards it is not possible for this country to play a part which in other circumstances we would wish to play. But outside the sphere to which he referred, there is the task of feeding the hungry; there is the task of helping to supply the world with food.  This country cannot afford, our people cannot afford, to devote their lives to feeding their neighbours for nothing, and we do not wish to pretend we can. But we can, by intelligent and hard work, make a great and valuable contribution to the realisation of the objectives of the Marshall Plan in which we participate.  In regard to the restoration of the capacity to produce to our land and the user of that capacity, where maximum ability is a very real contribution, without the scheme to which I have referred, which may employ the equivalent of 50,000 men in rural Ireland, we could not attempt the contribution that we ought to make. With this scheme completed, acre for acre, we can, and I believe will, become one of the most highly productive countries in Europe, acre for acre, and can provide for all our people, never the standard of a great industrial plutocracy but a standard of agricultural life as high or higher than that provided by any other purely agricultural country in the world.  That is what I want to see here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have neither the ambition nor the desire to reproduce in Ireland the conditions appropriate to a great industrial civilisation.  I do want to see the people who have been made secure in their tenure, certain owners of their land, contented and comfortable and so circumstanced that they can pay those who work for them a wage which a Christian man need not be ashamed to offer to his worker. That is the modest goal towards which we are working and, as we approach it, we approach a very great future for our people.  The men who work with us for the next ten years will know <Col N="424" /> that there is no element of relief, that there is no element of pauperism in the work they are doing, that they owe no debt of gratitude to anybody for the jobs they get but that, for fair wages, they are doing an honest day's work, jointly with the rest of the nation, to make the best we can out of the resources God entrusted to our care.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with this debate the first point I would like to emphasise is the fact that we in this Party do not consider road work to be relief work and the suggestion that the ordinary operation of road maintenance and road improvement is relief work in any sense is, to my mind, ludicrous. Road work is of vital importance to this country both with a view to ensuring proper transport for agricultural produce and with a view, above all, to providing improved amenities for the people of this country whose tendency to emigrate is so well known to the House.  In past years there have always been amounts raised from rates and from Central Fund taxation for the improvement and repair of roads and the only element of relief in connection <Col N="425" /> with road works is the extra sums provided from the Employment Schemes Vote, part of which are devoted to the road (rural) schemes which are used for improving and restoring county roads, largely in the winter months.  At the same time, we do have regard to the normal volume of employment that can be given through what is a normal feature of our life and which has nothing to do with relief and the fact that we wish to maintain employment on the roads during the course of the coming summer does not mean that we consider road work to be relief work.  One might as well suggest that when we like to have an adequate tariff on a particular industry in order to preserve employment in that industry which had great value for the country and because we wanted to insist on an adequate tariff we were, in fact, encouraging relief work.</P>
      <P>Having got away from that misunderstanding as to the position, I would like next to make it clear that the proof that restoration of the roads is necessary is to be given by the fact that there was an accumulation in the Road Fund during the course of the war and that at the end of the war the external skin of the roads had begun to deteriorate to such a point that unless the work was performed rapidly and completed within three to five years the capital cost of renewing the skin on the roads would be infinitely greater at a later period.  Therefore, some system had to be devised on a novel basis for restoring what I call the skin of the road and doing it as quickly as possible in order that we should not be faced in the course of five or ten years with an enormous burden of taxation arising from the cumulative increase in cost from the period when deterioration commenced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was quite impossible for any Government or any Minister for Local Government to foresee how long that process would take.  It had to be all, more or less, on a year-to-year basis, and of all the arguments put forward by the Government the quotation of letters from the Minister for Finance in regard to provision of expenditure for road maintenance and restoration is utterly ludicrous.  I should think everybody in this House ought to know <Col N="426" /> that the last Government would not have been able to perform one-quarter of its reconstruction work if we were to have regard to all the warning letters we got from the Minister for Finance when every scheme was produced, when every scheme was suggested for approval. It is the duty of the Minister for Finance to regard as &ldquo;astonishing&rdquo; all sorts of proposals put up by the Government of the day and the incidence of correspondence between Departments and the Minister for Finance in regard to any novel scheme has no relation to what should be done now in connection with the present situation in regard to roads.</P>
    <P>I am perfectly certain that when Fianna Fáil started the great housing scheme in 1932 the Minister for Finance of the day wrote a letter.  It may not have been in quite such excessive terms, but I am perfectly certain correspondence could be found with all sorts of warnings from the Minister for Finance of that day as to the expense and cost of housing schemes, giving all sorts of technical arguments as to the danger of putting forward a scheme of that kind, involving the community in increased taxation and burdens.  Of course, the Minister's objections were overruled and the great Fianna Fáil housing scheme commenced.</P>
    <P>In any event, it is a pretty poor thing for a Government, most of whose members have promised what might be described as a scheme of full employment, when we have a definite announcement that there is to be a reduction in the contributions towards road expenditure, when we see there are 4,000 more people unemployed at this moment in rural districts, when we see male emigration doubled last year, that they should give as an excuse the views of the Minister for Finance on road restoration in 1946 or any other year. I should have thought that the attitude of the Government would be: &ldquo;We are going to pass far beyond the narrow views of the former Minister for Finance in regard to these matters&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Debating this matter still further, the Minister for Local Government referred to the fact that previous Ministers for Finance had taken moneys from the Road Fund for general taxation purposes, but I think if the figure is examined as to the total amount spent on employment schemes out of the Employment Schemes Vote on roads (rural) and on other classes of roads it will be found to exceed by far the amount which was taken at any time from the Road Fund itself.  I cannot remember the exact figures but, so far as I know, the amount greatly exceeded any raiding of the Road Fund.  In fact, the raiding of the Road Fund was more or less technical in character.  The special grants for road restoration were meant to continue until road restoration had been completed. So far as I recall, about the end of 1947 road restoration had been completed only to the degree of about 15 to 20 to 30 per cent.  I doubt if road restoration is completed to more than 20 per cent. in a number of counties. In other counties it has been completed, I imagine, to the degree of about 60 per cent., but it was intended to continue these grants until road restoration was nearly completed and then to go on with road improvement.</P>
      <P>The problem of devising a proper system of roads in this country is a most difficult one.  There are 10,000 miles of main roads and 40,000 miles of county roads, all of which require improvement and restoration if the life of the people is to be what we would like it to be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the difficulties <Col N="428" /> which any Government will have to face in dealing with expenditure on roads relates to the increase in the cost of road improvement and road restoration. So far as I know, the percentage increase in the cost of road work last year compared with 1938 was from 60 to 70 per cent. and the recent increase in taxation has been nothing in like measure.  In spite of the supplementary duties on motor vehicles in October, 1947, we have not been able to secure an increase in the Road Fund comparable with the increase in road expenditure.  That is the problem which has to be faced.  It can only be faced by applying central taxation to road expenditure in one form or another.  It is a serious problem.  It so happens that this Government has to solve the problem of aligning the receipts from the users of roads with expenditure on roads.</P>
      <P>I do not think that anybody in the present Government can deny that my figures are approximately correct; that there has been a far greater increase in road expenditure than in road receipts, in spite of the increase in the number of vechicles.  The money has to come from somewhere; it may come from an increase in vehicle taxation, from petrol taxation, from duties on motor parts.  It must come from increased receipts or else from some general sum allocated from the Central Fund whose origin is not specifically stated.  In other words, at the time of the Budget a considerable sum could be voted towards main and county road upkeep, but the source need not be stated.  I am certain that the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary realise that that problem has to be faced irrespective of the outcome of this debate.  It cannot be delayed.  The road system has to be improved.  The more cars that come on the roads, the more the wear and tear.  If the taxation applied to these vehicles, even if the number is increased, remains unrelated to road expenditure, something has to be done about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what <Col N="429" /> the Minister for Agriculture is referring to.  I am indicating the problem which exists and that has to be faced.  The problem is not being faced this year because the grants from the Central Fund are being allowed to contract.  The balance accumulated during the war has been spent.  The problem is being solved by continuing to apply the proceeds of the Road Fund to road expenditure, although the two no longer bear any relation to each other.  I do not think that is a good long-term solution.  It is obvious from the observations of Deputies who are on county councils and from reading the reports in the newspapers that most county councils do not consider that a good long-term solution and feel that there must be an adjustment in the methods of providing money for road upkeep.</P>
      <P>In the course of his circular to local authorities, the Minister for Local Government referred to the possible formation of a national transport authority and related that to the recent Milne report.  That will not solve the difficulty for the Minister, because, no matter what happens in regard to transport in this country, the funds still have to be provided to keep the vehicles moving in one form or another.  If money is taken from road vehicles to finance the railways, the problem becomes even worse.  It is hardly likely that the railways will be made to finance road expenditure, that the receipts from the carriage of goods on the railways are going to finance road expenditure.  It is hardly likely that the present Government will protect the interests of the railroad to the point of driving traffic at present on the main roads and county roads to any great degree on to the railways. Nothing which has been stated so far indicates that there is going to be a rapid decrease in road traffic.  The number of vehicles constantly increases.  Whatever steps are devised to deal with the railway situation, whatever authority is responsible for the upkeep of the main and county roads or both, the difficulty still remains of finding the money to carry out road improvement or road restoration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government <Col N="430" /> did not assist the county councils when he stated that they could borrow for main road improvements.  He did not give sufficient details.  Before the end of the debate I should like to hear further indications as to the amounts that can be borrowed by county councils if they wish to borrow; for what classes of work; whether the volume of borrowing will amount to anything considerable in the year.  For example, can amounts be borrowed for considerable improvements along main roads, or can they only be borrowed for special road widening schemes and dangerous places, as was the case before?  What exactly are the principles upon which money can be borrowed? Does it really affect the situation to more than, say, a 5 or 10 per cent. degree in regard to the normal employment given on the roads?  I should like to know the additional percentage of men that can possibly be employed in the summer months as a result of adopting the policy of borrowing money in accordance with the Minister's statement.  That is a reasonable question to ask.  Many county councils very much object to borrowing. We should like to have an answer to that question, because it is definitely of importance if county councils are to make up their minds.</P>
    <P>We next heard from the Minister a number of statements in regard to the future employment policy of the present Government.  I wish any scheme well that gives employment and increases productivity, but the Government or any Minister thereof will be practising the grossest deception on the rural population if they talk in a general way about rural employment without stating the one unfortunate and difficult fact, that the problem of unemployment in this country is to a very great degree a seasonal one.  But the big problem which will face anybody, whether the Clann or the Labour Party, who support a policy of full employment, is the problem of employing men in the winter months.  Employment is seasonal, as everybody knows. We have already the difficulty that there are some 133,000 agricultural, labourers of whom only 65,000 are employed all the year.</P>
    <P>We have the difficulty that in <Col N="431" /> certain areas at present there is a scarcity of agricultural employment for a few months in the summer; that road workers and agricultural workers are not always complementary to each other; that they are two different groups of people.  Any Government which announces a large-scale scheme for full employment which does not advert to that difficulty is deceiving the people.  The question of rural employment does not arise when road work is at a maximum, when drainage work is at a maximum and when agricultural work is at a maximum.  The problem arises in the intermediate months, the months between the sowing of the crops and the months after the harvest is over, the months during the winter when wintry conditions make certain classes of work almost impossible to effect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister will let me speak, I will deal with the whole question of how far unemployment can be solved by any of the schemes put forward by the Government.  First of all, we were told about the doubling of the Bord na Móna turf development scheme and we welcome the fact that the Order of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in the former Government is at last going to be implemented 12 months after the new Government came into office.  It is one way undoubtedly of giving employment, but the Minister for Local Government knows as well as I do that employment in Bord na Móna is of two types.  There is residential employment of a migratory character purely in the summer months and there is employment on various small bogs scattered throughout the country where small machines operate.  The mere fact that Bord na Móna is going to double production does not mean that the road workers who have been disemployed as a result of the reduction in the Road Fund grants are going to be re-employed. The two schemes do not necessarily dovetail and there are the non-turf areas where there will be no effect on employment as a result of doubling the production of the Bord na Móna <Col N="432" /> scheme, quite apart from the preliminary work which must be done before the scheme can come off.</P>
      <P>It is quite impossible for this side of the House to make any comment on the new reclamation scheme because we have insufficient detail.  We have seen announcements of this great plan of reclamation, but it is quite impossible to discuss it in detail until we have seen the whole plan.  I would like, however, to ask the Minister for Local Government some questions about this scheme in so far as it will affect employment.  In some cases almost professional road labourers are employed in the months from April to October when the big road schemes take place and thereafter when the minor winter schemes are going on, when the stone is being crushed and when the stone is being prepared for the next season.  County councillors want to know the effect of the new plan on the ordinary road worker.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made it clear that there is going to be a reduction in the number employed on the roads. The Minister says that they will be helped by the reclamation scheme and I am going to ask him a few simple questions regarding that scheme.  I am going to ask him how far it is going to solve the problem of unemployment on the roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The way they live is very varied.  There are farmers' sons who come to work on the roads for a month at a time; there are the professional road workers; there are agricultural workers who are also road workers and there are farmers' sons who work the whole summer long on the roads because they are labourers who are exclusively road workers without any land.  The Minister knows that we have a varied system and that it varies throughout the length and breadth of the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The simple questions which I wish to <Col N="433" /> put to the Minister for Local Government in connection with this scheme are these.  When will we have the approval certificates to begin work on this scheme?  When the schemes are not directly Government or local authorities schemes what month will they commence and what month will the scheme be in operation as far as doing the work is concerned?  We have been told that the scheme will come into operation in July.  From what we have read in the newspapers, a great deal of it is to be of a purely voluntary character.  Farmers must absorb what the scheme contains and apply for it and they may apply in two different ways.  They may either do the work themselves or have it done for them.  Obviously there must be some kind of inspection if the work relates to drainage.  The question of whether some areas can be subjected to drainage will have to be examined by the Department.  We want to know when it is really going to be in operation as far as agricultural workers are concerned. I do not know if the Minister for Agriculture followed the decision of the former Minister for Agriculture to exclude dyke drainage and shore drainage from certain areas on the grounds that tributaries and rivers were already flooded and could not be drained until the main arterial drainage was carried out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the result of expert decision.  There is a corner of north west Longford where no drainage reclamation can be one on account of the fact that it is necessary to drain the rivers.  In spite of the ten-point programme made by the Government&mdash;one of the promises was to have a national drainage plan&mdash;and although drainage may be expanded to a certain degree, it would not be possible to begin reclamation on a large scale for two years.</P>

If the scheme is to be of a voluntary kind there is no safeguard that persons who were employed on the roads are going to be employed this year from April to October as they were during the past three years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody said there was. I have not suggested that there was anything wrong in a father employing his own son.  I am still trying to coordinate in the Minister's own words the incidence of employment from April to October in the new scheme with the incidence of employment in connection with ordinary road work as it was carried out during the last three years.  I hope to make it clear by very reasonable questioning, and I am not trying to be noxious or make trouble or to be hostile for the sake of being hostile.  I am dealing with the whole question of unemployment in rural Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture made an observation just now and pointed out that some reclamation work could be done in the winter months.  That is perfectly true.  Reclamation of a certain kind, including some drainage but including above all the removal of rocks, fern, furze and bracken from land, can be done in the winter and was originally part of the farm improvement scheme for which there were <Col N="435" /> 18,000 applications a year and which was a very satisfactory method of giving employment for farmers employing their own sons and others.  This scheme should be related to the 50,000 people who are supposed to be employed in the new scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There were 30,000 applications for the farm improvement scheme last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to hear that.  It shows that the previous Government already carried out a system of reclamation which apparently found great approval in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am listing the various methods of employing people in rural areas and showing how they affect the employment problem, the problem of carrying out a full employment policy which must include winter as well as summer.  Turf is largely summer employment and a great deal of drainage is largely summer employment.  Unfortunately the application of tar to main roads, in spite of every experiment that has been devised, is still largely a summer scheme.  I hope that the day will come when some kind of mixture can be found which will be able to resist the effect of rain in winter when the tar is drying on the road, but it has not been found yet.  Reclamation, as the Minister has observed, is both summer and winter work, but it is particularly summer work.  Even in connection with dyke and shore drainage, if that work is to be done in the winter months it will have to be done during a dry period.  As the Minister for Local Government well knows, even housing in the rural districts tends to decrease in the winter.  I should observe that road work, to some degree, is a flexible form of employment in regard to the seasons.  Even though the main part of the work is done in the summer, a county surveyor can spread out the work to a considerable degree.  The county councillors know that the work can be spread out.  The stone can be crushed, the county roads can be repaired, and a good deal of preparatory work can be done for the main roads.  It can be said that road work <Col N="436" /> can be spread out over most of the year.</P>
    <P>When we ask the Minister for Local Government to consider this question, we are considering a form of employment that goes on throughout the year that is of value to a particular class of persons.  I am not yet convinced that the Minister has been able to substitute works for people who were employed in previous years in carrying out road restoration.  I am not yet convinced that he is going to be able to do it either by the Bórd na Móna scheme or under the reclamation plan.  As far as I can gather, afforestation work will not increase at a rate which will employ a sufficient number of men to offset the decrease of employment on the roads.  In any event, employment on afforestation work is strictly localised.  It is not work that is spread over the whole country.  In fact, it hardly applies at all in certain counties.</P>
    <P>The former Government had a very definite policy in regard to roads.  One of the few things on which I am in agreement with the Minister for Agriculture is his statement that the more machinery that is used, within reason, in farm work the more it will be possible to pay agricultural workers. In other words, the more skilled a worker becomes the better, in the long run, it will be for workers in the agricultural industry.  That statement, of course, will have to be revised and modified over and over again, and related to the varying conditions to be found in different areas, particularly where you have small farms.  The idea is not a bad one and certainly can.  I think, be applied to roads.  It was an idea that the previous Government had, to have modern machinery used, as far as possible, on the roads.  It would mean, for one thing, that many of the road workers would become skilled in the use of machinery.  Until we had reached that position we never could possibly afford the big long term scheme of road improvement that we had in view.  Because of the increasing use of machinery on the roads.  I believe that a higher proportion of the workers were being paid more than the minimum road worker's wage in the last <Col N="437" /> two or three years.  At the same time, I believe that there should be plenty of work available on the roads for the ordinary worker, for the man who prefers to work with the spade or shovel. We did not wish to overdo mechanisation so far as road work is concerned. We simply wished to have it progress in the ordinary manner and to satisfy everyone.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, hopeless ambition&mdash; to satisfy everyone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The road plan prepared was not to be ready, I think, until some time in 1950 or 1951, but in the interval we did plan a complete restoration of the roads.  As the county roads appeared to be lagging in the programme, it was obviously necessary to apply more money for their restoration than for the main roads.  As well as I remember, the preparation and restoration effected was higher in the case of the main roads than in the case of the county roads at the end of 1948. It was, obviously, a good idea to increase the amount of money available for the county roads scheme.</P>
      <P>As Deputy MacEntee has already observed, we were the first Government to give grants for county roads.  It is quite obvious that the grants will have to continue in the future.  The observation of the Minister for Finance that he was surprised that money was to be found for county roads represents a bit of conservative thinking on his part. That, of course, is the inevitable duty, and the unfortunate lot, of every Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>It will also be recalled that we provided a better stone for main road development.  We insisted on having an analysis of the stone in order to make sure that the roads restored would not polish up immediately and become a danger not only to horse traffic, but to motor traffic.  I think that an examination of the new restoration effected on the roads will convince anybody that they are not going to polish very quickly or become a menace to horse traffic.  These were some of our plans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to say that I do not think the Minister for Local Government has faced the issue, first of <Col N="438" /> all, of the differential between road costs and road receipts.  Secondly, I do not think that, with the best will in the world, the Minister for Agriculture or the Minister for Local Government has satisfied the county councils in regard to the re-employment of the people who were on the roads last year. I would like to hear some more from them on that matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Morrissey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Childers says that he does not think that either the Minister for Agriculture or the Minister for Local Government has satisfied either himself or the other members of the House or the county councils that the schemes which both Ministers have outlined will meet whatever lag in employment has to be taken up as a result of the change in the road grant, or, as a Deputy has said, will meet that particular type of unemployment.  I suggest to the Deputy and to the House that one of the schemes announced is the ideal scheme for taking up that type of labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not dealing now with the scheme announced by the Minister for Agriculture, the one dealing mainly with field drainage and so on.  I am dealing with the one that was announced by the Minister for Local Government&mdash;that is, the clearing of rivers and streams.  I think I can claim to have a pretty fair knowledge of the country.  With that knowledge, one can say that there is not a county in Ireland in which you will not find a considerable number of streams and rivers, all of which can be cleaned and need to be cleaned.  Work of that kind will give employment to a wider and fuller extent, and perhaps over a longer period of the year, than road work will.  I am not putting up that scheme in opposition to road work but rather in addition to it.  Deputies must know that in every parish you will find rivers and streams choked with bushes and trees.  The trees have been left lying there for years, with the result that there are many bridges the eyes of which are almost completely choked by these trees and bushes.  Because of all that&mdash;a part altogether from the question of a bank slipping&mdash;a lot of flooding has been caused on good land. The work I speak of will help to <Col N="439" /> remedy that situation.  I am satisfied that this river scheme, as distinct altogether from the scheme outlined by the Minister for Agriculture will, if it is operated as it should be by the county councils, take up every unemployed man in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies seemed to suggest that the only useful and constructive work that can be carried out in rural Ireland is road work.  I do not subscribe to that at all.  I am very glad to hear that.  I was going to say that if I were given the choice of spending money to-morrow in giving employment I would infinitely prefer to see that money spent in clearing the types of rivers and streams that I am talking about than I should in making the roads.</P>

Of course, if the Deputy wants the type of luxury road for our tourists that Deputy MacEntee talks about that is another matter.  Let me make this quite clear.

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I was merely about to announce something which I thought would bring relief to the minds of Deputies who have been weeping on behalf of the unfortunate unemployed, the men who, according to them, would not be able, unfortunately, to get work in rural Ireland.  There are farmers in the Party opposite who know at least <Col N="444" /> as well as I do&mdash;some of them far better&mdash;that what I have said in relation to drainage and the clearance of rivers is quite true.  There is not a Deputy over there who, if he spoke his mind in regard to the conditions in rural Ireland, would not subscribe to everything I have said, as to its value both from the point of view of benefiting the land and giving employment.</P>
      <P>I do not subscribe to the statement made by Deputy Childers that drainage, clearing drains, in particular field drains, is the type of work that you can carry on only in summer.  Anyone who knows rural Ireland and who is acquainted with farming knows quite well that it is in the winter time the average farmer looks after the drains. Deputy Corry knows that quite well. That is one of the advantages of this particular scheme and of the scheme announced by the Minister for Agriculture. They are schemes which will give continuous employment almost the whole year round, provided you do not have a period of abnormal rainfall.</P>
      <P>My colleague, the Minister for Local Government, gave Deputies opposite a lot of information about roads and grants that they did not expect to get. He quoted from a few of the memorandums that passed from the Minister for Local Government to the local authorities and from the Minister for Finance to the Minister for Local Government and to other members of the Government.  He made it clear, as well as the then Minister for Finance. Deputy Aiken, that it was only for one year, that it was to be clearly understood that it would not be repeated.</P>

I suggest that the clearing of rivers and streams scheme will take up every available man who is ready and willing to work in rural Ireland, in conjunction with work on the roads.

I think they are as good as we can afford at the moment when there are much more useful schemes upon which we can spend the money.  I suggest that the scheme announced by the Minister for Agriculture and the scheme for river and stream clearance announced by the Minister for Local Government, plus the fact that there will be more money available for roads in this year than in any year up to the present, except last year&mdash;let us get that quite clear: this year there will be more money available to county councils for road construction and restoration than there was in any year since this State was founded, with the exception of last year; those are the facts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Let it be £400,000. I suggest that we are making better provision for the workers, for the farmers, for the ratepayers and the country generally by spending the amount we propose to spend on the roads and, in addition, the amount we propose to spend on drainage.  We are thereby doing much more for the ratepayers, the farmers and the workers by these combined schemes than was done under the entire road scheme last year.  I do not think that that can be questioned.  Deputies must make up their minds that this will happen.  I have no earthly doubt but that there will be more men employed in rural Ireland in the coming year than in any year since this State was founded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>The subject matter of this motion is one which affects my constituency very acutely.  The question of any reduction in the road grant is one of vital importance in County Dublin.  Inherent in any such reduction is the possibility of resultant unemployment amongst road workers.  So far as grants are concerned we feel that County Dublin is in a different position from any other county.  We do not think it either just or equitable to allocate grants for road maintenance and repair in County Dublin on the same basis as in other counties.  A recent traffic survey revealed that there is ten times greater density of traffic over the County Dublin roads than over any other roads in the country. When it is considered that the present grants are based upon mileage, Deputies can appreciate the disadvantage at which we find ourselves on that score alone.  The Bray road is one of the busiest roads in Ireland.  A recent investigation revealed that on an average 1,000 vehicles per hour pass along that road.  That average cannot be equalled in any other part of the country.  Traffic is so dense upon our <Col N="448" /> roads that the Dublin County Council would require a larger grant per mile than any other part of the country. That is the prevailing belief in our council.  That is a point of view which will be placed before the Minister within the next few days.  It is hoped that the Minister will pay particular attention to it.</P>
      <P>On the general question of the reduction of the grant, as a representative of rural workers and as secretary of a trade union representing some 10,000 county council employees up and down the country, I have been worried for some time past about the present situation.  In some counties a number of workers are at present unemployed. Efforts are being made to pin responsibility for that upon the present Administration. I know that in many cases the real responsibility for that unemployment rests on the shoulders of the local authorities who last year, when given an opportunity of getting additional grants, did not avail of that opportunity and, whether by accident or design, many hundreds of workers in rural areas are now unemployed.  I have said before and I repeat now that I believe it to be the duty of Government, no matter what its composition may be, to provide employment for every able-bodied man.  The Opposition has nothing to crow about in that particular respect because that is one particular task upon which they fell down.</P>
      <P>The question of the reduction of the grant is a serious one so far as the workers are concerned.  To some extent the position has been alleviated by the statements made that we are to have definite schemes which will give employment to those men who may become redundant as a result of the reduction of the road rents.  But I am concerned with the period which must elapse from the end of the present financial year to the commencement of these schemes.  Every week that passes during which a man is unemployed imposes a greater hardship and a greater injustice upon him.  Provision should be made immediately to provide the fullest possible employment in the rural areas.  We should not have to wait until May or July.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I refer to the question of the wages and working conditions that these men will enjoy.  Extra employment will be provided by Bord na Móna for an additional 5,000 men. Schemes will be introduced for the cleaning and dredging of rivers and streams.  But there yet remains a problem peculiar to my own constituency. Bord na Móna activities do not extend to us.  We have no bogs that can be developed, and, in the matter of drainage, County Dublin is outstanding, inasmuch as it has had very little, if any, drainage at any time during its whole history, so far as the State is concerned, so that I cannot see either of these schemes filling any gap which may arise as a result of the cutting of grants in relation to my own constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand from statements made that the ordinary accepted method of financing the roads, to use the words of the Minister for Local Government, has been the Road Fund, the fund which is accumulated by taxes upon motor vehicles and so on.  I see no reason why there should not be a departure from the particular method of financing the Road Fund and I see no reason why this Government should not have considered, as an emergency matter, the imposing of special taxes <Col N="450" /> in order to secure the £1,750,000 or £2,000,000 to make up the difference as between last year and this.  I should be delighted if this Government had decided to reimpose the excess profits tax as a step towards getting the amount required and I feel that that step would have been welcomed by most members of the House.  I do not think it is a sufficiently good case for reduced grants to say that there is no more money in the Road Fund.  The money, I believe, should be found.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;a Deputy who insists on being minded to some extent. There may be some people in the country, or even in the House, who may pay some slight attention to his peculiar statements and for that reason I want to make a passing reference to what he said.  It ill becomes Deputy MacEntee and it ill becomes any member of the Opposition to shed crocodile tears about the road workers because my memory need not be very long to remember when Deputy MacEntee saw fit to reduce a proposal for a weekly wage increase for road workers of 10/- to 1/-.  In my view, that did not display a very great love of the men about whom he now professes to be very worried.  My absence from the House during the day was due to the fact that everybody must partake of some sustenance in order to keep alive and was not, I assure the House, at all due to the fact that Deputy MacEntee happened to be on his feet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To return to the important question of the road grants, in my constituency we are faced with the position that if we are to carry out the current year's road scheme, we shall be required to place a fairly heavy levy upon the <Col N="451" /> rates, and the rates in County Dublin, due to the activities of the county commissioner, are not in too healthy a condition.  In County Dublin, the democratic rights accorded to other counties have been restored to us only recently&mdash;we got our county council only within the past two or three months&mdash;but if we are to carry out the current year's scheme, it will represent quite a big addition to the rates for next year.</P>
    <P>I may say, too, that, in my view, our current year's scheme would be inadequate to meet the needs of the county for next year, so that so far as the question of road maintenance is concerned, I feel that there is a special case to be made for County Dublin&mdash; we have more traffic than any other county in Ireland and greater wear and tear.  It is not just to the ratepayers of the county to base the grant to be made upon the mileage to be provided for.  There should be some consideration for the density of traffic.</P>
    <P>On the question of employment, these schemes which have been mentioned will be of little use to us. Through the activities of the late unlamented county commissioner, we in County Dublin have a smaller number of road workers than any county in Ireland, and that number is so small that we cannot but view with apprehension any further reduction in the number.</P>
    <P>I want to say, finally, that I feel an attempt should have been made to secure the money to make up the deficiency as between last year and this year from some alternative source, if it was not in the Road Fund.  If this is to bring unemployment amongst the people whom I represent, then I cannot, will not and would not support it, no matter what Government was in power.  If I am satisfied that it will not mean unemployment, but that employment will be given and given immediately, then I am quite willing to accept the assurances given here, quite willing to accept that they are given in good faith and that we will see this year schemes for the development of this country such as we have never seen.  I hope <Col N="452" /> from the bottom of my heart that we will see in July this scheme of land drainage and so on.</P>

I wish that there could be some authoritative statement to make it plain beyond yea or nay, some definite assurance, that if any men are disemployed in any part of the country as a result of this reduction in the grants, they will get immediate re-employment in some form or other, without any worsening of their working conditions or lessening of their wages.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Agriculture this evening, on the only occasion he was in any way relevant, read a letter written by the former Minister for Finance to Deputy MacEntee, then a Minister, in connection with the scheme of road grants this year.  He said that that was the attitude of the Minister for Finance and that therefore nothing was going to be done.  The difference between the present Government and the previous Government is that we put in a big soft-hearted, decent Minister, and put in handy boys to knock the corners off him in the shape of cash.</P>

    <P>You read about the Minister for Agriculture being down in Charleville and telling the farmers there that he was going to increase the price of milk. You had Deputy Halliden shouting and cheering and purring like a cat with delight.  Then the Minister came back and denied it himself, after telling the poor milk producers that his heart bled for them.  He had the Minister for Defence saying that they had a strong case and then, lo and behold, they <Col N="453" /> walked into the Minister for Finance and he said: &ldquo;Do you want to raise the cost of living?

      <P>As an old and valued comrade of some 25 years standing&mdash; I think it was back in 1924 we first met at the local authority&mdash;I have the utmost sympathy for him, for what hope had the Minister for Local Government of knocking anything out of the Minister for Finance, Deputy McGilligan?  Not a hope.  The poor unfortunate Labour Minister.  I endeavoured last December to get the facts that were elicited last week&mdash;to get them out of the Minister for Local Government.  Speaking in this House on the 10th December of last year, col. 1319, I stated :</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Last night I complained of the policy of all Governments in bringing matters as serious as this in at the tail-end of an important session and at a period when the Dáil will not have an opportunity of considering the position thoroughly.  I am exceedingly anxious on one point.  I wonder could we get an assurance from the Minister as to whether the money given under transition grants for the past two years in relation to roads, namely, 90 per cent. on trunk roads and 75 per cent. on county roads, will be continued this year? Can the Minister ease our minds on that matter now?</P>
      <P>An Ceann Comhairle: What relation does that bear to this?</P>
      <P>Mr. Corry: It has a very important relation to the amount of rates a farmer will have to pay in the next 12 months.  That is why I would like the Minister to give us that information now rather than at the end of the debate.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I saw what was coming last December and I looked for the information.  What happened since?  The county officials <Col N="454" /> in Cork County printed this sheet which I hold in my hand and sent it out to 55 or 56 of us in the Cork County Council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I will absolutely and I would be very sorry to deal with the Minister's Department or the Minister in any other way but honestly.  In this famous letter the Minister tells us:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I am directed by the Minister for Local Government to state that as the scheme of Road Fund Grants initiated in 1946-47 for the special purpose of restoring roads which had deteriorated during the war years has now been substantially implemented...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is the first portion of his letter. How much of it has been done in Cork County?  I asked that question yesterday from the responsible official, the county surveyor.  Here is the reply, as reported in the Press:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;In reply to Mr. Corry, the county surveyor, Mr. J.T. O'Donnell, said that approximately 55 per cent. of <Col N="456" /> the deterioration on main roads caused during the war had so far been restored, while about 65 per cent. of the tarred county roads had been restored but only a very small percentage of county roads were tarred.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is 55 per cent. of the job done regarding the deterioration of our main roads.  The other 45 per cent. is to continue to deteriorate.  That is the position.  They can draw a pretty effective smoke screen, I agree, to lead a few Deputies here and there up another path about unemployment.  I am concerned with the finishing of a job started three years ago, namely, putting the main roads back into proper condition.  The money for that has gone in cheap pints.  Further to that, the money that was guaranteed here last year, was refused on the 'phone yesterday by the Minister's Department in reply to a letter sent on the 20th January last.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcAuliffe" hpid="Mr. McAuliffe Mr. McAuliffe">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Call it what you wish. I am reading from the county manager's statement on the matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;In reply to Mr. Corry, the manager explained that the estimated increase, £74,527, represented debit balances passed from time to time but that figure included the £35,000 for flood damage repairs which the council proposed to execute before the 1st April and £7,000 for increases in road workers' wages in the present quarter.  &lsquo;If we get a recoupment (continued the manager) on these two items which we asked for in our letter of January 20th last, that debit balance will be reduced by the amount of the recoupment.  That £74,000, if we get the recoupment asked for, will be reduced by £30,000 and we would then be levying £44,000 which will represent about 10d. in the £.&rsquo;...  The county manager informed the council that they had got a reply to their telephone <Col N="457" /> message to the Department and the reply was that the road grant allocation for the current financial year 1948-49 did not permit of any further grant and that if the council's request were to be given effect it would mean that the amount of the grant for next year would be correspondingly reduced.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the position.  That is the letter sent on the 20th January that was replied to yesterday, the 22nd February, when we got into telephonic communication with the Minister's Department to extract that reply from them.  I suggest to the Minister that it is unfair. I suggest to him that the Counties of Wicklow, Limerick and Galway put up supplementary estimates, as we did, and got their grants.  I am not here to pillory anyone.  I am here to get fair play and justice for the county I represent. Thirty thousand pounds extra will have to be levied on the ratepayers of County Cork this year owing to the Minister's refusal to honour the grant.</P>

That is our position.  I am not going to bother chasing the hare that other people raised here to-day. Last year they told the turf workers to go out on the roads.  Now they tell them to go back to the bogs.  Another Minister told us he is going to put them into the river.  The Minister for Agriculture had a new scheme to-night. Goodness knows between the schemes and the schemers there is no doubt that a cute game is being played. I should like to point out that there is very little employment by Bord na Móna down around the eastern or even the northern portion of Cork County.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider this a very serious matter.  A sum of £85,000 has been stopped and deducted from the roads of Cork County.  That is a very serious matter indeed on top of the £30,000 we were told by telephone that we would not get yesterday.  I do not wish to occupy too much of the time of the House, but I am putting up the case so far as the ratepayers and the workers in my county are concerned. A reduction of £84,000 on the Roads Estimate is going to mean roughly 10 weeks' extra unemployment in Cork County for road workers.  That is the position and no juggling, no manæuvring, or no smokescreens will get out of that situation.  I said at the start that I had the utmost sympathy for the Minister.  I have, honest sympathy for the Deputy Tadhg Murphy I knew and who now finds himself <Col N="459" /> pressed by this <i>posad saluc</i> into this unfortunate position.  I have lots of sympathy for any Labour representative who finds himself forced into a position where he has to dock 10 weeks' work off the road workers of his own county.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture&mdash;Lord have mercy on the culture. The Minister for Agriculture stood up here this evening.  He gave us a lecture for about 40 minutes on everything only the reduced grants and removal of the workers from the roads. He told us of the new plan that he had for agriculture, the draining of the bogs and all the rest of it.  We are all fairly old hands at this.  The Minister for Local Government will agree with me that from the day the road worker gets out of the field on the road with a shovel on his shoulder he will not go back on the land.  He has no intention of going there&mdash;not a notion in God's earth of ever again sticking his head in over a ditch or working for any old farmer.  That is the position.  When I see the road workers inside, stuck in a drain in a bog with an old hack or an old shovel, I cannot help thinking that it will be a sad case for the Minister for Agriculture at the next general election. However, that is the position and I want this House to realise it and to face the facts.  Rates are going up by 5/- in the £, without taking into consideration any penny increase in the Roads Estimate for the coming year, and without taking into consideration the £74,000 for which the Department of Local Government have refused to give us the equivalent grant of £30,000 to which we are entitled.  That £30,000 is going up 7d. in the £ on the ratepayers of County Cork.  Remember&mdash; there is a debit sum of £74,000 to go on, in addition to this year's rates, for which the Minister has refused to give us the equivalent grant of £30,000 to which we are entitled.  That is our position.  The grant is reduced by £85,300.  Just think of it and realise the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="460" /> I heard the Minister for Agriculture tell this House about increased production and so forth.  Anybody listening to him to-day at Question Time and to his nice observation about Deputy McQuillan's constituents and to his nice remarks to Deputy Cogan in regard to the price of milk can imagine what the increased production on the land is going to be next year.  And the Minister shouts about increasing production !  I wonder how the dickens he is going to do it.  I should like portion of his reclamation scheme by which he is going to drain land and reclaim it at £10 an acre.  I know that the field drainage scheme in Mayo and Galway costs an average of £46 an acre&mdash;and the Minister for Agriculture is going to do it for £10 an acre.  I wonder what Deputy Dunne is going to say to the standard of wages to be paid on the job, considering that men are working for the past two years on similar work which is costing £46 an acre&mdash;and the Minister for Agriculture is now going to do it for £10.  I wonder what Deputy Dunne is going to say in regard to the standard of wages that is going to be paid on the job and what the road worker is going to be paid also&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have some consideration for the Deputies who wish to speak and, therefore, I intend to be exceptionally brief.  First, I would like to put a question to the Minister for Local Government: Did the Minister for Local Government recommend to the Minister for Finance that the same grant should be given this year as was given last year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to answer that question.  Did the Minister himself recommend to the Minister for Finance that the same grant should be given to the county councils as was given last year and, if he did make that recommendation, was it turned down by the Minister for Finance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Local Government realised that it was absolutely impossible within the limits of the Road Fund to continue the grant this year at the rate at which it was given last year.  There was no other <Col N="464" /> source from which money could be obtained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>The question I asked was, did the Minister recommend to the Minister for Finance that an equivalent amount should be made available for the local authorities this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>No, not in that form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister, therefore, explain why this decision was communicated to the local authorities on the 7th of this month?  I understand that it was on the 7th of this month that the decision was finally communicated to the local authorities telling them that they would not get this money.  The natural assumption from that is that there were the usual Departmental discussions going on and that they were only finally determined to enable the Minister to send his circular instruction on the 7th instant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to intervene but I would say that the circular went out this year, roughly, about the same time as it was issued for several previous years, perhaps a little later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the stress of a general election campaign last year made it necessary to send it by telegram about the 12th or 13th, which I can perfectly understand. However, the statutory meetings are held at the end of February.  The alteration in the amounts being communicated as late as the 7th February must necessarily have caused considerable concern and considerable upset in the business of local authorities.  It is clear to me that the Department of Finance has a very strict control over Government Departments.  The Department of Finance has been responsible for knocking two Governments in the past. The deduction of 1/- from the old age pensioners during the period when Mr. Blythe was Minister for Finance led to the downfall of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government.</P>

      <P>The increased tax on beer the year before last year led to <Col N="465" /> the defeat of another Government, and it is quite possible that this decision taken now, in the way it has been taken, may bring about the collapse of the present Government.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the issue. If&mdash;as I have said before in this House &mdash;this Government is brought down, it will be brought down by its own Ministers. Looking at it from the point of view of a Deputy who has generally supported the Government, this was no time to communicate a decision that will lead to substantial unemployment through the country.  It was a dangerous step for the Government to take.  Looking at it from a political point of view purely, I would describe it as political madness.  The Minister tells us that he has been authorised by the Government to have a Bill drafted which would enable rivers and drains to be cleaned up.  That Bill has to be drafted; it is apparently only a three line Bill; but it is not drafted yet.  It has to go through the usual formalities. It has to come before this House and the Minister tells us that when the Act is passed into law local authorities will carry out inspections, they will prepare their plans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>May I intervene?  I indicated broadly that the Bill would probably be a one clause Bill; that authority to draft it had been given already; that I hope to introduce it in a very short time and that, in anticipation of the speedy passage of the Bill into law, from to-morrow out, I would ask local authorities to make their preparations to submit the schemes and to submit them immediately in anticipation of the passage of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  That is perfectly correct.  That is what I understood the Minister to say.  The Minister thought that his local engineers will have to inspect.  They will have to inspect all the places that may be improved.  They have to prepare plans.  They have to send those plans to the Department of Local Government. There may be inspections from <Col N="466" /> the Department of Local Government before there is final approval.  I hope that stage of it will be cut out.  But, rushing it as quickly as the Minister and the Department possibly can, there is very little likelihood that this plan will be in operation within a period of six months.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have some experience in this House of the progress made in housing and, if we have the same progress in this as we have in housing, I see no possibility of any substantial employment under this scheme even within the coming financial year.  I was astonished when I read the other day the statement of the Minister for Agriculture about this remarkable plan he has in mind, to spend £40,000,000 or £50,000,000 to employ more people than there are available in the country for employment.</P>
      <P>At the same time, while all these plans are in contemplation, there is a deliberate decision taken to end employment for a considerable number of people.  The sensible thing would be to employ these people continuously until the schemes are available, no matter what the cost.  If county councils and other local authorities have immediately to prepare a plan for the year on reduced moneys, it must be a plan to employ fewer people and there is no doubt that there will be substantial unemployment through the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say to the Government, through the Minister, that any substantial volume of unemployment created now will not only cause political damage, but national damage.  I agree with the figures given by Deputy MacEntee as to emigration.  I cannot say they are perfectly right, but I do know from my own knowledge that thousands of people are leaving this country for Britain and America to get employment. Every day I have people asking me can I get them a job.  I recommend them to the labour exchanges, I recommend them here and I recommend them there, but I find it absolutely impossible to get employment for a single one of these individuals.  Now <Col N="467" /> on top of that serious situation we have a decision taken which will lead to substantial unemployment.  There is this live-horse-and-you-will-get-grass attitude; if we can only get over this we have plans to give employment in July.  I hope the plans materialise.  I have sufficient knowledge of the Government machine over a period of years to know how difficult it is to get these schemes into operation.  It is wrong I say to create unemployment first with a promise of substantial employment later.  I want to make my own position quite clear. I think this is a bad move, a bad decision, and that I can only do the thing that I ought to do, namely, to give expression to my point of view by voting for the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government (Mr. Corish) Brendan Corish">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government (Mr. Corish)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the limited time at my disposal, it might be no harm first of all to reply to some of the points raised by Deputy Cowan.  The emphasis in this debate has been on the question of unemployment.  I think it would be natural in the first instance to admit that if the road grants are to be curtailed this year it does mean some unemployment in consequence But, as against that, I think the statements made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Agriculture regarding the proposed commencement of schemes of drainage, reafforestation and reclamation of land should allay the fears that Deputies may have in that respect.  Deputy Cowan said that, so far as the workers are concerned, it was a question of live-horse-and-you-will-get-grass.  Let us assume that these schemes which were announced will commence in July. The county councils have notified to them the annual road grant.  This money is at their disposal and there is nothing to prevent county councils from engaging in the same volume of work during the months of April, May, June and, if necessary, July, so that they may keep in employment the same numbers as last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That will not seriously interfere with <Col N="468" /> the working of any county council because, as members of local authorities realise, there is and always has been in the county councils what has always been regarded as the permanent staff.  Nobody will disagree with me when I say that a very big proportion of the road workers employed since the 1946-'47 period are regarded as temporary and many of them are regarded as casuals.</P>
    <P>As to whether places like County Dublin will benefit from these schemes which have been announced, I can assure Deputy Dunne and other Deputies who think that their particular areas will not benefit by these schemes that special consideration will be given to them both from the point of view of unemployment and from the point of view of the repairs necessary to the roads.  Therefore, I do not think we need have any fears so far as unemployment is concerned for road workers from 1st April up to July when, I believe, and the Government believe, that these plans which have been announced will be put into operation. I should like to say in that respect also that, while these schemes will be commenced in July, it is anticipated that the schemes will be in full operation for the winter period.  Deputies, therefore, need have no fear so far as that is concerned.</P>
    <P>So far as the motion is concerned, it resolves itself into three problems&mdash; restoration, the burden on the ratepayers and the question of unemployment. I tried very briefly to reply to some points made by Deputy Cowan. I do not think I have the time at my disposal to deal with the other two points as to restoration and the question of the burden on the rates.  So far as the extra burden on the rates and unemployment are concerned, I should merely like to emphasise that local authorities are asked this year not to provide additional money, but only to provide the same amount of money as they did last year.  The Minister has also advised them that, if they think there are any further works they should do, they are empowered to do these works and raise the money by borrowing.  Deputy <Col N="469" /> Childers asked for details of this borrowing scheme.  I think the fairest reply to him would be: let county councils or other local authorities send up their borrowing proposals and each will be considered on its merits by the Minister.  I should like to say also that these schemes for which money will be borrowed would be in the nature of improvement works or works of a permanent character.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEntee tried to make a certain amount of airy play regarding his tussles with the Minister for Finance and Deputy Childers later on tried to tell us that the absolute and sole purpose of any Minister for Finance was to oppose any scheme which involved the spending of money. I do not think that could be considered seriously.  I should like to say that the previous Minister for Local Government and the former Minister for Finance had, over a period of years, severe tussles as to how the Road Fund ought to be disposed of.  It is no harm to emphasise that the reason why this special grant could be given in the last three years was because the Road Fund had accumulated despite the raids which the Fianna Fáil Administration made on it since 1940.</P>
    <P>I think it is true to say that from 1940 up to the 31st March, 1948 the Fianna Fáil Administration had raided the Road Fund to the extent of £900,000 and I think that road restoration might have been advanced a little further if that £900,000 had been made available to the local authorities for restoration.</P>
    <P>I would like to say also that Deputy MacEntee's speech made me think as far as his idea of road restoration is concerned.  I do not know if he meant it or not, but he said that the notification of these grants yearly had a psychological effect on the local authorities.  He made the point that if local authorities were under the impression that they would only get special grants for that particular year the most resourceful of the local authorities would, so to speak, jump in and avail of any money that was going.  On the other hand, he contradicted himself when he said that in the earlier years, in 1946-47, certain <Col N="470" /> counties could not avail of the grants because of the turf industry in those counties.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy will give me one minute more, I would like again to stress to Deputy MacEntee a matter which he raised with me last week in a question.  The grants were notified each year and it was intimated to the county councils each year that these would not continue and in that particular respect the Minister for Finance opposed it strongly from year to year; so much so that in 1947-48 there was no approval by the Minister for Finance of the payment of the special grants until November when there was talk of a general election. The special grants for the second year were approved by the Minister for Finance on the 13th February when it was obvious that Fianna Fáil were going out of office and they then committed us to expenditure to the extent of £2,250,000.</P>

      <P>In moving this motion I did not envisage such a discussion as we have had.  It went circling around the unemployment there would be as a result of withholding the grants which were made available last year.  In moving the motion I mentioned three things that were directly concerned, namely, the restoration of roads to their pre-war conditions&mdash;that is No. 1; the burden that might be placed on the ratepayers of this country, that is No. 2; and the unemployment that would be caused as a result of slashing the grants.  The discussion circled largely around unemployment but that is only one of the three.  Is it the contention of the Minister for Local Government that our roads have now been <Col N="471" /> restored to their pre-war condition? If that is so, it is the duty of every council in this country to dismiss their county surveyors because they have submitted estimates asking for the same amount of money as the council put up last year, and in some cases more, on the basis that they were going to obtain the same grants as they got from the Department of Local Government last year.  Now the county surveyors have misled the councils if the Minister's contention is right, but we know from going through our own constituencies that the surveyors were right and that the roads have not been restored to their pre-war condition.  In the county I come from, County Kilkenny, we have bridges, as I told you in moving the motion, that have not been touched since the floods of 1947. That is the position which obtains there.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of unemployment, we have men working on the roads in my constituency who are from 50 to 60 years of age.  Is it the suggestion of the Minister for Local Government and of Deputy Dunne, who is the organiser of the road workers and the rural workers in this country, that these men must get into the rivers next year?  Is that how they are going to solve the road workers' position, to put them into rivers, drains and dykes all the year round when there is no work on the roads?</P>

We have not turf bogs in Kilkenny and if we are going to have drainage schemes, as was stated, I wonder what the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance has to say in this connection.

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="472" />&ldquo;To divert the board's engineers and plant to deal with smaller drainage problems at present would be a complete departure from the recommendations of the Drainage Commission and the fundamental basis of the Drainage Act of 1945.  It would also mean disrupting the elaborate organisation now being built up and a deferment of the basic work on arterial drainage.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The question of solving unemployment in rural areas <Col N="473" /> in this country is a very easy one if the same conditions obtain as have obtained&mdash;the emigrant ship, and instead of inviting technicans to the country, the Minister for Industry and Commerce will want to build more emigrant ships to take the people out because there is no work for them. The same thing applies as far as housing is concerned.  The Minister for Local Government will have no difficulty in getting all the houses he needs because there will be nobody in rural areas to occupy them.  I know what I am speaking about when I say that our rural areas are becoming depopulated.  As a result of the Minister for Agriculture's policy, agricultural labourers are being thrown out of work every other day.  Week after week they are going out of the country and their only hope is employment on the roads.  That employment is not there for them.  If the suggestion made by the Minister for Local Government is carried out there will not be work for them during three or four months of the year.</P>
      <P>We had the Minister for Agriculture talking about his big scheme of land reclamation.  Why did he not spend the £500,000 on land improvement last year that was introduced by the Fianna Fáil Government or the £250,000 on the farm buildings scheme? What is the use of the Minister talking to us now about a £40,000,000 scheme? There were schemes there that he could have easily handled but he did not put them into operation.  They were left in abeyance like other things that we have heard so much about, like, for instance, the full employment that we were going to have in the country.  The Minister talks about his major scheme and the £10 grant for drainage provided the farmer does it himself.  If the farmer does he will have to pay £5 to the Department of Agriculture.  In reply to a question, the Minister stated that the cost of the drainage is £46 per acre.  Where is the land in this country, requiring drainage, that is worth even the figure of £46 an acre?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Statements were made about getting loans for works.  We know what happened last year regarding these loans when the Budget was introduced.  The interest rates were increased from 2½ <Col N="474" /> per cent. to 3¼ per cent.  That was the help that was given to the local authorities.  In the case of houses and of machinery purchased for the maintenance and repair of roads, the position is to be that the rates of interest on new claims will be 15/- per £100 more than they were under the Fianna Fáil régime.  That is the help that the Coalition Government are giving to the local authorities.  It is there plain to be seen by everybody.</P>
    <P>Tourism was mentioned, and the Minister for Industry and Commerce said that the roads were good enough. If we are to expect tourists to come here then we will have to provide them with good roads.  The members of the Government should remember that. Our tourist traffic is worth £28,000,000 a year to us.  It brings in more than our cattle, our eggs and our poultry. What provision are the Government making for it through the upkeep of the roads of the country?  Are they making any provision to keep the roads in a proper state of repair?  We tried to do that during the last four or five years.  The help the Government are giving is to slash the grants for the roads.</P>
    <P>In August and September next when the county councils will not have a shilling or a penny in their coffers, we will find that the water channels on the roads will not be cleaned and that the roads hedges will not be cut.  The result will be that when the first floods come in October the channels will be choked and the roads will be torn up for many a mile.  That will put more expense on the local authority.  There will be no money there for the purpose of keeping the roads in repair.  Even as it is, the county councils find it very hard to do the work that is necessary on the roads.</P>
    <P>The question before the House is this: is the Minister going to put men out of employment for the sake of saving £2,000,000, or is he going to burden the ratepayers with the task of providing the moneys necessary to have the same amount of work done on the roads this year as that which obtained during the past three or four years?  In the County Kilkenny, where I come from, we have had very little <Col N="475" /> variation in the number of men employed on the roads during the past number of years.  We had in or about 650 men.  They worked for about ten months of the year.  I am sure that the position which applies in Kilkenny applies in every other county, but even more so in those counties where turf was produced during the war.  There was a great deal more work to be done on the county and main roads in the turf-producing counties than in a county like Kilkenny where we had no turf production.  Our men had to do harvest work during the emergency. Nevertheless, in my constituency we were able to do more work on the roads than they were in many other areas. Notwithstanding the amount of work that we did during that period, our county surveyor has reported to us that our roads will not be back to normal for at least another two years on the condition that we will be able to spend as much money on them as we did last year.  If the statement that he submitted to us is wrong, and is wrong in so far as it applies to every other county, then I submit that the Minister for Local Government should order the dismissal of every county surveyor in the country for trying to mislead the ratepayers by looking for more money than they need.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude I want to say that the schemes envisaged by Ministers here to-night will necessarily take some time to put into operation.  In view of that, I want to ask, will the Minister <Col N="476" /> for Local Government not consider continuing the grants on the old scale until these new schemes come into operation?  I think he indicated that these schemes would not be ready to start until next July.  Why, therefore, not make the grants available for another year?  If that is done we will be satisfied with the amount of work that will be done, our men will have got employment and the ratepayers will be saved the necessity of putting up this extra money.  It is no longer the responsibility of the local authorities to keep the roads.  They have done their duty in all cases.  It is now the responsibility of the Minister for Local Government and of the Government as a whole.  Let no argument be put forward in this House that the local authorities are not doing their duty.  They are, and will continue to do it.  The Government also have a responsibility in the matter and they must live up to that responsibility.  The farmer Deputies have a responsibility to the people who sent them here.  The leaders of both Labour Parties have a responsibility to the workers.  This is the place in which they must shoulder their responsibilities, and the only way in which they can do so is by voting for or against this motion to-night.  I challenge both of them to show their hand, and so let use see how their feelings run.  They can do that by voting for or against the motion.  By their vote we are going to judge their sincerity on this question.</P>

      <P>I addressed a question to the Minister for Lands to-day as follows:</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Lands if he will state under what regulation of the Land Commission a plot of land on the O'Brien estate, Cromin, Co. Limerick (Collection No. P8712), was recently allotted to Mr. Patrick O'Donnell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, in reply, told me that it was allotted by the Land Commission in the exercise of their powers under Section 31 of the Land Act, 1923.  I asked the Minister a supplementary question.  I asked him to justify giving <Col N="479" /> a plot like this to a man with a valuation of £136, a farm of 126 statute acres, and who has let every year over a number of years 80 acres of the 126 in grazing.  The Minister said he was not responsible for the introduction of the 1946 Act under which, apparently, the plot in question was taken from the man for bad user.  That was sidetracking the question I put to the Minister and I am raising the matter here to-night to see if the Minister can justify the action of the Land Commission and throw more light on the reallocation of this plot to a man who was already a large landholder and who was letting a substantial portion of the farm he had in grazing.</P>
    <P>The history of this case is that the O'Brien estate in Dromin was acquired by the Land Commission about 11 years ago.  There was a herd on the estate named O'Brien and he got this plot in question, I understand, as compensation for the loss of his employment as a herd.  This is a plot of four or five statute acres.  He was found not to have worked the land according to approved methods of husbandry and the Land Commission resumed possestion some time in 1947.  They let it then to a cottier who lived across the road from the plot, a man named Burns, and I understood from an answer the Minister gave to another question put to him on November 18th that it was let for revenue purposes under a grazing agreement from the 3rd December, 1947, to the 31st October, 1948.  When the 31st October, 1948, came, Burns was dispossessed.  His grazing letting, evidently, had terminated. The plot was resumed by the Land Commission and given to this large land-holder with the 126 statute acres and £136 valuation.  This land-holder was himself a migrant and when the O'Brien estate at Dromin was acquired 11 years ago he surrendered his own holding in another part of County Limerick and got this place by way of exchange.</P>
    <P>I realise quite well that under the circumstances he was entitled to do what he liked with that land.  He could either work it as a dairy or tillage or fattening farm or let it in <Col N="480" /> grazing, as he did.  I am not quarrelling with that at all.  What I am quarrelling with is the dispossession of the cottier who got that on a grazing letting and the handing over to a man who already had a very large holding and who was not working that holding as the Land Commission would expect it to be worked in order to qualify for any portion of land whatever.</P>
    <P>According to the section of the Act the Minister quoted&mdash;Section 31 of the Land Act of 1923&mdash;allotments could be made to uneconomic holders, to a person who entered into an agreement with the Land Commission for the exchange of a holding, to a genuine representative of an evicted tenant, to a person being a labourer who by reason of the sale of any lands under the provisions of the Land Purchase Acts has been deprived of his employment on the said lands, to trustees for the purposes mentioned in Section 4 of the Irish Land Act, 1903, as extended by the 1923 Act, and any other person or body to whom, in the opinion of the Land Commission, an advance ought to be made.</P>
    <P>I will direct the Minister's attention to sub-section (2) of the section he quoted.  Here it is:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Land Commission, in deciding as to the suitability of applicants under this section, shall be satisfied as to their competence to work the land, and their intention to do so and not to sell, let or assign it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Here we have a case where a man who could not in any circumstances be described as an uneconomic holder with 126 statute acres of land carrying a valuation of £136 and who is actually letting some of his land; yet, this man still gets more land from the Land Commission. At the same time a cottier living across the road who could work these four acres as an accommodation plot is deprived of them.  The man who got the four acres is not qualified, as far as I can gather, under any of the regulations of the Land Commission in any circumstances whatsover.  How does the Minister justify that action on the part of the Land Commission?  I have seen the Land Commission do many queer things in my time but this recent example beats all the others.</P>

      <P>The facts that I am giving to the Minister were clicited under oath in court.  The size of the holding in question, the valuation of it, the fact that a substantial portion of it is let every year and all the other data that I have given to the Minister were elicited under oath.  I want to know how the Minister can justify that action on the part of the Land Commission.  There is no justification for it under any of the regulations that I can discover.  This cottier was in possession of these four acres from October, 1947, to 1st November, 1948.  He was doing his best to work the land to the satisfaction of the Land Commission.  He had bought two milch cows and three young cattle.  He was tilling a substantial portion of his own cottage plot.  He was doing all in his power to work that land in a manner satisfactory to the Land Commission and beneficial to himself, his wife and young family.  I think he was disgracefully treated by the Land Commission. I raised this question earlier to-day and, being dissatisfied with the Minister's reply, I raise it again now.  What justification is there for the way in which this matter was dealt with by the Land Commission?</P>

      <P>I asked the Minister under what regulations of the Land Commission was this plot allotted to Patrick O'Donnell.  That is the name of the man.  I had difficulty in getting that information from the Minister, but he gave it to me in the end.  He gave it to me in reply to a previous question that I put down on the 1st December.  Why all this talk about the rural labourers and the effort to help them to better their conditions when the Land Commission turns round and behaves in this fashion.  The Minister comes from the West of Ireland.  He knows what conditions and circumstances are like there.  How can he justify this action on the part of the Land Commission?  There is a squalid atmosphere about this whole matter <Col N="482" /> for which I can see no justification. To me it appears to be illegal.  There is no regulation in the Land Commission under which a small plot of land like this could be handed over to a large land-holder who was letting a substantial portion of his lands in grazing, thereby depriving a cottier, who was working the land satisfactorily, of the particular plot.</P>

I have never been an advocate of landlordism.  I know the man from whom the land was acquired.  His name is O'Brien.  He worked the land in the best interests of the agricultural life of the country.  His land was taken from him by the Fianna Fáil Government and he was given £5 per acre compensation. Dromin is reputed to be some of the best dairying and grazing land in Ireland.</P>
