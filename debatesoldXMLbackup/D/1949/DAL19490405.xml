      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if, he will state the number of persons employed weekly in occupations insurable under the Unemployment Insurance Acts of 1948 as calculated from the net unemployment insurance income and comparable figures for 1947 and 1948 allowing for the changed scope of the Unemployment Insurance Acts since October, 1948.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The average numbers of persons employed weekly in occupations insurable under the Unemployment Insurance Acts, as derived from the net contribution income of the Unemployment Fund in the years 1947 and 1948 have been provisionally estimated as follows:&mdash;1947, 304,200; 1948, 319,700.</P>
      <P>From the 4th October, 1948, nonmanual workers whose remuneration exceeded in annual value a rate of £250 but not a rate of £500 became insurable under the Unemployment Insurance Acts for the first time.  The estimated number of contributions paid by persons affected by this extension of the scope of the Acts has been excluded from the foregoing calculation for 1948 for the purpose of the comparison with 1947.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands whether he is aware that large tracts of land, suitable for afforestation, are available at Barrahauring, Donoughmore, and at Curraheen, Carrigrohane, County Cork; and, if so, whether the Land Commission will take the necessary steps for their acquisition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Blowick) Joseph Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Blowick)</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1936 there were offers by 13 tenants of a total area of 92 acres at Barrahauring, and about the same time an offer of 300 acres of Barrahauring mountain.  The 92 acres lot was too small and too far distant from the nearest forest centre to justify acquisition, and the exposure and unfavourable soil conditions on Barrahauring mountain rendered it quite unsuitable. In 1946 a further area of 84 acres was offered at Barrahauring but the price expected by the owner was far too high.</P>
      <P>We have had no offers from the Curraheen and Carrigrohane districts, but if the Deputy will supply me with the names and addresses of the owners of any sizable lots which he thinks would be suitable for acquisition there, I shall have inquiries made without delay.  Perhaps he may also be in a position to secure additional offers at Barrahauring, in which case I shall be glad to have the position there re-examined.</P>

      <P>The total area in this district on offer for sale for forestry purposes comes to 350 acres approximately. Two other areas which were formerly on offer have since changed hands and the present owners have indicated that they are not prepared to sell and propose to retain the lands for their own use.  The prices asked are, in the main, in excess of the value of the land for forestry purposes, and the areas offered form a long, narrow block which would involve very high costs for fencing in relation to the total area.  It is understood, however, that the owner of one block of about 170 acres is prepared to consider sale at a reasonable figure and a valuation and offer will be made at an early date.</P>

It must, of course, be understood that there is no public right of fishing in fresh water nor could such be established even by long continued usage.  It is always open to those holding such rights to permit others to fish on their property, and it is not proposed to legislate for the purpose of compelling them to do so.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to recommend the payment of compensation in such circumstances as those outlined by the Deputy.  The policy of my Department in regard to outbreaks of fluke, parasitic worms, hoose and similar conditions is not to wait until havoc has been wrought and then return to count the dead and pay compensation for a catastrophe that should not have been allowed to occur; but rather to take preventive measures in good time as was recently done in the Loop Head area of the Deputy's own constituency, with the gratifying result that whereas these diseases accounted for 853 deaths of cattle in that area between September, 1947, and February, <Col N="2220" /> 1948, only six cattle were lost from similar causes between September, 1948, and February, 1949.

      <P>I have no information as to the employment position in the De Selby Quarries.  So far as is possible. I would prefer that local authorities would carry out their own quarrying operations, but where the employment of a contractor is necessary the decision as to which contractor to employ is a matter for the local authority.  I have inquired from the Dublin County Council as to their contracts for these road materials and am informed that the conditions of contract require that all labour employed by the contractor shall be trade union labour and that wages paid shall comply with the council's fair wages clause.  With one exception. all the quarries from which stone is <Col N="2235" /> supplied to the county council are in County Dublin.</P>
      <P>Contractors for the supply of stone to Dublin Corporation are, at the request of the corporation, appointed each year under the Combined Purchasing Act, 1925.  Last year the corporation intimated that the selection of a single contractor would not guarantee an adequate supply of materials for road work, and it was decided to include all applicants (four in number) on the official list for 1949, at the prices quoted by them. In November last the corporation had represented that they could get satisfactory materials at a price lower than that quoted by the official contractors for 1948.  They were informed that, in these circumstances, there was no objection to their getting supplies from firms other than the official contractor.  It is understood that the firm from which they got supplies employs trade union labour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>When the House adjourned last week I was dealing with the proposed position under Section 5 which deals with the compensation rights of people who may be affected under the provisions of the Bill.  I was suggesting to the House that, certainly by implication, under sub-section (2) of Section 5 which purports to confer jurisdiction on the District Court to deal with claims under the section that these would be limited to District Court jurisdiction.  I was pointing out that that provision differs materially from similar sections in other Acts conferring statutory powers on the District Court.  In any section of a previous Act that I have seen which purported to confer statutory power on a District Court, the district justice was referred to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2243" /> We know that, under the Courts of Justice Act, the jurisdiction of the District Courts is limited, in cases of tort, to £10, and I think it should be made clear whether that is the intention of the Minister and the Government so far as sub-section (2) of Section 5 is concerned.  If that is not the intention, I do not see what objection there can be to having this section amended so as to provide that the district justice will have jurisdiction to deal with claims for damages arising under this Bill up to a certain amount, or to provide in other cases, where large claims for damages may arise in connection with works carried out under this Bill, that these claims may be dealt with either in the Circuit Court or in the High Court as the case may be.</P>
    <P>There is no suggestion in this section that the district justice will act as an arbitrator.  Various instances might be given to show that where jurisdiction of this kind was conferred on the courts previously, a particular section in the Act set out specifically that the jurisdiction of the courts concerned was being enlarged.  One case was that of the Married Women's Property Act, under which the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court was enlarged to enable the court to deal with cases &ldquo;irrespective of the value of the property in dispute.&rdquo;  I cannot see why there should be any objection, on the Committee Stage of this Bill, to the amendment of sub-section (2) of Section 5 by adding words to the following effect that, irrespective of the value of the property in dispute or irrespective of the amount of damage involved, the court would have jurisdiction to deal with the claim.  Even if we do that, I still can visualise cases arising under this Bill which may be of such an important nature&mdash;cases in which the claims for damages may be very large &mdash;that it might be preferable to have a court of greater jurisdiction and with higher authority to deal with them.</P>
    <P>It may be quite all right for a district justice to deal with the smaller claims arising under the Bill, claims say for £5, £6 or £10, but I do not think it is desirable, nor do I think the House should recommend, that the District <Col N="2244" /> Court should have jurisdiction to deal with claims affecting, for example, fishery rights or important claims arising from the diversion of watercourses or claims by mill-owners in respect of their rights which may be interfered with owing to the nature of the works carried out under this Bill.  I can visualise some of those claims running into thousands of pounds, claims, say, in respect of flooding if this Bill is carried out on an extensive scale. Works executed under this Bill may create major problems of flooding which in turn may give rise to very large claims.  In such cases, where there are claims for big damages I do not think the District Court should be the tribunal to deal with them.</P>
    <P>Under the section, as drafted, there is no line of action laid down and no guide given as to how the court shall proceed to deal with claims for damages that may arise and, therefore, this section is unprecedented as far as that position is concerned.  If we take any other Act dealing with local authorities, if we take the Act under which practically all claims&mdash;where there is any dispute with a local authority in connection with the payment of compensation&mdash;are dealt with, such as the Acquisition of Land (Compensation) Act of 1919, it is laid down both for the arbitrator and, if necessary, for any court or tribunal set up under that legislation, to deal with claims affecting local authorities, that as far as the acquisition of land is concerned, the rule to guide the tribunal dealing with such a claim should be the price that would be payable by a willing purchaser.</P>
    <P>There are definite rules laid down for the tribunal and the basis is set out on which they should deal with these claims.  Here you have a bald statement to the effect that compensation shall be determined by a district court on the application of the claimant, in default of agreement.  In the Act that I have referred to there is provision made for the number of witnesses who can be called and the type of evidence that may be required.  Here we are left without any indication in that connection&mdash;and I say this both from the point of view of the local authority <Col N="2245" /> as well as from the point of view of any claimant who might come before this tribunal.  There is no basis to guide the tribunal in the matter.</P>
    <P>In practically every piece of legislation that we have on the Statute Book dealing with rights where compensation is to be assessed, including, if we like to take it, the landlord and tenant clause, there are always certain standards laid down for the guidance of the court, and to be of assistance to the court, as to the way in which it should assess compensation.  In this section there is no such indication given.  All Deputies here, and particularly those who are members of local authorities, should be very careful of this particular section.  It would appear that the local authority is going to have the doubtful pleasure of paying for the fun.  If any work done under this legislation gives rise to claims, then the local authority will have to foot the bill.  Therefore, members of local authorities who are also members of the Dáil should bear this in mind, that what is proposed under this section is that the ratepayers will ultimately have to pay for any of the claims envisaged under this Bill.</P>
    <P>In addition, the local authority presumably will have to provide the necessary machinery to carry out works under this Bill.  They will be responsible for a host of engineers and officials who may be necessary.  If that is the position, we have to face the fact that there is no indication in the Bill as to how far the present Minister or his successor may go in the matter of providing finance from the Central Fund.  If the local authority has to pay for all damages, if it has to pay for the engineers who will be necessary to carry out these schemes, then some of the provisions of this Bill are illusory.  It is well known what happened in connection with drainage works taken over by local authorities under the 1925 Arterial Drainage Act. If local authorities had the opportunity again, they never would have taken over these works because they mean an annual recurrent expenditure out of the rates.  Under the 1925 Act the local authorities are compelled to <Col N="2246" /> maintain the drains in the same condition as when they were taken over but still, if liability for drainage were enlarged, as presumably it will be under this measure, it would mean that the local authorities would have to come down to brass tacks at their annual financial meetings and with an already rising rate it would mean a very substantial increase in the rates. With the rates at their present high level, local authorities could not undertake any major expenditure under this Bill; they would be financially unable to do so.  These are matters I would urge, particularly on members of local authorities who are also members of this House.</P>
    <P>Under Section 4 a local authority or a person executing works pursuant to the Bill when it becomes law, or an Order made under it, or any officer, servant or agent of such authority or person, may enter on any land for the purposes of the execution of the works. Anyone who obstructs that person, or any minion of a local authority armed with the necessary powers under the section, shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £10. I venture to say there is not another statute under which a similar power is conferred, without any notice to the party affected.  Under this Bill, without by your leave, a farmer may wake up in the morning to find county council workers putting a drain through his yard.  If he tells them to get out, that he knew nothing about it, he will be hauled before a court and fined £10.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>This may be nonsense to the Minister, but I would like to point out to him that he was so brief when he was introducing this Bill he gave us little or no information, and now we have to try to find out what is implied by the different sections. Perhaps we may provoke the Minister into being a little more verbose in the course of his reply.  I will emphasise <Col N="2247" /> again that there is no right conferred on any local authority, in any statute that I know of, to walk in on any man's private property without notice being duly served.  The Minister may enlighten us as to where these powers lie.</P>
      <P>If it is a question of cutting hedges along the public road, the local authority has power under certain legislation to insist on fences or hedges being cut, but to cut these hedges it is not necessary for the local authorities' officials to trespass on a man's land; they can do the work from the road.  But, before they interfere with the hedge, they have to serve the individual, on whose land the hedge is growing beside the public road, with 21 days' notice and request him to cut the hedge.  If he does not do so they have to apply to the District Court for an order directing him to cut the hedge.  So without any question of trespass being involved where it is a matter of interfering with a farmer's rights, a property owner's rights, due notice has to be given.  Before any local authority could take over a bog due notice had to be given to the owner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take any authority under Government control&mdash;a body like the Electricity Supply Board&mdash;any powers given to such authority up to the moment have been limited to this extent, that before they would be exercised due notice would have to be given to the owner of any property affected.  Before Electricity Supply Board poles are put down in a man's land he gets notice of the intention of the Electricity Supply Board in this respect; not only does he get notice, but a map is served on him setting out clearly the proposed route to be taken with these poles.  The owner of the land then has the right to object. Under Section 4 of this Bill the Minister or the local authority&mdash;mark you, the Minister may exercise rights under Section 4 just as well as the local authority &mdash; without a by-your-leave, without any provision for notice, either personally or through the medium of <Col N="2248" /> the Press, or even notice served by registered post on the owner, whose rights may be seriously affected, the Minister or the local authority can send in their engineers, gangers and men and proceed to drain the land, irrespective of any objection the owner may have, letting in extra water from his neighbour's land, or do any of the things that Section 2 empowers them to do.</P>
    <P>When this Bill comes to the Committee Stage I shall certainly recommend to the House that this authority should not be given either to the Minister or to the local authority unless some provision is made for the serving of due notice on any man whose lands may be affected or on any man whose rates may be affected by the proposed work under this Bill.  I do not think I need elaborate the position under Section 4 any further.  Suffice it to say that at the present moment a farmer's hens cannot cross a neighbouring fence without a right of action accruing, the reason being that hitherto property rights have been respected.  I do not see why we should give either the local authority or anybody else the right to interfere with private property without due notice being given and without making provision to enable people to make objection or claim compensation. Local authorities are generally reasonable. We all know that in the majority of cases where objection is made, particularly in relation to matters affecting rights of private ownership, the local authorities invariably try to meet the objections made.  But it is not merely the local authority that may exercise power under this Bill.  Section 3 of the Bill empowers the Minister to send down his emissary from Dublin to carry out work under this Bill, without the permission of the local authority. As a matter of fact he can do it, as it were, over the dead body of the local authority.  That being the case, it is imperative that we should give some guarantees to those people whose rights may be interfered with under this Bill since their own local authority may not be able to protect them.  It is only right and fitting that we should protect them against the Minister and his officials.  It is possible that <Col N="2249" /> Local Government might have a major scheme about to be undertaken.  The engineering staff might decide to drain a particular river in some backward country district.  Without giving any notice to anybody they may start work on that, leaving the people concerned no chance of even bringing it to the attention of the local authority concerned. A position like that could arise.  The time to remedy a position like that is now, before the Bill passes into law.</P>
    <P>Section 3 confers certain powers on the Minister.  If the Minister is satisfied that a local authority is unable or unwilling to execute any particular work, he can nominate a person to execute such a work and &ldquo;the person shall be deemed to be acting on behalf of the local authority&rdquo;.  Presumably any damages arising as a result of such a work executed by the Minister will, in accordance with Section 5, be paid for by the local authority.  I suggest that no part of Section 5 should be passed.  If there are going to be any judges as to what should or should not be done under this Bill, the local authority should be the authority to exercise such judgment.  We have heard a good deal of talk in the past about the filching away of the powers of local authorities.  The Minister himself has been very loquacious on that subject.  The present Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, apologising for his inclusion in the Coalition Government, gave the County Managerial Act as one of the reasons why he had joined the Coalition.  He said he wanted the Act repealed.  We have had many speeches on the taking away of the rights of local authorities.  Here is a section in this Bill that goes further to nullify what a local authority may or may not do than does any section in the managerial code.  If a local authority in its wisdom&mdash;and the local authority knows the <i>locus quo</i> quite well&mdash;decides that some particular work might do more harm than good, there is nothing to prevent the Minister completely overriding that decision and, irrespective of what the local authority thinks, irrespective of what may suit local conditions and irrespective of damage accruing from such <Col N="2250" /> work, the Minister can appoint his own man and send his workers down vested with all the powers of a local authority to carry out that work over the heads of the local authority.  That is a section I intend to oppose.  That is a section I would oppose, irrespective of what Government might want to take a power of this kind, particularly when the local authority will have the dubious pleasure of paying any compensation that may arise as a result of the carrying out of such works.  This section is also open to all manner of abuses.  I do not say abuses might arise under the present Minister.  But the section is open to certain abuse. Suppose that in the future a particular Minister happened to be in power and a particular henchman of his down the country wants to have a particular job done, irrespective of the rights of the local authority or the local interests concerned, he may prevail upon his Minister to carry out that work and thereby &ldquo;have the laugh&rdquo; on the local authority, because the unfortunate ratepayers will have to pay any claims for compensation arising as a result of such work.  This is not a section one could recommend to the House.</P>
    <P>So far as the works of local authorities are concerned under this Bill, provided due notice is given of them and provided they are carried out in a proper way, the provisions in this Bill are necessary.  It is necessary to give the local authorities the powers to carry out works that affect their own property in regard to the flooding of roads and the flooding of bridges and so forth.  In so far as the provisions of the Bill dealing with general drainage throughout the country are concerned, I find myself in somewhat of a difficulty. I do not know how far this particular measure will replace the works under minor relief schemes or farm improvement schemes.  We seem to have an extraordinary number of Departments dealing with drainage. The Land Commission deals with it. The Department of Agriculture deals with it.  The Department of Local Government deals with it and the Board of Works carries out certain schemes.  You have the Arterial Drainage Board which purports to deal <Col N="2251" /> with the major rivers and now we have this.  I do not know how far it is intended to develop small drainage and large drainage under this particular Bill.  I do know, however, that it will be a waste of time carrying out a number of schemes under this Bill unless the major rivers into which these small drains or rivers flow are done first.  I am also aware that under previous drainage schemes in many cases much more harm than good was done by relieving flooding in one particular place without the major rivers being done; more flooding was created at another place.  If this is done in any kind of an intensive way, if we are going to be draining here, there and everywhere throughout the country under this Bill, without the Arterial Drainage Bill being carried out, it will mean that drainage problems in this country will be multiplied.  We have had no indication from the Minister, in the main, as to the type of drainage work that he hopes to have local authorities do under this Bill.  As the Bill is drafted it appears to me that local authorities would be enabled to carry out practically any type of drainage under this particular Bill.  I am also in a great difficulty to understand how the Minister, or anybody else in this House, interprets what is called &ldquo;public interest&rdquo; under Section 2, sub-section (3) of this Bill.  This particular provision says that he can do these works where land:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;has sustained, or is likely to sustain, damage from flooding, landslide, subsidence or other similar occurence, and that it is in the public interest to afford relief or protection from the damage...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It may be in the public interest to clean a drain that is just relieving, say, a flooded field of potatoes belonging to John Brown, because you might suggest that you were preserving these potatoes for the good of the community. It may be suggested, on the other hand, that a drainage scheme in the public interest under this particular Bill should only be a scheme affecting a considerable number of people or draining a considerable amount of land.  I do not know how this question <Col N="2252" /> of public interest would be interpreted. I do not know how the Minister interprets it.  Therefore, I do not know in what way that particular section is going to limit, if it is going to limit in any way, works to be undertaken under this particular Bill.  I think it is a matter which the Minister might clarify so that we shall know where we are by the time work commences under this Bill.</P>
    <P>I was rather amazed to see that the Minister for Justice, I think it was on Sunday, when speaking at Strokestown, stated that this Bill was being delayed or obstructed by the Opposition in this House.  How the Opposition in this House got an opportunity either to delay or obstruct this Bill, a Bill that was given to us on Tuesday last and the discussion on which only opened one evening here last week, is beyond me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy does not wish to listen to me the people on this side will excuse his absence.  His contribution has not been heard except by way of disorderly interruptions.  The charge that the Opposition of the House are obstructing this Bill seems to be an extraordinary charge coming from a responsible Minister of State in respect of a Bill which was introduced in this House only three days before the Minister addressed that particular meeting.  It just shows the limits to which some Ministers are prepared to go to misrepresent the attitude of the Opposition in this House to measures of this kind.  As I stated last week, there are principles of this Bill&mdash;even the principles briefly set out in the explanatory memorandum issued by the Minister&mdash;which would be acceptable to us but we pointed out and I am again pointing out that we consider this Bill to be a dangerous one.  We consider many abuses may arise under this Bill.  It is revolutionary in so far as in certain cases it infringes on the rights of private ownership and in so far as in some cases it gives the Minister absolute and complete dictatorial powers over even the unanimous view of local authorities.  While we do see <Col N="2253" /> some principles in the Bill that we can support and accept we certainly are not going to swallow it without proper examination as it is our duty to consider some of the implications of subsections of this particular measure. Most of these things that we have raised will be dealt with on the Committee Stage by way of amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would, however, make the position much easier for the House if the Minister had indicated to the House when introducing the Bill what was intended to be done under the Bill, who was going to bear the whole cost of all these claims that may arise under the Bill and as to how he proposes to deal with such major compensation claims as the rights of fishery owners and others that may be affected under this Bill.  These are the difficulties that we have foreseen might arise under this Bill.  If that were done and if, even at the Committee Stage, the Minister is prepared to give the safeguards asked for by me, the Minister will find that the passage of this Bill through the House will be accelerated very much. The Bill, when it is duly amended to cover the points raised by us, will be much more quickly put into effect throughout the country than if we pass it in its present rather peculiar form. The Bill does not purport to repeal or extend any other measure.  It does not purport to repeal any of the existing rights of riparian owners.  It is completely silent on that matter.  I am not satisfied, for instance, even to-day as to whether claims arising under this particular Bill might be dealt with under the Acquisition of Land Compensation Act of 1919, which statute also provides for compensation in respect of any interests in land such as mineral or water rights or easements of any particular kind. The Bill does not expressly repeal any of the measures affecting such claims. It does not suggest even an amendment of any of the powers taken in connection with the arterial drainage scheme.  As I said, the Minister has been silent as to how far it is proposed to substitute works under this Bill for the various drainage works which are being carried out through other measures throughout the country.  I <Col N="2254" /> think we should have some kind of central directing board to deal with this question of drainage; otherwise, because of the different drainage schemes carried out by different Departments, we shall have a duplication of officials, a duplication of engineers and a duplication of expense. I think the Minister would be well advised to state even now how far the Government can go towards endeavouring to amalgamate the different drainage authorities and the different Departments and to try some system of co-ordination for drainage throughout the whole State, instead of having some schemes carried out under this measure by the Department of Local Government and other schemes carried out by the Department of Industry and Commerce, the Land Commission and the various Departments responsible for other work of this kind.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, may I say that it has been suggested by the Minister for Agriculture that no inspector can go inside the farmer's fence in future without a special invitation from the particular farmer?  There are supposed to be 12,000,000 or 13,000,000 acres of land in this country and under this Bill the Minister for Local Government can enter on every acre of these 13,000,000 acres without leave, licence or notice of any kind.  I hope the Minister for Agriculture, with whom I disagree on many matters, will express some of these conservative views of his to the Minister for Local Government who is piloting this Bill through the House and give him some of this advice about the rights of landowners and farmers to ensure that they, at least, will not be interfered with without due notice being given to them and that proper provision will be made for compensation of ordinary tenant farmers affected by the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy MacEntee, speaking in opposition to this Bill, occupied practically 15 pages of the Official Debates, in merely complaining of the simplicity of the wording of the Bill and of the danger arising from its simplicity.  He elaborated at length upon the pickings likely to be made by the legal profession upon any Bill so <Col N="2255" /> simply framed.  I tremble to think what the pickings might be, if the wording were anything more elaborate or more intricate having regard to the contribution we just have had from Deputy Moran who is one of the representatives of the legal profession in this House.  To my mind, as a layman this is a very simply drafted Bill which seems to convey in very simple language, the proposals of the Government to carry out some very necessary work.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacEntee challenged the urgency and the necessity for the work. He asked the Minister why he had not come along to submit some evidence to the House as to the necessity for the work.  He stated that he could easily have got the views of various county surveyors and of many gangers in the country as to the necessity for the work. That is perfectly true but I suggest if the Minister were to take the trouble to submit to the House the list of complaints received from county surveyors, deputy surveyors and gangers, the 15 pages occupied by Deputy MacEntee's speech would not be sufficient to convey to the House the number of complaints of the type for which redress might be sought under the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any of us living in the country must be perfectly aware of the hardships inflicted on citizens, mainly farmers, through the flooding of their lands and, incidentally, the flooding of public roads under the control of local authorities because of the defective drainage in the surrounding areas.  These local authorities were powerless to take steps to prevent flooding and to come to the rescue of the ordinary citizen. I have in mind cases that have occurred in my own county, and that have been going on for years.  In company with a Deputy of the Opposition Party, and the chairman of the county council, I had to call on a wealthy landowner in one district whose land ran along the public road.  There was a river running beside it and the county surveyor was utterly powerless to prevent flooding on that road.  Children going to school in rainy weather had to wait for some friendly farmer to ferry them across the floods on a horse cart and, when <Col N="2256" /> returning home in the evening, the process had to be repeated.  With a Deputy of the Opposition Party and the chairman of the county council we waited on that landowner.  He had refused to contribute towards the cost of an earlier scheme which had been proposed.  We asked his co-operation in a scheme designed to drain his land and his neighbour's land, and to prevent the flooding of the public road. He said he would agree on condition that he was given the stones from the bottom of the river after they were excavated by the Board of Works. That was the contribution he made to the public weal.</P>
    <P>Eventually we succeeded in getting him to agree to a scheme but we did not give him the stones which were utilised afterwards to repair the county roads.  That is typical of the cases one meets in the country.  That road has been relieved only to a very limited extent.  I hope that with the assistance of this measure the local authority will be able to come to the relief of farmers in that area, to release for cultivation large areas that are now frequently submerged and to make the roads safe for passengers and pedestrians.</P>
    <P>Deputy Smith will remember the famous Mulcaire scheme but the portion of the river dealt with under that scheme gave only partial relief.  There is a portion above that that was not embraced in the scheme at all because of the fact that the lands adjacent were not considered of sufficient importance to justify their inclusion.  None the less, the water came down through that particular place.  Houses have been flooded and in one case a man and his family were rescued in the middle of the night and had to be accommodated elsewhere until they could again be restored to their home. These floods inundate the public road and travel down to the village of Cappamore. Without a very generous grant it would be waste of time to tackle that scheme at any time in the past because it could not be done in any economic fashion.  I am hoping that under this measure the county council will be able to come along and <Col N="2257" /> to start work at the top of the Mulcaire scheme.</P>
    <P>Deputies from the districts are also aware that there is frequent flooding on the Tipperary-Limerick border. Thousands of acres of land are frequently flooded and both tillage and bog lands are submerged.  It happened this year and it happened two years ago.  These people are faced with an impossible task in trying to meet their rates and land annuities.  Their families are working just for nothing.  The river there comes out on the public road frequently.  I remember attending a meeting two or three years ago in the district and the Fianna Fáil Deputies from Limerick and other Deputies had to pass through five feet of water on the public road to get to the meeting. They had to get a special car built up with blocks, to get over that flood on the public road from Limerick to Newport.  That has broken out again this year.  The land is the property of a private owner, who has not a shilling to do repairs.  There is no drainage board in existence, and the Limerick County Council has no responsibility. The only hope was to cut the bank of another river and allow the water off, so they cut the bank of the Anna to draw off the waters from the Newport river.  The work was carried out by the county council, who had to get special authority to do it.  I wonder who would be inclined in that locality to object to the county council having these powers under this measure, which means that they could put their engineers on this job to deal with the Newport and Mulcaire rivers to clear the banks and prevent flooding so that the farmers and their families could rest in security that their diligence and toil put into the land would not be swept away in the next flood.</P>
    <P>I wonder where all these fears expressed by Deputy MacEntee and Deputy Moran arise, about the terrible vandals who are going to rob and destroy the farmers.  I feel that one of the banes of this measure will be that the Minister will not be able to provide sufficient money to meet the schemes which will come from all over the Twenty-Six Counties.  I know the reception it will get from the people <Col N="2258" /> and I am sure every Deputy knows that also.  Wherever flooding occurs, the people will be saying: &ldquo;What about my river?&rdquo;  I have been speaking to some of them.  We have two cases of flooding in one part of my constituency and another in another part.  There is the case of the Morning Star River, which is well known in this House.  The Lower Morning Star was drained by a grant and the Upper Morning Star was also drained but, peculiarly enough, the Mid-Morning Star was not.  Anyone can realise what happened when the upper and lower portions only were drained.  The Golden Vein at its very heart, at Elton, is flooded every year by the Morning Star River.  These lands produce the finest crops of any land.  Houses are flooded every year and the public road also, while the land and crops are covered over.  For 16 or 20 years the people have been clamouring about the Mid-Morning Star River and questions have been tabled year after year, but it has never been reached.  There was a Drainage Act in operation many years ago.  It was only a temporary measure going to schemes under £1,000, but then it lapsed and with it any hope of getting the work finished.  The Mid-Morning Star was not done, though the upper and lower were done, so in some places the people are still being flooded out. They are looking forward to this measure.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to Deputies on the other side of the House, if their concern is the fear the farmers may have about the powers being used under this Bill, to realise that the farmers are the people who will clamour for the operation of the Bill.  I know that deputations have been prepared already to Limerick County Council to ginger them up for fear they may be slow in doing their job.  There will be deputations from South Limerick, from East Limerick, and I am sure West Limerick will not be far behind, to force the county council to go on with the work.  If the Minister can raise all the money for the demands, I will be happy about it.  I am also concerned here about the employment of our people, if they are put to work at this most necessary job, which is a <Col N="2259" /> preliminary and a prelude to a further scheme of land drainage.  You cannot have the land drainage envisaged by the Minister for Agriculture if you do not do the initial work that is necessary, so as to take away the silt and repair the embankments at the bends and turns.  That work on the rivers, and subsequently on land drainage, will be invaluable to this country.</P>
    <P>I am amazed that anyone should suggest that there may be objection or trouble about claims for compensation. The county council will be doing the work and they will be responsible for compensation for any damage they do, as the Bill says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where any land sustains damage ...the local authority concerned shall pay compensation...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I cannot think of anything more simple than that.  The minimum of damage will be caused by the engineers and staff operating on behalf of the county council, since they themselves will eventually have to pay the compensation.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEntee discovered nothing in the bed of the rivers only tin cans and bicycle tyres and wheels.  He never found that alluvial deposit which is normally found there and which, when spread over the land, is of very great advantage as one of the finest fertilisers.  It is amazing what one cannot see when one has not got the proper glasses.  I would ask every Deputy to approach this Bill as a generous attempt to carry out essential work, that will bring relief to the farmers themselves on the one hand and to the rural labourers on the other hand, who will be doing work of a remunerative character for themselves and the nation as a whole.  It will bring about a spirit of fraternity between the workers and the farmers, in making a great effort to relieve unemployment and build up the prosperity of our country.  This is essential to a further scheme of land drainage and the only fear I have is that the Minister may not be able to find enough money to deal with all the applications coming in to avail of this measure.</P>

      <P>Deputy Moran spoke of the irresponsibility of a Minister of <Col N="2260" /> State when he said that Fianna Fáil were trying to obstruct this Bill.  I am going a bit further than the Minister of State&mdash;I think they would love to sabotage it.  They are afraid of two things, quite obviously&mdash;first of all, that there is going to be work in rural Ireland; and, secondly, that some drainage is going to be done.  I forgive poor Deputy MacEntee&mdash;&ldquo;a little knowledge is a dangerous thing&rdquo;&mdash;for not understanding simple diction in relation to its legal interpretation; but I do not deem it as anything but sheer dishonesty on the part of Deputy Moran, who has some training, and who has fulminated in the inflammatory way he has done on this simple Bill.  He could do immense harm by the arrant type of nonsense he was speaking here for some 40 minutes in my hearing to-day.  He deliberately pretends to this House that he cannot read a simple section as it is there. He and Deputy MacEntee have two of the grandest imaginations and two of the most weird imageries about this Bill that I feel it possible to conceive. Why is that?  This is something that their Party when in office were not able to conceive and were not able to bring before this House in a practical form.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill on behalf of everybody I represent in West Cork, irrespective of their political allegiance, because they welcome it.  They can see in this, not only work for the unemployed in rural Ireland, but also the improvement of their own property. Deputy Moran finished his address by talking about inspectors from the Department of Local Government being able to wander throughout the length and breadth of this land with a roving commission.  That is a wilful statement to make here, against the national interest, to try to arouse groundless fears in the general community which this Bill is endeavouring to help.  I call it downright national sabotage.  That is exactly what the other side is trying to do, without having the courage to say so.  I think they would love to vote against this Bill, just as they would have loved to vote against the Republic of Ireland Bill, but they had not got the courage.</P>

      <P>If the calf-tangler and the goat have finished, I will proceed. I welcome this Bill because I am glad to see that the Minister has had the courage to take the power he will need to stop the type of obstruction which Fianna Fáil are going to try to create in the local councils.  We know perfectly well that it will come.  This sudden sham interest which Deputies opposite can develop in the farming community amuses me.  This Bill is going to do good to the country, and they do not like it.  It is going to do good to the country without discrimination against person or place.  It is going to give the farming community throughout the length and breadth of the country a fair and reasonable chance to get certain necessary improvements made by the local authority, and if the only excuse Deputies opposite can offer for delaying the passage of this Bill is the vapourings of the lay lawyer and the blatant dishonesties of the alleged trained solicitor, then I suggest they throw their hats at it and let the Minister get on with the job of putting this drainage work into full operation, of putting people to work and getting some realistic return for money expended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some time ago, the Leader of the Opposition referred to money as going down the drain in connection with this Bill.  He apparently cannot comprehend that this Bill is going to improve, everywhere it is put into operation, the capital value of the land in the area in which it operates.  We have heard preached from all sides of the House the doctrine that the basis of our economy is the farmer and that the only way in which real development can be brought about is by, as rapidly as possible, increasing the productivity of the land.  Here is a ready means of helping to bring about that increased <Col N="2262" /> production and what contribution do we get from Deputies opposite? Honestly, I should be inclined to laugh, were it not so pathetic.  Go through this Bill from beginning to end and criticise as you will the powers the Minister seeks in Section 3.  I say that, unless he got these powers, you would have queer, petty interference with a scheme which is for the national benefit.  The Opposition delight in petty interference and hit and run methods.  I am glad the Minister is not going to give them the chance and I am glad that the Fianna Fáil dominated county council down the country which wants to continue its obstructive tactics will be under the strong hand of the Minister who can force them to do what they should do in the country's interest.</P>
    <P>The fears expressed by Deputy Moran and Deputy MacEntee are what I describe as the real strength of this Bill.  The Minister is undertaking an immense task, but he is undertaking it on the right basis.  This is a wide scheme for national improvement and I do not think that any powers which will ultimately result in the achievement of this type of drainage can be too wide.  I know perfectly well that the fears aired here, in the inflammatory way in which they were aired by Deputy Moran, are merely political catchcries.  Deputies opposite know as well as any Deputy on this side that the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; has a definite meaning and that &ldquo;public interest&rdquo;, to people on this side anyway, has a real meaning and is not the Party club system.  What are their real fears?  I think I can crystallise them as I did before by saying that their fears are that work will be given and productive work done.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moran sees some reason to take exception to the proposed method of granting compensation and he wants to know on what basis the District Court will assess compensation.  He asks that question, and he is supposed to be a trained lawyer who knows perfectly well that the decision of any court deciding such a matter will be arrived at on the evidence adduced before it.  He apparently envisages claims running into thousands and <Col N="2263" /> thousands of pounds because he evidently thinks the Minister is going to have a few expensive experiments like the pipes in Santry Court.  I have not got any of these fears and I am satisfied that whatever rights to compensation anybody may have as a result of certain works under the Act are well safeguarded.  Deputy Moran did not like to be frank with the House and tell us that the machinery is there whereby a person who is not satisfied with the award of a District Court can take the normal course of law.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to go through each section in detail or to follow the tortuous arguments adduced by Deputy MacEntee, but I will say that if, when he enjoyed the privilege of being Minister for Local Government, Deputy MacEntee had thought even half as tortuously as he is now thinking, he would not have walked into many of the mistakes he made.  This is a bit of whitewashing&mdash;a long, loud bleat from the Opposition because now has come into this Chamber a measure which will bring immediate and practical relief to certain types of flooded land.  What else is it going to do?  There is a lot of moaning and groaning about rising unemployment.  We should all, like men, face the job and pull together to try to get this Bill through as quickly as possible in order to give as much employment as we can.  That is our job and the duty we owe to the public. This House should not have to listen to the empty vapourings that we have had to listen to when we are facing the problem of getting practical work done and putting people in rural Ireland into employment so that they will be able to maintain and sustain themselves here.  I am tempted to be provocative.</P>

      <P>We are not going to enter into any controversy in regard to these matters, but we are going to examine this measure for what it is worth line by line to see what its implications are before it becomes law, and I think any Opposition or any Party in the Dáil is entitled to that privilege.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My interest in this measure arises from certain problems in the constituency I represent.  Do I understand from the Minister that this Bill is introduced specially to obviate certain interference or damage by recurrent flooding that occurs in various parts of the country from time to time after heavy rainfall?  When there is serious rainfall, as there was in 1946 or early in 1947, certain parts of the River Deel in County Limerick overflow their banks.  The part of the river between the mouth of the Deel and a place called Newbridge gets seriously flooded on such occasions.  It is believed that certain rocks and <Col N="2265" /> obstructions, weirs and other things, cause part of the flooding.  Will the Limerick County Council be empowered by this Bill to remove these rocks and other obstructions?  Will the county council be able to do the same thing between Newbridge and the town of Rathkeale, where flooding occurs and where there are rocks that are supposed to be the cause of the flooding?  Will it be possible to go further upstream and continue the work that was initiated voluntarily in the Feohanagh and Castlemahon localities during the summer of last year?  Will it be possible for the local authority to drain smaller rivers like the Bunocke?  That little river floods its banks and creates serious flooding on the main road between Newcastle West and Drumcollogher.  Does it mean that that type of work can be done by the county council, and is it the intention of the Minister that the work will be financed out of the Central Fund? If that is the case, I do not see why that guarantee should not be written into the measure.  The Minister should have in the Bill guarantees and safeguards for the local authorities with regard to finance, because if the Limerick County Council or any other county council carries out this type of work and discovers afterwards that it has no guarantee that the money expended will be paid out of the Central Fund it will be a nice prospect for the local authority and the ratepayers of the county.  The financial guarantee that I understand the Minister gave in his opening statement should be written into the Bill.</P>
    <P>What about the difficulties that are experienced sometimes in regard to these schemes?  I refer to the difficulties of farmers who feel that their interests will be injured rather than anything else.  There must be some reasonable provision for cases of that kind.  The provisions in the Bill can be worked by local authorities to bring certain local reliefs to people who are very seriously affected by flooding at various times but, with regard to the general implications of the Bill, we will have to wait to see how it works because, in the matter of <Col N="2266" /> drainage, particularly the clearing of streams and rivers, as we have seen under the 1924 and the 1925 Acts, one man's meat may be another man's poison.</P>
    <P>It is suggested that the cause of the serious flooding in the lower parts of the Deel near Askeaton in recent years is the partial drainage scheme on the Deel that was carried out at Ballyallinan and near the town of Rathkeale in 1933 under the 1925 Act, that the clearing and drainage that was carried out at that time in that part of the river created more serious flooding further down.  Unless work of this nature is started at the mouth of the river, let it be a large river or a small river, a main artery or tributary, the work will not be satisfactory and will create difficulties for people along the banks of the river who had not up to then been subject to flooding.  To a certain extent that has been the experience as a result of certain work that was carried out in the river Deel.</P>
    <P>There is another case also, a concrete example of work which is needed in County Limerick and it is in connection with the River Maigue.  Part of the main road between Limerick City and Foynes becomes seriously flooded on occasions, the road at Court near the village of Kildimo.  The cause of this flooding has been in recent times the bursting of the Maigue from its banks near Adare.  That occurred during the August flooding of 1946 and the then Minister for Lands came down and saw the thing for himself.  As a result of what he saw he got it well repaired, an action which was very much appreciated because the Land Commission had no responsibility.  There was a trust fund but it was exhausted, or rather, there was supposed to be a trust fund but it did not really exist because the investments were bad.  As a result of the intervention of the then Minister for Lands, Mr. Moylan, the banks were put right, but another portion of the banks burst later&mdash;I think it was in 1947.  I do not know if the Land Commission intervened, but judging from what the Minister for Lands told me in reply to a question here early in 1948, <Col N="2267" /> the Land Commission did not.  Would it be possible under this Bill for Limerick County Council to rectify flooding of that nature?  We would like to have all these points cleared up and I, personally, am very anxious to see the guarantee which the Minister gave here in the Dáil when he was talking about this some weeks ago and when he introduced the Bill written into the Bill, the guarantee that he would meet 100 per cent. of the cost of any work that the county council carried out because I do not want to see the ratepayers mulcted for any portion of the work envisaged in this measure.</P>
    <P>These are the only comments I have to offer regarding this measure.  There are, however, certain safeguards with regard to the rights of private individuals which should be written into the Bill and I hope that will be done when the Committee Stage comes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Donnellan) Michael Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Donnellan)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is necessary, I feel, that I should hold the House for a few moments with reference to this Bill which is before the House.  I must first and foremost congratulate the Minister and his Department for having been so bold as to take over a measure such as this and carry it out.  The Bill is designed more or less for the removal of obstructions but, from what I see, one of the greatest obstructions to be removed from the House and from the country is the Fianna Fáil opposition to this Bill.  It is real obstruction.  I have listened to Deputy Ó Briain and surely he has made a case for a terrible amount of work in County Limerick under this Bill which is very necessary.  I could excuse Deputy MacEntee and Deputy Moran because Deputy MacEntee and Deputy Moran know very little about rural Ireland and the things necessary in rural Ireland.  I can forgive them, but when the ex-Taoiseach stood up here and said that this Bill should not be rushed, that there was a danger in rushing the Bill, then I say that he did not know anything about rural Ireland either.  I believed and expected the moment the Minister introduced this <Col N="2268" /> Bill that within two hours all stages would be given to him because of the great necessity of rushing the Bill as far as rural Ireland is concerned and the necessity of the work it is to do. It is urgently needed if you are to be able to do something for the people who are unemployed and want work&mdash; and it is the great cry of Fianna Fáil that there are thousands upon thousands of them.  When you realise that the work is so very necessary in this country and consider the Fianna Fáil cry of the great necessity which exists to relieve unemployment, the sooner this very necessary Bill is let through the House the better without this cheeseparing.  Work will be carried on where those people will get work and very necessary work.</P>
      <P>I was one of those who had discussions during the past few months with the Minister in connection with a very necessary Bill of this description to fill the gap between the 1945 Arterial Drainage Act and an Act such as this, that allows local authorities to go in and do work such as the removal of obstructions and the raising of roads that are flooded.  Such work is very necessary, and I am quite sure that when Deputy Smith comes to speak on this Bill he, too, will appreciate its great necessity.  I am quite sure that when he was in the Board of Works, where I have been for the past while back, he, too, was tormented with people coming and asking when is the work on such and such an arterial catchment area going to be carried out and he realised, I am sure, as I do, that work is needed in roughly 40 major catchment areas and 60 minor catchment areas.  It will be many years before all are reached.  There are obstructions such as trees which have fallen across rivers and silting under bridges, and it is very necessary that these obstructions should be removed so that, for the time being, at any rate, people will be relieved of flooding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Naturally, I have to be very grateful to the Minister and to Local Government for having decided to take over and carry out this work themselves, because they have relieved the Board of Works.  Our first objective is arterial drainage, and if we had to <Col N="2269" /> take over this work is would take from us many of our staff whom we badly want at the moment&mdash;in fact, we are looking for more every day to carry out work under the Arterial Drainage Act.  I congratulate the Minister and his Department for taking it over and relieving us of the trouble of getting away from our very important work of arterial drainage.  Another great reason for Local Government taking it over is that this work is so very necessary at the moment, and instead of one body working it, you will have 27 local authorities.  They know what work is locally necessary and the work will actually be done much faster by them than by one single authority.</P>
    <P>This kind of false propaganda which is being carried on by the other side of the House would remind you of the speech of Deputy Lemass in Fermoy when he stated that a certain document put forward by the Government of this country so that they would get the aid they were entitled to was a false one. I can compare this Bill with nothing other than Marshall Aid for rural Ireland, Marshall Aid from the Minister for Local Government where he is giving 100 per cent. of the cost, free grants for work of that description.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly, Murphy aid or Marshall Aid as far as rural Ireland is concerned.  Deputy Ó Briain had some false propaganda.  Liars need to be very careful, to stand by their lies. He wondered how much the grant was going to be but before he was finished his speech he knew it was going to be 100 per cent.  If those Deputies on the other side of the House think that false propaganda will carry them very far they are mistaken.  Any amount of lies, and any way they may try to despise a very necessary measure like this, will not worry me.  I believe that the more rope such a class of people get the higher they will hang, and the sooner they cut one another down the better it will be for Fianna Fáil and this country as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy MacEntee had to throw a slur on all local authorities.  Actually, he said, they were responsible.  He also said that there was no money in <Col N="2270" /> this Bill.  Money in a Bill is something we never heard of in our lives.  He need not worry.  The moment this Bill becomes law there will be plenty of money for it.  He saw no work under this Bill&mdash;according to him a few hundred pounds would be all that would be spent; just a little work to remove silt under bridges.  I believe he sees nothing in the nature of work to be done on rivers except the removing of old bicycle wheels and tin cans and silt from under bridges.  There must be silt in his two eyes if he sees nothing in obstructions except stuff of that description.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>He is worrying about what will be done when all these old tin cans and bicycle wheels have been removed.  As I say, he need not worry. He should pay a visit now to the Brosna and see what is being taken out of it. It is spread out on the land and it is actually making land for the people. It may surprise Deputy MacEntee to know that we have applications from different counties for over £40,000 worth of works.  I wonder if Deputy Killilea, Deputy Kitt or Deputy Beegan will vote against work of that description being done in County Galway?  I wonder if Deputy Corry will vote against work of that kind being done in Cork?  I do not believe they will. I am quite sure that Deputy Beegan&mdash; who is one man in this House, at any rate, who knows rural Ireland as I know it&mdash;would be one of the last men in this House to agree with Deputy MacEntee or the like of him when he says that such work should not be carried out.  To my mind, this is the most important measure that has come before this House for a long time.  It will help to alleviate the distress that many of the people in rural areas suffer in regard to flooding.  This Bill proposes to carry out repair work which will, in many cases, eliminate such distress altogether and the people will have a chance until such time as the Arterial Drainage Act can be enforced to do the work properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I certainly am proud of our Minister for Local Government.  As a matter of <Col N="2271" /> fact, instead of describing this work as &ldquo;Marshall Aid to rural Ireland&rdquo; we can, to use Deputy Cowan's phrase, describe it as &ldquo;Murphy Aid.&rdquo;  I believe that no Deputy in this House, no matter what Party to which he may belong, will vote against this Bill if he knows rural Ireland and knows what is required there and is honest about helping it.  In fact, I challenge any Deputy from rural Ireland to vote against the measure.  If any such Deputy does so, he is voting against the measure not because he has the interests of rural Ireland at heart&mdash;and such a man is a greater obstruction to this country than any of the obstructions the Minister for Local Government is going to remove under this Bill.</P>

      <P>It was because of a row I had in the Cork County Council, where a law prevented us from taking steps to save a whole side of a country that was being flooded and where, were it not for the timely interference of the then Minister for Lands.  Deputy Moylan, something between 200 and 300 acres of wheat would have been lost. That was in Ballycotton.  I understand that the £50 Deputy Seán Moylan put up for doing that work was never paid to the workers.  I hope the Minister for Lands will put that down in his notebook.  We will be calling for it one of these days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is anything that would frighten me about this Bill it is the speech which the Parliamentary Secretary has just made&mdash;I should be glad if he would not leave the House for a <Col N="2272" /> moment.  I have haunting memories of the Parliamentary Secretary coming along here at one period after making a big speech up the country and telling us that, in relation to every road connecting two roads in every county, the Parliamentary Secretary was going to do them all and the county ratepayers were going to be relieved to that extent.  I remember rushing down and putting all the county surveyors in Cork County on the war path.  I think that, between us, we collected a couple of hundred thousand pounds' worth of stuff and sent it up to him&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>You did not send up the money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but the Parliamentary Secretary did not get one of them yet, nor the cash from his pal the Minister.  As I have said, I welcome this Bill.  The moment I heard the statement by the Minister for Local Government in this House I went down and got on the war path.  In my little part of East Cork I have already £50,000 worth of work there waiting for him&mdash;so nobody need say that I am not co-operating to the fullest extent.  I want all the cash I can get out of him.  The work is there waiting to be done.  I am aware of very many serious problems that we have had to face in the past owing to not having this particular legislation. The £48,000 required for flood damage would not have to be faced in Cork County to-day had we possessed those powers previously.  I had to put down a question here to the Minister for Lands last week in connection with one job where a landlord is sitting like an iceberg perched at the mouth of a river&mdash;as a result of which something like 200 or 300 acres of land have gone into a complete swamp.  That scheme will now be put on the list.  When we were caught in the Ballycotton problem we immediately went to our county surveyors.  A bridge was endangered and two sluices that were put in by the county council were rendered completely useless by a sand bar outside. The county surveyor, with all the goodwill in the world, had no power to touch it.  The Land Commission, when called in, said it was not their baby&mdash; it was nobody's child.  The Minister <Col N="2273" /> for Lands, however, stepped in and said: &ldquo;As far as we are concerned, we will give something to get rid of this,&rdquo; as it was pointed out to him that there was going to be very serious deterioration of land up the river and he did his part.  That scheme has gone in for consideration under this Bill.  As I said, we have already handed in between £50,000 and £60,000 worth of schemes from the Midleton area.  We have a whole lot of them spread out as far as Mitchelstown in my constituency.</P>
      <P>The only fear I have about the Bill is that it will disappear like the roads of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance.  I think, however, the Minister for Local Government can be relied upon in connection with these matters as he has some experience of them.  I think he was present when we had trouble with the law advisers with regard to these matters and I am sure that he will see them through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the town of Fermoy there is very serious flooding owing, I believe, to a weir and some islands below the bridge.  I understand that the county surveyor is at present engaged on that job and that as a result of this enabling legislation he will be able to remove that weir.  Of course, there is a second part of this Bill which raises a rather serious matter and that is the question of compensation.  That will definitely arise in connection with Fermoy.  However, without this Bill, we were going to be left with Fermoy town constantly flooded and without any way of remedying it.  The Minister has made a definite statement with regard to the financial provisions of the Bill and said that there will be a 100 per cent. grant. I should like to know what will be the position of the local authorities in regard to compensation of that kind.  In this case, I understand that the mill water is backing up and I understand that there will very definitely be a question of compensation in regard to putting in something which will work the mill instead of the river water. Therefore, I think that the Minister should spread his powers further and give a guarantee that local authorities will be saved from compensation in connection <Col N="2274" /> with these matters because it would mean a lot.</P>
    <P>Then along the whole valley of the Blackwater from Fermoy to Lismore hundreds of acres of the best land are flooded every year.  I do not know what the salmon fishing gentlemen think of it, but I am a farmer who sees valuable land flooded.  Whatever we may think of fishing, we must consider the unfortunate man who endeavours to put in a crop on the land and finds it wiped away in one night by the floods caused by the weirs and the other obstructions down along the river.  That is why I am anxious that the Minister should consider the question of providing compensation from the Central Fund as against compensation from the local authorities.</P>
    <P>So far as the other parts of the Bill are concerned, I am also concerned as to the disposal of the stuff that will be taken out of the bed of these streams and rivers.  Some of it will be good stuff.  I do not think any farmer would have any complaint if 20 or 30 tons of good soil were thrown out on his land, but, if there are 20 or 30 tons of rock thrown out, it will be a different story.</P>

      <P>Sometimes.  That material could be shifted up the river a bit and used for embankments.  I suggest that <Col N="2275" /> when a river is being cleared the farmers should have a voice as to where the materials should be put. That would be the easiest way out of it.  There is no doubt that, with goodwill on all sides and co-operation as between farmers and local authorities, this can be made a very good measure and do a lot of good.  If that particular river which I had the pleasure of putting the Minister for Lands wise to is dealt with under this scheme, I wonder where the landlord will come in?  I hope he will get out.  I saw what the game was.  This landlord sold an estate to the Land Commission; he reserved for himself the duck pond&mdash;I cannot call it anything else.  The sluice being on his land, he lets it get into disrepair so that the water will go back along the good land and the duck pond spread out and thus he will be able to get more for his shooting rights.  We had to face a similar difficulty a few years ago in the Blarney district but, through the good offices of the then Minister for Lands, Deputy Moylan, we got over that and, in fact, got a little bit out of the landlord to help in doing it.  Practically through the whole of my constituency there is a whole lot of good which can be done by this measure.  Therefore I welcome it frankly and whole-heartedly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the troubles and difficulties of these farmers.  When proposals are put before the Cork County Council in regard to the matter that we are discussing, the county surveyor tells us: &ldquo;Well, unfortunately, this would mean that we would have to clean portion of the bed of this river and we have not the power to do that.&rdquo;  I have seen that happen repeatedly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have seen the main road from Midleton to Castlemartyr flooded for three weeks, and in the end a couple of local men had to go out at night and break a hole in the wall so as to let the water off.  They had to do that because the county council had no power to touch the wall in order to get rid of the water.  I got that work through here with the then Parliamentary <Col N="2276" /> Secretary to the Board of Works under the 75 per cent. grant as a rural improvement scheme.  I got that job done, and I got the whole side of that country relieved from flooding.  When we on the county council decided to give a little grant towards that work we were immediately stopped by the regulation then in force and could not give it.  The result was that the full 25 per cent. burden fell on the farmers of the district who were not getting a great benefit from the work.  The principal people affected were those living in the town of Castlemartyr and the people using the main road between Midleton and Castlemartyr. With problems of that type before us, is it any wonder that I should welcome the Bill?  I thank the Minister for introducing it, and I make no bones about saying so.  There are, as I have said, flaws in the Bill that can and will have to be remedied on the Committee Stage.  My only trouble is that I cannot find any provision in the Estimate for the Department of Local Government to meet the payments which will fall to be made under this measure.</P>

      <P>Neither is there any financial provision in the Bill itself.  I think there should be, both as regards the grant and the compensation to be paid.  It is the duty not only of Deputies in opposition but of all Deputies to examine the Bills presented to us, to put their fingers on the flaws they see in them, and seek to have those flaws remedied in Committee. How many times have we seen Bills passed through this House and, a short time afterwards, amending legislation introduced to remedy defects in them after a lot of damage had been done under the principal Act?  It is, as I say, the duty of every Deputy to examine carefully the Bills that come before us, and particularly of the gentlemen in the legal profession who profess to have knowledge&mdash;I do not know whether they have it or not&mdash;of these matters.</P>

      <P>If they have it, I hope they will give us the benefit of their assistance.  As I have stated, my only dread is the amount of cash that will be made available.  From the information that has been put before us on the Cork County Council by the county and deputy surveyors, I expect that the total amount of work that will be handed in to the Minister by the county council in regard to these works will represent an estimated cost of in or about £250,000.  I can say that every bit of that work is necessary.  It is work that I, at any rate, am anxious to see done.  We have had complaints from every village and from every school in regard to flooding.  The unfortunate children have to walk on top of the road fences to get to school in the mornings.  The result is that they go into school cold and wet and they are miserable for the day.  We in Cork wanted to remedy these things, but we found that the county council had no power to do so.  It could not interfere with an adjoining river, even though the river overflowed its banks and turned the road into a river bed.  All that is necessary work, urgently in need of being done.  I deprecate the attitude, or the tone if you like, that has been adopted here towards any criticism.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Of the Bill or the flaws that are in it, real or imaginary.  It is only by pointing them out now and getting them remedied that you are going to make this a good workable Bill.  If you do that, then it is going to be of enormous benefit not only to the rural community but to the urban community as well.  I suggest that can be done if the Bill is properly examined in Committee, and if the flaws we see in it are remedied by way of amendment.  I have never seen a Bill come to this House that had not flaws in it, and I have been here for 22 years.  If this Party goes to the trouble of examining the Bill section by section and of pointing out the flaws that we see in it, I do not see why umbrage should be taken, or shouts of opposition raised when we ask to have those flaws remedied. <Col N="2278" /> Apparently, some Deputies think that the proper thing to do when a Bill is brought in by their Minister is to say that it is the loveliest thing in the world and to shove it through, while at the same time one little flaw in it may be the means of holding up the execution of important work and of forcing this House, at a later stage, to pass an amending Bill.</P>
      <P>In my opinion, this Bill proposes to remedy a crying need and to correct a serious flaw in the present position so far as local authorities, who are responsible for the maintenance of roads, are concerned.  It will relieve the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, as he has stated himself, of a lot of work, and will relieve the unfortunate farmer of the payment of 25 per cent. of the cost that he would have to meet if his scheme got through with the Board of Works. Every river and every road in my area subject to flooding have been brought in.  I hope that the Bill will be passed, not as it stands, but with the necessary amendments that, I suggest, should be made to it.  Let us get the Bill through as quickly as possible so that the Act may be put into operation at the earliest date.  That is the way that I look on this Bill, and I make no bones about saying so.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is a crying necessity and has been so for quite a long time.  It is common knowledge, at least to rural Deputies and people who know the Irish countryside, that drainage is one of the most important works that could be undertaken all over the country. The present Government have made very great strides towards remedying something that has been seriously interfering with production.  The Government are aiming at the removal of something that has been fast robbing many of our farmers.  The problem of <Col N="2279" /> flooding is not confined to one area.  It is bad in almost every area.  Some places are suffering more than others. I challenge any rural Deputy and I challenge any county councillor from any part of the Twenty-Six Counties to say that in his area there is no need for drainage, for the implementation of the Arterial Drainage Act, for such a measure as the Minister for Local Government has now before the House, or for such a measure as the Minister for Agriculture recently outlined.</P>
    <P>The whole case for the Bill boils down to this, that agriculture is our principal industry.  I think all sides of the House are agreed on that now. There was some difference of opinion about it some years back and it was contended that agriculture was only a secondary industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>We can judge people more by their actions than by their words.  We well remember how the farmers were hit.  Most farms were in a pretty bad state and Deputy Corry had the courage and decency to admit that some people were practically robbed.  These people are still paying rent and rates for their farms as if they were enabled to reap a profit off their land, and as if it were not flooded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since this Government came into office the drainage problem has given Ministers a great deal of worry A lot of Government time at meetings has been spent discussing this problem and how to tackle it.  Now that we have put the Arterial Drainage Act into operation to tackle the big job, and now that the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Local Government are going forward with their own schemes, it only remains to put them into operation at the earliest possible moment in order to change completely the face of the country and to stop flooding.  I have no doubt that all <Col N="2280" /> these schemes will give the farmers an opportunity of working usefully the 4,000,000 acres that the Minister for Agriculture spoke about.</P>
    <P>Most of the land, nearly all of it, that suffers from flooding is the very best of our land.  The low-lying land along the river banks and in the valleys is the very richest.  In most cases it is the rich alluvial deposit, the fertility of which could scarcely be exhausted if our farmers had an opportunity of tilling it.</P>
    <P>But there is another aspect of the Bill that we must not lose sight of, because it is just as important, and that is the employment that will be given under those schemes.  At present there is a great deal of talk about unemployment.  There is a certain amount of unemployment all over the country and it is desirable to reduce it as much as lies in the power of the Government to do so.  In the country districts I cannot visualise any more productive form of labour than reclaiming the land that is flooded for the purpose of either of the schemes I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>A good many people seem to think that the Minister for Lands is responsible for drainage in all areas.  There is an historical reason behind that&mdash; that the Congested Districts Board and the Irish Land Commission were responsible for drainage.  They were, but in very small areas only.  I was requested to meet deputations and to see various areas in many counties.  I am quite familiar with most of the problems in my own county, but I was asked to go to Roscommon, Galway and Limerick.  I am quite familiar with all the areas Deputy Ó Briain referred to.  I was in Cork, Kerry and Tipperary and many other counties. The trouble could be all boiled down to the outfall of the rivers.  The outfall in the fullest sense of the word is really a matter for the Board of Works people when they put the Arterial Drainage Act into operation.  Any other scheme will only result in taking the water from one place and transferring it to another; in other words, taking the trouble from one set of farmers and perhaps destroying another set.  For that reason we are putting the Arterial <Col N="2281" /> Drainage Act into operation as fast as we can.</P>
    <P>Deputy Smith, who was in charge of the Board of Works and who gave a certain amount of attention to this Act in all its phases, must realise that the Arterial Drainage Act, left to itself, would be a long time coming to the rescue of some smaller areas.  There are about 40 major catchment areas and 61 or 62 minor catchment areas. The Board of Works people will do well if they can put two, three, four or five of these schemes into operation. When they have the machinery purchased they will do well to get five of the major schemes running side by side, taking them in their order of priority. Suppose five of them are running side by side, it will take 40 years to come to the end of the 102 catchment areas. It will thus be seen that this problem calls for immediate action.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>All I remember when the Arterial Drainage Bill was going through the House is this, that unlike the attitude of the Opposition now&mdash; Labour and Fine Gael composed the Opposition then&mdash;we gave every assistance to the then Minister for Finance, who is the President to-day.  If you look up the records it will be found that he paid a compliment to the useful and constructive criticism that we offered to the Bill.  There was nothing approaching the kind of criticism that this measure is getting now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Arterial Drainage Act has a wide scope and it is to be hoped that in whatever catchment area it is in operation its implementation will be 100 per cent. efficient.  The present Bill is not one whit less important than the Arterial Drainage Act is.  Before we can appreciate fully the ultimate effect of these measures we must go back for a little while into history in order to find out why it is that we are now so subject to flooding when 25, 30 or 40 years ago there was no problem of this nature.  In the years that are gone a different system of land tenure obtained.  That was before the Congested Districts Board and the Land Commission came into being.  The <Col N="2282" /> landlords and the big landowners were interested in drainage.  Whatever other faults we may have to find with them, we must all admit that they knew a thing or two about drainage.  Boards of trustees were established by them to take charge of the principal rivers and watercourses.  They kept those rivers and watercourses in such a condition that the water ran rapidly away to the sea.  They had not the authority we have now.  They had not the equipment or the machinery such as the Board of Works is using at the present time on the magnificent drainage operations that are being carried out by it; but they certainly did an efficient job of work with the methods at their disposal.</P>
    <P>Since those boards of trustees have fallen into disuse the cleaning and deepening of the rivers annually have likewise fallen into disuse.  Our rivers and principal watercourses have been silting up over the years.  The weeds have not been cut.  The particular section of the Arterial Drainage Act of 1945 which empowered the county councils to take over the watercourses in 1946 and maintain them in the condition in which they were at that time has fallen far short of what was originally intended in the Act.  As soon as the county councils were handed over the job of maintenance we all thought that that was an end of the problem. We know now that things are not working out according to plan.  As a matter of fact that has been a disappointing failure in our experience.  This Bill proposes to remove the fetters with which the local authorities find themselves shackled and to allow them to go ahead and put the rivers and watercourses into a condition similar to that which obtained many years ago, thereby relieving flooding all over the country.  In that way it will be possible to go ahead with the scheme for land reclamation propounded by the Minister for Agriculture.  It is very appropriate that the two projects should go hand-in-hand, because one will make the work of the other easier; otherwise, the scheme enunciated by the Minister for Agriculture might be difficult to implement in certain areas without the assistance of this particular measure.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2283" /> Deputy Corry and several other Deputies asked what was to become of the stuff taken out of the rivers.  What was ever done with it in the past except to dump it on the bank?  Deputy Corry said something about carrying it upstream.  I would ask any Deputy who does not understand the situation to go down to the Brosna and see what is being done there.  In a normal stretch of the Brosna River 3,250,000 tons of silt and so on have to be removed&mdash;that is, rocks, bushes, trees, old roots and other useless material of that sort.  There is no place one can put that except along the river bank. Deputy Moran said we must protect the people's rights.  Of course we must protect their rights.  That is exactly what this Bill is doing.  We are protecting the rights of the man who pays land annuities to the Land Commission and rates to the local authority who, at certain times of the year, has nothing but a sheet of water on which to pay rates and annuities.  There are many farmers who put in tillage crops in the spring and find themselves, as a result of a wet August, with no crops of any kind.  The question then is, what is the best thing to do?  Is it better to dump a certain amount of stuff and thereby cause a certain inconvenience to farmers or is it better to leave them with ten, 15, 20 or 30 acres of flooded lands, as the case may be?  I have never known anything to be done with the stuff excavated from a river but to dump it on the bank. Any Deputy who thinks it can be disposed of elsewhere has a poor knowledge of rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>I fail to understand the extraordinary opposition offered to this Bill.  It has met with a stream of unintelligent abuse.  Perhaps the explanation for that lies in the fact that possibly the Opposition now regret that they had neither the vision nor the foresight to introduce an intermediate measure of that kind.  Perhaps they do not like to see the present Government utilising this scheme as a method of employing those who are now idle.  Perhaps they do not like to see these unemployed used on productive labour.  There seems to be no other explanation.  Deputy <Col N="2284" /> Smith may smile at that.  The employment that will be given under this Bill is certainly a matter for amusement, as far as I can see.  I am as conversant with life in rural Ireland as any Deputy.  I know this is a sound and excellent Bill.  Deputy Donnellan very aptly described it as Marshall Aid for rural Ireland; some other Deputy improved upon that and said it should be called &ldquo;Murphy Aid&rdquo;.  That is exactly what it is.  It is going to give enormous relief to the farmers all over the country.</P>
    <P>Practically every Deputy on the Opposition Benches held that specific financial provisions should be laid down in the Bill.  When introducing the Bill the Minister made it quite clear as to where the money would be obtained.  Where, then, does the doubt arise in the minds of the Opposition? Has the time come when a Minister's statement is doubted?  Is that distrust born of something else?  Is it born of the fact that when Fianna Fáil were in power they made statements that they knew in their hearts they had no intention of implementing?  Which is it?  I would like an answer.  Vast numbers of people in the country think that, like the last Government, we intend passing this measure and then shelving it, as the Arterial Drainage Act and several other measures were shelved.  I want to take this opportunity to assure those people that we are in a hurry to put this Bill through and to put it into operation as quickly as possible.  The county councils are not being asked to contribute anything. The Minister has said that the Central Fund will pay.  That statement is as binding as if it were embodied in the measure itself.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moran raised the question of claims.  I do not envisage many claims arising under this.  The people have lost so much through flooding that they think they will never see the job done. Deputy Ó Briain made a case for the Bill, on the one hand, by pointing out all that could be done and should be done in his county.  That is perfectly true.  I was in County Limerick myself last November and it is as a result of what I and other members of the Government saw there that this Bill is now <Col N="2285" /> introduced.  We saw rivers that were absolutely choked up.  We saw one good area in the Croom area of County Limerick where, under the supervision of the local Curate, the young men went out and actually cleaned the choked rivers themselves&mdash;a job for the Board of Public Works.  It came to my mind at that time that I wished that such a public spirit was abroad in many other counties besides County Limerick.  I wish to take this opportunity to pay them this tribute, that finer or better work I never saw.  One of the men who was engaged in arranging the work told me that something like 1,200 full days' work was put into this job, free of charge, costing absolutely nothing to anybody.  It gives one some idea of the enormous amount of work they did.  Such people as that deserve all the assistance they can get from the Government.  It just goes to show the urgency of the problem when these people were forced, through being robbed year after year by floods, to take such very practical action themselves.  I have seen in Limerick and in County Cork where a river overflows its banks sometimes changing its course to a main road or a by-road completely for the duration of the flood period.  That is one reason to give this Bill its free scope through the House.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that various kinds of safeguards should be put in. The Bill as introduced by the Minister is very naked, if you like to put it that way, for the very reason that we do not intend to allow any red tape whatever to hamper the local authorities from undertaking the work as quickly as possible.  That is exactly what the Opposition is asking for, that we tie the Bill up and, like the Arterial Drainage Act and others, just make it ineffective and inoperative.  We have no intention of allowing that.  We want the local authorities to be free to do the work at once.  The local authorities are actually free under this measure to purchase light drainage machinery such as that used in the Brosna scheme and in other catchment areas where arterial drainage is actually being carried out.</P>
    <P>The question of bringing claims <Col N="2286" /> before a District Court has arisen.  I see in the Arterial Drainage Act an identical provision which Fianna Fáil put through the House some time ago. No question was then raised about it. Now another Bill is going through with the same provision in it to allow people who think their land has been damaged by the operation of this Bill to come before the District Court.  The District Court is not the last court in the land.  There is nothing that says a person cannot appeal to a higher court. If the jurisdiction of the court is to allow the claim up to only £10 there is nothing to stop a person who thinks he has a proper claim from taking it to a higher court.</P>
    <P>That is all I have to say on this measure.  It is a simple measure but it gives local authorities very wide powers which is exactly what it is intended to do.  As I said a moment ago, it is not intended to allow a local authority to be hampered by any red tape.  The rights of the citizens are very carefully protected in this Bill.  I should like to point this out.  Deputy Smith should, I think, know all about trying to get schemes done from his experience when he was in charge of the Board of Works when the minor employment schemes, rural improvements schemes and others came into operation.  A crank is always to be found in an area who, though perhaps not afflicted with whatever is doing damage in the locality&mdash;perhaps a by-road might be under repair and the man lives 40 or 50 yards from the main road&mdash;stops the scheme.  The very same thing applied to drainage schemes under the Board of Works in the past.  It is about time to say to that crank, &ldquo;You must fall in with your neighbours.  You cannot hold up the rest of your neighbours.&rdquo;  A man may happen to be on high ground and free from flooding but the drain is at the tail end of his farm and he will not allow the work to go through. However, the fact that that man is holding up the scheme and not permitting it to go through might be the cause of robbing ten, 15 or perhaps 100 farmers further upstream.  Will any Opposition Deputy stand up and say that that man should be allowed to hold up the whole scheme because all that is being done to him is that work <Col N="2287" /> is going to be done on a public watercourse which happens to flow through his land?  Perhaps some of the refuse that comes out of the river or drain in the course of the drainage might be dumped on his bank.  That is exactly all he will suffer from.  Nobody is going to deprive him of his rights in any shape or form.  Any man like that should have enough of common citizenship in him not to stop a good and useful scheme just because he may not benefit from it.</P>
    <P>Even the crank can bring the local authority into the District Court if he has been injured or outraged in any way.  The Constitution is there to safeguard his rights, no matter what the Bill says.  The Deputies on the Fianna Fáil Benches should know that, if they do not.  The Bill cannot outrage any citizens' rights which are set out carefully and safeguarded in the Constitution. No Act of this House is allowed to run contrary to the Constitution.  I would have expected more from the Opposition.  When my Party, Clann na Talmhan, first came into the House in 1943 our attitude was that when a measure came up, if it were a good one we would support it, if we found anything wrong with it we would say so.  However, the shower of unintelligent abuse which has been let loose on this Bill shows that this Dáil is in a very precarious position.  Any Dáil that has not a good sound Opposition is in a precarious position.  The Opposition have not offered any constructive criticism of any measure that has come in here since they went over there 13 or 14 months ago.</P>
    <P>Even though some may smile and sneer at that fact, remember that an Opposition has its duty and that duty is just as important, in a sense, as the duty of a Government.  Their duty is to point out exactly where a Government is not doing its duty or where, perhaps, it may be exceeding its duty when introducing legislation of any kind.  It is the duty of the Opposition to give their criticism, to expose any faults in the proposed legislation and to do their best to get it put right. While legislation is going through the House it should not be made a source <Col N="2288" /> of political scoring which has been tried, but ineffectively, by the Opposition in this case.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill to the House as a member of the Government.  It is long overdue and I would ask all Deputies not to clutter it up with red tape which may make it ineffective but to be of help to the local authorities who will do the work when the Bill has passed through the two Houses and has become law.  It is our duty first, to get the land of this country free from flooding and secondly, to give useful employment to the unemployed at the present time.  Do not hinder either of these two good works by any unfair criticism.</P>

      <P>I am glad that I rose to-night because if I had spoken on Thursday evening I would have adopted a different line to the one I am going to adopt now.  The new line I am going to adopt in my approach to this measure is due to the speeches I have heard this evening from Deputy Ó Briain and Deputy Corry.  Both these Deputies approached the Bill in a reasonable way.  Their approach was much different from that made by Deputy MacEntee and Deputy Moran. I think that probably the week-end has had something to do with that change of attitude, that Deputies who visited their constituents during the week-end must have discovered that the obstructive attitude adopted here both by Deputy MacEntee and Deputy Moran had not the approval of any responsible or serious-minded person in the country.  I think it was a great pity that the duty of opposing this measure was given to Deputy MacEntee instead of to Deputy Smith because he approached this Bill in a spirit of bitterness.  He made a vicious onslaught on the Minister and on the Bill. Spite and malevolence exuded from every pore during that speech lasting a couple of hours.  Now we have it stated by two Fianna Fáil Deputies that this is a good Bill.  Deputy Ó Briain has considerable works in Limerick to be done under the Bill and Deputy Corry has £50,000 of works to be done.</P>

We could have had amendments from all Deputies who think that this Bill in any way infringes the rights of individuals and the Bill could be law this week, a beneficial Bill as it is now admitted to be.</P>
      <P>Why did Deputy MacEntee adopt the line he took?  Deputy MacEntee saw in this Bill a Bill to provide employment in the country.  He saw a Bill that was going to do a lot of good in the country and the only idea that actuated him was: &ldquo;We must hold this Bill up until after the Easter recess. We must hold it up as long as possible so that there will continue to be unemployment in the rural areas.&rdquo;  In other words if Deputy MacEntee could maintain unemployment in rural areas, he might hope to gain some political advantage from it.</P>

      <P>It has been changed because it has been found in the country to be wrong political tactics. <Col N="2290" /> I say that Deputy MacEntee's idea was to delay the passage of this Bill so that the schemes of employment, for which we are all crying out, would not be put into operation as early as they might be and so that the Party the Deputy represents would be able to gain some political advantage from it. Now that is completely changed.  The week-end has made a considerable difference.  Now we find this Bill welcomed but the damage has been done in so far as there has been this avoidable delay.</P>
      <P>I heard Deputy Moran also discussing this Bill.  He purported to discuss it as a lawyer and he expressed certain opinions in regard to sections of it.  He said that if the rights of individuals were attacked, if they were poor people or small farmers, they would not have anybody to take up their case and fight it for them.  He said that no counsel was going to spend days arguing a case in the High Courts in Dublin concerned with the rights of individuals. I want to say in regard to that&mdash;and I have seen many cases&mdash;that there is no counsel at the Irish Bar who, if asked to fight a matter of right as between an individual and the State, would not do it if the case were to last a fortnight. The leaders of the Irish Bar, the busiest counsel at the Bar, have given their time, often several days, for the purpose of fighting for the rights of individuals.  That is well known.  I can speak with personal knowledge.  I have been personally concerned in cases in which there was a fight for an individual's rights.</P>

I do not pretend to know very much about the law but I was completely amazed by the interpretations given to these simple sections by Deputy Moran.  Of <Col N="2291" /> course, I am not concerned about Deputy MacEntee, as he has no claim to speak as a lawyer&mdash;although he did mention one particular matter that indicated some slight knowledge of the law of libel.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;should know something about the law of libel.  This is a nice, neat little Bill, a well drafted Bill, that in a few very easily understood sections gives to the local authorities very substantial and necessary powers and gives to the Minister, in case a local authority does not want to do its duty, powers that ought to be exercised in the interest of the community.</P>
      <P>We all know of cases throughout the country that are affected.  I have been approaching the Board of Works in regard to very substantial damage done in an area down near Athlone.  Substantial damage has been done to the road and to a big area of land down there, by an obstruction in a stream and that obstruction could not be removed because the owner of a mill claimed mill rights.  There has not been machinery in that mill for over 70 years, and there is no roof on it; nevertheless, asserting her rights, the mill owner refused to co-operate with the local people in having the work done.  As I have said, there has been damage to the roadway there by flooding. Under this Bill, the Westmeath County Council will have authority to go in there and remove that obstruction, to the benefit of a whole section of the people living there in South Westmeath.</P>
      <P>There has been objection to Section 4, which gives authority to an officer or servant of a local authority to enter on any land for the purpose of the execution of the works.  Furthermore, the Bill says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;A person who obstructs or interferes with the exercise of the power <Col N="2292" /> conferred by sub-section (1) of this section shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding £10.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There has been substantial objection to that, but when I look at the Local Government Sanitary Services Act&mdash; piloted through this House, I presume, by Deputy MacEntee&mdash;I find the very same provision, that an officer, servant or agent of a sanitary authority may enter on any land and there do all things reasonably necessary for that purpose; but in case of obstruction, under Deputy MacEntee's Act, the fine was £25 and £5 for every day that the offence continued.</P>

      <P>That is what offends me in regard to this approach to legislation here.  I agree entirely with what Deputy Corry said, that it is the duty of every Deputy to examine a Bill line by line, word by word, and even comma by comma; and when a Bill is introduced that may interefere with the rights of individuals, it is our duty, as a Legislature and as Deputies, to examine it carefully and to ensure that, when that Bill is finished in this House, it is as good as we can make it.  There has been no such approach to this Bill by Deputy MacEntee.  We have had abuse and bitter attack, sustained over a period of two hours of Parliamentary time, used by Deputy MacEntee, for what purpose?  For the purpose of obstructing this Bill and for no other purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not like to talk with any authority in regard to Section 5, which provides that if damage is done the person concerned may apply to the District Court.  I do not claim to speak with authority or knowledge, but it has been suggested to me that a claim founded under that section would be a claim in tort.  I do not adopt that view at all.  The interference with the right of the individual is given by this Bill: it is this Bill that authorises the interference with the right, that is the tort; but the Bill provides that where damage is done the authority to assess <Col N="2293" /> the damage, if there is no agreement with regard to it, will be the District Court.  That is why I said at the beginning that, having examined this Bill carefully, I thought it was a well-drafted and neat little Bill.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and would like to see this stage completed as early as possible, so that we may proceed to the Committee Stage to consider any amendments and have the Bill made law at an early date.  We have a duty in that respect.  I feel personally that I have a duty to contribute in every way I possibly can towards any and every measure that will alleviate and end unemployment.  I feel that perhaps there are claims being made for this Bill that are too high, but I am examining it, not from that point of view but from the point of view that it will do good and beneficial work and at the same time provide good employment for a very substantial number of our people in the rural areas.  A Bill that has those beneficial results is one that is worthy of the assistance and cooperation of every Deputy.  I am glad to pay a tribute to the Minister for introducing this measure&mdash;as I have, on occasion in the past, criticised him&mdash; and I hope we will be able to get it through all its stages here as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MatthewOReilly" hpid="Mr. M. O'Reilly Mr. M. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree thoroughly with Deputy Cowan in the last statement he made.  I am aware, and almost every Deputy is aware, that there is quite a good deal of unemployment and that anything we can do to relieve it should be done.  That, of course, brings about a little danger, that is, that we might over hurry this measure and cause the same results as have been brought about by almost every drainage measure passed through this House, with the exception of the Arterial Drainage Act.  I stood up mainly to try and convince the Minister for Lands, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Deputy Cowan, that this Party had no intention whatsoever of voting against this Bill.  In order to clarify their minds on that, may I say that, from the records, it appears that when Deputy Moran was speaking it was Deputy <Col N="2294" /> Cowan who interrupted, as given in column 2190, and asked:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Are not Opposition Deputies bound to vote against it anyway?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy Moran replied:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I can assure Deputy Cowan that no speaker on this side has expressed his intention of voting against the principles of this Bill.  There are certain matters in connection with the infringement of rights which I propose to point out and that we will vote against.  We will endeavour to protect the individual by amendments which will be submitted later.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There is no indication there that anybody on this side is going to vote against the Bill.  I think the Bill is absolutely necessary, but, in saying that, I do not say that we have solved the whole problem and do not let any of us think that.  Recently I looked back as far as 1800 when the landlords were dealing with this problem.  They had their own money which they put up, as the Minister is now putting up the money of the State&mdash;the county councils will not have to put up any money.  They went on with the work and they removed obstructions and made embankments, and they settled the question of the debris by making embankments of it, where necessary; but they came up against the question of compensation, because, when they flooded the other fellow, the row started.  From my experience, no matter what we do here.  I am afraid we will flood the other fellow until the arterial drainage schemes have been completed.  We will certainly pass the water on to somebody else, and, as soon as that happens, the row starts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1924 Drainage Act was put into operation for the relief of unemployment. The Free State Army was then being disbanded and there was the problem of employing these men.  The 1924 Drainage Act was passed, but it turned out to be a complete misfortune. The courts were full of cases and justices were hurrying out to view the results of it and coming back and telling the state solicitor: &ldquo;I could not possibly do anything in this matter &mdash;the man is flooded out.&rdquo;  Men were charged for drainage who were living <Col N="2295" /> on hillsides, and, in order to give employment, new drains were cut, with the result that men who, until then, were not flooded and who had reasonably dry land, were immediately flooded, because of the relief given to the other fellow.  The whole scheme collapsed, as we all know, and that is one of the chief reasons why it is essential that we should criticise this Bill to the last letter.  The longer the Bill is under consideration, the better it will be, the happier and the more content we will all be and the more employment it will give.</P>
    <P>Drainage is a most involved business as I have pointed out&mdash;time has proved that.  I do not know how many Drainage Acts have been passed, but the British Government tried to deal with the problem and we tried to deal with it.  Therefore, we are bound, even though it may mean leaving the unemployed idle for an extra day or two, to see that this measure is successful, mainly because the Government is putting up the money.  Every one of us knows well that, in these circumstances, people who feel aggrieved will go wholeheartedly for compensation. It is one of the things which will attract them, and it is our business to discuss this measure carefully and to see that it is amended with a view to getting all the benefit we can out of it.  I do not say that you are going to get enormous benefits from it.  I believe you will get some employment, but the benefits will not be very many, and any of us who know anything about drainage know very well that the benefits could not be many.</P>
    <P>Take the case of the Boyne&mdash;each of us knows the rivers in our own constituencies best.  Suppose we took all the rocks and other stuff out of the Boyne at Trim.  We would simply flood Navan, and we would then have to take the stuff out of the river at Navan and pass it on somewhere else.  All around the Boyne, there is drainage to be done, as in the case of the Blackwater. The drainage of the Blackwater was started as far back as 1800 and we are still at it.  I hope the Minister will be able to solve the problem, but let him not get annoyed because he is criticised. <Col N="2296" /> When I heard that annoyance given expression to.  I began to ask myself what was behind it and what they were afraid of.  Never be afraid of criticism.  Let us criticise all we can. That is what we are here for.  That is the only function we have here and it is the Minister's function to listen and to benefit from the criticism, so let him not resent it or people will suspect there is a reason for his resentment.</P>

      <P>Deputy Corry said that he was practically the father of this measure.  Some time in the winter of 1947, a decision was arrived at by the Cork County Council, in the making of which, I must say, Deputy Corry took a very prominent part, with regard to a particular part of his and my constituency, Castlemartyr.  Arising out of that decision, legal advice was solicited and senior counsel was engaged to give advice as to what authority exactly we had as a council to enter on land and to remove such things as silt which was causing damage to our bridges and roads.  Senior counsel's advice was that, even with the consent of the landowner, we had no authority.  At the time, an Act was being piloted through the House by the then Minister for Local Government, Deputy MacEntee, and we appointed a deputation to interview him and to point out the hardships and the destruction which were being caused by floods due to the passage of water under the bridges being impeded.  We asked him to receive that deputation about November or December of 1947, but that deputation was never received.  We asked him then, through our officials, if he would include in the Sanitary Services Act of 1948 a section which would give us authority to do this and that was turned down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this Government took over, some of us identified ourselves very intimately with this matter and at frequent periods pointed out to the Minister the damage being caused both to the roads&mdash;I regard that as even a secondary consideration&mdash;and to the fertile lands adjoining the rivers.  When Deputy Corry is good, he is very, very <Col N="2297" /> good.  I shall not quote the remainder of the nursery rhyme.  Deputy Corry did his own share in the Cork County Council to try to expedite the introduction of this Bill, and I have no hesitation in giving him credit for it.  I could mention some of the areas that year after year are flooded but which would never come under the arterial drainage schemes.  They are flooded because the bed of the river has been silted up and would continue to be silted up until some provision was made.  That provision is made in this Bill to have the beds of rivers cleaned. You will find in the beds of the rivers more than tin cans and bicycles.  I am sure that provision will be made to bring these tin cans and bicycles to a dump, the dump into which, when this Government took over, we put the ex-Minister who gave our roadworkers twopence a day, that is, the dump of mismanagement.</P>
    <P>I do not believe rural Fianna Fáil Deputies are against this Bill.  Every one of them knows that it would be political self-immolation in their various constituencies to go against this Bill.  Deputy Corry struck the right keynote this evening when he congratulated the Minister.  I have not heard very much of the debate, but I have noticed that some Deputies are very perturbed about the ramifications of the Bill, particularly some of the legal people on the Fianna Fáil side of the House.  Perhaps the wish is father to the thought.  They may see things in this Bill that lay people cannot see. They may visualise a little harvest and are putting out propaganda from this House which will be an incentive to people to seek protection of the court. Some of these gentlemen are adepts at that.  They say a little of what they mean and imply the rest.  However, I am sure that the rural Deputies, some of whom are suffering personally as a result of flooding and who are getting a lot of trouble from their constituents who are asking them to get something done to alleviate flooding, will not under any circumstances countenance an objection, even by the brass hats of their Party, to this Bill.</P>
    <P>There is one thing I would like to <Col N="2298" /> bring before the Minister in regard to the implementation of this Bill, and that is, the wages of the men who will be carrying it out.  I am very sorry that Deputy Corry is not here now inasmuch as I heard him quite recently looking for extra wages for the people who carried out the rural improvements scheme in Castlemartyr.  He mentioned that these workers were in the river for a very long time.  He had the sympathy of Cork County Council but, unfortunately, we were only carrying out the scheme; we were not paying for it.  I would like to draw the Minister's attention to the case of these people who will be carrying out the scheme.  I do not know whether to put the work in the category of undue hardship or danger.  I think both could be considered fitting terms.  Anybody who is continually in a river, cleaning it, runs the risk of developing rheumatism and sciatica.  I am sure that T.J. Murphy, known as the Minister for Local Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Of course, I should speak for my own area.  I do not believe there will be any local objections to the carrying out of what is envisaged in this Bill.  People will realise that, for once, they are getting a break that will improve the fertility of the soil and will improve their financial position.  There is also involved a saving to the various county councils inasmuch as a certain sum of money has to be budgeted for year after year for the maintenance or repair of roads which are absolutely destroyed by floods.  I conclude by saying that I hope we will get more Bills like this.</P>

      <P>I fail to understand the resentment that is obvious in the various speeches that have been made from the Government Benches of any criticism that has been offered by the Opposition.  It is the duty of the Opposition and, incidentally, of all Deputies, to examine measures such as this and to point to any flaws that may be contained therein because no Bill was ever introduced, and I suppose no Act was ever passed, that was perfect. I think that far from resenting the criticisms, the Minister and the members of the Government should welcome criticisms of a helpful nature pointing out any defects that may be contained in the Bill as it stands.  I do not suppose the Minister contends that the Bill is perfect or incapable of amendment and I hope that on the next day he will accept certain amendments which seem to me to be obviously necessary.  I was intrigued listening to the Minister for Lands, who got quite hot and bothered because of the criticisms of some of the spokesmen on this side and particularly when he referred to the fact that the rights of the people were enshrined in and safeguarded by the Constitution.  I had only to cast my mind back to 1937 when the Constitution was being passed through this House, and I wonder would the Minister for Lands or those associated with him care to look up the records and find out whether there was any criticism then of that measure or of other measures introduced by the previous Government.</P>

    <P>As far as we are concerned, there is general agreement as to the necessity of this Bill.  Those of us who represent rural constituencies and who have experience of living in rural Ireland know that a measure of this kind is absolutely necessary.  I also know that something of this nature was necessary to come to the aid of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and I hope that my interpretation of this Bill is correct, particularly with regard to its <Col N="2300" /> scope.  I take it that the measure is intended primarily to remove obstacles in river beds&mdash;as is stated here in Section 2&mdash;the widening and deepening of watercourses, the making of drains and the repair of walls and embankments. On some of these I would like a little information.  Take sub-section (4) (a) of Section 2&mdash;the making of drains.  I would like to know how far the Minister intends going in that direction.  I presume that it is not intended on that to step in and intervene regarding the Minister for Agriculture's £40,000,000 or £50,000,000 scheme.  I hope there will not be overlapping. The question of embankments is mentioned here and I would like some information as to what exactly is meant by the word &ldquo;embankment&rdquo; in that particular section.  Is the Minister taking powers in this Bill to repair embankments of such rivers as the Fergus and Shannon which would, in my opinion, be very large works to undertake under a measure of this kind, or will this measure be confined to smaller rivers, streams and watercourses that are not within the provision of the 1945 Arterial Drainage Act?</P>
    <P>With regard to the powers given to local authorities to carry out works in this Bill, I think the Minister would be wise to secure the consent of the local authorities and not to use the heavy hand where local authorities are concerned. I can hardly visualise any local authority opposing a measure for the relief of flooded land anywhere in their district and I think the Minister should pause before he would override the decision of a local authority.  If the county council of a particular county decided that certain work for some reason known to them with their local knowledge should not be carried out, I think he should pause before he would send somebody to do that work against their will and wish.  It is only natural to assume that a county council, particularly as the moneys will come from the Central Fund, would be only too eager to provide all the schemes necessary and possible in their respective areas with a view to having them carried out as speedily as possible.</P>
    <P>With regard to obstructions that <Col N="2301" /> arise particularly at bridges, it is time that county councils got such powers as are necessary.  We have all seen in various parts of the country where in time of floods a sudden downpour of rainwater rushes down from the mountains or higher lands and sweeps away bridges because they are an obstruction and sweep out on to the roads so that we have often seen roads rendered impassable for a considerable period of time.</P>
    <P>On the question of compensation, I should like to have an assurance from the Minister that some compensation should be given to people who actually suffer damage, genuine real damage, not the cranks who, as a previous speaker said, are found in every community in the country who seek to get into the law courts to get some compensation to which they would not be entitled.  Ordinary farmers, however, whose lands are flooded on account of action higher up the river should have access to the courts and to compensation in excess of the amount to which the District Court is limited.  The District Court should have the authority and the increased jurisdiction to give reasonable compensation to people suffering loss as a result of action taken upstream to relieve flooding of a river.</P>
    <P>The principal danger I see is that if drainage is undertaken at a high level the released waters might inundate lands further down leading to actions in the courts, and it would be possible that one action of that kind could hold up a whole scheme.  We have seen recently where one action against the Land Commission held up work for a long time and the Minister's hands were tied pending the decision of the court, and the Minister should see that a similar situation would not arise when this measure is enacted.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Lands, speaking on this Bill, said that county councils will be empowered to purchase machinery such as that which the Board of Works have operating at the present time.  I wonder if the Minister is quite correct on that.  Will each county council be empowered to purchase machinery such as the Board of Works have operating on the Brosna?  I think we should be <Col N="2302" /> made aware of the truth or otherwise of that statement because that machinery is, of course, very expensive and would mean a tremendous expenditure on the part of the county council. If the Minister gives the assurance that they will be allowed to purchase machinery, and if he is prepared to foot the Bill, then the county councils will have no complaint under that heading.</P>

      <P>There is another matter in connection with compensation to which I should like to refer.  Local authorities will have to foot the Bill with regard to compensation.  I think that they should be protected against the possibility of having to face a large number of legal actions.  After all, if there should happen to be large amounts involved, as in the case of, say, fishery rights and mills, involving pretty hefty sums by way of compensation, I am afraid&mdash;having regard to the present high rates in every county in Ireland&mdash;that if another impost is added it will adversely affect the interests of the community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. B. Maguire Mr. B. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill has a very strong appeal to anyone who understands the needs of rural Ireland.  As has been said by many speakers, this measure is long overdue and, apart from the employment which will be provided under it, it will render permanent benefits all over the country. There is hardly a road that you travel for any distance that is not cut off by flooding, the traffic having to be diverted in consequence.  Very frequently, too, you come across parts of towns that are subject to occasional flooding and, due to the absence of <Col N="2303" /> machinery by which these inconveniences could be remedied, that situation has continued and people were inconvenienced and the owners of property suffered loss.</P>
      <P>I think that one of the most important things in this Bill is that it brings up to modern requirements the general question of ownership of land and property. In the old days when laws were passed under which the title of property and ownership of property was so rigidly guarded, the property in this country was owned by comparatively few landowners.  In the course of time their place was taken and their property and the assets of the country were divided amongst a very wide section of the people.  It is only right, then, that the law should be brought up to date and that ownership in property to-day should not be as rigid as it was when the laws were first passed. The needs of the people these days are considered of primary importance.  In the days when comparatively few landlords owned the whole property in this country the ownership of property was of far more value and, in the eyes of the law, it was regarded as something sacred, to be preserved in its entirety without regard to the needs of the people.</P>
      <P>In recent years Governments have assessed the value of the people.  They have come to realise that they must, out of State funds, provide the amenities of life for every human being. Houses are being built for people at State expense.  The water supply, sewerage and other facilities are provided out of public funds.  It is in conformity with modern needs and modern progress that this right of ownership in regard to land and property of all sorts should no longer exist inviolably in the hands of the individual but that, where required, it should be amenable to the needs of the people.  Therefore, I regard this Bill as a valuable progressive step towards bringing control of our property generally in line with modern requirements and modern needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt at all, having listened to some of the speeches, that <Col N="2304" /> most of the criticism on this Bill has been very fair.  I do not know why Deputies on the Government Benches should complain that the criticism has been unfair.  I do not think it has been unfair but I do think that, undoubtedly, snags will arise all along the line.  I compliment the Minister who has introduced this excellent Bill.  However, no matter who might introduce a Bill of this importance with all its complications&mdash;no matter how well worded, well prepared and well planned it may be&mdash;snags are bound to arise.  It has been for the purpose of seeking information and of pointing out the fact that such snags may exist that there has been criticism.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed when the Minister for Lands stated that the Bill aims at improving existing watercourses.  I think the Bill itself includes the right of building drains.  If we are confined to operating over the existing watercourses we will very often find that we are spending money on something that will continue to give obstruction.  We should have power to alter the course of a stream, if such action should be required.  I hope the Bill does not limit action to merely following the existing courses of the streams which it is proposed to clean.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that care should be taken at this stage in regard to one aspect of this Bill.  We have in existence now a major drainage scheme. We have also a drainage scheme, which is proposed to be operated by the county councils, known as the arterial drainage scheme and now we have this scheme.  How these three schemes are to be correlated so as to work in unison without overlapping is a matter that requires serious investigation by those responsible for these operations.  To rush in wildly merely for the purpose of providing immediate employment&mdash;a very ideal outlook, no doubt, and a very necessary one&mdash;without a prepared plan as to how far this present scheme is to operate would be unwise.  We must examine how far this measure will operate for or against the scheme under the Department of Agriculture and how far it will finally be dependent on the major scheme.</P>
    <P>I am sure nobody will say that my <Col N="2305" /> criticism is unfair criticism because, after all, I do welcome the Bill.  However, with my knowledge of local conditions in rural areas I am constrained to say that I see difficulties and the possibility of snags arising&mdash; snags that might prove serious&mdash;and losses of public money unless the matter is carefully gone into in advance.</P>
    <P>The question then arises of how far this scheme will improve conditions in the drainage areas that were handed over to the county councils under an Act a few years ago.  The law as it stands constrains those now responsible for operating those drainage areas to keep the drainage areas in the condition in which they were when they were handed over originally from the Grand Juries to the county councils and the Board of Works.  That meant that no authority in charge of these drainage areas dare interfere so far as the lowering of the level of the watercourse as it then existed was concerned. There might be obstructions in the form of gravel or rock&mdash;probably minor obstructions&mdash;the removal of which would be of substantial help. The law, however, prevented any interference with the obstructions by the county councils in these drainage areas. Will this Bill give power to the county councils to alter the existing drainage districts for which they are responsible and set aside the law under which they were established and under which they are now compelled to operate?  Will it give power for the altering or removal of fishing weirs and, if so, to what extent?  Will it give power to deal with the use of water for power purposes, such as the driving of mills etc., and, if so, to what extent?  These are factors that I am afraid will delay the operation of the work in many districts unless the matter has been fully thought out in advance and full plans made so that all these obstacles may be completely overcome.</P>
    <P>Where it is intended to enter upon lands for the purpose of opening a watercourse which is flooding a bridge or county road, I hope it is the purpose of the Bill to complete the work in such a way as to cause the outflow to be fully absorbed.  Temporary measures <Col N="2306" /> merely for the relief of flooding on a county road or other place which will increase the flooding down stream would be highly injurious, very damaging and very irritating to the public and would in itself destroy the purpose of the Bill.  I hope the scheme visualises the largest measure of drainage necessary to ensure that where water is released, work on the watercourse will be pursued so as to allow the outflow to be carried away without interference with somebody's property.  These are a few criticisms which I offer.  I say the Bill is a magnificent one and is welcomed by all Parties.  It will be doubly welcomed in the country and the Minister responsible for it will be applauded by the people in the rural districts and the towns who have been affected by flooding for many years.  I say good luck and God speed to him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Madden</NameTxt>
      <P>I will.  I will say language that does not improve the tone of the debates or add to the dignity of the House.  I am glad to see that there is a definite change in most of the speeches made this afternoon.  Since the advent of national Government here constructive and beneficent legislation has been passed for the benefit of all sections of the community. During the time of the last Parliament the late Judge Overend declared that a certain drainage scheme was of doubtful validity.  In my opinion, however, no measure has ever been introduced in this House of such national importance as this measure which embraces within its ambit all sections of the people, both rural and urban, because they will all be affected by it.  As Deputy Maguire said, this Bill is long overdue, and I think the Minister is to be congratulated on its introduction. During the week-end there was a <Col N="2307" /> chorus of appreciation of it from the farmers in my constituency and, indeed, in the whole County of Limerick.</P>
      <P>I listened with attention to Deputy MacEntee's speech last Thursday.  As one of the Front Bench members of the Opposition and a Deputy having unique experience in Ministerial offices, I thought we would get from him a reasoned and constructive speech. What did we get?  An exhibition of complete ignorance of rural conditions which I hardly accept.  It is hardly possible for Deputy MacEntee, having had the experience he had of Parliamentary administration, to be so ignorant of rural conditions and of the necessity for and the urgency of the Bill introduced by the Minister.  If I am not satisfied that complete ignorance of rural conditions was the real and driving motive which prompted his speech, I must arrive at another conclusion&mdash;that it was bitterness against the chief architect of this Bill, the Minister for Local Government, assisted, of course, by the others who form the Executive of the Government. I am forced to that conclusion.  I am speaking quite honestly.  I expected constructive and reasoned criticism in a temperate way from him.</P>
      <P>I have learned quite a lot to-day, however.  Some of the criticisms offered by Fianna Fáil Deputies&mdash;a couple of them at any rate&mdash;were very helpful to the Minister and conducive to removing any little imperfections which there may be in the Bill.  I welcomed them. That is what we are here for.  We are here as a board of directors selected by the Irish people to administer their affairs in a proper manner and for the good of all the people and not to fling undignified and improper epithets across the House.  I said that I was amazed at Deputy MacEntee.  I propose to quote now from the speech which the Deputy delivered here on the 31st March, 1949.  Speaking at column 2147 of the Dáil Debates, he said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;This Bill is being rushed, and it is being rushed without any justification. Where are the vast public interests that are at the present moment being endangered by reason <Col N="2308" /> of the fact that this Bill is not law? What public edifice is being undermined by floods or water?  I should have thought that one of the difficulties that we are experiencing at the present moment in this country is, perhaps, a shortage of water&rdquo;;&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>Can you imagine that?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <P>He went on:</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;&ldquo;but, in any event, where are these vast tracts of land that are at present endangered; where are the valuable public properties that have been jeopardised or damaged by reason of the fact that this Bill has not become law?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked what public institutions were being endangered?  I answer&mdash;the basis of our whole economic structure, the greatest institution that we have&mdash;agriculture&mdash;is being ruined.  Many months ago Muintir na Tíre invited the three Deputies in my constitutency in the western part of Limerick to a meeting which was representative of ten or 12 parishes.  We discovered that 15 or 20 years hence the operation of the Arterial Drainage Act would, or might, reach that area under the scheme of priorities in connection with that Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidJohnMadden" hpid="Mr. Madden Mr. Madden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Madden</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like Deputy MacEntee to look at the map which I hold in my hand.  It is a map of Feoholagh, Newcastle West, in which 1,000 farmers and workers, realising the continued destruction which flooding was causing to that otherwise fertile area, decided to tackle the problem themselves.  A thousand of them took off their coats and worked for a whole summer.  At the end of their labours they had relieved the water, the drainage and siltings from ten miles of rivers and their tributaries.  The cost to them was the amazing figure of £5 to buy wire rope to work along those ten miles of rivers where nearly 3,000 acres of land were being rendered unproductive because of flooding over a number of years.  The two Deputies on <Col N="2309" /> the other side and myself, having walked the whole area, recognised the great work that had been done by this voluntary effort.  There was no legislation under which immediate relief could have been given.  The fact was appreciated that that relief could not come for a period of nearly 20 years, and so those men decided to tackle the problem themselves.  They did so and had a 75 per cent. success.  That appealed to me very much&mdash;to see this band of men, led by their priest, Father Culhane, doing that work themselves. I asked the Minister for Lands if he would come down to see what had been done.  He did and was so convinced by what he saw that I am told fairly authoritatively that, as a result of what that spontaneous, generous and cooperative effort accomplished on the part of those 1,000 farmers, it inspired the introduction of this measure now before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is so far as the western part of the county is concerned.  One can then go six or seven miles to the east. Deputy Ó Briain very properly and correctly referred to this area to-day&mdash;to the Maigue.  Before the last Government went out of office the then Minister went to Adare and travelled over the whole area.  He met the committee there and gave them to understand, if not an undertaking, that when his Government would be returned after the general election&mdash;he assumed that his Government would be coming back to office&mdash;he would take the matter up tentatively, and at least relieve the destruction done by the over-flooding of the Maigue.  We were told&mdash;the local committee having examined the matter very carefully and methodically with the help of a very distinguished engineer&mdash;that along the Maigue valley, from Croom right down into the Shannon, there were 20,000 acres of land rendered absolutely unproductive. Deputy Ó Briain told the House that for weeks it often happens people cannot pass through to Limerick to do their business.  Deputy MacEntee asked what edifices were being destroyed.  The Protestants living in and around Adare have not been able, in recent times, to attend service in <Col N="2310" /> their church on Sundays if there is a downpour of rain on the previous Friday or Saturday.  I am told that the church there is flooded in wet weather to a depth of nearly a foot.</P>
    <P>So one goes along with sickening repetition until you find yourself in the Mulcaire drainage area about which I am not going to talk.  Deputy Smith laughs, but when he introduced retrospective legislation under which a figure of £40,000 was being superimposed on the ratepayers in County Limerick, he said to me in the Seanad that Limerick was a rich county and could well afford to pay.</P>

      <P>Then, I withdraw. There are 16 parishes of which we have authenticated, correct returns.  In this particular area there are 8,085 acres of land and the area flooded, rendered practically unproductive, would be 2,054 acres.  There are other particulars set out with regard to the number of cows and other matters of that sort. Everything has been carefully compiled. I suggest to Deputy MacEntee that that is convincing proof that the conditions in my county, my constituency, are such as to demand legislation of the type that has been introduced here.  The conditions in my county, east, west and centre, are analogous to the conditions obtaining in many other parts of the country. Deputy MacEntee may not be aware of that, but if he took his motor car after two days' rain and drove down to Mallow he would observe many instances of what can be done by floods &mdash;the destruction that floods leave in their wake.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and I say that the Inter-Party Government are to be congratulated for introducing it.  I do not know of anything that has brought such consolation and such joy to the rural community and to the ordinary people in the towns contiguous to rivers that are subject to flooding.  In my own area there are many families that have been affected by floods for years.  I could cite instances where farmers lost their live stock and crops in heavy floods.  In my area some ten or twelve thousand acres of beautiful land are regularly inundated.  The sooner this measure finds its way to the Statute Book the better it will be for those unfortunate people who have suffered so much through the years. Deputy MacEntee would appear to have lost all faith in our county councils and he does not seem to have a very high opinion of the personnel of those councils.</P>

      <P>Deputy MacEntee even questioned the efficiency of our county <Col N="2312" /> councils to take charge of a drain. That was the purport of his argument. I may say that 70 per cent. of the members of the county council in my county are farmers and they are prepared to do this work efficiently and so relieve conditions such as this Bill envisages. I trust it will soon find its way into the Statute Book so that we will have our people east and west improving their land, removing river obstructions and putting an end to the flooding which has caused such loss and damage over so many years.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the attitude of Deputies on the opposite benches, it is to be hoped that they will co-operate in implementing this measure, because it will really be in the interests of the people as a whole.  I hope this Bill will get the unanimous approval of the Seanad and when it is enacted I feel sure it will bring joy and prosperity, peace and plenty, to the people living in the areas contiguous to the rivers that have been so long the cause of flooding</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>To whatever extent local authorities are found to be in need of the powers that are sought in this Bill, an excellent case can be made for providing them with such powers, but, just as did Deputy MacEntee on Thursday last find it difficult to justify the section which proposes to confer such powers, I find myself more or less in the same difficulty.  I have, it is true, only a limited knowledge of local bodies.  I was a member of a council for a number of years and also chairman, and I confess that, while the conditions there might not be analogous with the conditions in other areas, during my period we never as a council found ourselves unable to tackle any of the problems that are mentioned in this Bill.  It may be that we had those problems and it may be, too, that those who were responsible for attempting to solve them saw that there were legal barriers that made it impossible for them even to approach the matter; but I, like Deputy MacEntee, must confess that while I see the need for providing local authorities with such powers, in my experience I have not met with any case where the local authority was prevented from carrying <Col N="2313" /> out any improvement for the purpose of safeguarding a road, bridge or any other property that happened to be owned by the local authority with which I was associated.</P>
      <P>The strange part about this matter is that, while I have for years experienced trouble as a result of the flooding of roads&mdash;and I am sure that we have had as much suffering in my own county as a result of the flooding of roads in the winter months as any other county&mdash;I find it hard to reconcile my own limited knowledge of that problem as a layman with the proposals that are contained in this measure and with the proposals in the circular which was issued by the Department of Local Government, with the authority of the Minister, and sent to county councils, suggesting to them the sort of work that they should undertake when this measure becomes law.</P>
      <P>Even before the introduction of this Bill county councils have had to decide to raise the level of a stretch of road in order to eliminate flooding.  They have done that sort of work for many years to my own knowledge, in some cases with success.  Suppose they were to continue to raise the levels of certain stretches of roads subject to flooding and at the same time proceed, as the Minister in his circular has instructed them.  My understanding of their doing these two things at one and the same time leads me to the belief that while a county council might be engaged in raising the level of a road adjacent to a main artery in order to relieve the flooding on that road and remove any impediment to public traffic, some confusion might arise from the instructions contained in this circular, where the Minister invites councils as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In selecting works preference should be given to the less elaborate types of schemes which can be expeditiously undertaken with the consent of all parties concerned and which have the added advantage that the employment given on them will be more widespread.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the point of view of employment I can quite easily see the force of that argument and the weight of that advice. <Col N="2314" /> But I can also see that a county council engaged on minor works of that type might quite easily, as the saying goes, add fuel to the fire, because a county council might be engaged in raising the level of a county road in the lower reaches, in order to prevent flooding in the winter months, while ignoring the effect of small minor drainage works in the upper reaches.</P>
    <P>Without attempting to paint an unreal picture, I can quite candidly say that there are areas in my own county where, if the suggestion made in the circular is given effect to by the county council, while at the same time taking advantage of the powers that have been conferred upon them to carry out works for the protection of roads and buildings from flooding, the county council will undertake the impossible; because, while in one place they will raise the level of the road, in some other place they will carry out work which will have the effect of increasing both the speed and the volume of water flowing to the low-lying parts.</P>
    <P>There is another point to be considered in relation to the relief of flooding where public buildings are concerned. I have no particular building in mind that might be affected by flooding.  We have not got such buildings in my county.  But I know quite a number of bridges and I know quite a few stretches of public road.  Apart altogether from the question as to whether or not the county council has at the moment the legal right to go in and carry out works on the eyes of a bridge or adjacent to the eyes of a bridge.  I cannot for the life of me see how the flooding caused by the obstruction can be removed without in many cases carrying out works not only adjacent to the bridge but many miles away from the bridge.</P>
    <P>Here is another difficulty that I see. No provision is made here for consultation as between local authorities.  One Deputy supporting this Bill suggested that we are going to have 27 different authorities dealing with drainage.  It is because of the confusion that will result from that that we are critical of this measure.  I cannot see why there should be any complaint made against us on that head.  Speaking on a <Col N="2315" /> drainage motion recently, I admitted quite frankly, to the extent of my observations on that motion, that I was confining myself to the particular kind of drainage problems about which I had personal knowledge from watching them through the course of my life and from very often finding myself embarrassed by them.  Let me emphasise that, while we see in the powers that are being sought, there is nothing to oppose in principle in conferring these powers on the local authorities, I can at the same time visualise occasions on which these powers might be improperly used for the purpose of conferring benefits upon some to the detriment of others.  That is all I wish to say on that portion of the measure which purports to arm local authorities with the powers specified in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I come now to the second section, which purports to give to local authorities the right to carry out other types of work when it is in the public interest that these works should be undertaken. Some years ago, when discussing the Arterial Drainage Act, I made the point that drainage is such an important matter and so many people are affected by it that it is an excellent subject on which both Deputies and public men can make flowery speeches calculated to create the impression that this is a simple problem and that men down the ages were so stupid in relation to it that they failed to grasp its simplicity.  The suggestion is now made that we have discovered in this Bill of five sections&mdash;described by one enthusiast in this House as a neat Bill &mdash;a solution to all the problems affecting those who own land subject to flooding.  Now, if I were Minister for Local Government and having listened to some of the speeches that were made in support of this Bill, I would certainly feel embarrassed.</P>
    <P>When talking about this question of drainage is it not a wonder that Deputies would invite not only those who listen to them but those who read them, either in the official records of this House or in the papers down the country, to think for a moment and ask themselves what has been said of this subject, even as recently as the last few <Col N="2316" /> months, by a man who has been employed and paid by the present Government for the purpose of making a report to this House and country as to the best means by which the waste lands of this country are to be rehabilitated? The most extraordinary attitude is taken up by those who support this measure.  In their desire to take advantage of the popularity of drainage they seem to want to ignore the recommendations of this individual, from whom I shall quote in a short time. Further, we are told that it is on the basis of this report that not only under this scheme which is envisaged as a result of this Bill but under a scheme which is proposed for the rehabilitation of land by the Minister for Agriculture we are going to get those new proposals from the other Minister to which I have referred.  What has Mr. Holmes, whose report, we understand, has cost the modest sum of around £400, to say about drainage?  I do not want to pretend that everything stated by an expert must of necessity be accurate, but after all we must have some regard to the opinions of these people when we talk about problems such as these we have been discussing all day.  I am now quoting from the report of Mr. Holmes, &ldquo;On the Present State and Methods for the Improvement of Irish Land.&rdquo;  In the paragraph dealing with marsh land he says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A great deal of the marsh land on the river flats and around the loughs remains unproductive because of periodic flooding caused by lack of proper clearance further down the river.</P>
    <P>It would, therefore, seem obvious that any scheme for straightening, deepening, and clearing a river should work up from the mouth.  I understand that the Barrow scheme was begun in the middle and resulted in more serious flooding of the land on its lower reaches.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There may be something in that or there may not.  I think there is a great deal in it.  When we talk, as Deputy MacEntee and other speakers from these benches have during this debate, of the rights of private owners I want it to be understood that I would be the <Col N="2317" /> last person in the world to place the private person in a position to obstruct any national scheme to which adequate consideration and adequate time for planning had been given.  My concern and the concern of my colleagues in regard to this matter result in our inability to see in those proposals the protection that we think the private owner is entitled to.  For example, with regard to the question of giving an individual seeking compensation the right to go before a district justice, solicitors, lawyers, barristers and so on have disputed across the floor of this House as to what that particular section means.  I do not know which point of view is right.  The attitude I take up, as one who, I think, can properly claim to speak the mind of those who are likely to be affected by work under this measure, is that, if the scheme is felt to be desirable in the public interest&mdash;if there is a proper means of determining what the public interest is&mdash;I certainly would be the last not to arm the local authorities with adequate powers to deal with that problem.</P>
    <P>Even the section seems to contemplate that the claim would be made in the area of the district justice where the work is being carried out.  That suggests to me that the claim will be limited to damage that may result following a particular work, to any individual who may reside in that particular area.  However, as I have shown in the case of the flooded road so a number of cases could be demonstrated in which harm would result not only as between one district and another inside a county boundary but as between work carried out say in County Monaghan having an adverse affect upon certain farmers and people in a neighbouring county.  I should like to know how farmers whose lands adjoin the banks of a river flowing through two, three or four counties are to know when their rights are being interfered with as a result of the activities and the work being undertaken by a local authority of a neighbouring county.  Again, because of the lack of provision in this measure for co-operation as between neighbouring local authorities.  I can see problems arising as a result of <Col N="2318" /> which work that might be carried out in one county would cause damage in another.  The damage following such work might seriously injure the property of people living well into a neighbouring county.  There is no use, therefore, in our attempting to give the impression, in the course of the discussion here, that because this is a five section Bill and because it is a Bill drafted in such simple language, we can just sit here and let it pass without seeing what are its implications when it becomes law.  From reading the Bill or the explanatory, memorandum I certainly have not the information one would need to have to stand up in this House and outside it to declare properly what one's attitude as a Deputy was towards this measure.</P>
    <P>I am as anxious as any other Deputy to see this problem solved.  I am certainly going to strive as best I can to ascertain what hardships may be endured by those who are affected by the measure.  I have sat here during the whole course of this debate and I have heard Deputies speak of certain individuals who unreasonably withheld their approval to the carrying out of some particular work.  They spoke of them as &ldquo;cranks&rdquo; and they talked of the benefits of which such &ldquo;cranks.&rdquo; because of the stand they had taken, were depriving their neighbours upstream. But nobody once referred to the damage that might result to those who were downstream.  Is it any wonder then that a layman like myself would feel dissatisfied on hearing from one side of the House the accusation from a legal person that this Bill contained only certain provisions as far as compensation was concerned, and, on the other side, a tendency not to discuss the matter as thoroughly as I should like to hear it discussed before I as a layman would be prepared to agree to it?</P>
    <P>I have here a number of other quotations that I could give to the House in addition to the more recent one to which I referred from Mr. Holmes in connection with this matter of piecemeal drainage.  I think it would be no harm to give these quotations in view of the sweeping statements that have been made on the benches opposite, <Col N="2319" /> not only by Deputies but by Ministers from whom one would, at least, expect caution and a certain amount of reserve in these matters.  I do not want to give these quotations just to convey to the House that I am in any sense a worshipper of what these gentlemen have to say but, if you look at the names of those who were associated with the Drainage Commission, you will find on that body a very large number of men who, not only because of their technical training but because of their wide experience, had every right to speak with authority on the subject that we are now discussing.</P>
    <P>In the Drainage Commission Report, at page 27, under the heading &ldquo;Review of Past&rdquo; here is what they have to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The outstanding feature of arterial drainage in the past is the piecemeal manner in which the work has been planned and carried out. The Barrow was the nearest approach to large drainage works designed and carried out in a comprehensive way.  The Barrow Scheme entailed a consideration of the drainage problem affecting the entire catchment area.</P>
    <P>The Act of 1925 did nothing to alter the position.  It continued the haphazard creation of individual districts without consideration of the interests, problems and requirements of river basins as a whole.  The very method of initiating schemes introduced by the Act, by which any six ratepayers could get the machinery of the Act in motion, was repugnant to the idea of a planned drainage policy and facilitated piecemeal development.</P>
    <P>The fact that drainage on this basis should have continued all through the years is the more remarkable in view of the recommendation made by previous commissions on this aspect of the problem.</P>
    <P>In 1887 the commission presided over by Sir James Allport reported:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&lsquo;We find drainage districts formed without any regard to the interests of the larger river basins in which <Col N="2320" /> they lie and so arranged as to escape their share of what should be a common responsibility.  On the other hand, the boundaries of such districts are often so arranged as to impose on their promoters responsibilities which ought to be shared by others and to force these promoters to confer benefits on their neighbours towards the cost of which the latter contribute nothing.  Instances occur in which some physical obstruction, which is, in an engineering sense, the key of the position, is left outside the boundary of a district, the board of which has no power to deal with it.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a quotation from the Report of the Drainage Commission of 1938-40. These reports were made by men who have some knowledge of the problem of drainage; yet one would gather from the discussion that there was no obstacle to just starting up and, as one Deputy said, having 27 different local bodies operating as drainage authorities without any plan or any approach to this problem in a constructive way.  I want to say to the Minister for Local Government&mdash;and I am saying it in no sense of trying to be obstructive or unreasonable&mdash;that if the policy he has enshrined in the document which he has issued to local bodies, is followed in a very large area of the country of which I have considerable knowledge, I can see that enormous damage will be done miles away from the actual work on which the local authority might be engaged. I want to remind him that if, say, the local authority were, as a result of its consideration on a matter of that kind, to decide that because of the danger to which certain people on farms removed from the proposed work might be exposed, not to go ahead with the work, I am naturally sceptical as to the powers which are conferred on the Minister here to take action himself. I am not expecting that the Minister would be unreasonable in a matter of this kind, but he might have it conveyed to him to take certain action.</P>
    <P>I think a Minister of this Government had it conveyed to him that a certain local authority was not doing its work as energetically as it might <Col N="2321" /> regarding housing and the Minister in question fell for the advice and afterwards, of course, more or less withdrew the attack which he felt he was justified in making on that particular local authority.  I can see the possibility of a local authority, as a result of its belief that damage would accrue from a certain work, refusing to carry out that work, and I can see the Minister forced to take action over their heads and have the work carried out. Unfortunately, a considerable time must pass before the public would appreciate the extent of the damage and injustice done as a result.</P>
    <P>I think I understand the point Deputy Maguire was driving at.  If my interpretation of his remarks is correct, his warning was quite sound. According to the Act of 1945, all drainage districts have been transferred for maintenance purposes to local bodies. The law provides that these local authorities are expected to maintain these districts only in a condition similar to that in which they have been handed over to them.  The land owners inside those districts have a legal right to compel the local authority to maintain the district as it was handed over. Suppose that the Minister, through the local authority, carries out under this Bill a number of small drainage works, such as those to which he has referred in his circular to county councils. Those works are not included in any drainage district, but are naturally flowing into drainage districts.  Since many of those drainage districts are in such a condition that a local authority could not recondition them until a new scheme is prepared, the local land owners inside the district will have a claim against the council, as the position will be worsened if small schemes are carried out which flow into the area.</P>
    <P>Members of this House, and Ministers as well, proceed to lecture us as to the duties of an Opposition, and give the impression that we are obstructing a Bill introduced a week ago.  When the Bill affects the people in a way that we have made clear, and possibly in a way to which none of us have referred at all, surely it cannot be contended that it is unreasonable to have a fairly protracted discussion? <Col N="2322" /> The importance of this measure is appreciated by people whose lands are flooded and by many farmers who know that they have land in a place to which you cannot go to give relief as a result of this measure, no matter how anxious you may be to do so.</P>
    <P>Certainly, if some of these new works are carried out on any kind of elaborate basis, they will not bring the relief that has been spoken of by Deputy Madden and others.  He referred to districts that I know and saw myself&mdash;districts to which relief cannot be afforded by the passage of this measure.  Many farmers living along those river banks cannot be as enthusiastic for this Bill as some Deputies would have us believe.  They are the other way about; they see quite clearly that, if these small schemes are carried out in an extensive fashion, much harm will result to them.</P>
    <P>Apart altogether from any criticism that might be levelled against this measure as to the absence of any provision for financing it&mdash;other than the Minister's assurance that free or full grants will be given to local bodies&mdash; there is ground for comment on the fact that the responsibility for the payment of compensation is being placed upon local authorities.  I do not know what reason the Minister may have had in deciding that this burden should be carried by local bodies.  The Minister must have received certain advice from his legal advisers, and also from his technical advisers on the engineering side, and I would like to know what that technical advice was, in both the legal and the engineering sense. Perhaps some of those who advised him have made clear the dangers of a measure of this kind.</P>
    <P>It is spoken of by supporters of the Government as a simple measure and yet, to be candid with the House and candid with the Minister, and irrespective of any assurance I may get to the contrary, I can see in it only rush and haste and lack of consideration. Whether I am right or wrong in making this allegation, all I can see is a charge to get through the House some instrument which will serve as a stop-gap to cover an awkward situation. This is an attempt to plug a <Col N="2323" /> gaping wound that was created by the policy of the present Government in regard to road grants.</P>
    <P>That may be wrong, but, believing that I know something about this problem, as do dozens of other rural Deputies, believing I know something about the damage that can result from ill-considered work of this kind, this measure to me shows evidence of haste and lack of consideration. I would be prepared to make any wager that those who we naturally regard as authorities on this subject, from both the legal and the technical angle, if we knew their minds, could not possibly stand behind the provisions of this measure and time will show to what extent the magnificent reception extended by some Deputies to this Bill is justified.</P>
    <P>I say that not only because of the statements made by those who were employed by the State to recommend a policy and an approach to the solution of this as one of our greatest national problems, but because of the personal experiences of men who live in flooded areas, who have watched the effects of water and the results which a certain type of activity in one district may have on another.  They believe, and I believe with them, that those who can see in this measure, if its provisions are made use of to any great extent, any solution of our problems are fooling themselves and time will establish the truth of that statement. While I admit that undoubtedly it is possible to bring relief to certain districts by following the sort of policy outlined in the circular sent to county councils by the Minister&mdash;I take it that will be the policy of the Department and the policy which local bodies will be encouraged to follow when the Bill becomes an Act&mdash;you will certainly create havoc in some other districts.</P>
    <P>It is because I can see, apart altogether from what assurances we have got from Deputy Cowan and Deputy Esmonde as to the legal provisions of this measure, farmers with mill rights, with drinking rights for cattle and a thousand and one other rights who will be affected by its operation, that I, as a member of the Opposition Party, however much I may sympathise with <Col N="2324" /> those who seek in, in my opinion, this rather foolish way a solution of one of our most trying problems, will in this House see to it that, by voice and vote and otherwise, these rights are protected, while, at the same time, not in any way attempting to put the private individual more or less on a pedestal above the interests of the community. I feel that it is our duty to take that course and there should not be any question of trying to create the impression that a Bill like this should go through in a few hours.  This is a long-standing problem, and there is no reason why, in order to make sure that these rights to which I have referred will not be tampered with, we should not give an extra week to its consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am greatly surprised that Fianna Fáil Deputies should speak against this Bill.  Only yesterday, I went out visiting cottage sites and I told a Fianna Fáil county councillor that his Party were objecting to this Bill and he nearly fell out of the car with surprise.  The position in Westmeath is that every Fianna Fáil county councillor is running to every district in order to be first to tell the people about this drainage proposal.  Deputy Kennedy, who has left the Chamber, went up to Clonmellon last week and walked drains there, and I challenge him or any other member of the Fianna Fáil Party to stand up and say that he objects to any one of the drainage works listed by the Westmeath County Council.  I have looked over that list and they are all works for which we have been crying out all our lives. There is the Stoneyford, beyond Delvin, with which Deputy Smith's famous drainage proposals were to deal, and the problem there was that, while the drainage at either end would be maintained, in respect of three miles in the middle, if we imposed one penny on the rates, we would have been summoned. I am sure that 400 or 500 acres of land are flooded in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies opposite have talked about the farmers objecting.  Examine any scheme which the county engineer in Westmeath has sent up and you will find that the farmers are crying out for it.  What farmer would object to <Col N="2325" /> getting his land drained?  It is the greatest proposal ever put forward by any Government.  Deputy Smith says that, if flooding in one district is relieved, some other farmer's land further down will be flooded.  Are our engineers fools?  Are they going to start schemes which will flood land somewhere else?  Surely our engineers are competent to deal with these matters. Deputy MacEntee, in a letter to the papers, referred to people's rights.  Go back over the past ten years and see how these rights were respected when land was taken from people for nothing.  That is what these rights amounted to then.  I know one poor man who was left some land and who is now unable to pay his rates.</P>

      <P>Notwithstanding all we have heard from the Fianna Fáil Party about this terrible scheme introduced by the Minister and notwithstanding their horror, their fear and their dread in the matter of the rights of private individuals and the liberties of the citizen, I am one of those who welcomes this Bill whole-heartedly and I congratulate the Minister on his courage in introducing it.  Since the first Dáil sat, we have had a continuous appeal to every Government for drainage of one kind or another, and I can say that one-half of the time of every Deputy from the country, irrespective of what part of Ireland he comes from, whether from the West where the land is swampy or barren, or from the East where it is of better quality, is taken up in making representations to the Office of Public Works and the special employment schemes branch for the carrying out of drainage of some kind.  In spite of all these efforts since the country got its freedom, we know well that all that has been done up to date is very insignificant. <Col N="2326" /> Whatever else this Government may be blamed for and whatever else Fianna Fáil may criticise it for, they must admit one thing&mdash;that drainage has got first consideration, so far as this Parliament and this Government are concerned.  The national arterial drainage scheme&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Even though the few legal minds that there are in the Fianna Fáil Party try to find legal difficulties in this Bill and to point out how difficult it may be at a later date to solve some problem which has not been set out in black and white before us, I am thankful to the Minister for giving us what I consider is the first simple Act of Parliament that has been introduced in this House.</P>
      <P>I have no knowledge of legal matters but I have as much understanding as the average Deputy and I have read through this Bill in a few minutes and understand it perfectly and clearly, and know what it means to do and what it does not mean to do.  The Minister having given us such a Bill, is it not the duty of Deputies who want simple legislation to support and welcome it and to treat it with respect?  While the Fianna Fáil spokesmen, each and every one of them, have criticised this Bill, not one of them has admitted that he will oppose this Bill and vote against it.</P>

Everybody who <Col N="2327" /> comes from the country realises that this Bill will bring in its path a certain amount of good.  There are people who think that it will do anything and everything, that we have in this Bill a measure which will clear the floods in no time at all.  I am not so foolish as to believe that that will happen. This Bill could only be successful if we had the arterial drainage scheme completed and followed it up with this scheme.  But, despite the Government's best activities to get arterial drainage into operation in all the catchment areas that it would like to drain, we know that it will be impossible for a big number of years.</P>

      <P>The operation of this Bill, which is the object of the present Minister for Local Government, should make drainage schemes much easier. If the Minister could get officials of his Department to search in the Office of the Special Employment Schemes, 51 St. Stephen's Green, for drainage schemes that have been applied for in the past 10 to 20 years, and which have never been touched for the reason that the amount of money allocated to special employment schemes and minor relief works is entirely too small, and transfer the work to the county councils, he would be putting into the hands of the county council officials works which it is essential should be carried out.  I suggest that that would speed up the job in a way in which it needs to be speeded.</P>
      <P>We all welcome the powers that are given in this Bill to local authorities to make drains or watercourses, to clear or to take away water from land or roads which are their property and also from land which is not their property. In many cases roads are flooded and it is very essential to have them drained and cleared but it is even more essential that land which is not the property of the county council but the property of an individual ratepayer or land owner should also benefit.  The sub-section which has been inserted to ensure that such land may be drained under this Bill is something which I welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to give a word of praise to the Minister for the section which empowers an official of a local authority or an official of the Minister to go and to make drains or to see that drainage work is carried out irrespective of whether the person in question wishes it or not.  Unfortunately time and again in our efforts to get drainage schemes carried out, we find that there may be ten people quite anxious to have the drainage scheme carried out and there may be one in the locality, the village lawyer, if you like, or the local crank, who will not consent and who will not allow work of any description to be carried out, who will not allow what is taken from the bottom <Col N="2329" /> of the river or drain to be thrown on his land, who will not allow workmen to walk across his field to the bank of the river.  Are we to allow such an individual to impede progress or to hold up work that would bring benefit to a large number of people?  We are not.  Again I say to the Minister for Local Government that I support this measure which will give the powers to his officials to go in and do work irrespective of whether there is a local objector or not.  I have an instance in my own locality, an individual who owns almost 1,500 acres of land and who last year when a rural improvements scheme was contemplated in the area and when 15 people had signed the rural improvements form, refused to allow drainage to be carried out that would go through his land.  When he was approached by the spokesman in charge of the rural improvements scheme, he said he wanted to have land flooded; he wanted to have 50 acres of swamp so as to have good snipe shooting when the season began and therefore refused to allow the scheme to go through.  When you get an individual like that, an aristocrat, a British Peer&mdash;which he is&mdash;who can hold up a scheme, then some Government at some time should come in with a measure to enforce that work should pass through his land whether he liked it or not.  On the other side you can have the case of the small land-holder or the medium land-holder who can be just as contrary and jealous as some of his neighbours and refuse to co-operate with them.  That is how the Minister has done something which was definitely wanted.  We have had Party propaganda by the Opposition Party who claim that they have a terrible interest all of a sudden in the individual citizens in this country, but must not the rights of the others who are always in the majority be thought of as well?  If they have not been thought of I am glad to see they are thought of at the present time.</P>
    <P>With regard to compensation, the Minister has set out here in black and white&mdash;we can read it and the ordinary individual can read it&mdash;that compensation can be determined in the District Court before the district justice, thus eliminating the waste of time, the court <Col N="2330" /> procedure and the giving notice in advance that such-and-such a portion of a person's land must be inspected with regard to allowing certain inspectors or individuals to go through in order to carry out a drainage scheme.  Power is granted to give compensation if compensation is demanded, but I can assure the House from my own knowledge that in the county I come from, instead of looking for compensation, land-holders would be more inclined to pay or at least to give a helping hand towards a drainage scheme.  They would not want to go to the county council for compensation for something which would be beneficial and useful to themselves.</P>
    <P>The effort that is about to be made by the Minister for Local Government under this Bill is something which any Party should be proud to support and I can assure the Minister that the Party to which I belong&mdash;and I, individually and personally&mdash;are very proud to support it.  When this scheme comes to be debated by the Mayo County Council and when the members of that local authority are asked by the county engineer to give him a helping hand regarding what schemes should be done, I wonder will a single member of that county council sit down there dumb or say that there is no drainage to be done in his area, that he has nothing for him to do or that he does not want to take part in this beneficial scheme?  I can assure everybody in this House, talking from commonsense and from knowledge, that there is no such councillor in Ireland at the present time in any council, because drainage has been neglected and forgotten. It has never been really tackled until a year ago, and now it has been tackled to suit all sides and to appease the impatient section who think it is too long to wait for the Arterial Drainage Bill.  They want this measure, which will bring them immediate relief and which will immediately restore prosperity to land which has been swamped so long and so often.</P>
    <P>The big fear seems to be that the letting go of water or the cleaning of drains and rivers may cause flooding further on.  That may or may not be a debatable point, but in nearly every case reported by the officials of the <Col N="2331" /> special employments scheme, in 19 out of 20 inspections made by an engineer, recommendations were sent back to the Office of Public Works that the work was essential, that the outfall for the work in question was sufficient and that, if possible, that work should be done.  There is an answer already from an engineering staff who know their business that the drainage to be done under this Bill will not cause flooding down the line.</P>
    <P>My only query regarding the success of the Bill is whether the Minister for Local Government will be able to provide from the Treasury of this State sufficient money to carry out all the drainage schemes which will be put before him in the course of the next six months.  If he can do that he will be doing something which will be very beneficial and which, mind you, will satisfy anybody and everybody who is interested in the ruling, the Government and the welfare of this country.</P>
    <P>It was about time somebody unwound or cut all the red tape which has surrounded so many Bills and Acts, and the Minister for Local Government has done something to make things more progressive.  I say to the Minister for Local Government that he is living up to the expectations some of us had of him and if he has succeeded in cutting through some of the red tape which has been such a hold-up on progress for so long in this country and if his colleagues would take example from what he has done&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The majority of them have just as much intelligence as Deputy MacEntee has.  They know they are doing good work and something that will be beneficial to the country as a whole&mdash;just as Deputy MacEntee knows he is doing harm when he is trying to prevent this Bill from going through the House by endeavouring to create a scare in the minds of everybody by talking of citizens' rights and freedom, of his care for the people's property and everything else, of communism and of the fact that the Minister for Local Government is so red that he has at last given us something which is very welcome and which Deputy MacEntee should welcome very much too, if he only had the courage to do so.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to intervene in this debate but, having heard most of the speeches that were delivered from the Government side of the House, I felt I ought to make my attitude quite clear in regard to this Bill and what I believe to be the attitude of the Deputies on this side of the House in regard to this Bill since we first started to criticise it.  The people sitting on the Government benches have, of course, in their usual way, tried to create the impression that Fianna Fáil are opposing this Bill just <Col N="2333" /> for the sake of obstruction.  I do not think that anybody who has taken any interest in the speeches delivered from this side of the House could say that any Deputy on those benches, at any time, made anything but what could be termed constructive criticism in regard to this measure.  So far as drainage in general is concerned, our attitude is clearly understood throughout the country.  Deputy Commons referred to the National Arterial Drainage Act that they brought in last June.  The National Arterial Drainage Act was not brought in last June or 12 months ago.</P>

      <P>I do not want to be responsible for any of the mistakes the Deputy has made.  They are so numerous and they weigh so heavily upon him that he is beginning to develop a little bit of a hump.  As I have already said, our attitude in regard to drainage is well known throughout the country.  We welcome drainage of any description that will help the people of this country.  What we have criticised, and what we are entitled to criticise, are the flaws which we believe this Bill contains.  This Bill was dealt with, section by section, from this side of the House and those things in the Bill which we thought wrong were pointed out to the Minister.  We tried to make as clear a case as we possibly could so that the Minister would give further consideration to the points raised, with a view to bringing in a Bill which would put local authorities in the position of not having to face huge legal actions at any future date and which would put the people who will be affected by this drainage scheme, either <Col N="2334" /> one way or another, in the position that they will not have to face big legal actions.  Our desire is to make this a piece of legislation so that it will be understood by everybody and that it can be worked by a local authority without any hindrance from the day the Bill is enacted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section I of the Bill was criticised&mdash; I am not so much interested in criticism of that section.  What I fail to understand is that some Deputies who have been members of county councils have not, apparently, made much study of the Bill and have not, I believe, taken into consideration what Section 2 contains, namely, the execution of works by a local authority.  What we have been trying to point out to the Minister, and what should be understood by all those Deputies who represent a rural constituency, as I do, is that we have county council engineers who go around and from time to time carry out a particular type of work.  I often find people coming along and making representations to me or asking me to make representations on their behalf either in the county council or outside it, as the case may be, so that the county council's engineer will not interfere with or infringe upon their rights by doing something that will, perhaps, destroy some of their land or interfere in some way with their rights in general.  Suppose we go to the county council meeting and take the matter up with the county council engineer and suppose we still cannot get the county council engineer to do what we think he should do in this matter.  What I see wrong with the section is this.  If, to-morrow morning, under this section the county council engineer says: &ldquo;There is a particular job of work I want carried out in a particular locality and there is a certain individual down there kicking up a bit of rumpus because he does not want us to go ahead with the work,&rdquo; and we say: &ldquo;Wait a week.&rdquo;  What is the position?  We go to meet that individual and hear his case and we come back to the county council engineer and say to him that the man has a case. The county council engineer, on the other hand, says &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  If the county <Col N="2335" /> council turns down the county council engineer because it is satisfied that the job will be detrimental to the interests of the person who made the complaint &mdash;in the case of most county councils that I know of they have the interests of the poorer sections of the community at heart and it is with the interests of these people that the county council always takes sides&mdash;the county engineer can write to the Minister and say that the job should be carried out. The Minister can reply and tell the county engineer and say: &ldquo;Carry on. Do not worry about the council at all.&rdquo; Or the Minister may decide on getting somebody else&mdash;as is clearly set out in the Bill&mdash;to carry out that particular job of work.  Is there any harm in our asking the Minister to examine that point and, if he thinks it requires alteration, to alter the Bill so as to make it workable without creating any rows or creating any hardship amongst any section of the community? The case made from this side of the House and put up to the Minister is something of that nature and we have asked him to have the matter carefully examined before the Bill becomes law.  I expected, when a Minister and Parliamentary Secretary spoke on this measure in the House to-day, that they would give some sort of a reply to our case&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Their attitude in trying to answer some of our criticisms of some of the sections of the Bill and to explain to us why they were, in their own opinion, justified in putting these particular sections into the Act was: &ldquo;I defy the Deputies opposite to vote against this Bill.  I would love to see them doing so.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The attitude of everybody who has spoken from the other side of the House has not helped us to get the Minister to examine this Bill and to produce a satisfactory piece of legislation, a piece of legislation that will not involve local authorities in legal actions and that will enable people who will be in one way or another affected by this Bill to steer clear of legal actions.  Instead of doing these things, they have attempted to misconstrue our statements and to try to get the people to believe that we are here just to offer certain criticisms, which of course is not the case and they know that very well.  What they are worried about is that our criticism has been so useful that it may show them up at another stage.</P>
      <P>When we asked for a little more time to examine this Bill we did so because we had not been afforded an opportunity to examine it.  It was stated that we got the Bill on Saturday. There may be some Deputies who did, but I had to attend a county council meeting on Saturday, another meeting on Monday, and I came up here on Tuesday.  Therefore the first opportunity I had of examining the Bill was on Wednesday.  On that day, however, we had other matters in the House which demanded attention for the greater portion of our time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we asked for time to examine more carefully the different sections, we did it purely from the point of view of trying to see if we could enable the Government to produce a piece of legislation which would be useful, and which, when put into operation, would not be held up at any stage but could be given effect to immediately.  We are told that we should not have done that because of the urgency of the Bill. There is not that great urgency about <Col N="2337" /> it.  Even though the Minister has sliced considerably the grants given to county councils, between these grants and the amounts which we have made available in my county, and I believe the same applies to every other county, we have ensured that 12 or 14 weeks' work will be available for workers.  I believe that the holding up of this Bill from last Thursday until to-day will not hamper the activities of the Minister or his Department, nor deprive the workers of even one hour's employment.</P>
    <P>I am very anxious that this type of legislation should get all the consideration that it deserves.  It is a very important piece of legislation.  So far as I am concerned, it may not go far enough for me in certain directions. I can quite understand the case that can be made about a particular individual holding up work in a townland or some drainage work or something like that.  I understand that as clearly as any Deputy opposite.  I go further and say that I sincerely hope that any legislation of this kind should go a step further, and that is in connection with people in villages or townlands who try to hamper&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be going a step further than you have gone in this, but it would be going in another direction and a very useful direction. We are not opposing this merely for the sake of opposition.  We have not at any stage made the case that this is not a type of legislation which was urgently required.  We do make the case that, if the Bill is given effect to, there are a number of clauses in it which we believe will be questioned in the courts and which will probably make things very awkward for local authorities as well as people directly concerned.  There is nothing in this Bill about the Minister providing even 1/towards defraying expenses in connection with that.  There is a section which provides that all expenses must be defrayed by the local authority. That does not show that the Minister is in any way prepared to come to their assistance.  I think we might add a line to that saying that the Minister <Col N="2338" /> would defray all the expenses that a county council may be involved in as a result of any legal action or anything like that.</P>
      <P>The Minister made a statement and said his word must be taken.  Several Deputies said the Minister's word must be taken.  So far as I know anything about legislation, it works out in this way.  When a Bill becomes law and a county council or county manager comes to interpet it, it is the Bill they will go on and not what the Minister said.  In the same way, if a case is brought into a District Court I am sure the district justice never looks up what a Minister said or decides the issue on the basis of what a Minister had in mind.  He will always try to decide the issue on the basis of what is in the Bill and nothing else.  That is why we are making an effort to get put into the Bill things which the Minister thinks he has in the Bill and which we believe he has not.  The people on the opposite side should not continue on their crooked course of trying to create any other impression.</P>

      <P>Deputy MacEntee made such a long speech on this Bill that it was a pity that he did not offer his contribution, instead of on Thursday, 31st March, on the following day, Friday, 1st April.  Listening to-day to other Opposition Deputies, it is quite clear that their views are somewhat different from Deputy MacEntee's. They have at least cleared away some of the obstructions, including the bicycle frames and tin cans which one Deputy spoke of.  As regards the legal and constitutional question raised by some Deputies, I think that Deputy Cowan and Deputy Esmonde have expressed views with which I can agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Right through his speech Deputy MacEntee maintained that it would not be safe to extend the powers given to local authorities.  Surely he cannot forget the fact that in a certain number of county councils the Fianna Fáil Party are in the majority.  Furthermore, it is safe to say that in every county council farmers who are members of the various Parties comprise the majority.  As the majority of members on local councils are farmers, they will make sure that, if officials prove <Col N="2339" /> themselves to be incompetent, they will be removed.  That should at least dispose of the argument so far as the local councils are concerned.</P>
    <P>Another statement made by Deputy MacEntee in the course of his speech was that the Minister should treat members as reasonable intelligent beings who should be persuaded by argument.  I wonder was the Deputy sincere when he made that statement? Deputy MacEntee, above all others in this House, never depended on swaying any members or in bringing them to his side by argument.  According to himself, he has a great belief in the rights of individuals and in the rights of private citizens, but he did not show that when he marched all over the country with orders abolishing the county councils and in placing managers, as individuals, over the vast majority of the people.  As we know already, it is the expressed opinion of the present Minister to give extended powers to the members of the various councils, and collectively they, surely, must be considered to be true safeguards of the rights of our citizens. We had, again, from Deputy MacEntee the statement that he has often repeated here that the present Government have refused to provide funds to maintain and improve roadways and public property.  It is well known to all the members of the Cork County Council that a vast amount of money is needed each year to keep the roads of the county in a fair condition because of the obstructions and damage caused by nearby rivers and streams. The water which overflows from them in responsible for the roads being in a bad condition.  If the Minister is wise enough to say to the local authorities that, under this Bill, they are getting power to prevent obstructions in, and to clear damage caused by, these nearby rivers and streams that, naturally, is going to prolong the life of the roads which will then cost less to maintain.</P>
    <P>Deputy Smith mentioned that he had not enough knowledge to say whether it was necessary that any of these schemes should be provided.  Deputy MacEntee should not be in that position, since he was Minister for Local <Col N="2340" /> Government in the previous Government for many years.  He must be aware that time and again requests went up to him from the Cork County Council drawing his attention to the fact that not only were roads being damaged by flooding but houses belonging to private individuals&mdash;the people in whom the Deputy is so interested&mdash;as well as cottages the property of the various boards of health. The fact that the Minister is offering money to prevent such damage being caused in the future must, in itself, be the answer to Deputy MacEntee's worries so far as the provision of money for the maintenance of public property is concerned.</P>
    <P>I do not know much about any county except my own or the number of schemes that are likely to be carried out.  I think Deputy MacEntee mentioned that there might be 50 in the County Dublin.  I should imagine that there would be at least 30 in County Cork.  I am interested in this matter, as are other Deputies who are members of county councils.  I was in touch with my own local authority as late as Saturday last, and even up to yesterday before leaving for Dublin.  I should say that, so far as the County Cork is concerned, from £180,000 to £200,000 would be needed to repair the damage caused by obstructions in small rivers and streams throughout the county.  One doubts as to whether the Minister will be able to make provision for all that is required to be done. Indeed, if he can do half the amount that is needed to be done under this Bill he will at least have done one decent day's work in the interests of the farmers and workers of the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEntee, with his cheap jibes, referred to the members of the Labour Party and their tactics, but in my county I have in mind the case of one farmer who approached some of us who are on the county council.  He drew our attention to the hardship and loss that he was suffering from flooding on the roadway.  The floods entered his field and at one time destroyed many acres of his best land.  The present Minister for Local Government was one of those who drew attention to that case of hardship.  In that case, the local officials, the county council and <Col N="2341" /> the roadmen were most anxious to go in off the road and repair the damage that was being caused to that man's private property, but, unfortunately, there was no legislation to allow them to do so.  Thanks be to God, that is a thing which this simple-worded Bill will enable them to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>One would imagine from many of the speeches delivered in support of this Bill that it was going to be the beginning of the end of all our farmers' troubles.  I am afraid I cannot share that optimism.  An attempt has been made by practically every speaker on the Government side to try and make the people of the country understand that the Fianna Fáil Party are opposed to this Bill.  That, of course, is not true.  Nobody objects, in the slightest, to the giving of power to the local authorities to carry out drainage work.  What we do object to is the giving, into the hands of a local authority or anybody else for that matter, of powers of an unrestricted nature.  Great dangers are involved in doing that.  Members of the House reared in the country-know full well that in the past there has been no greater curse in the country than litigation over rights-of-way and of waterways. I ask the Minister to see that, before this Bill is passed, provision will be made to prevent a repetition of what went on here in the old Petty Sessions days when farmers and others were so often engaged in litigation arising out of rights-of-way and waterways. For example, if the Electricity Supply Board, the Department of Posts and Telegraphs or any other State Department desires to enter on a farmer's land it must give him notice, and, in certain cases, give an assurance that it proposes to pay compensation as well.  Naturally, people have rights. I certainly will never stand for the taking away of certain rights from the people of this country.  Deputy Commons, I think, let the cat out of the bag when he said, in effect, that they were going to brush aside anyone who stood in their way.  Then he made some reference to a British peer.  I do not think that we ever had any great love for those people, but what was the case <Col N="2342" /> of the British peer that he mentioned may be the farmer's case to-morrow under this Bill.  I am not at all optimistic about this Bill achieving the drainage of the flooded lands of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister's optimism will be fully justified&mdash;I can sincerely assure him of that&mdash;but in my opinion the arterial drainage schemes should first be tackled.  If you do not clear the larger rivers in time of flood the small tributaries will have a backwash and no matter what drainage you do your last position will be as bad as your first.  Not much progress will be made until the larger rivers are tackled in a serious way, and we have power to do it.</P>
      <P>What about the village of Ardfinnan? We have in Tipperary the highly industrialised village of Ardfinnan, where the flooding is abnormal.  By draining the rest of the countryside into the Suir you are going to make the position much worse there.  I appeal to the Minister to safeguard the rights of the people in these villages where flooding has occurred.  He should see that something is done so that their position will not be worsened.  That could, I believe, happen under this Bill.</P>
      <P>I have had occasion to see lands in Tipperary in the Cahir area and the farmer who owned those lands had 75 acres under water for the past seven or eight years.  Old people in that neighbourhood say that until seven or eight years ago flooding to that extent was unknown on that land.  What was the cause of it?  It was entirely attributed to the drainage done by the Forestry Department on hills in the neighbourhood which they planted. They drained the hills and unforfortunately for that farmer he has had 75 good acres constantly flooded for many months of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cowan brought us to book very severely for not rushing the Bill through, and so did the Minister for Lands.  Apparently their consciences are troubling them and I can quite appreciate that.  They told us it was necessary to put people into employment&mdash;and <Col N="2343" /> so it is, very necessary. Their consciences must be troubling them because they went into the Lobby and voted for the reduction of the road grants.  The result is that we have thousands of road workers idle all over the country.  In South Tipperary, where there were 1,800 workers employed last year, we have to-day less than 200 workers employed.  That leaves 1,600 unemployed.</P>

      <P>I will prove them.  It is no wonder the Government tried to rush this Bill and, as far as possible, to take the stain off their political consciences because of what they were guilty only a couple of weeks ago.  We have been told that the road workers are now going to do drainage work. Will the Minister put them at the mercy of every ganger, every engineer, at the whim, perhaps, of a council? Will he put the elderly road workers doing drainage work&mdash;men who have been working on the roads all their lives?  Will they now be forced by economic reasons to go into the drains? If that is so, I can only say that above and beyond other things this reduction in the road grant was not justified.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilbride</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution to this debate will be very brief.  My position as regards this Bill is this, that with the great amount of propaganda all over the country regarding the Bill I have been approached by different people about streams and rivers that they want cleaned and as a Deputy and as chairman of the county council I want to get information on certain points.</P>
      <P>I do not rise to criticise the Bill or to applaud it.  I am merely anxious to get information and I think the best thing I can do is to give the House one example.  I have before me a letter written from the Special Employment Branch with regard to a drainage scheme that was asked for some time ago and, with the permission of the Chair, I will read portion of it.  It is in regard to a rural improvements scheme application for drainage at Rinn Kilshalvey, County Sligo.  The letter reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I am directed by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance to refer to your recent representations about the abovementioned application for a drainage scheme, and to enclose for your information copy of a letter which we addressed to you on 10th May, 1948. Although you were informed in that letter that we could not undertake to carry out the work, you forwarded on 19th June, 1948, a bank draft by way of local contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have again considered the matter carefully and regret that we cannot alter our decision not to undertake the work.  The stream in <Col N="2345" /> question drains a catchment area several square miles in extent, and we are advised that the main channel of the Owenmore River has not sufficient capacity to deal adequately with such floods as normally occur, and that the further opening up of additional side drains and tributaries should not be undertaken....  We have no means of reconciling the interests of land-holders whose lands adjoin a main drainage channel with those of land-holders bordering on tributaries.  Such problems occur in many parts of the country and they can be dealt with only by means of the machinery of the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, the information I want is, can that tributary be drained under this Bill?  I discussed this matter with the county engineer and with the engineer of the Board of Works and the reason they gave me why this river could not be drained was that the people along the main river, the Owenmore, would have an action every time they were flooded if that river was drained.  I want a clear statement from the Minister. Is it the intention of this Bill to allow that catchment to be drained? I want to know from the Minister, if the right of action still remains, who is going to pay the compensation?  I am a member of a local authority.  I am a Deputy.  I think I am entitled to a clear statement of the position.  I am not satisfied with the clause in the Bill handing over the payment of compensation to the local authorities.  As a member of a local authority that is what affects me most.  I would ask the Minister to state clearly whether that compensation will be covered by the 100 per cent. grant of which he spoke.</P>
    <P>Before the Bill leaves this House I think an amendment should be inserted making it clear who is going to pay for the damage caused before any local authority is asked to take responsibility for it.  In County Sligo the Brosna River drains into the Moy in County Mayo.  If the authorities in County Mayo object to our draining into the River Moy, can we proceed to drain this river?  Those are the points on which I want some explanation.  I do not object to giving powers to the <Col N="2346" /> local authorities to drain these rivers but, before I return to Sligo, I want to know definitely who is going to pay for any damage that may occur.  It is stated clearly here that the people along the main river have the right to claim damages.  Does that right still remain?  Who is going to pay for the damage caused?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFlynn" hpid="Mr. J. Flynn Mr. J. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of a local authority I welcome this measure.  The majority of the farmers and workers in my county welcome the Bill.  We regard it as a step in the right direction. For years we have been agitating in regard to certain roads and flooded areas.  The Land Commission could not intervene.  Other Departments could not intervene.  The local authority were powerless to assist.  This Bill will give us an opportunity of doing good work.  We have heard a good deal about the infringement of the rights of citizens.  As far as I am concerned&mdash;and I have heard opinions expressed on this by others&mdash;I believe that that is imagination and I think that the position has been misrepresented in that respect.  This is a business-like way of dealing with an urgent problem and of giving employment. My only desire is to get it through as quickly as possible.  That is what we want in County Kerry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Great play has been made on the question of compensation.  We have our own officials in the county council. We have competent engineers who can make surveys and assess any damage that may be caused.  There are certain implications in the Bill which I shall not enter into at this stage.  The question of the easement of flooding is, perhaps, too complicated.  In order to relieve a flooded roadway and improve the adjacent land one may flood out a man further down.  The question is can one, under this Bill, go right through to the outlet?  As far as I can understand 90 per cent. of this Bill is confined to flooding affecting roadways. Watercourses and canals are mentioned but the main stress seems to lie on flood damage to roads, villages and towns.  From that point of view the Bill is not so extensive as some Deputies would seem to think.  Some of the speakers seem to be under the impression <Col N="2347" /> that one can carry out extensive drainage.  It is, however, an ideal measure and one to which we have looked forward for years.  Speaking on behalf of the people whom I represent I am glad to say that it will be welcomed by the people of County Kerry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I want some information from the Minister with reference to this Bill.  In my constituency all the rivers empty into the sea.  We have, however, sluice-gates here and there on small rivers and extensive flooding has occurred from time to time because these gates have fallen into disrepair.  It has occurred in Portmarnock, Donabate, Lusk and other areas.  I had some experience of drainage in the past and I welcome any Bill which will be of assistance to the majority of our people.  I feel, as other Deputies on this side of the House feel, that the Minister should make this Bill go even further than it does.  At one stage I had practical experience of draining a lake into a main river.  The main river was not drained and the result was that the whole countryside was flooded.  If the Minister is not going to clean the main river and the tributaries the scheme will not have the desired effect.  I heard Deputy Donnellan speaking to-day on the arterial drainage scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>You were shedding yourself of responsibility for the arterial drainage scheme and you welcomed the Minister's effort to come along and help you in a small way.  I do not want to be too critical.  I merely want to get a constructive measure which will be beneficial to the majority of our people.  If we go about this in a haphazard way, I am afraid that the surplus water from County Meath will flow into the rivers of County Dublin, if the rivers are not drained from the sea inwards.  I want the Minister to make provision for the care and maintenance of sluice-gates and the cleaning of the main tributaries.  If this Bill is merely going to deal with small streams in a small way, then we shall lose.  In Garristown there are a number of tributaries.  The main river flows <Col N="2348" /> into the sea.  A proper scheme of arterial drainage is essential there. This river is responsible, particularly in Portmarnock, for the flooding of houses and roads every year.  Is the Minister going to run other streams into that main drainage river and make the position worse than it is?  These are matters about which we are deeply concerned.  As I have told the House already I have practical knowledge of this work and I know that except the main tributaries are cleaned the small rivers will only be making the situation worse than it was before.</P>
      <P>We welcome very much all these things such as cleaning under the eyes of bridges, because we know they are long overdue and are most desirable. Why I object to this Bill is that I do not think it is going far enough.  Why did we in this country start an arterial drainage scheme and why did we set up a commission to get all the advice possible when now we are going to take over the thing that we should develop from the main source first?  If you clean the main rivers and then the tributaries running into them you are doing a practical job.  As far as my own constituency is concerned I wish to see the job well done.  I do not want to see in after years that flooding will occur in areas where it has not occurred now.  That has been my experience in the past with reference to small drainage schemes.  Up and down the country the Congested Districts Board started on small schemes where they opened small tributaries into main rivers but did not touch the main rivers.  The result was chaotic.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider this Bill and in his wisdom to see that this Bill is not far-reaching enough to do the work that he has in mind to carry out.  I respectfully suggest to him that this Bill is not going far enough.  It is going to clean small rivers into larger ones and bring about a chaotic condition which I do not think will serve County Dublin very well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With reference to the small sluice gates on the streams running into the sea, is the Minister going to handle this in a practical way?  Is he going to see that the tide is not going to go <Col N="2349" /> into the country and flood the roads? Is he going to deepen the rivers from the very source to stop that flooding? Is he going to build up the banks and stop the tide from flooding in on the land or stop the water that cannot get out as a result of the tide being in? Is he going to build up the banks of the rivers?  I wish to refer to these points which are practical and in the interests of the people I have the honour to represent.</P>

      <P>When the Minister is concluding I want him to assure the House that the same mistake which was made in 1927 as between County Louth and County Monaghan is not going to occur again.  If the Minister claims, as some of the Deputies who supported him have claimed, that this Bill is going to be far-reaching in its importance then it is going to move quite a considerable quantity of water.  Every Deputy in this House and every person in this country who takes any interest in it would like to see water which is doing damage moved off the land and into the sea.  However, if considerable quantities of water are going to be moved by means of this Bill I want to get some assurance that they are going to be moved to the sea and that they are not going to be moved down on to other land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2350" /> In the year 1927 a certain Minister of the then Fine Gael Government decided during a general election that they were going to give £5,000 towards clearing a marsh in County Monaghan. The £5,000 was spent.</P>
    <P>The marsh lands in County Monaghan which were drained were just snipe grounds and they are still snipe grounds but the £5,000 succeeded in delivering the water that was held up in those marshes on to the good lands of County Louth.  For years there was a very bitter agitation by the farmers of County Louth that some step should be taken to undo the damage that was done.  The matter went on for years.  I had intimate knowledge of it at the time because, as a Deputy representing that area, complaints were made to me.  It was not until the middle of the 1930's that we got the then Government to make some amends.  When the 1945 Act was passed the Office of Public Works decided that they were going to open up the Glyde and Dee and when that is done it will certainly pass on the water to the sea.  If, in the course of the next year or two, as a result of drainage of the Counties Monaghan and Cavan millions of gallons per minute are going to be delivered into County Louth great damage is going to be done unless the main rivers in County Louth have been drained before that time.</P>
    <P>It was not for nothing that in all the Drainage Acts which were passed in times gone by, a number of provisions were made which tried to minimise any damage that might be done by ill-considered drainage.  You have all sorts of notifications necessary before drainage can be started.  The farmers who might be affected, the county councils who might be affected, urban councils who might be affected have a right of objection and a right to have their claims heard.  However, under this Bill they have no such rights left them. If there are a few million gallons of water per minute added to the river going through Kilkenny instead of having two feet of water for a couple of weeks you may have ten feet of water for ten weeks.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister was in a <Col N="2351" /> hurry in introducing this particular piece of legislation.  I think that he did so on foot of a promise that he made here that alternative means would be found to employ road workers disengaged as a result of the cutting of grants but, for goodness sake, if we are going to put men to work, let us put them at useful work.  Let us not put them to work that will create damage in the country.  Members of the Opposition will, of course, put forward amendments to this Bill designed to improve it, designed to ensure that while good work may be done under it, no harm will be done under it.  When I read the Holmes Report recently presented to the House, I was interested in the whole report of course, but there was one clause that I thought completely unnecessary.  Deputy Smith referred to it here to-day.  That was the clause which said.  &ldquo;It would therefore seem obvious that any scheme for the straightening, deepening and cleaning of a river should work up from the mouth.&rdquo;  He went on to say: &ldquo;I understand that the Barrow scheme was taken in the middle and resulted in more serious flooding of the land on its lower reaches.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance is, I take it, interested in drainage, as every Deputy representing a rural constituency must be, but in the reply read out here to Deputy Gilbride, he had to say that, in relation to the drainage of one river, the Board of Works would not undertake it because the main artery was not in a position to take the extra water and until the main artery was clear the draining of this particular district was going to cause damage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is in substitution for special employment.  After all, the special employment schemes were meant to deal with very small schemes of drainage.  Is this Bill meant to deal <Col N="2352" /> with very small schemes or big ones? If it is meant to deal with big drainage schemes, then it is a substitute for the work that this Dáil placed in the hands of the Office of Public Works under the arterial drainage scheme of 1945.  If it is simply going to deal with small schemes that are taking a few gallons a minute, it will not do very much harm but if it goes into thousands of gallons a minute and many of them are done in combination, the cumulative effect will be that millions of gallons per minute will have to be dealt with. The Parliamentary Secretary must admit that there is grave danger that, if these schemes are not properly supervised, damage will be done to certain people and that damage may be done to good land whereas the scheme will relieve only very poor land from floods.</P>
      <P>There is one good purpose which marshes serve.  As they become dry in summer time and become flooded in winter they are a natural reservoir against flooding.  In certain countries where they do not exist, artificial marshes are actually built to take the flood waters so as to prevent it getting into the main artery.  These marshes which dry up in summer time and fill up in winter time have a very beneficial effect in curtailing flooding.  We must release the water gradually.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be crazy to attack this drainage problem like a bull at a gate.  If this measure is proceeded with, not only should there be legal safeguards regarding the individual, as several Deputies have asked for on each side of the House, but there should be other safeguards introduced.  There should be some consultation between neighbouring county councils, particularly those that stand between the sea and the other counties which intend to carry out drainage work.  Take, for instance, County Louth, through which several main rivers flow from the inland counties&mdash;Meath, Cavan and Monaghan.  There should be some consultation there and they should get some warning as to how many million gallons per minute extra will be added at flood time to the rivers passing through the county.  As I said before, £5,000 was spent on drainage that was done in a hurry for a political purpose &mdash;just as that which, it seems to me, <Col N="2353" /> has governed the introduction of this Bill&mdash;and it did untold damage to land worth £50 an acre and did not improve the marshes in Monaghan worth 1/- an acre.  How much of the £50-anacre land are we going to destroy in order to relieve land worth 1/-?  That is the question.  The farmer whose land is walked through has the right to get reasonable notice.  We do not seek too long a notice.  If there are farmers who are obstructing and holding up a good scheme, they should be given only a certain time within which to lodge their objections, but they should get some time.</P>

In order that we may provide such safeguards, two things are necessary. The Minister should consider very carefully the objection made here by Deputy MacEntee, Deputy Smith, Deputy Moran and others to certain of the sections.  He should provide some system of giving notice to the farmers, with reasonable time to object and he should set up some sort of authority, other than the initiating authority, to decide as between the farmer and the county council&mdash;or the Minister, if he is doing it in default of the county council.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>On Thursday last, 31st March, I asked the Minister for Social Welfare the following Parliamentary Question:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To ask the Minister for Social Welfare whether he is aware that the Workmen's Compensation (Amendment) Act, 1948, has caused much disappointment in its operation in so far as many recipients of workmen's compensation have failed to derive any benefit by way of increased compensation, under the Act; and, if so, what action he proposes in the matter.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister replied by saying that a few cases had been brought to his notice and then he went on&mdash;quite irrelevantly, in my submission&mdash;to say that Section 7 of the 1948 Act extended existing legislation in the matter of giving the court power to increase or diminish the weekly payments to injured workmen, on it being proved, amongst other things, that there was a fluctuation in wages.  In order to put the Minister on the right track, I instanced three cases in which the 1948 Act did not benefit recipients of compensation at all or only to a limited extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first case was one where workmen were in receipt of pre-accident earnings of 50/- or less.  These people received no added benefit under the 1948 Act.  The second case was of people who were in receipt of compensation based on partial incapacity. These people were not benefited either under the 1948 Act.  The third case was of people whose earnings ranged between 50/- and £3-6-8.  These people benefited only to a limited extent under the 1948 Act.  In reply to that question, the Minister&mdash;again apparently failing to see my point&mdash;referred me to Section 7 of the 1948 Act.  I may point out here, a Leas-Chinn Comhairle, that under Section 25 of the 1934 Act, if a workman on going to court could prove that there was a fluctuation in the rate of wages that he was receiving at the time of his accident, on fulfilling certain other conditions he had a right to get from the court an Order increasing <Col N="2355" /> his compensation.  This applied to adults or infant employees.  The employer had a corresponding right to reduce the compensation in the event of a fluctuation in wages by way of decrease.</P>
    <P>However, the interpretation of the courts on those sections was that, unless there was a prior Order of the court giving the workmen compensation or unless he was receiving it under an agreement registered in the court, Section 25 of the 1934 Act did not apply; so in the new Act of 1948, Section 7 was introduced to overcome this defect.  It provided that, even where people were receiving compensation without an Order of the court or without a registered agreement, they could go before the court and, on proving that their wages had increased by a certain amount, the court could increase their compensation.</P>
    <P>In reply to my Supplementary Question, the Minister again referred to that particular section.  In order to get the Minister's mind off that Section 7, I instanced cases again where persons in receipt of compensation could not get relief.  These were cases of people whose pre-accident earnings were 50/- or less and who in the meantime could not prove to the satisfaction of the court that the rate of wages in their particular grade of employment had increased to an extent sufficient to meet either Section 25 of the 1934 Act or Section 7 of the new Act.  Even though Section 7 could in no way apply to such cases, the Minister again pinned his faith to this particular section and side-stepped the issue I put before him.  I say that he deliberately side-stepped the issue, either in order to boost his own Act, failing to see its difficulties, or because he failed to see the point I was raising.  I am strengthened in that idea because, in the course of his reply to my first Supplementary Question, he used the following words:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Deputy apparently does not realise the potentialities of Section 7 of the 1948 Act, and, if he gets some legal advice, he will find that these people can recover a greater rate of <Col N="2356" /> compensation than he or some of those for whom he speaks appear to realise.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy permit me to interrupt him at this stage?  Might I take this opportunity of saying that, when I made that reply on the last day, I made it completely unaware of the Deputy's professional qualifications and in so far as the reply purported to be even in the remotest degree a reflection on his professional qualifications, I withdraw any such unintended reflection.  I assure the Deputy that, when I was speaking on the last day, being unaware of his professional qualifications, I thought it well to deal with the matter from a non-technical point of view, my legal advisers having assured me that the section has the meaning which I said it had.  I would like to assure the Deputy that nothing was further from my mind than to reflect on his professional qualifications. I want to assure him that I had no such thought in my mind and I would ask him to accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Minister that I accept that explanation unreservedly.  However, I want to maintain that, when the Minister kept referring to Section 7, he did not deal with the points I raised.  Apart from that, the main purpose of my raising this particular question on the Adjournment was to ask the Minister if he now realises that his remarks in regard to Section 7 in no way applied to the cases I have instanced.  The first case was where a person whose pre-accident weekly earnings were 50/- or less and who could not prove to the satisfaction of the court that there was an increase in his wages to the extent that would satisfy the court to make an order increasing his compensation.  Many of those cases exist and I can instance some of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of casual dockers, these people had very unreliable rates of wages&mdash;some weeks they earned a lot of money and other weeks practically nothing.  These people could not say that the rates of wages applicable to their particular grade of employment <Col N="2357" /> had increased.  There are several cases within my own personal knowledge, even though the Minister said that only a few cases had come to his notice.  I can give names and addresses of certain people who have come to me, keenly disappointed about the operation of the new Act, in so far as that is concerned.</P>
    <P>The second case in which people received no benefit is that where the recipient of compensation is receiving it on the basis of partial incapacity. The partial incapacity is assessed on the difference between the worker's pre-accident earnings and what he would be able to earn in some suitable grade of employment in his partially incapacitated condition.  The percentage varies as between 80 per cent. if over £1 and 75 per cent. if less than £1.  The Minister must realise that there are people who, having to live on 37/6 a week and having to provide, possibly, for families, cannot maintain those families on the paltry compensation of 37/6 a week.  In many cases, some of those people undertake parttime work that they are able to do and so supplement their earnings.  As a result of that, their compensation is automatically decreased.  These people make no attempt at malingering but, on the contrary, in order to help their families and possibly improve their prospects of getting over their particular affliction, undertake work and for that reason are not entitled to any increased benefits under the new Act.</P>
    <P>The other people whose pre-accident earnings were more than 50/- per week and less than £3 6s. 8d. per week, which latter figure is the minimum pre-accident wage which would entitle a person to 50/- per week, are not in the same state of hardship as these people to whom I have referred.  Nevertheless, I am not advocating that compensation should be raised to such a figure as would promote malingering&mdash; that compensation should be raised either to the level of pre-accident earnings or to a level in excess of it, because that would promote malingering and any recipient of compensation might well say to himself: &ldquo;Why should I try to get better when I can get more money than I would have if I were earning wages?&rdquo;  I feel, however, <Col N="2358" /> that some provision should have been made for these people whose wages were 50/- or less and who could not possibly prove a subsequent increase in wages.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's difficulty in trying to raise this matter, but the Chair is in a difficulty, too.  I cannot see how the Deputy can discuss the Act <i>per se</i> because the Act is law and we cannot discuss an Act on the Adjournment. The Minister is not responsible for the administration of the Act&mdash;it is the courts which are responsible for the administration of the Act and the courts are not subject to discussion here.  I have allowed the Deputy a good deal of latitude, I think&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Up to a few minutes ago, I was simply stating the question and answer as they took place on Thursday last.  I realise that I am not entitled to criticise or advocate legislation, but what I want to make clear is that the Minister in his reply did not answer the questions I put to him.</P>

      <P>If I can get the Minister to realise now&mdash;I may not have put my case as strongly as I would have wished &mdash;that Section 7, which he told me on Thursday, met the cases I put to him does not do so and that the people I have mentioned are in no way provided for by way of increase under the new Act, I shall be satisfied, having made my point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Norton) William Norton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Lynch is endeavouring to import into this matter an enormity and a gravity which it really has not got and which he must know himself, on reflection, it has not got.  It seems to me that he is striving <Col N="2359" /> after political effect more than endeavouring to expose whatever weaknesses he pretends to discover in the recent Workmen's Compensation (Amendment) Act.  Let me tell the Deputy what we did in that Act.  The Deputy talked about the paltry compensation of 37/6 per week.  I felt that it was so paltry that I was not going to leave it at 37/6 per week.  From 1934 to 1943, it was 30/- per week, which was still more paltry than 37/6, and from 1943 to 1948, it was at the paltry level of 37/6 per week, as the Deputy has properly described it.  Just before last Christmas, I introduced a Bill the effect of which was to raise the ceiling from 37/6 to 50/- per week.  In other words, as between 1934 and 1948, injured workmen had their compensation increased from 30/- to 37/6 a week, an increase of 25 per cent., and the Bill I introduced last December gave them an increase not of 25 per cent. but of 66 per cent.</P>

      <P>Deputy Keyes pointed out that the Deputy cannot take it. Deputy McGrath dodges Deputy Keyes's remark, although complaining about dodging in another sense.  The recent Act stepped up the ceiling from 37/6 to 50/- per week, an increase of 66 per cent.  Is that not a substantial benefit which these people never previously got?  There was nothing to prevent them getting it in 1947, 1946, 1945 or 1944&mdash;every year since 1934&mdash; but they did not get it.  Why?  This House was not keeping it from them&mdash; it was never asked to pass legislation to give it to them.  But they got it last year and they are getting it this year and injured workmen and the unions which cater for them know only too well&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Lynch says that where a person has a certain rate of pay, he gets no increase on 37/6.  The whole basis of workmen's compensation, as Deputy Lynch knows, has been that an injured workman got three-quarters of his pay if he was injured, subject to a maximum of 37/6 per week.  If three-quarters of his pay was less than 37/6, he got less than 37/6. Deputy Lynch now says that if a person has 50/- per week he gets no increase. He gets three-quarters of his pay subject to a maximum of 50/- per week, whichever is the lower.  You are bound to have cases in which people will not get 50/-.  The whole basis of the Act is three-quarters of your pay or 50/- per week, whichever is the lower.  Take the case of the person paid £1 per week, or, in order to avoid the percentages, the difference between 75 and 80 per cent. which is a factor <Col N="2361" /> in the construction of the Act, take the case of a person with £2 a week.  If he meets with an accident, he gets three-quarters of his pay, or 30/-.  Does Deputy Lynch want to give him 50/-per week?  Does he want to give an injured workman 10/- per week more than he would get if he were employed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister allow me to put one question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>If a man was injured about 1934, the year of the passing of the Act, whose wages were 50/-, he could not now go to court and prove that the rate of wages in his grade of employment has advanced.  Does the Minister hold that his rate of compensation should not be increased while he is still totally incapacitated at the present date?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will answer that question with the greatest of pleasure.  Is the Deputy clear on one point?  Under the 1934 Act and under the increased benefit made available by the Emergency Powers Order, 1943, award of compensation was raised from 30/- to 37/6 but that increase in fact was held to be not legally applicable except to compensation awarded as a result of a court order?  Is he also aware of the fact that it was held in court that an injured workman receiving 30/- per week could not get the 37/6 because his 30/- in the first instance was paid by agreement with the employer and not as a result of a court order?  I put Section 7 in the 1948 Act for one purpose and one deliberate purpose, to enable the injured workman to go to court.  This provision was not previously available to him even in a case where his previous compensation was not settled by the court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, the Minister is not dealing with any of the points I have raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have time enough to deal with them and we will deal with them all.  The injured workman was entitled to go to court and if he could show the court that between the time he met with the accident, say, 1934, <Col N="2362" /> and the passage of the 1948 Act his wages would have increased by as much as 20 per cent., he was entitled to ask the court to recalculate his compensation on the basis of his notionally assumed increased wage.  The Deputy admits that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Thanks.  Does anybody know of any worker who between 1934 and 1948 had not his wages increased by as much as 20 per cent.?  If he does, he should identify that worker for us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that the Deputy is right in his premises but I do not want to get into a legal argument with the Deputy because he has professional standing in the matter of the interpretation of this Act.  I have none.  But, I want to say to the Deputy that I am still a bit doubtful as to whether there is not even a remedy for the docker to whom he refers.  I do not want to construe Section 7 of the Act. All I can say to the Deputy is that I have handled many such cases for constituents of mine who told me that their employers had told them that they were not entitled to any increase under Section 7 of the Act and who, when the facts were pointed out and the construction of Section 7 was brought to their notice, the employers paid compensation which, if it had been left to their own construction of Section 7, they would never have paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>That is again applicable to people who have fixed rates of wages that were increased through the years.  Take casual workers and handymen and people like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, it is not a matter for me to interpret Section 7. I am not too sure that these people are denied a remedy even under Section 7, if one compares their hourly rate for that class of work at the time they met with the accident with the hourly rate which they now would get for that <Col N="2363" /> class of work if they had not met with the accident.  However, that is a matter for the courts to construe.  It is not a matter for me to construe, but I am declining to believe that they are placed in the difficult position which the Deputy suggests they are in.  At least, I am not going to believe it until the courts decide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>A partially incapacitated man could get no increase under the 1943 Emergency Powers Order.  If the Deputy looks up the Order, he will realise that the Order did not deal with a partially incapacitated man.  Under Section 7, for the first time since 1934, I permitted a partially incapacitated man to go to the courts if he could show that his wages from the job he had in his partially incapacitated state had increased by as much as 20 per cent., and again, he was entitled under Section 7 to a remedy at court which he had not under the 1943 Act and which he had not since the 1934 Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1948 Act has been a good Act from the point of view of <Col N="2364" /> injured workmen.  As a matter of fact, the provision in Section 7 enables a workman who was injured 30 years ago and who received workmen's compensation at the rate then in operation to go to the courts now, even if he made a voluntary settlement with his employer then, and say to the courts, &ldquo;I met with the accident 30 years ago.  I have been getting a low rate of compensation. During all that period, I never had a remedy in law.  I have got one now under Section 7 of the 1948 Act.  I want to show you that my wages would have gone up by at least 20 per cent. since I met with the accident and because of that fact I ask you to revise my compensation.&rdquo;  The revision may take the form of stepping up the compensation to a ceiling of 50/- per week even though that man was not getting 30/- per week before Section 7 was introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have handled cases in the last few weeks of injured workmen who were receiving compensation as low as £1 2s. 6d. a week.  Under Section 7 they can now go to the court and, having regard to the occupations which they followed when they met with the accident and the pay they would receive for that occupation to-day if they are still following it, they can have their compensation raised from 22/6 to 50/- per week.  Is not an Act that does that a good Act?  I suggest to Deputy Lynch that when he tots up all these cases that he has he will find that they do not occupy many reams of paper.  In my Department only three or four cases have come to notice officially.  In these cases we told the people concerned to go to a solicitor, to show him Section 7 of the 1948 Act and ask him to construe it, and if he feels that they have a case under this section, to go to the courts.  In any of the cases I have handled I have not yet seen a solicitor so handicapped by the circumstances of any case so referred to him that he was unable to plead that the workman was entitled to an increase under Section 7 of the 1948 Act.  I suggest to Deputy Lynch that he should take these cases that he has in mind to the court and give them a good airing there, relying on Section 7, and having more faith in it <Col N="2365" /> than it would appear he has this evening.  I still have faith in it.</P>

      <P>I think the Deputy can make a good circumstantial case because he can still find out what wages the man now doing the job is getting and, so far, the court has not declined to take that as evidence.  If he does that, I feel sure the future of these people will not be as bleak as he thinks it is.  At all events, I suggest that he should not at this stage jettison the very valuable provision in Section <Col N="2366" /> 7, at least, not until the courts have come down against it.  He has not tried the courts yet.  That is the authority to construe the section, not I.  What views I have expressed are the views of a layman, but I still think the section contains valuable safeguards for the injured workman.  Deputy Lynch does not appreciate them, but he has not tested the section yet.  I have tested the section in other cases which came personally to my notice, and the section has stood up to the test I imposed on it.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 6th April, 1949.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare whether he is aware that Johanna Doyle, Derristown, Murrintown, County Wexford, was refused an old age pension on grounds of means; that her husband, Michael Doyle, has been out of work for some time, and that neither the applicant nor her husband has any means; and, if so, whether he intends to remedy this state of affairs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Mrs. Doyle was refused a pension in December, 1947, on the grounds that her means exceeded the statutory limit for pension.  Her means were assessed on half her husband's earnings and the yearly value of a small plot.  She again claimed in July, 1948, <Col N="2238" /> and in connection with this claim, she informed the investigation officer that her husband was still employed and that his wages were higher than in 1947.  This claim was refused on the same grounds as the previous one.</P>
      <P>Mrs. Doyle has now lodged a further claim to pension which will be investigated and determined as soon as possible.  She has not, so far, given any indication to the Department that her husband is out of work.</P>
