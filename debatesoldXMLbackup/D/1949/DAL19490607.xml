      <P>Departmental examination of the proposed social security scheme is now complete and the draft White Paper is being submitted to the Government within the next week.  When the Government's decision is taken, the paper will be printed and published.</P>
      <P>With regard to the second part of the Deputy's question, I can only say that no avoidable delay will be permitted to occur in the preparation of the necessary legislation, but the task involved will necessarily be a heavy one.</P>

      <P>Vacancies which cannot be filled by local registrants are, if the employer so desires, offered to registrants in other districts who are considered suitable.  Suitability for the employment is the determining consideration and no distinction is made between registrants on the grounds of means or dependents, unless the employer stipulates otherwise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare whether he will state, in respect of the period since the end of the Employment Periods, 1948, the total number of registered unemployed persons (a) who were offered work through his Department; (b) who accepted such offers, and (c) the monthly average number of registrants over the same period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to (a) of the question I would refer the Deputy to my reply of the 31st ultimo to a question asked by him relating to the same subject.  With regard to (b) and <Col N="3" /> (c), information in the exact form sought by the Deputy is not available. The following particulars may, however, meet his requirements.  The number of offers of employment through the local offices of my Department accepted during the period from the 1st November, 1948, to the 21st May, 1949, was approximately 31,000.  The weekly average number of persons registered at those offices during the same period, derived from statistics in respect of the Saturday of each week of the period, was 75,097.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCann</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare whether he is aware (i) that many recipients of unemployment assistance have had benefit discontinued because they could not produce, to the court of referees, written evidence of their having been seeking work and (ii) that it is almost impossible for men to get such written statements from gangers or builders' foremen; and, if so, whether he will have the regulation on the matter amended to cover these cases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that payment of unemployment assistance has been refused to persons because they could not produce documentary evidence of their efforts to get work. Such evidence has, however, been voluntarily tendered by certain applicants for unemployment assistance where doubt has arisen as to whether they satisfied the statutory condition which requires them to be genuinely seeking but unable to obtain suitable employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education (a) when the building of the vocational schools at Whitehall and Killester will commence; and (b) what the capacity of each school will be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (General Mulcahy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee is at present engaged on the preliminary arrangements in connection with the provision of two new regional schools, <Col N="4" /> one at Clogher Road, Crumlin, and the other at Aldboro' Parade, North Strand, and for the provision of extensions to the existing premises at 14 Upper Mount Street and 3 Great Denmark Street.  Until considerable progress has been made towards the completion of these it will not be feasible to give an estimated date for the commencement of the building of schools at Whitehall and Killester.</P>
      <P>As regards the capacity of these latter schools nothing definite has as yet been finally decided upon and the matter is still the subject of correspondence between my Department and the committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HarryColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the erection of these schools, particularly the one at Killester, was proposed several years ago, and that the population in these areas is increasing rapidly?  In fact, it has increased very much since the proposal was first made.  I would ask the Minister to see that this matter is attended to in a more urgent way than apparently it is, judging from the reply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter was the subject of discussion a short time ago between myself and the representatives of the Vocational Education Committee in Dublin.  I think that any final decision as to what type of school, or what size of school, would be built at Killester would have to wait until we had full experience of the Whitehall position, following the building of the school there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The suggestion that the smallholders in Raigha are sub-tenants is incorrect.  They are direct tenants of the Land Commission.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Sea Fisheries Association that some 40 applications for motor fishing boats of various sizes have been received from the area in question since 1939; but, as the Deputy will have gathered from the annual reports of the association, it was virtually impossible to obtain delivery of motor engines during the emergency period.  Fortunately the supply position has now become easier, and the directors hope to clear during the next 12 months a considerable proportion of the applications now on the association's &ldquo;waiting list&rdquo;.  It is not feasible to forecast the number of boats to be issued to West Cork applicants; but I can assure the Deputy that they will be allotted their fair share of the total available for supply to the <Col N="7" /> association's members generally within the coming months.  Prior to 1939 six motor fishing boats had been issued to West Cork members.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether it is a fact, as reported in the Press, that the British Ministry of Food have agreed to purchase all our surplus farmers' butter at 2/1 per lb. f.o.b.; and, if so, whether he can state the price per lb. that will be payable to producers under this scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true that the British Ministry of Food have made an <Col N="8" /> offer of 233/4 per cwt. (2/1 per lb.), f.o.b. Dublin or Cork, for the farmers' surplus butter.  This offer has been accepted.  The butter will be exported by registered butter factories, and the price which these factories will be in a position to pay to producers will be determined by their costs of collection, processing, packaging, etc., matters which ultimately depend on the efficiency of the factories concerned, a factor which I am sure the Deputy will agree, we have every reason to depend upon for satisfactory results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that it was published in some of the papers that the price payable to producers is not more than 1/7 or 1/8 per lb. and does he not think that that would be a very low price and that it would represent too high a margin of profit for the wholesalers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is aware by this time that all the factors that go into making up the final price to the wholesaler are very carefully and thoroughly gone into before arriving at that price, and the object behind those efforts is to secure the maximum for the producers and no exorbitant or unreasonable profit for anybody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister consider, in view of the fact that creamery butter carries a subsidy, the desirability of a similar subsidy for this type of butter, which is a product of equal quality?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Deputy is speaking for, or would claim to speak for, farmers generally in his supplementary question.  The price is <Col N="9" /> not unreasonable, and one of the Deputy's headaches is the extent to which promises made have been kept.</P>

      <P>I am not clear from the terms of his question what information precisely the Deputy desires.  The Estimate for Public Works and Buildings for the current financial year includes a provision of £18,520 for the general maintenance of the harbour. In addition, a provision of £1,500 has been made to meet the balance of the cost of £2,000 for necessary improvements to the mail boat pier to suit the new mail steamers.</P>

      <P>During the past year my predecessor on a number of occasions invited the co-operation of large employers of labour in the general housing programme by building houses for their employees.  In April of this year he sent a personal appeal to several hundreds of industrial and commercial firms where not less than 50 persons are employed and which might be expected to be in a favourable position to provide the necessary capital for housing purposes.  Local authorities have been invited to supplement this list, and as a result a similar appeal is being addressed to other concerns which might be in a position to cooperate in the housing drive.</P>
      <P>Messrs. Arthur Guinness, Son and Co., Ltd., the Irish Sugar Co., Ltd., and a number of other concerns have already made arrangements for the building of houses for their employees.

    <Speaker pid="SeanOGrady" hpid="Mr. O'Grady Mr. O'Grady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister concludes I would like to say a few <Col N="22" /> words on some matters under this Estimate.  I do not intend to delay the House unduly.  The ground has already been fairly well covered by the previous speakers.  Nevertheless, there are a few matters to which I would like to direct the Minister's attention.</P>
      <P>When the Minister and his colleagues came into office some 16 months ago they seemed to have misled themselves by their own propaganda prior to taking office.  They had come to the conclusion that everything that Fianna Fáil had done was wrong and that, therefore, the best thing they could do was to reverse the entire policy of their predecessors.  I am glad, however, to know that the Minister has been learning from his experience.  I think, perhaps, his trip to America helped to add a little to that experience and helped to open his eyes to the fact that all the policy of Fianna Fáil was not wrong.  The result is that we find him, both while he is in America and on his return home, stressing the importance of the tourist industry, despite the fact that during the election all the propaganda was directed towards a wholesale condemnation of tourism merely because Fianna Fáil had done so much to develop it.</P>
      <P>According to the Tánaiste, this industry is estimated to be worth £35,000,000 per year.  That is not to be despised when one compares it with the exports of cattle during the years 1947 and 1948.  In the year 1947 exports of cattle, a very important item to the people as a whole, amounted to £17,000,000; in the year 1948 it amounted to £16,000,000&mdash;a drop incidentally of £1,000,000.  Comparing the two, we find that the tourist industry was equal in value in one year to the total exports of our cattle in two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with our tourist traffic the Minister would be well advised to examine the facilities provided for our tourists, particularly those provided at the chief port of entry at Cobh.  I have heard many complaints as to the facilities available there for the large numbers of Irish-American tourists who return to this country by that <Col N="23" /> route.  If the Minister can do anything, steps should be taken at once to provide proper and adequate facilities. For a long time to come the bulk of these Irish American tourists will come via Cobh despite the fact that numbers landing at Rineanna will probably increase as time goes on.  In that connection, I am reminded of the disastrous effect on that airport of the change of Government.  The sale of the Constellations, over which there was so much jubilation immediately the Government took office and despite the profit of £450,000, was a severe blow to Rineanna.  Immediately following that sale we had the closing down of the Lockheed repair works there. That was a very important industry so far as Clare was concerned, and provided employment for 286 skilled mechanics.  The disappearance of an industry of that magnitude is a serious loss to that part of the country. Tourists coming from abroad were, of course, described by some critics of the then Government as locusts who were eating up our food and leaving the poor of this country in a state of starvation. I wonder is that still the opinion of these politicians?  Short as the time has been, I am sure some of them have already come to realise the importance of that industry.</P>
    <P>Another change of policy on the part of the Government has been the closing down of the hand-won turf scheme and their frowning upon fuel production in the country as a whole. In my opinion, with the present cost of coal, the production of even hand-won turf is an economic proposition, and the Minister and those of his colleagues who can influence turf production would do well to reconsider their attitude.  This industry provided very necessary employment in rural areas.  If the position could be restored, as no doubt it could be, by insisting on a good standard quality of turf which would in time help to undo the evil reputation which the production of bad turf created in the minds of city people in the past, turf production, with proper supervision, could, in my opinion, be made an economic proposition.  It would help to provide much needed <Col N="24" /> employment and to stem emigration, particularly in the western parts of the country.</P>
    <P>The principal function of the Minister in charge of this very important Department is to create conditions under which more employment will be provided for our people.  As a result of the plans made by the Fianna Fáil Government, we saw, before the change of Government, that industrial employment was slowly but surely increasing.  I shall just give one or two figures to illustrate that point. In September, 1945, there were employed in certain industries a total of 75,603.  By 1948, the number employed in the same industries had grown to 92,599.  That was a total increase of 16,996&mdash;let us call it 17,000 in round figures.  That was an average annual increase of 5,565 but, whatever the reason, immediately after the change of Government took place, a slowing up seems to have taken place in that progress.  In March, 1948, there were 92,106 employed in these industries and in September, 1948, 92,599, or an increase of 493 in the six months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures show that there was an increase of 7,000 in the 12 months&mdash;a much higher increase than the average for the preceding three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOGrady" hpid="Mr. O'Grady Mr. O'Grady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the figures only for the six months.  However, I shall accept the Minister's statement, of course.  The impression given to me by the figures were that the position had become more or less static.  If the Minister's figures are correct, I am very glad, because it would be no pleasure to anybody in any part of the House to find that there had been a worsening in the satisfactory position that existed when the change of Government took place.  I do hope that the Minister will forget the prejudices of the past and that where he finds that the plans prepared by his predecessor were such as to give good hope of industrial expansion and the provision of employment, he will go ahead with the work, despite past prejudices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter to which I should like to refer is the proposed nationalisation of the railways.  That is a very big question on which opinions are <Col N="25" /> bound to differ.  It is a matter which the Minister and his colleagues will have to consider very carefully.  There are many difficulties in nationalisation. If we look at the results of nationalisation in other countries, I think they will give the Minister food for thought before he takes that step.  There is a lot of criticism about Government interference with industry and I think the Minister would be well advised to avoid such interference wherever he can.  The railways are the life blood of the country, for without adequate transport you cannot, of course, have proper industrial development in the country.  If they are taken over by the State, there is a danger that every dispute between the workers and their new employers will become a matter into which politics will enter.  I think nothing could be more disastrous for a large institution such as the railways than to have these matters determined on a political basis.</P>
    <P>So far as the Industrial Development Authority is concerned, my opinion is that the Minister, in consultation with the experts of his Department, would be the best authority to say whether any projected industry should be approved or otherwise.  The only effect of submitting such questions to the Industrial Development Authority will be to put a brake on the development of industry.  If the Minister were of that mentality and wanted an excuse, he could shelter behind that new authority in order to avoid criticism. He could easily say that as soon as the Industrial Development Authority had made up its mind he was prepared to go ahead but that he would have to await its decision on whatever matter was being considered by it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrigetMRice" hpid="Mrs. Rice Mrs. Rice">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Rice</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no desire to delay the House but I should like to make a few remarks from a woman's standpoint regarding the cost of living.  We have been told recently by Deputies from the city and from the country that the cost of living has gone down.  I do not at all agree with that statement.  It is no relief to a harassed housewife to be told that the cost-of-living index figure is down by half a point or so if, when she goes into a shop to buy the necessaries of life with a pound or a <Col N="26" /> few pounds, she finds there is no reduction in the cost of living, as far as the essentials of life are concerned.  Although shops are full of goods which were not to be had during the emergency period, still prices have not come down in any way at all.  There may be some small articles, but with regard to food and clothes prices are just as high as they were at any time during the emergency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the many statements which have been made that shopkeepers and other people in this country were aided and abetted by the Fianna Fáil Government to fleece the public, it is due, I think, now to the country and to the people that the present Government should say that they cannot bring down the cost of living and that the allegations made against the previous Government were unfounded.  I would like the Minister to tell us any one article of clothing which has gone down in price.  From the smallest thing you can think of to the highest, dearest material, the price has not gone down.  Even potatoes are too dear.  In Dublin, I understand, housewives have to pay 2/4 for potatoes which are sold down the country for 9d.  That is an extraordinary thing to happen in an agricultural country and that is only one item.  Then, of course, the cost of living has gone up considerably for people in the professional classes where there is one wage earner in the family, the man of the house, and no other money is coming in.  He may have got a rise in his salary, but as the cost of living has gone up, he is just as he was.  These people are pretty badly hit by the fact that rates and valuations have gone up by leaps and bounds.  In the case of one family I know their rates were £40 and are now £60 and that is a very big increase in one item.  The housewives of this country are in no better position to-day than they were in during the five years of the emergency.  Everybody knows the difficulty the Government had at that time to preserve the people of this country, to preserve the neutrality of the country, to supply bread to the nation and how they were abused for that.  I would like the <Col N="27" /> Minister to state now if he can honestly with regard to what item of goods there has been a reduction in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>Another matter that I am very interested in is that a number of boys and girls in our universities obtain degrees in chemistry and engineering every year and there is no outlet for them up to the present.  They were hampered during the war as they could not get jobs in this country, and I would like to ask the Minister if there is any prospect of advancement for them in industry.  After all, we are told that there is a great demand for Irish technicians abroad, and I cannot for the life of me understand why Irish boys and girls cannot put their years of learning into practice and get a chance at home.</P>
    <P>I would also like to know from the Minister if he is going on with the project to manufacture sulphate of ammonia and copper sulphate in this country.  It would provide a large amount of employment, and the raw material is, I understand, available. Not alone would it give employment to the workers, but it would absorb boys and girls with university degrees and give them a chance of a livelihood in this country.  If the Minister for Finance objects to giving money for that, I think it would be excellent to apply Marshall Aid to it as has been done in India.  A sulphate of ammonia plant has been established there on Marshall Aid.</P>
    <P>I think it is due to the country and to the people that the Minister should now make a statement that he cannot really bring down the cost of living and that the allegations that Fianna Fáil had aided and abetted the fleecing of the people of this country were untrue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Morrissey) Daniel Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Morrissey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like at the outset to express to the House my appreciation for the manner in which the discussion of this Estimate was approached and also for the general tone of the debate.  There are two or three matters which I will deal with later, but perhaps it would be no harm, in view of its undoubted importance, <Col N="28" /> if I were to take as the first matter to which I would refer the question of the cost of living, which was raised just now by Deputy Mrs. Rice, and which was raised by quite a number of Deputies from various sides of the House during the course of the debate.  A lot of nonsense is talked, both inside and outside this House, about the cost of living, and a good deal of nonsense is talked, particularly from the Fianna Fáil Benches, about the cost-of-living index figure.  I hope to give a few small points, a few small items of information, which may be of interest even to Deputies on the opposite side.  First let me say that if Deputies want to approach this question of the cost of living and the cost-of-living index covering the period of the last 15 months, and if they want to approach it in a real way, an honest way, they must advert to the fact that during that period of 15 months in respect of a great many raw materials there was a continuous increase in price and that in respect of many of these raw materials that increase is still continuing. That, of course, inevitably has its effect on the cost of the article, but what is much more important and which Deputies&mdash;indeed, I am not confining my remarks in this respect as they can apply to some Deputies on my own side&mdash;forget or at least choose to ignore is the fact that during the last 15 months there have been more increases in wages and salaries than during any other similar period in the history of this country.  I want to be frank about this matter.  The cost of living is not as low as I would like to see it and it has not come down as rapidly as I would like to see it coming down, but I do suggest that the officers in my Department who are responsible for price control are entitled to credit in that, notwithstanding the fact, as I have said, that there were increases in the prices of many raw materials and that we had this, what I might call, spate of wage and salary increases over the last 15 months, there has been no increase, not even by one single point, in the index which was framed by our predecessors as between February, 1948, and February, 1949.  I have not yet the latest figure for mid-May.  Not <Col N="29" /> only that, but it is an undoubted fact that in respect of a great many items of general domestic utility, items which people have to buy very frequently but which do not figure in the cost-of-living index, there has been a decrease in price and over a very wide range of goods.  I am prepared to give any Deputy of this House, on request, a list of the commodities on which price reductions have been secured over the past 14 or 15 months, and, as I say, that comprises a pretty wide list of articles which do not figure in the cost-of-living index.</P>
      <P>As I am on that index question, may I remind Deputies on the opposite side how they dealt with the rising cost of living?  In mid-May, 1947, the last year in which Fianna Fáil were in office, the figure on the old index rose from 293 in the previous November to 319.  The Government then got afraid and panicky about it, but they were not able to take any really effective steps to bring down the cost of living, so they simply indulged in subterfuge.  Instead of changing the cost of living, they changed the figure of the index and we got a new figure.  Then, of course it was in order to complete that picture that we had a supplementary budget in November 1947.  It is interesting to remind the House that the November 1947 Budget had the effect of stabilising the new index at 100, but the Fianna Fáil Party took off the index, when they were increasing the price, beer and tobacco; and those items, which were dropped from the index, had the effect of reducing the figure from 101 to 97, so that by removing beer and tobacco from the cost-of-living index they reduced the cost of living by four points.  These are the people who come into the House and preach to me about reducing the cost of living.  I would prefer to see the real cost of living being shown in all its nakedness in the figures than adopt a cheap subterfuge of that kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, leave it at that. There are many other things I could say about the cost-of-living index.  I want to emphasise again that I am not speaking now solely to the members of the Fianna Fáil Benches, but also to some members on this side of the House who occasionally let themselves loose on the cost-of-living index without taking very much trouble to ascertain the true facts and the real position.</P>
      <P>In the course of the debate, a large number of items were raised and so far as I can I will try to deal with them. Deputy Lemass referred to a number of matters, but his remarks were, in the main, directed towards certain activities of Córas Iompair Éireann, particularly the proposed new bus station at Store Street, the chassis factory and the springs shop.  He said that one, if not the sole, reason why this building was being erected at Store Street was that a central bus station was required.  There is no doubt that a bus station is required and also central offices to house all the clerical staff of Córas Iompair Éireann were required.  The intention was that Store Street would act not merely as a bus station but also as the central headquarters.  It had been calculated that they would save money on it, that it would be cheaper for them to build this place and equip it and transfer all their officers there, than for them to pay rents and other commitments in relation to the present offices at the various railway stations.  In my opinion, that was a fallacy.  I believe that the interest and sinking fund, even on the original estimate for the cost of the Store Street building, would have been more than any cash commitments they have now to meet in respect of office accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know if it occurred to them to consider to what purpose the evacuated <Col N="31" /> offices at Kingsbridge, Westland Row, Broadstone and various other stations would be put once they had cleared out.  I think they would be sheer waste and would become derelict. Situated as they are in the middle of railway stations, right in the heart of the railway work, they could not be let to outside concerns.  Whatever might have been the risk, and however well-founded or otherwise their conclusions might have been when they started, those conclusions were founded on an estimate of £450,000 for the building of the station at Store Street. It is going to cost at least twice that amount and I have no hesitation in saying, from the information at my disposal, that before it is completed and ready for occupation by the clerical and headquarters staffs of Córas Iompair Éireann, the cost will exceed £1,000,000.  I am not now going into the question as to the wisdom or otherwise of the location.  We can debate that on another occasion, if it is thought desirable to do so.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass also asked about the chassis factory and asserted that we were making a cardinal mistake in not proceeding with it.  We have no intention of proceeding with the production of chassis there under the agreement or along the lines originally laid down by the board of Córas Iompair Éireann.  The building is in course of construction and will be completed, and it will be decided at a later stage for what purpose it will be used.  The chassis factory was built, designed and planned for an economic production of ten chassis per week.  The estimated requirements of Córas Iompair Éireann itself were only four chassis per week &mdash;two lorries and two buses&mdash;so that, in order to make it an economic proposition and to produce ten chassis per week&mdash;eight of the ten being lorries&mdash; they would have to produce six per week, as against their own two, for the competitors outside.  On the face of it, that seems to me to be a very adequate reason for stopping the production of chassis in this shop.  As it was originally planned by Córas Iompair Éireann, it strikes me as a most extraordinary proposal.  With regard to the agreement itself, which <Col N="32" /> they made with Messrs. Leyland, which also contains some rather strange clauses, we can go into that again at a later stage.  The same thing applies to the springs shop.  The building was under construction and will be completed.  Whether springs will or will not be made there is a matter to be decided when we see the position as it will be then.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass also asked me some questions about Cement Limited, the production of cement and the reason for the delay in building the factory extension at Limerick.  The company at present is producing cement to the full maximum capacity of the present equipment.  The delay in proceeding with the Limerick extension is very simply explained; the company is not prepared to proceed with the building of that extension except on terms and conditions to which I am not prepared to agree.  The Deputy is quite conversant with that matter himself, as he was dealing with it and negotiating with the cement company during the time he was Minister.  The Government is more than anxious that the work at Limerick on this extension would start at the earliest possible moment.  We are prepared to agree to what we consider not only reasonable but generous terms and I can only hope that the cement company will see that the conditions and terms to which I am prepared to agree are reasonable and almost on the generous side.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass also referred to the question of steel for shipbuilding.  All I can tell the Deputy and the House on that matter is that I have neglected no opportunity since I became Minister to procure the biggest possible allocation of steel for this country for ship building and other purposes.  I think I can say I have devoted more time and attention to that matter than perhaps to the procurement of any other raw material for the country.  I have not made very much progress.  There was over 1948, and there has been to date, some slight improvement and some slight increase, but it is not very substantial.  The Deputy, of course, is aware of the steel position in Britain and of the difficulty of getting steel. However, we have made continuous <Col N="33" /> efforts and will continue to press for an increase in the allocation.</P>
    <P>I want to come now to another important matter, the matter of unemployment. It is a matter in respect of which the speeches made&mdash;and again I am not confining my remarks to the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;and the approach to it and in particular to the speech I made in Westport were not facing up to the position in the way in which it must be faced up to.  There has been misrepresentation and distortion of what I said, but far from receding from the position I then took up or recalling any word I uttered on that occasion, I want to reiterate and emphasise what I said, because I look upon this matter as a matter of fundamental national importance.</P>
    <P>In order to clear the ground, perhaps I will be allowed to quote what I did say in Westport.  I had been referring to the necessity for increased production; I had been urging people to support home industry; and I had been outlining certain of the national schemes which the Government had in hand, certain of the schemes were initiated by my predecessor and which this Government decided to proceed with.  I should like Deputies to listen carefully to what I am now about to read, because I propose to ask if there is any Deputy on any side of the House who wishes to challenge anything contained in these words.  I proceeded to say: &ldquo;It is, however, a matter of grave concern to the Government to find that very considerable difficulty is being experienced in obtaining the required number of workers for these schemes. It is indeed remarkable that, at a time when unemployment is regarded as one of our most serious problems, sufficient men cannot be obtained in rural Ireland....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want Deputies who have been taunting me with expecting city-born and bred workers to go down and cut turf in the bogs to take special note of the fact that I said &ldquo;in rural Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...for work on turf production and electricity development.  Bord na Móna had employment available in 14 counties on production and development <Col N="34" /> work.  Having failed to obtain an adequate response from men who had been previously employed by them, the board approached the employment exchanges.  The response in this case was also poor, although about 28,000 men with some experience of turf work were registered as unemployed. Radio and newspaper advertising was then resorted to, but as late as a week ago the labour force needed had not been obtained in 11 of the 14 counties concerned.  The conditions of employment on turf work are good.  The board's rate for unskilled workers is 1/4 per hour for time work, but, whenever possible, work is carried out on piece rates designed to enable the average worker to earn 1/8 per hour and, in fact, good men earn 2/- and over.  Camps for workers are provided in Carlow, Kildare, Offaly and Tipperary, and, where adequate labour is not forthcoming locally, whether camps exist or not, Bord na Móna organise lorry trips over a radius of 12 to 15 miles where sufficient numbers can be obtained in towns and villages within that radius.</P>
    <P>The experience of the Electricity Supply Board on the Erne hydroelectric scheme has been somewhat similar.  Owing to the shortage of available labour it has been necessary to recruit workers for the scheme from as far away as Galway, although, at mid-April, there were over 9,200 persons registered as unemployed at the local office in Donegal and over 1,100 in County Sligo.  Employment is at present available for an additional 100 unskilled workers, but they are not forthcoming.  I understand also that men refused employment on the Erne scheme, preferring instead to go to Scotland as migratory labourers for a few months of the year.  Adequate housing and canteens are available on this scheme and unskilled labourers are paid 1/10 per hour for a minimum of 48 hours per week, with the possibility of overtime.  I am amazed that Irishmen are prepared to continue in idleness throughout the country when these opportunities for employment have been made available.  This state of affairs cannot be tolerated and the persons concerned will have to realise that they cannot be kept in idleness at <Col N="35" /> the expense of hard-working Irish men and women.  I have repeatedly emphasised that we cannot even maintain our existing standard of living unless we produce more, and, if some of our citizens are not prepared to produce at all, it is not necessary for me to stress what our future will be.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is there anything wrong with that? Deputy Lemass is smiling.  Does he see anything wrong with it?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no change of rôle so far as I am concerned &mdash; not the slightest.  Let me go further and say &mdash;the Minister for Finance referred to this matter before &mdash; that we took four employment exchange areas in rural Ireland in a county where turf is to be found and where turf is cut and saved in practically every parish.  Out of the four labour exchanges 319 single men, no man being over the age of 45 years, were selected as suitable in every way for the class of work&mdash;national work, let me add&mdash;which was to be done.  Out of the 319 single men so selected nine men offered themselves for work.  I want to ask Deputies on all sides of the House is that not a position that requires very serious consideration from every Party and every member of this House?  Does not it disclose a situation that has in it dangers to the State itself?  I resented &mdash; particularly coming from people like Deputy Briscoe and perhaps I should resent it even more coming from certain Deputies on my own side of the House&mdash; being told, when we talk about unemployment and say that men are offered work on fair conditions and at decent wages that they ought to accept it, that that is a return to the old mentality. Which old mentality?  I have some experience and knowledge of trade unions; I have some knowledge of the Labour Party; I have some knowledge of Labour Party policy.  I have yet to learn that either by trade unions or the Labour Party or any other Party in this House was it ever laid down as a duty of this House other than to provide suitable employment at fair wages and conditions.</P>

I am sure there is no Deputy who is not concerned with the fact that here we have two great national schemes, two schemes which I am urged from every side of the House to proceed with with the utmost rapidity.  As a matter of fact, one of the Deputies who criticised me for my remarks about the unemployed and people who would not accept work that was offered to them, also criticised me because Bord na Móna were not proceeding rapidly enough with the work.  We have not reached within 2,500 of our peat requirements in Bord na Móna for this year but at the present moment we are short 1,670 men that we require.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have.  Let me quote from a newspaper that I have here. I do not know anything about it.  I do not know what its political views are or if it has any.  It was sent to me by Bord na Móna.  The article is headed: &ldquo;£8 weekly for Bog Workers &mdash;and they can't be got&rdquo;.  It says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="37" />&ldquo;Bog workers can earn up to £8 per week at the present time on any bog where Bord na Móna operates. Anybody who can work will be taken on.  Yet any ganger with whom a <i>Herald</i> reporter talked during the week&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;this is not the <i>Evening Herald</i>&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;complained of not having enough men.</P>
    <P>Accompanied by the district superintendent, Mr. J. Hanafin, writes a <i>Herald</i> reporter, I made a tour of bogs in Roscommon and Westmeath during the week and not in one single instance did I meet a ganger who did not want more men.</P>
    <P>Nobody seems to know what is the real cause of the shortage of labour....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It goes on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The strange thing about it is that wages were never so high.  Four of a crew on a cutting machine can earn an average of £8 3s. 0d. a week. Yet, on every bog there are machines lying idle because men cannot be got to work them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The reason I am reading this is that it gives not merely the names of the bogs but the names of the gangers who were interviewed.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On one bog near Loughglynn (County Roscommon) crew men were earning an average of 30/- per day.</P>
    <P>There is any amount of work for juveniles at rates of 1/- per hour. Young lads after leaving school can work at turning and footing turf for as many hours as they wish and get paid for it.  Children and so on....</P>
    <P>Any way and every way the bord will take workers&mdash;but they cannot get them.  Workers are wanted in Limnagh, Ballyglass, Clooncoose, Cloonroughan, Lisananny, and every other bog.</P>
    <P>Lorries travel from non-turf areas to bogs every morning, transporting workers, and even this is not sufficient to meet the demand.</P>
    <P>A curious feature of the shortage is that there are hundreds signing on at all &lsquo;dole&rsquo; offices every day&mdash; signing that they are able and willing to work if they can get it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="38" /> In Westmeath the bord tried to get 100 men from the labour exchange.  Not one turned up for work.  Recently, out of 300 &lsquo;dole-men&rsquo; in two offices, 30 turned up to work.  In Boyle, five out of 125 reported for work; in Castlerea the figure was 26 out of 158.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He makes the comment: Surely there is something amiss here.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Bord officials say they get every co-operation and assistance from managers and other officials in the labour exchanges, and all their efforts are of no avail.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He went down to the bog at Lisananny, Castlerea.  He interviewed ganger Frank Flannery, ganger McDonald in Loughglynn, and so on down along. There is a picture.  Let me give Deputies the latest figures which are for the week ending 25th May.  There were employed by Bord na Móna 5,225 men; vacancies unfilled, 1,670.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister give any analysis of the length of time these men stay?  Could he say what proportion of that 5,000 is constant or is there a drift in and a drift out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, you will always have a certain drift in and out in any job of that kind, no matter how good the conditions may be.  My information is that the vast majority go in there at the beginning of the season or early in the season and remain to the end of the season.  That is my information. Remember, we are in the same position in relation to the Erne development.  That scheme has been delayed for months and months beyond its normal time, not only because of the difficulty but because of the impossibility of getting sufficient unskilled labour there.  Remember, the wages for a minimum working week of 48 hours for unskilled men are 1/10 per hour.  Remember, also, that on that scheme full board and lodging is provided at 33/- per week.  That leaves the unskilled worker, who works the minimum 48 hours, with 55/- cash in his pocket at the end of the week, having discharged his liability for his full week's board and lodging.  I want to put this to Deputies: What is the <Col N="39" /> use in my being criticised inside this House for not going ahead quickly enough and in my being urged both inside this House and outside this House to get a move on&mdash;what is the use of Deputies talking to me here about the numbers of unemployed&mdash; when we have work available?  What is the use, when I know and there is not a member of this House, certainly not a member from rural Ireland, but knows that there are in every rural area, in every provincial town and in every village, young single men quite capable of doing the work required to be done either by Bord na Móna or by the Electricity Supply Board?</P>

      <P>There is even a special wet-time scheme also.  I am faced with propaganda&mdash;entirely dishonest propaganda; with photographs of people flying out of the country; with lurid stories in some of the newspapers of the conditions under which Irishmen have to fly to work in the mines in South Africa.  I am perfectly satisfied that the conditions which obtain on those two national schemes are at least as good as they are upon any similar schemes in Great Britain or in any other part of the world.  If there is anything seriously wrong with the terms of employment there or with the conditions of employment, I would ask Deputies to come to me and to give me concrete evidence.  I do not want evidence founded on the remarks of the grouser who gets tired at the end of a week or a fortnight.  Again, that remark will be twisted.  It will be twisted and distorted by people who know far less about manual labour than I do and who did far less manual labour than I have done in my time. For 27 years, since the first time I entered this Dáil, I have been, to the best of my ability, trying to uphold the case for the unemployed man in this country.  But at no time during that period did I ever claim that unemployed people were entitled to other than the offer of work at fair conditions and at reasonable wages.  I do not think any responsible Deputy on this <Col N="40" /> side of the House would ask more.  We have to face the fact that this country cannot afford to keep in idleness people who are able to work and who ought to be willing to work.  If Deputies do not subscribe to that view to-day, they will probably begin to think about subscribing to it maybe when it is too late.</P>

I have accepted the information given to me.  I have no reason in the world to doubt its accuracy.  If individual Deputies are in a position to ascertain for me that there are unfair conditions, or conditions which impose on workers hardships which should not be imposed &mdash;particularly in present-day conditions &mdash;well, I am prepared to have these complaints examined and, in so far as I possibly can, to have them set right. I am afraid I have devoted a considerable amount of time to that particular matter.  However, I personally think that it is the most important matter with which I have to deal, not merely from the point of view of my Department or from the point of view of this Government, but from the point of view of the country.</P>

Equally, I resent Deputy Connolly telling  <Col N="41" /> me that I was lecturing and rebuking the unemployed.  I have never lectured the unemployed nor, indeed, have I ever sought to lecture any other section of the community.  I should hope that I have a little more common sense.  But I make no apology to anybody for putting the facts of the situation, in relation to our difficulty in securing the necessary labour to carry on schemes of national importance, before the House and before the country. It is my duty to put that position as clearly as I can not merely before this House, but before the country. Again, let me remind Deputies that in one county, in four employment areas, 319 single men were selected as suitable for this employment and nine out of 319 accepted work.</P>

There is, therefore, no one county to be blackened.</P>

      <P>I have searched for a reasonable explanation but, so far, I have not been able to get it. Deputy Larkin raised a number of points.  He referred to factory inspection. All I will say in connection with that point is that we have increased the number of inspectors and we intend to increase the number still more.  He also referred to employment in the Liffey Dockyard on ship repairing work.  He made a reference to ship building, with which I shall deal later.  So far as trying to secure that the maximum number of ships for repair would be repaired by the Liffey Dockyard Company is concerned, I have made representations to every shipping company which has its offices in this country &mdash; also to the London, <Col N="42" /> Midland and Scottish, the Great Western Railway and the other companies who have boats plying between this country and Great Britain &mdash; to give, as far as they possibly can, the maximum amount of repair work to the Liffey Dockyard Company.  I have assurances from every one of them that they will do so, as far as practicable. Deputy Larkin returned again to the question of the building of ships by the Liffey Dockyard Company and, in particular, to the new ships which were built for Irish Shipping, Limited. Deputies will, of course, appreciate that those orders were placed before my time.  However, in view of the serious statement which was made by Deputy Larkin on this matter, I made it my business to go into the whole question of the building of these ships. I went into all the files dealing with the negotiations which took place and the correspondence between Irish Shipping, Limited, and the Liffey Dockyard. The Department of Industry and Commerce did not enter into it very much, practically not at all.  Having examined that from beginning to end, I am perfectly satisfied that not only did the Liffey Dockyard Company get a fair break in the matter, but that the officers and the officials of Irish Shipping, Limited, went out of their way to try to remove whatever obstacles and difficulties were in the way of the Liffey Dockyard Company in securing the contract for the building of these new ships.  Not only that, but, as a matter of fact, the board of directors of the Liffey Dockyard Company, both verbally and by letter, marked their appreciation of the help and assistance which they had been given by the directors and officials of Irish Shipping, Limited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The statement was made by Deputy Larkin that the Liffey Dockyard Company could have built any of the new ships which were ordered by Irish Shipping, Limited.  That is not so.  It would not have been physically possible, I am informed, in the present lay-out down there for the Liffey Dockyard Company to build the ships for crossing the North Atlantic.  It would be within their capacity to build the ships which were built for the <Col N="43" /> Baltic; they are about 2,000 tons.  I could give fuller and more detailed information on these matters to show that Irish Shipping, Limited, did everything that it was possible or reasonable for them to do in regard to having these two ships built in Dublin.  I could give that sort of detailed information and give very definite reasons why these ships were not built in Dublin, but I think it is better that I should not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Every conceivable allowance was made.  Not only that, but advice of a nature which should be of the utmost help to the Liffey Dockyard Company was given by the officials of Irish Shipping, Limited.  I am satisfied from the files that the board of directors and officials of Irish Shipping, Limited, went all out as far as they could possibly be expected to go so as to make it as easy as it could be made for the ships to be built in Dublin.  Unfortunately, it could not be done.  I should like to say to the House, however, that, having seen all the files, having read all the correspondence, and having got the full facts of the matter, I am perfectly satisfied that everything in connection with the building of these ships was entirely above board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Larkin also referred to Solus Teoranta.  I think that position is all right.  Deputy Larkin and, I think, Deputy Corry also, asked about the position of Irish Steel, Limited.  Recently I got a report from the board of Irish Steel, Limited, regarding its <Col N="44" /> present position and future prospects, and the matter is under consideration at present.</P>
    <P>We had a great deal of talk, of course, from various sides of the House, particularly from the Fianna Fáil side, about the general unemployment situation and emigration.  Deputies on the Fianna Fáil side of the House were amazingly eloquent about emigration.  You would imagine that somebody reminded them that emigration started in February, 1948.</P>

But in 16 years they had managed the affairs of the State so well that emigration reached figures unequalled since black '47 and '48. Deputy Lemass would like to forget the period when they were pouring out of our ports at the rate of 1,000 per week.</P>

      <P>You can always know when you are getting home a thrust on &ldquo;the boys&rdquo; opposite; they always start to squeal.  America had closed its doors in 1932, but the American doors were also closed when they were pouring out of here at the rate of 1,000 a week, not to America but to Great Britain, not after 16 months of a Fianna Fáil Government but after 16 years.  Let me make this point.  If there were&mdash;I say &ldquo;if&rdquo;&mdash;40,000 or 50,000 emigrants in the calendar year, 1948, was it the policy pursued by Fianna Fáil for the previous 16 years or the policy pursued by us for ten months which was responsible? <Col N="46" /> Surely if that 16 years of Government had been successful there would not be any emigration.  Surely if the Fianna Fáil policy had been successful we would not have Deputies over there yapping about 84,000 unemployed.  Incidentally, of course, it is only a detail so far as Fianna Fáil Deputies are concerned.</P>

      <P>The Minister did not persistently interrupt anybody.  Deputy Burke is an old friend of mine and I do not like to see him wandering from the straight and narrow path.  Accordingly I tried to bring him back on the path again.  Let me make this clear. Nobody in this country or in this House, and certainly nobody on this side of the House, is throwing his hat up in the air about the unemployment or emigration situation.  We are taking very effective steps to deal with it. We have reached the stage where we have nearly 2,000 jobs available and we have not men to take up the work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>On that question let <Col N="47" /> me say this.  I have nothing to do with it as Minister.  I do not lay down the terms of the rate of wages or the number of hours.  However, I do say this and, again, I can speak from some personal experience.  If I could secure for every unskilled worker in this country that at the end of the week, having paid for his full board and lodging, he could be left with 55/- in his pocket the situation would not be too bad at all.  I hope, though I am afraid it is a very vain hope, that we will not hear as much for the next few months as we have heard for the last few months about unemployment and emigration.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dockrell raised the question of buses in Dublin and referred to the buses that are being used for sightseeing tours.  The number used daily does not exceed six or eight and they are all single-decker buses.  I should like to inform Deputies that, excluding the new buses replacing the Terenure and Dartry trams, 57 additional buses were placed on the Dublin City service during the last few months and an additional 20 will be going on very shortly.</P>
      <P>I am trying to deal with as many points as I can.  With regard to turf production I heard a great deal of talk, but not as much as last year, about hand-won turf.  I do not intend to go back over the ground again except to say this.  There is a market even to-day in this country for considerably more good hand-won turf than is being produced. Deputies are probably aware that what I prophesied this time 12 months actually happened last winter. As a result of the campaign conducted by the gentlemen on the opposite side of the House there was not enough hand-won turf produced last year, notwithstanding the fact that we had the mildest winter probably within our memory.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have one in front of me. I told Deputies and deputations that the result of all that campaign last year would be to so frighten people that they would not produce enough hand-won turf to meet the normal requirements of this country.  It is in indisputable fact that in many counties throughout this country, notwithstanding the mild winter, there was a shortage of turf and it could not be got. An awful lot of nonsense is talked here about hand-won turf and all that was done.  I heard one gentleman during this debate saying that this Government had killed hand-won turf, that there was no more hand-won turf being produced in the country.  Hand-won turf was produced in this country before ever Fianna Fáil were heard of. Remember this, the ordinary normal production of hand-won turf in this country, even when coal was being landed on the quays of Dublin at 19/-, 18/- and 17/- a ton, was 500,000 tons per year.  The full impact of the seven years' war, the cutting off completely of external fuel and the whole of the spate of propaganda that was let loose succeeded in increasing the production of hand-won turf by little more than 25 per cent.  Deputy Lemass knows that quite well and I know it.  I know a lot more about turf than many Deputies who were lecturing me on it and I have a much more practical interest in it. I was dealing in hand-won turf and in machine turf 16 or 17 years ago and putting it against coal when coal was about a fifth of the price it is to-day.</P>

They know themselves that they are absurd.  In many cases they know the statements are untrue.  The statements are made in this House and outside for the sole purpose of having them reported the following day in the <i>Irish Press</i> in the full knowledge that 98 per cent., if not 99 per cent., of the people who read the <i>Irish Press</i> read no other newspaper and, therefore, get only one side of the story.

That is a matter that is under immediate consideration. I do not want to say very much on it. Political capital is being sought to be made by the people on the opposite side that a blanket factory has been closed down.  That is one side of it. The other side of it is that another Irish factory, producing blankets, had, within the past fortnight, to refuse to accept an order from an institution in this country for 500 blankets because it is booked so far ahead with orders that it would not accept the order for delivery in the period required.</P>

      <P>There are other aspects of the tourist traffic on which, perhaps, the Minister might enlighten us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>On that I would like to say, quite honestly, to the House that, so far as I am concerned and so far as the Government are concerned, we appreciate fully the value of the tourist traffic.  We are having the matter examined.  All that we are concerned about is to see that the best possible organisation will be set up to deal not merely with the question of attracting tourists to the country but also with the question of catering for them when they are here.  The matter, as I say, is being very closely examined.  It is being gone into in a very full way.  I should like to assure the House that we are fully conscious of the value of the tourist traffic.  Our only concern is to see that it shall be catered for in such a manner that not merely will it attract tourists at this period and in present world circumstances, but that it will induce them and their friends to come here again when competition for their trade will be much more keen than it is to-day. At the moment I want to say again that I would prefer not to go into details. <Col N="52" /> I do repeat that it has been very fully considered and that the Government are fully conscious of its value to the country.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies referred to the question of a sulphate of ammonia factory.  That is not only a very important matter, but it is a very big question.  I have got a report from Ceimicí Teoranta on the matter which I am having examined.  Deputy Lemass, of course, is aware of its importance and of the fact that its establishment would be a major project. From that point of view it is desirable that the matter should be fully considered in all its aspects before the Government would come to a decision on it.  I can assure Deputies that there has not been any undue delay in dealing with it.  I have to confess that I am not inclined to take the advice which was so freely offered to me, again not merely by Fianna Fáil Deputies but by some Deputies on my own side of the House, namely, to act first and get the matter considered afterwards. I prefer to get the matter considered first, with all the rapidity that is possible, and then to act in the light of all the information that is placed at my disposal.  But, neither in relation to the sulphate of ammonia factory nor, indeed, to any other project is there any desire on my part or on the part of the Government for any waiting or a slowing up in any way beyond the time that is necessary to see that careful and full consideration is given to all these projects.  The successful future of many of those projects, apart from the fact that the establishment of them would run into very big sums of money, will depend entirely on the full examination which they get at the beginning and in seeing that they are started and placed on a sound basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are just a few other matters that I want to deal with.  Statements have been hurled at us, not only from across the House but from off platforms, about the promises which were made by the present Government during the election and which were not fulfilled.  We have been told that we promised to reduce taxation and that, in fact, we increased it.  Of course, we did not increase it.  The truth of <Col N="53" /> the matter is that taxation has been reduced almost exactly by the amount by which Deputy Lemass said it had been increased, namely, by £7,000,000. The fact is that Deputy Lemass, or rather his colleague, Deputy Aiken, when he was Minister for Finance, prepared and had printed a Book of Estimates for the year 1948 which bore on the cover £70,500,000.  The inter-Party Government presented the House this year with a book bearing on the cover a sum of £64,500,000.  That is the trouble with me&mdash;I have a long memory and I can quote for Deputy Lemass and for Deputy Little from the years 1932, 1933, 1937, 1938, 1943 and 1944; I could quote some of them almost verbatim.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>It did this for me anyway, that in the 16 years the Deputies never once succeeded in deceiving me.  I give you the same advice in relation to election promises as I gave you in relation to emigration &mdash; the less you say about them the better.</P>
      <P>There is one other matter I wish to speak about and I shall address my remarks to all members of the House and ask for their earnest co-operation. I am quite sure that that will be forthcoming from all sides of the House.  A couple of months ago I decided to invite representatives of people engaged in trade, industry and commerce and those associated with trade unions to meet me in connection with an effort which I hoped would be made to push and popularise Irish-made goods in this country and to do so on an organised basis and in a co-operative way so as to make an effective effort to meet the spate of advertising and propaganda which our manufacturers have to cope with outside and inside this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very glad to say that I did get a very good response, from the point of view of attendance.  The idea was taken up, I might say almost enthusiastically, and a committee was set up by the parties concerned.  I am <Col N="54" /> not in a position to tell you what the committee have done, but I know they met on at least two occasions.  I am not satisfied, however, that they are acting as rapidly and as enthusiastically as they should.</P>
    <P>I believe, from the evidence which has come into my possession since I became Minister, that no matter how vehemently certain people may deny it, there is in this country not merely a preference for foreign goods, but in certain circles definitely a prejudice against Irish goods.  I am asking all Parties in this House, every individual here, to assist me to break down that prejudice and to demonstrate and prove to our people that there are sound national reasons, and in many cases sound selfish reasons, why our people should, on every conceivable occasion, show a preference for Irish over other goods.</P>
    <P>There are certain people who always try to see evil in everything, certain people who ought to have more sense. Certain of the people whom we are trying to help in this particular campaign have tried to injure it, if not to kill it, by suggesting that this is an intrigue on the Minister's part to get away from providing protection, either by way of tariffs or quotas where tariffs or quotas are necessary to safeguard Irish goods.  It is no such thing; it is not intended in any way to be a substitute for whatever protection might be necessary for any worthwhile Irish product, but it is intended, and it can be of tremendous assistance, in helping to build and develop Irish industries.</P>
    <P>I appeal to Deputies, when they are addressing meetings, whether meetings of their own branches or their own Parties, or where they are addressing meetings in public, in the cities or towns or at the crossroads, to say just a few words either at the beginning or the end of their speeches in favour of having our people ask for, in so far as they know they are available, goods of Irish manufacture.  I ask Deputies to urge the people at those meetings to insist on getting goods made in our own country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="55" /> This is not a Party political matter. Fostering the development of Irish industry is not the prized possession of any particular Party, and I hope it never will be.  I know I can, with confidence, appeal, not merely to Deputies on this side of the House, but to Deputies on the opposite benches.  We all can do a good deal in this matter. I will make a special appeal to the teachers in the schools to try to instil into the children what a sound national policy it is to insist on getting, as far as they are available, goods made in our own country.</P>
    <P>I must confess I find it very hard to understand some people who are going out to-day &mdash; again, I do not want to be taken as applying this entirely to the Fianna Fáil Party &mdash; writing to the newspapers, making speeches, and in ordinary conversation denouncing us on the grounds of unemployment and emigration and going into a shop five minutes later and accepting some article made outside the country in preference to one made inside this country, or accepting an article without asking whether an Irish-made article is available.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to delay the House any longer.  There are points which some Deputies may have raised and which I have overlooked in the course of my reply.  I assure Deputies that if I have failed to reply to any of their points, it was in no way a deliberate action on my part, nor is it due to any reluctance to give the required information. If there are any points which I have not dealt with, perhaps Deputies will be so good as to send me a note about them?  I shall have the facts ascertained and a letter sent to each Deputy concerned setting out the information he requires.</P>
    <P>I can only say, in conclusion, that I appreciate the manner in which the House has debated this Estimate, which is undoubtedly a very important one, and I also appreciate the tone in which the debate was carried on.  I have tried to put before the House a complete picture of the activities of the Department over the past 12 months and I have endeavoured to give some <Col N="56" /> indication of what we propose to do during the coming 12 months.</P>
    <P>As far as the Government is concerned and as far as I am concerned, we are anxious to see the fullest possible development of industry.  The Industrial Development Authority, whose functions we shall be debating here very soon when I introduce the Bill, was set up by us because of our conviction that it was through such a body we could advance more rapidly than we have advanced in recent years, even in the development of industry. Far from there being any question of that authority being set up for the purpose of acting as a brake on industrial activities, I take this opportunity of assuring Deputies that it is because we believe they can speed up matters and reach quicker decisions for people who are either contemplating starting an industry or expanding an industry that this authority was set up.</P>
    <P>On the industrial side our position is pretty good.  We have been making fairly substantial advances.  In the course of my opening remarks, I mentioned that the export of non-agricultural goods in 1948 had increased by almost 20 per cent. over the figure for 1947.  I do not say that for the purpose of scoring points over the Opposition. I state it merely as a fact, a welcome fact, I am sure, to every member of the House.  The increase in the export of non-agricultural goods was almost £2,000,000 over the corresponding figure for the previous year.  I am happy to say that not only has that increase been maintained but it is continuing to grow.  The latest figures I have are for the first four months of this year.  As compared with 1948 there is an increase in the first quarter in the export of non-agricultural goods of almost £1,000,000.  I believe that there is an opportunity for this country to develop not merely in agriculture but also in industry.  I believe that if we get from those who are engaged in industry that co-operation which is so absolutely essential, plus that fair output we are entitled to expect from both employers and employees, I believe that we can compete successfully in many goods on the export market. When one gets on the export market <Col N="57" /> one must, of course, be right both as regards quality and price.  Otherwise one cannot sell.  The fact that we are exporting and are holding our own with very old-established industries in other countries shows quite clearly that our manufacturers are making efforts to be as up-to-date as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I suggest that when discussing industrial development advice should be taken from those men who have a deep sense of patriotism and not because of bank balances in this country or from men who very often have not the vital interests of the country at heart?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This Supplementary Estimate is being introduced to provide for expenditure <Col N="61" /> consequent on the enactment of the Housing (Gaeltacht) Amendment) Act, 1949.</P>
    <P>The total additional amount now being provided is £15,300, which is made up as follows: An additional £600 under sub-head A of the Vote for salaries and wages of administrative staff; an additional £3,260 under sub-head H (1) for the salaries and wages of the outdoor housing staff; an additional £1,840 under sub-head H (2) for travelling and miscellaneous expenses of that outdoor staff; and an additional £9,600 making, with the provision in the main Estimate, £10,850 in all, under sub-head H (3) in respect of the payment of grants under the Housing (Gaeltacht) Acts, 1929 to 1949.  This Estimate is based on a careful survey of housing conditions in the Gaeltacht, and past experience of the operation of the Gaeltacht Housing Acts.</P>
    <P>The total provision of £10,850 in respect of grants may seem small but it must be remembered that grants are paid in instalments according as the work progresses, and in all the circumstances it is thought that the provision of £10,850 under sub-head H (3) will be sufficient to meet claims falling to be made under the amended Acts during the current financial year.  If the work of building and repairing houses under these Acts proceeds at a much quicker rate than is anticipated, then I will have no hesitation in asking the House to make further sums available. Previous experience, however, indicates that the sum proposed will be adequate.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that if the Minister could give us some information as to the extent <Col N="62" /> of the problem which remains to be dealt with as far as Gaeltacht housing is concerned, the House would be able to judge whether the amount that he seeks, the sum of £9,600, can be described as reasonably adequate.  It seems on the face of it to be extremely inadequate from the point of view of the number of houses which can be built for that sum, even allowing that the payments are to be made by instalments and having regard to the amount that is being set aside for administration.  I think that the Minister should give us some more information as to the extent of this problem.  £9,600 cannot possibly be anything more than a mere flea-bite.  In the case of some of the areas in Donegal I am quite sure that there are estates where it would take far more than the whole of this sum, in fact, several times £9,600, to effect a radical improvement.  If the Minister is in earnest about proceeding with housing in Gaeltacht areas I think he will certainly have to spend a very much larger sum than is here contemplated. We have not had the advantage either on the main Estimate or now of having a succinct account of what exactly remains to be done.  I gather from the Minister that he has exact figures, or at any rate that some kind of survey has been made which enables him to judge of the extent of the problem which remains to be solved.  Having regard to the intense congestion in these areas and the very severe economic conditions under which the people try to exist&mdash;they are not really existing in a great many cases but merely living from hand to mouth&mdash;one of the first necessities is to try to provide them with decent houses.  Certainly it is no cause for congratulation for any of us to feel that this problem still remains even to the extent it does remain.  I suggest that the Minister ought to take the House into his confidence and state definitely what is its extent, what is the total sum which he thinks may be necessary and the number of applicants which he foresees will be looking for grants.  Is it the position that there are in fact no applications in at the moment or are there applications on which the administrative staff can get to work?  The value <Col N="63" /> of the scheme is that it helps very poor people in a way that other Government schemes will not in the provision of materials.  Even when their resources are extremely limited Government assistance in securing materials, timber, slates and so on, enables these people who would be absolutely prevented from building houses for themselves to secure accommodation.</P>

      <P>The old grant still remains but the Minister introduced a Bill recently increasing the grants for Gaeltacht houses so that they have not only the standard of ordinary housing but something in excess of that.  I would suggest to the Minister&mdash;I believe it is in his mind and that he is making provision for it&mdash;to make this legislation retrospective to the time the last Government increased the ordinary housing grant.  After all, with all the disabilities the people in the Gaeltacht suffer, the one thing we can do for them is to give them decent housing conditions.  I feel perfectly sure that they will avail of the facilities of this. new provision so that their conditions will at least be brightened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the inspectors&mdash;at least some of them&mdash;responsible for the inspection of applications for Gaeltacht housing grants are rather strict with regard to the knowledge of Irish of the families who make the application. After all, it may happen that a man from the Gaeltacht gets married to a lady from outside the Gaeltacht who may not have a knowledge of Irish and the children in that case may not have the knowledge of Irish required, strictly speaking.  I think a great deal of common sense should be used in cases like that and the responsible inspector should use his discretion.  When he submits his reports to the Department <Col N="64" /> I hope that the Minister for Finance will see that there will not be too much strictness in carrying out the regulations so that nobody living in the Gaeltacht, so long as one member of the family has a knowledge of Irish, will be deprived of the grant to enable him to have a decent house.</P>

    <P>I want to support Deputy Derrig in his request for information as to the smallness of the amount of money for houses and the largeness of the part of the Vote for administration.  Will the Minister say if the sum provided for administration is in respect of not alone this present year but will take in next year and subsequent years? The Minister knows that £10,000 at £250 per house&mdash;assuming they are five-roomed houses &mdash; would only build about 40 houses.  It may be said it is rather late in the year to bring in any more money, but 40 houses spread over the Gaeltacht are not a large amount.  I imagine there are more than 40 people ready to go ahead with the building and, in fact, I know some myself who have begun.  I want to impress on the Minister that there are many cases which cannot be dealt with under this scheme because another section of the Minister's Department, the Land Commission, has not made progress with the rearrangement of holdings.  The Minister knows there is a fairly large number of householders in the Gaeltacht who cannot get the grant under the Gaeltacht scheme or even under the local government scheme for the reason I have stated.  They are living under very bad conditions and I have appealed year after year for these people.  The Minister should bring about some close co-operation between the officials of the Land Commission and of the Gaeltacht housing branch so that the very worst of these cases could be dealt with.  Surely the Land Commission officials ought to be able to say in respect of some of these congests: &ldquo;You will not be changed off your present patch of land and we will allow you to build a house.&rdquo; There may be others who may be in doubt. Where the location of those houses is not in question, why they cannot get facilities under the Act is more than I <Col N="66" /> could understand.  I would ask the Minister to give special attention to that matter.</P>

      <P>There are places in my constituency&mdash;and I assume, also, in other Gaeltacht constituencies &mdash; in congested areas where the people do not qualify for building assistance under any housing Act because the Land Commission will not give a certificate that the lands will not be subject to rearrangement.  To the extent to which the Minister can bring about co-operation between the Land Commission and the Gaeltacht housing section, I ask him to see that the largest number possible of these cases will be brought within the scope of the Gaeltacht Housing Act.  On the main Estimate I mentioned a case in which a young couple purchased a farm which has no house or ruins of a house and under the regulations, as they have been operated, that type of case was not entitled to a grant under the Gaeltacht scheme.</P>

I must say I have only one case in mind at the moment myself but I think that case justified bringing the matter generally to the Minister's notice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear the Minister say that he is prepared to come to the House and ask for further money, if it should become necessary and I take it that the amount here is only a token amount, pending the applications coming in.  As everybody knows, building in the Gaeltacht <Col N="67" /> has been at a standstill for years.  The House made special provision under the Local Government Act in respect of houses in rural Ireland outside the Gaeltacht, but the Gaeltacht was completely forgotten, and, as I say, building has been at a standstill there for years.  I think that this amendment of the Act would need to be advertised so that people will know that it has been amended and that the new grants are now available.  That is the first thing that should be done.</P>
      <P>Two matters have been mentioned which should be settled forth with.  One is the matter of inspectors interrogating people as to their proficiency in Irish. I understood that the Gaeltacht was a geographical area, that, irrespective of whether Irish, English, French or Italian was spoken there, the qualification was that the applicant resided in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht, and I should like the Minister to give a definite assurance on the point, because otherwise it would mean throwing a spanner into the works which would entirely destroy the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second matter is that referred to by Deputy Bartley with regard to the inspector raising the question of what will happen in the future to the holding occupied by the applicant.  I do not think the inspector should interfere in that matter at all.  It is a matter for the Department itself as to the title of the site on which the house is to be built at the time the application is made.  The future may be left to look after itself.  We are a long time awaiting the rearrangement of these holdings, the settlement of rundales and so on.  Some of us have got very old listening to it and some others who are young will be much older before it is completed.  Surely it is futile to suggest that an inspector or the Department should raise such points because the scheme could not go ahead on that basis at all.  It was originally intended as a handy scheme to enable people who had not the means that other people have to build houses, and, while it was in operation, it was a great success.  These fellows who had been in Scotland and in England working as builders' labourers built houses and made a very good job of them.  They <Col N="68" /> built these houses with granite which was available in their districts and I think that every facility should be given to them and that no question of what will happen in the future should be raised now.</P>
    <P>It should be laid down definitely that the Fíor-Ghaeltacht is a geographical entity and that no question of the language spoken arises.  If we begin to have these inquests, we will have all these inquests about the £5 grant, but it is not at all on the same footing. The children receive £5 for speaking Irish and coming from a home where Irish is spoken, while this is a matter of houses for the Fíor-Ghaeltacht. There are, as Deputy Palmer said, cases of marriage between a man in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht and a girl who has been working in England, Scotland or in the Galltacht areas, but love does not draw a boundary between the Fíor-Ghaeltacht, the Breac-Ghaeltacht and the Galltacht.  That is not the way it operates, and it would be unfortunate if the scheme were to be held up because of a petty point like that.  The Fíor-Ghaeltacht is a geographical entity and anybody in the area who is prepared to build a house should have our good wishes.</P>
    <P>Many houses have been built in the non-Gaeltacht areas for the past four years, but house building has been at a complete standstill in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht. That is a bad state of affairs because, when people get into the habit of not doing something, it takes time to get them going again and you want four, five or six people in a parish to set an example so that the machine can be got going again.  It is a machine which is completely dead in the Gaeltacht because the House forgot about it when the Local Government Act was being amended and obviously these people could not face up to the expense of building a house on a grant of £80. The Minister should give these people who are prepared to build houses every opportunity possible to do so.  A lot was done, but much more remains to be done and the only way to get it done is by putting as few impediments as possible in their way.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether these areas know that this Act has been amended. <Col N="69" /> The inspectors cannot be expected to go around the laneways telling the people that increased grants are available. Something else must be done to bring it to their notice and a very suitable way would be by means of a circular to the clergy of all denominations in these areas which could be read out on Sunday.  That is done with regard to other matters, such as tree planting and so on, and I am sure that the various clergymen would not object to doing it.  Almost certainly, the Minister will require more money before the end of this year and I am sure he will tell these people that all the money they require will be made available when it is required.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nobody prouder than I am to see the last obstacle cleared out of the way by the introduction of this Supplementary Estimate and to see the people in these areas who, as we all know, are badly in need of houses, enabled to get going on the work.  Deputy Derrig and Deputy Bartley were anxious to know what number of applications we anticipate will come in.  The figure is roughly 7,000.  That may not be absolutely precise, but it is as near as we can get to it.  We anticipate also about 900 applications in respect of renovations or improvements.  All these will not come in in one, two or three years, because they will not all apply together, but there is a sizable number of applications already in. Roughly 430 applications are already on the stocks.  It will take time to get things going.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a suggestion that the sum of money is small.  It is small, but, nevertheless, taking into account the fact that we do not pay the full grant all at once, that we do not pay the full grant when the house is commenced&mdash;it is paid in three instalments &mdash;I anticipate that the sum asked for will be quite sufficient for the period until 31st March next, and possibly for a longer period.  If more money is needed, nobody will be happier than I. If the number of applications and the rate of progress of the work are such that more money will be necessary.  I cannot imagine&mdash;certainly it will not <Col N="70" /> happen while I am here&mdash;the work being held up for a single day by reason of any failure to come here for a Supplementary Estimate.  We anticipate that the sum asked for now will be quite sufficient for the coming year, because experience has shown that no house is completed under 12 months. From the date of the application the average period is from a year to a year and a half, and, in the case of improvements or renovations, roughly about half a year is the usual period. Taking all these matters into account, we are satisfied that the money asked for will be sufficient.  As a matter of fact, I hope it will not be sufficient. While some building materials are plentiful enough, others are scarce.  I hope that the supply of building materials that are scarce at the moment will become so freely available and that the number of applicants will be so great that I will be forced to come to the House for another sum. No Government &mdash; either the past two Governments or this Government&mdash;is anxious to skimp or save at the expense of the people in the Gaeltacht above any section of the community. Their demands on the public purse are very small when we consider the country as a whole.  It would be like stripping the corpse to try to keep them down.  The very opposite is the policy.  We are anxious to improve their lot.  I think that goes for the two previous Governments.  I want to give merit where it is due.  We are anxious to make the people of the Gaeltacht as comfortable as possible and to bring them up as much as possible.  They happen to live in areas where nature is pretty harsh on them.  The quality of the land is poor.  In addition to the provision of housing, it is my desire and the desire of the present Government to improve their lot in the matter of rearrangement that Deputy Bartley spoke about and which I will deal with later, and also to provide some useful and good and remunerative employment, such as forestry, and so on.</P>
    <P>Although it is not a matter that I should refer to on this particular occasion, it is no harm to transgress to the extent of one sentence, to say that their land is more suited in nearly all <Col N="71" /> cases for forestry than it is for agriculture. Housing is just one little relief or comfort that we need to bring to them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bartley finds fault with us because we do not allow people to build houses under the Gaeltacht housing grant in some cases where rearrangement is in the offing.  I think the Deputy should not have raised that point because the Land Commission or the Gaeltacht services section will not stop a man building a house, but it is obvious that if there is bad rundale in a townland or in a few townlands, and if the present occupiers of the land were allowed to build houses under this grant, we might find when we went in to rearrange, as we found recently in a certain area in County Mayo, that a man would have two dwelling-houses on the land after it was restriped or rearranged and we would have to build a new house in another area where there was not a house.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I am as anxious as the Deputy is to come to the rescue of these people, but it would be very foolish to spend money or to allow them to build houses.  As a matter of fact, I have the Land Commission officials driven crazy pressing them to take up these bad cases of rundale first.  They are doing their very utmost to meet the situation and sometimes we are more anxious than the tenants to have rearrangement carried out. When we go in there we often find obstruction that upsets our plans and, perhaps, when an inspector has spent a month or two or even three trying to bring some kind of order into a very bad case of rundale in townlands or an estate, the tenants themselves obstruct and will not agree even though they know in their hearts that they are getting a good rearrangement.  I do not want to say that that goes for all the tenants, but we have the case, and I am sure every Deputy from the congested areas is familiar with it, where you might have 16 to 30 tenants in townlands needing rearrangement and, <Col N="72" /> perhaps, one or two out of the 30 might refuse to agree to the rearrangement scheme and hold up the whole work. Apart from rendering the work of the Land Commission absolutely useless, all the time, money and labour spent on it goes for nothing and one or two can hold up the scheme and keep their neighbours in poverty and misfortune just because they want to get a better share.  They think that by being cranky or fighting for more they will get a better share.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I would rather not discuss it with Deputy Allen because Deputy Allen comes from a county that is blessed to the extent that there is no bad case of rundale there, but Deputies from the West should know the problem that I am speaking about. You cannot use compulsory powers. You would not get the co-operation of those whom you are anxious to benefit, if you try compulsory powers.  If you take up the land from the one or two cranks out of the 30 who are to benefit by the scheme, you will find&mdash;not in isolated cases but every single time&mdash; the neighbours immediately take the side of the objectors and refuse to take the land, although it would be of benefit to them.</P>
      <P>That has been our experience and the only thing the Land Commission could do was to beat as graceful a retreat as they could and leave the matter there.  That is what has happened.  We do not allow houses to be built in some cases.  We cannot do it because, while we would like to be lavish, we cannot afford to be extravagant or wasteful in dealing with the taxpayers' money.  If we were to allow people to build a house under the Gaeltacht grant on a particular site which might fall to another neighbour in the course of rearrangement, the possibility is that that neighbour might have a house and would not want the one he was getting.  That is the cause of the whole trouble.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider the suggestion I made, that <Col N="73" /> is, that the Land Commission official, in consultation with the Gaeltacht housing official, could pick out holdings in a townland that is to be arranged that are likely to remain more or less as they are and on which there is a suitable site, that will remain the property of its present owner, and give that man the house, provided he is not an objector?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>There is absolutely no difficulty about that.  The Land Commission inspector, if he is familiar with the particular area, knows by a glance at a map what holding will fall to a particular person and, as a matter of fact, we have the co-operation of the Land Commission officials in that regard.  There is no trouble about that.  It is the very bad cases of rundale that I am referring to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the point the Deputy has made, there is no difficulty there.  Nearly all Deputies who spoke referred to Section 4 of the 1934 Housing (Gaeltacht) (Amendment) Act, which reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Notwithstanding anything contained in the Principal Act, grants and loans under that Act shall be made only to the occupiers of dwelling-houses in which the Irish language is habitually used as the home language of the household, and, accordingly, so much of sub-section (3) of Section 11 of the Principal Act as requires the Minister to give a preference to the occupiers of such dwelling-houses shall cease to have effect.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That seems harsh.  In other words, it means that if Irish is not the spoken language of the home the applicant does not get the grant.  There is no use in wrapping it up in cotton wool. That is the Act and that is the way it is going to work, and, in my opinion, that is as it ought to be.  Deputy McMenamin raised the point that the whole Gaeltacht was a geographical area.  It is, but the object is to try to hold Irish as a spoken language in that area, to expand it, if possible.  We are all anxious for that.  I have never <Col N="74" /> heard a Deputy, and I have heard very few people, say that that should not be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>If we give a grant to a person who does not speak Irish inside the Fíor-Ghaeltacht boundary, let us say, it places him in a different category at once and in a much more favourable position than his neighbour outside the boundary who will not get it anyhow.  I would point out that that section is a section that has been carried down through all the Gaeltacht Housing Acts.  It is absolutely necessary and I would not favour alteration of it at all.  I think some softening of it was mentioned when the Bill was going through this House, and in the Seanad also, but I did not agree to it. It may be harsh when being put into operation, but, nevertheless, the spirit of the Act is the maintenance of the native tongue as much as possible within that area, and to extend it if possible.  The area is defined by the electoral divisions set out in the Schedule to the first Act.  The number of electoral divisions in each county are very clearly marked out and can be easily seen on a map.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary gave no assurance that he would meet Deputy MacEntee's amendment to this section in anything like the generous fashion in which we wanted it to be met.  It is absolutely essential that more notice or a longer period should be given for the putting in of claims than is in the Parliamentary Secretary's amendment to the Bill.  A period of 18 months after the commencement of the work is much too short.  A number of Deputies have <Col N="76" /> pointed out that the work might not be completed within the 18 months after its commencement.  Deputy Mac-Entee wants six years.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to indicate how far he would go to meet Deputy MacEntee's view and also the views of a number of Deputies from his own side of the House who urged that he should amend this particular amendment. Take the case of a drainage work which is started in 1950, say, and is not completed until the summer of 1951.  The winter of 1951-2 might be a dry one and so also might be the winter of 1952-3.  You may have a succession of dry winters and no damage resulting from drainage that has been carried out a couple of years beforehand.  It is necessary at least to give a few winters to see whether people downstream are going to be affected by drainage works carried out.  If that notice is not given, lands may be flooded to a great extent and extensive damage may be caused to individuals. Actually, small farmers may have their lands completely flooded and rendered useless, and there would be no legal method open to them to obtain compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, if we regard the drainage as on the upstream farms, it may very well be that for a couple of years following the carrying out of the drainage work you may have a succession of wet summers, and farmers will not notice during a very wet summer the lowering of the water-table.  The wells may still be filled and the water holes may be there for the cattle.  But if you have a few dry summers and the existing water-table lowered in a district, the result may be the drying up of wells and water holes and the farmers will be put to grave inconvenience and grave loss in carrying water over long distances both for human consumption and for watering their stock.  It is absolutely essential, therefore, that there should be a reasonable time in which it is open to the farmer to claim compensation for damage under this Bill.  We must remember that no particular care is taken before the work is embarked upon.  We did succeed in getting the Parliamentary Secretary to bring in a few amendments which would give some sort of <Col N="77" /> notice to the farmers about the matter. But if we are to judge by another Bill which has been circulated, the Government have not yet learned a lesson. Under his Land Reclamation Bill, which he has circulated, the Minister for Agriculture is going to walk in without giving notice to anybody&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I grant that it is not in order to discuss that Bill, but we have to take cognisance of the Government's approach to this whole business of drainage.  When this Bill is going through the Dáil we have to do our utmost to have inserted such amendments as will give some protection to people whose property is damaged by works carried out under this Bill. There is the other case, the most important case, where works are carried out by a Minister's nominee.  The Parliamentary Secretary steadfastly refused to accept any amendment which would make the Government responsible for the damage done by work carried out by a Minister's nominee. Particularly in that case where the work may be carried out against the better judgment of the members of the county council and of the local engineering staff, I think that we should give some reasonable time within which it would be open to the person whose property is damaged to claim compensation.  I, therefore, urge the Parliamentary Secretary either to accept Deputy MacEntee's amendment in full or give some indication that he will meet it generously on the Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to be as generous as possible with regard to the period of limitation, because it is fairly well known that some local authorities facing a claim as to which they could claim protection under the Public Authorities (Protection) Act sometimes keep on writing to the claimant that the matter is being looked into, that the matter is receiving attention.  It has happened that the man is put off with an acknowledgment of that kind and he then finds when the six months are up that he does not get any answer to his letters or he gets an answer telling him that he has no claim because the Public Authorities <Col N="79" /> (Protection) Act applies.  The time limit under that Act is very short. From the point of view of the citizen and in his interest, I think he ought to be given very great latitude so far as the period of limitation is concerned. Therefore, I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to be as generous as possible in the matter.</P>

      <P>Work carried out under Section 2 (3) may fall for compensation. In regard to other work, where the local authority protect their own property, that should not fall for compensation at all, in my opinion.  Of course, it is a matter for consideration. But it is not that type of work for which compensation falls to be paid or will need to be paid.  It is the type of work which you have to enter on private property to carry out.  That is where compensation may fall to be paid.  That is an important matter to keep in mind.</P>

This Bill has been under consideration in one form or another by the Government, or should have been, since 23rd February and the Parliamentary Secretary should be able to give a clear indication of Government policy on this relatively small matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 25:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (2), lines 47 to 49, and substitute the following new sub-section:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3) In default of agreement, the amount of any compensation payable by a local authority under this section shall, if the amount claimed in <Col N="83" /> respect thereof does not exceed twenty pounds, be determined by the District Court or, in any other case, be determined by arbitration under the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919 (as amended by subsequent enactments) as if the compensation were the price of land compulsorily acquired and the court or the arbitrator, as the case may be, shall have jurisdiction to determine whether compensation is, in the circumstances, payable at all.</P>
    <P>This amendment proposes to delete sub-section (2) of the Bill and to insert a new sub-section which will give power to the District Court to hear claims up to £20.  It further provides that any claim over £20 will be settled by arbitration under the Acquisition of Land (Assessment Compensation) Act.</P>
    <P>This amendment is not a new one. There is a similar provision in the Water Supplies Act of 1942, in the Local Government Act of 1946 and in the Arterial Drainage Act.  The amendment also proposes to give power to the arbitrator to determine whether compensation is payable or not.  He will be empowered, therefore, to dismiss frivolous claims, and to determine whether or not a claim was made in a specified period.  As I have said, a provision similar to this is to be found in previous legislation, so that its insertion in this Bill does not establish a precedent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the Parliamentary Secretary has taken some cognisance of the criticisms that were made to this Bill on the Second Reading, and that under this amendment he is going so far to meet the criticism regarding the paltry sum which could be claimed by a person who was adversely affected by the execution of works under the Bill.  I am not familiar with the sections in the Acts to which he has made reference as to this proposed new section not establishing a precedent.  I shall be glad to hear a little bit more from the Parliamentary Secretary regarding those Acts to show <Col N="84" /> how the sections in them are suited to this particular Bill.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary referred to the Water Supplies Act.  I take it that the question there was one of collecting water and of putting up reservoirs so that, in the normal way, only very small claims could be made for compensation.  Again, under the Arterial Drainage Act, great care is taken before work is commenced. Every interest affected under that Act has power to object to the arterial drainage, so that what might be suitable arbitration under that particular Act would not be suitable at all under this works Bill.  Therefore, in my opinion the Parliamentary Secretary's explanation for the introduction of this amendment is not completely satisfactory. I am glad that he is definitely limiting the power of the District Court to hear claims up to £20.  I should like to hear him further justify the taking into this Bill of the machinery which was held to be suitable in previous Acts for the assessment of damage.</P>

      <P>I desire to call the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to the fact that it is only land that the arbitrator can consider under this amendment.  In the definition section of the Bill there are many things mentioned as well as land and I think this is the time to direct attention to that fact.  You can do damage to a watercourse that is taking water to or from a mill, you can damage fisheries, you can damage footways or pavements or buildings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is there any provision in this section under which the arbitrator or the court <Col N="85" /> may consider claims arising out of damage to buildings, apart from land? No matter how wide the section is in relation to land, I do not think it includes buildings.  Land is not defined. The Parliamentary Secretary's amendment may not be wide enough to do justice or to allow claims to be made for damage in all respects.  It is the usual function of an arbitrator to determine whether and for what reason compensation is payable.  He is now asked to determine whether there is any damage done.  Has it been the function of an arbitrator to determine whether there is any damage done?  Is this the first time he is so asked?</P>

      <P>There does not appear to be any analogy between the Acts which the Parliamentary Secretary has mentioned and what is proposed in the amendment.  If land is taken it is taken for a definite public purpose and after full inquiry.  The general complaint about this Bill is that a local authority may do anything without inquiry, without giving people even time to make objections.  The effect of the amendment, and particularly of everything that follows after the word &ldquo;enactments&rdquo;, will be to deprive an aggrieved person of his full right to compensation, where his land is damaged by reason of the neglect or incompetence of the local authority.</P>

    <P>That is a very different position from the position which the Parliamentary Secretary has set before the House.  A local authority cannot enter on land for the purpose of providing a water supply until the whole matter has had a strict engineering investigation and inquiry.  All the plans have to be submitted <Col N="86" /> to the Department of Local Government.  In this case a local authority quite arbitrarily can decide to carry out certain works which appear to it to be necessary in order to prevent certain things happening.  It can do that without even allowing the person whose property is likely to be affected an opportunity to lodge an objection.  Things may be done which quite clearly ought not to be done. Damage may be almost wilfully done, to put it that way; certainly damage can be done neglectfully and the amendment will deprive a person of compensation whose property has been damaged by reason of the negligence or incompetence or wilful default of a local authority.</P>

      <P>That is the lawyer's answer to the point I have made. Quite obviously one of the purposes of the Bill is to provide plenty of work for the lawyers.  That is why we have a lawyers' Government introducing it and supporting it.  It is our purpose as a legislature to try to settle these things here by law so that there will not be any resort to common law actions and so that a person will know where he stands and if his property is damaged by negligence or default he will get the full compensation to which he is entitled.</P>

      <P>Speaking as a legislator and not as a lawyer, I might suggest that perhaps the point has been missed by Deputy MacEntee.  I respectfully submit that land does not require any definition for the purpose of what is sought to be effected in this section.  Amendment No. 21 gives the right to a person who has suffered damage to apply for compensation, and it sets out the type of damage that person is liable to suffer.  When you come to amendment No. 25 you find the manner in which that compensation is to be assessed.  The point not to overlook here is the distinction between this Bill and other similar legislation.  All the local authority seeks is a right or a licence to enter on the land for the purpose of doing certain <Col N="87" /> works.  What Deputy MacEntee has in mind is the class of statutes which give the right to local authorities and other bodies compulsorily to acquire.  There is no such purpose in this particular section.</P>

      <P>Deputy Aiken asked me to quote from the other Acts which I mentioned and in which I said a similar provision was made.  I will refer him to Section 15 of the Water Supplies Act of 1942.  That section is practically identical with the section which we propose to have inserted in this Bill.  The Local Government Act of 1946, Section 54 (7), says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In default of agreement, the amount of any compensation payable by a road authority under this section shall, if the amount claimed in respect thereof does not exceed £20, be determined by the District Court or, in any other case, be determined by arbitration under the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919 (as amended by subsequent enactments) as if the compensation were the price of land compulsorily acquired.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>In this Bill it is entry on land: there is no suggestion of acquiring land.  Section 54 (7) is identical with the amendment which is proposed here.  Deputy MacEntee talks about plenty of pickings for the lawyers.  I cannot understand his line of argument.  He has reams of amendments which, in my opinion, will provide pickings for the lawyers for many years to come.  In certain amendments he provides even for the colour of the paper to be used when an objection is sent in.  If we accepted even a quarter of Deputy MacEntee's amendments there would be work for the lawyers for the next 50 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="88" /> Deputy MacEntee goes on the assumption that amendment No. 21 has not been passed.  Land has been defined pretty clearly and adequately in the Interpretation Act of 1937. Amendment No. 21 was passed, and it embraces practically everything so far as any claimant may be concerned.  In the matter of watercourses, which Deputy Allen raised, the claimant is also adequately covered.  A watercourse is a right, and if there is any damage done to that right the person so damaged is entitled to claim.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;In default of agreement, the amount of any compensation payable by a local authority in respect of the damage suffered by a person by reason of any interference caused by the execution of the works pursuant to this Act shall, if the amount claimed in respect thereof does not exceed £20, be determined by the District Court or, in any other case, be determined by arbitration under the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919 (as amended by subsequent enactments) as if the compensation were the price of land compulsorily acquired.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary, if I may say so, is very slick.  He referred to Section 7 of the Act of 1946.  To what did that relate?  It related to entry upon land.  Am I right in that? That is what it does relate to; and the other section&mdash;Section 15 of the Water Supplies Act, 1941&mdash;relates also to entry upon land.  Section 5 here, <Col N="89" /> as amended by amendment No. 21, does relate to entry upon land, but it relates to a great many other things as well.  Am I not right in that?  Is that not the fact?  Why should the Parliamentary Secretary try to mislead the House?  He carefully refrained from reading Section 7 of the Act of 1946.</P>

How is anybody going to assess damage to a building or damage by reason of interference with a right-of-way of access to a building by flooding the area surrounding the building?  How is anybody going to assess the damage done to that building through denial of access as if it were land compulsorily acquired?  Is that not a fact?  Is that not the position that the Parliamentary Secretary is trying to create by this hurried amendment which bears the hallmark of the same undue haste as the Bill itself bears?  If there is going to be any relief given to an aggrieved person surely it can only be given if all the words after &ldquo;enactment&rdquo; in this amendment are omitted. <Col N="90" /> However, that will be another day's discussion.  The real fact of the matter is that the section in the Act of 1946 to which the Parliamentary Secretary referred and upon which he relies relates to entry upon land.</P>

But the section goes further and says:&mdash;</P>

If a farmer suffers damage he should at least get from the court sufficient to pay his lawyers so that he will not have to pay them subsequently out of his own pocket.  There might be a very big case in court and the plaintiff might have to engage engineers and other witnesses, quite apart altogether from lawyers.

      <P>Take, for example, a case where on the completion of a drainage work upstream the water comes pouring down upon a farmer miles away from the scene of the original work. He may not only have to go into court and prove that his lands were flooded on a certain date but also to prove that his land was flooded as a result of the work carried out under this Bill.  In order to prove that, it will be necessary for him to have witnesses not only from his own district but also to have an engineer's report on the works carried out very much higher upstream.  He will have to bring in neighbours to prove that the land prior to the carrying out of the drainage work was not flooded and that now it is.</P>
      <P>Similarly, if you take a man upstream, when the water-table has been lowered and he finds one day that a well which had been there for generations is there no longer and that he is compelled to go five miles for water for human consumption or for his cattle, he will have to bring evidence to the court that it was the lowering of the water-table that dried the well or that the particular ponds in which his cattle used to drink are no longer in existence.

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>All I have to say is that the costs fixed in this amendment are roughly the costs&mdash;in fact they are a little more&mdash;usually paid in a claim of this nature.  We have got to be a bit reasonable about this matter. Cases of this kind coming before the district justice will be the sort of case <Col N="94" /> where the district justice will go and have a look at the damage.  I hope it will be dealt with in that way.  Claims coming before the District Court may take a whole day to hear and the maximum costs charged are roughly three guineas.  I think it would be very unwise to allow a discretion whereby sums in excess of three guineas might be paid in claims such as this.  I think it is better to have a fixed fee and then everybody knows where he stands. There is some little difficulty about expenses but we have got to look at this from the broad general point of view. There is no necessity to encourage people to bring along engineers or experts for the purpose of establishing a case in the District Court; it should be dealt with in the way in which cases are generally dealt with in that court and an allowance of three guineas for costs is related to the practice in regard to similar claims in the District Court at the moment.  If I were looking at it purely from the personal or professional point of view, I suppose I would be looking for increased costs for lawyers but looking at it from the point of view of the public interest, I think the figure that is there at the moment is a reasonable figure and it is better that people should know where they stand.  In regard to the question of expenses, I do not know whether that is provided for or not.  It is pro vided for in the arbitration section. It is covered very effectively there but in regard to the District Court I think it is just as well to have a fixed fee so that everybody will know where he stands.</P>

      <P>I do not know what Deputy Cowan has in mind when he suggests that the procedure which is likely to be followed and which, in fact, he recommends, is that the district justice would go out to the scene of the damage.  If a district justice were to follow that advice, I doubt whether that would be a very wise course to adopt.  You may rest assured the damage in respect of which a man will claim will have disappeared by the time the District Court comes to dispose of the claim.  If a man has land situated convenient to work that is carried out and if he suffers damage for a <Col N="95" /> week or a fortnight or some such period, I do not know that the court will sit just to convenience him or to enable the district justice to see that damage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so.  Flooding is a recurring thing.  Some district justices, if the damage were very great, might be prepared to go out and examine it but you cannot expect them all to do that.  In the main I think a district justice would insist on the person who is making the claim producing evidence in court to satisfy him from a technical point of view as to how the damage arose and what the nature of the works were.  I am very much afraid that district justices will insist&mdash;and rightly&mdash;upon the advocate building a case by the production of a reasonable amount of technical evidence.</P>

    <P>I cannot make the same forecast as to the procedure district justices will follow as Deputy Cowan, but I am no more anxious than he that we should have a situation where the lawyers would benefit.  I am with Deputy Aiken that we should ensure that a man who suffers damage as a result of works carried out under the Bill will not be frightened from insisting on his rights by the fear that building up a case in the manner I have described will cost far more than the amount permitted.  In the discussion on the last amendment on which there was a division there was a tendency on the part of the Parliamentary Secretary, on the part, I am sure, of his advisers and on the part of the Minister and those responsible for the Bill to single out the individual while nobody protects the individual's rights against the larger body.  As I said on the Second Stage, I was never in favour of a position where the State or a local <Col N="96" /> authority could not interfere with a man's property if necessary, but my claim is that you are interfering with the rights of persons who have not the power, financial or otherwise, to protect themselves.  While you should insist on taking the power necessary to enter and carry out work, you should ensure that the person concerned would have a way of seeking redress.  That is my interest in this matter as in the previous issue on which we had a division.</P>

      <P>I think I am not disrespectful to Deputy Aiken when I regard him as a typical idealist.  An idealist is generally a bit of a pessimist. Deputy Aiken in previous discussions on this Bill endeavoured to persuade the House and the Parliamentary Secretary to force the Government, through the Central Fund, to bear the total cost, not alone of carrying out useful works, but of any damage which might be involved.  He failed to persuade the Parliamentary Secretary or a majority of the members of this House to carry the cost of damage, alleged or real.  He knows perfectly well, however, that we have now arrived at a stage in the discussion where the cost of any damage will have to be borne by the local authority, in other words, by the ratepayers.  He is now, therefore. endeavouring to persuade the Parliamentary Secretary to increase the cost which is to be borne by the local authority and the ratepayers.  I would appeal to Deputy Aiken, when he is dreaming about the contents of this Bill&mdash;he is only dreaming because he has not been thinking about the benefits of the Bill&mdash;to realise that the works which are to be carried out will confer real and lasting benefits upon the community and that any damage, plus the legal costs referred to in this particular amendment, are only infinitesimal.</P>

      <P>He is responsible for the fact that the ratepayers will have to bear the larger part of the burden and now he is full of concern for them. This democrat who always stands for the protection of the rights of the individual has no concern for the man who is aggrieved by something the mighty, the omnipotent, local authority does under this Bill.  His heart bleeds for the local authority with a revenue of £500,000 in some cases but he does not give a tuppenny tram ticket &mdash; a Parliamentary expression&mdash; for the man who has to go to the District Court and prove his claim there. Deputy Davin's argument is directed to one fact.  If a man is aggrieved, if his property is damaged, even if it costs him up to £20 to prove his title to compensation, he is only awarded £3.</P>

Why not make it, then, that the district justice will be entitled to award the amount which he thinks is reasonable to cover the costs and expenses incurred by the successful claimant in prosecuting his claim? Would that not be right and proper from the point of view of doing justice to the individual?  Surely you are not going to allow the district justice to award, say, up to £20 compensation and have the greater part of that £20 eaten away by additional costs or other expenses?  Is not that the position?  I cannot see any justification for imposing this limitation of £3 3s. at all, except that the Party of democrats opposite, led by that sterling democrat, Deputy Davin, want to provide that the poor private individual should suffer and that the great corporation should get scot-free.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>The only point I want to make is that an application like this coming before the District Court in respect of a sum not exceeding £20 is very like the type of case heard every day of the week, where there is a claim for damages or even a case in relation to contract up to £25, in which there may be quite a number of witnesses and which may be very difficult and involved.  There are cases which come before the District Court in regard to maintenance which are rather involved, intricate and difficult, and which may occupy the whole day.  There is a scale of costs laid down in both contract and tort and they do not exceed the £3 3s. permitted here.  That limitation is set out in the District Court Rules, and, so far as my recollection goes, in respect of costs, it does not exceed <Col N="103" /> £3 3s.  That is why I said that, once it comes into the District Court at all, three guineas is a little more generous.</P>
      <P>This type of case where it arises, if it arises at all, will, I hope, be dealt with by the local solicitors, who generally have more than one case in the day.  If a solicitor has three or four of these minor cases for damage, what generally happens is that the solicitor representing the local authority has a talk with him and says: &ldquo;We are prepared to pay £5 in John Brown's case and £7 10s. in somebody else's case, plus your costs&rdquo;, and the matter then is put to the district justice and agreed to by both sides.  From that point of view, it is perfectly reasonable.  In regard to witness's expenses, it is provided in the District Court Rules that a district justice may award expenses to witnesses appearing before him and I hope that, when he comes to award expenses, he will award them on a reasonable basis, and that the headline which we set for him here of £3 3s. for the legal costs will be a headline in regard to the expenses he should allow.</P>
      <P>Nobody wants to encourage litigation. I do not think anyone even on the opposite side wants to do that and if £3 3s. is considered a reasonable figure for the costs of the application, if the District Court has jurisdiction, as it has, to allow expenses, I do not think anyone would raise any objection.  If this clause were not inserted&mdash;it is restrictive I admit &mdash; in regard to the £3 3s., the district justice would be entitled to award costs at his discretion.  I think it is better from everybody's point of view that there should be a restriction in respect of costs and that the district justice should use his discretion in regard to expenses.</P>

He has told us that, under the existing District Court Rules, the maximum amount which might be awarded by way of costs would, in general, be less than £3 3s., even in the most complicated case.  I do not think I am misrepresenting <Col N="104" /> the Deputy when I say that.  Not only do the District Court Rules provide for the payment of legal costs in accordance with the scale in force at the time, but they also make provision for the payment of expenses, expenses reasonably incurred by the plaintiff or claimant in prosecuting his claim.

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am discussing amendment No. 28, but sub-section (4) of Section 5 provides:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Where, in the case of an application to determine the compensation <Col N="105" /> to be paid under this section by a local authority, the compensation determined by the court does not exceed that offered unconditionally by the local authority before the application was made, the court may order that the costs and expenses of the local authority shall be deducted from the compensation determined by the court.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In fact, in that sub-section, there was made provision for the recoupment to the local authority out of compensation awarded in certain circumstances of the costs incurred by it, but there was no corresponding provision made in relation to the costs of the claimant.  That makes me believe&mdash;I am a layman and I do not know how the courts would construe it&mdash;that, if this amendment is inserted in the section in the form in which it has been introduced it will completely oust the jurisdiction of the District Court to award expenses at all.  It makes me believe that the courts would construe this amendment very narrowly and say that the only thing a district justice is entitled to do under this section is to award costs and that he has no jurisdiction to award expenses. I am only a layman, as I say, but one can appreciate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is a certain amount of unreality to this discussion and a lot of time is being wasted over a very simple amendment.  I suppose there is no point in my again quoting sub-section (8) of Section 54 of the Local Government Act, 1946.  That amendment was introduced, if my memory serves me right, by a Fianna Fáil Deputy and was accepted in relation to a Bill which provided for doing works which are very similar to <Col N="106" /> the works to be undertaken under this particular Bill.  I am not a lawyer any more than Deputy MacEntee is, but I have consulted some of my few legal friends on the fixing of £3 3s. as costs and I think in relation to a sum of £20 it is fair.  On the other hand, if a farmer or land-owner wants to incur large expenses, wants to make a big claim, he need not go to the District Court, he can go to the arbitrator.  If he wants to make a claim over £20, even £21, he can go to the arbitrator and the arbitrator can fix costs.  I have been informed that even with this particular provision in this Bill whereby the costs are set at £3 3s. the district justice still has power to award witnesses' expenses, but in relation to this particular Bill I do not think too much time should be wasted on this question of claim for compensation because we visualise that there will be very few claims for compensation and, as far as the District Court is concerned, many of these claims will be settled, not with the expert advice or evidence of engineers or architects but purely on technical questions and the evidence will be purely verbal.  Every solicitor and lawyer in this House knows that.  The District Court is a place of summary jurisdiction and there is no point in talking about having three or four architects or engineers.</P>
      <P>If people want to incur large costs they can claim £30, £40 or £50 and can have their claims heard by the arbitrator and he can fix costs for them. On the other hand, if there is damage in a particular district and three or four farmers are involved, one of them can make the claim and the decision can apply to the others who are alleged to have been damaged.</P>
      <P>Deputy Aiken and other Deputies quoted complex cases which I agree might involve bringing forward an engineer or architect or some other technician but these would not be cases which would be ordinarily heard in the District Court and could well be heard by the arbitrator.  There is a way out.  I think everybody, even the lawyers in this House, will agree that £3 3s. is a fair sum in relation to the amount which they may claim in the District Court, that is, £20.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cowan has the wrong idea about the effect of this Bill altogether or the claims that may come under it.  He spoke about local solicitors getting in touch with the local council's solicitor and fixing the thing up.  That may happen in cases where damage is done within a certain county and the cost of the damage arises within that county but if you cross county borders and if the cause is 20, 30 or 40 miles from the scene of the damage, no such local consultation can take place.  In certain of these complicated cases there may not only be big witnesses expenses for engineers and ordinary farmer witnesses, but there may be considerable legal complications and lawyers' costs.  In that event, I want to see that the farmer gets from the court the amount that he must pay his lawyer.  Otherwise, he is restricted to £3 3s. to pay his lawyer and his lawyer may charge five, ten or 15 guineas, or more.  He may charge him all he gets by way of compensation. Deputy Davin is very optimistic about all the good that will come out of this Bill and can see no other side of the case.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 33:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 6 to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  It shall not be obligatory on a local authority or on a person nominated by the Minister under Section 3 of this Act, when executing works under this Act, to comply with the Fisheries Act, 1842 to 1944.</P>
      <P>(2)  Notwithstanding the exemption conferred by sub-section (1) of this section, a local authority or a person nominated by the Minister under Section 3 of this Act, shall, when executing works under this Act, take such precautions and make such provisions for the protection of fisheries as the Minister for Agriculture either generally or in particular cases may advise.</P>
      <P>I am advised that this amendment is necessary.  There is a similar provision in the Arterial Drainage Act of 1945. The particular section which is referred to in the Fisheries Act&mdash;I have not the actual section&mdash;provides that no person may:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  Obstruct or impede the passage of salmon or trout during the weekly close time (6 a.m. Saturday&mdash; 6 a.m. Monday);</P>
      <P>(2)  disturb spawning beds or injure or disturb spawn or fry thereon during the close season (i.e., 13th October to opening of next season);</P>
      <P>(3)  Allow any deleterious matter to flow into any river or lake.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this respect I should like to say that the Department of Agriculture are <Col N="113" /> preparing certain instructions and a list of regulations and precautions in connection with a particular work which may be undertaken in rivers and streams.  As I said, there is a similar precautionary section in the Arterial Drainage Act of 1945.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I should certainly like Deputy Davin, having said that no damage might be caused, to read this particular amendment which is introduced by the Parliamentary Secretary which gives the local authority or the person nominated by the Minister the right to proceed, notwithstanding the fact that he may cause grave damage to fisheries.  If there was no danger of damage to a fishery right it would not be necessary to have this amendment. As the Government proceeds with this particular Bill they see that it is more far-reaching than they stated when they introduced it in this House and that we have got to be very careful to ensure that, as far as we can, it will be amended so as to give reasonable protection to the rights of individuals.  Personally, I have no objection to including this particular amendment.  If it is decided that a drainage scheme is a right and proper thing, then there should be some means of going ahead with it rather than that the local authority should have to comply with every one of the sections of the Fisheries Acts from 1842 to 1944 which would tie them up for years, let alone weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>While, like Deputy Aiken, I welcome this amendment, I am surprised that the Minister for Local Government or the Parliamentary Secretary has contented himself with this amendment only.  After all, as we have pointed out, grave damage may be done not merely to fisheries but to turbary and to drainage schemes in general by works which are carried out under this Bill.  Yet the Government very strongly resisted an amendment which would ensure that the Commissioners of Public Works &mdash; who are the legally constituted drainage authority in the law of this land&mdash;would be informed regarding schemes which the local authority proposed to carry out and which might affect the drainage <Col N="114" /> works under the control of the Commissioners of Public Works. Apparently, of course, the Minister for Agriculture is a much more influential man in the councils of the Government and carries greater weight than the Minister for Local Government with the Minister for Finance or the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance who is in charge of the office of Public Works.  The Minister for Agriculture gets his way and an amendment goes down which will enable him to compel the person or local authority carrying out works under this Bill to take such precautions and make such provisions for the protection of fisheries as the Minister for Agriculture, either generally or in particular cases, may advise.  The Commissioners of Public Works are not put in the same position. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance cannot insist that a local authority will take similar precautions and make similar provisions where works which are the particular responsibility of the Commissioners of Public Works are likely to be affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The introduction of this amendment justifies the action which the Opposition has taken in relation to the Bill. It is an admission of danger.  Simply because we did not put down an amendment of this sort, the Parliamentary Secretary puts it down.  If we put down that amendment, Deputy Davin and the rest of them would try to bulldoze the people into the belief that it is a harmless little Bill by voting against it.  This amendment is an admission of guilt.  We welcome it.  Let me emphasise and stress, however, that it is an admission of incompetence.  It is a sure indication that this Bill was not drafted as it ought to have been drafted, after full consideration of the consequences of it.  Surely to goodness other interests than fishery interests are likely to be affected by the Bill. You can divert watercourses; you can carry out work under this Bill which will make the arterial drainage problem in several drainage districts much more difficult.  Yet you have completely ousted the Commissioners of Public Works from their legitimate responsibilities and from the exercise of their <Col N="115" /> proper functions in a matter of this sort.  I welcome this amendment, but there it is&mdash;evidence to convict the Government of gross incompetence in drafting the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  Some of the provisions of this particular measure have been before the House in the form of Financial Resolutions.  Two others I want to mention at this point <Col N="116" /> are in Sections 28 and 29.  Section 28 authorises the transfer to the Exchequer of £300,000 from the Road Fund, which corresponds to the motor tax imposed by the Supplementary Budget of October, 1947.  Section 29 recognises the position of continuing legislation for the further year of payments from the Transition Development Fund since the 31st March, 1949.</P>
      <P>Before I go on to deal with the separate clauses to which the Bill refers, I want to mention one matter which was omitted from the Bill.  In my Budget speech I said that as the result of representations made to me to the effect that the absence of a legal definition of Irish whiskey constituted a handicap in the export market, I intended to provide for a definition in the Finance Bill.  I have since been given to understand that the inclusion of a provision of this type would render the Bill ineligible as a Money Bill.  In view of this I have decided to omit the definition provision for the present.  At the earliest opportunity, I shall endeavour to include it in another measure.</P>
      <P>Section 1, which corresponds to a Financial Resolution passed on Budget day, is the usual section providing for the charge of income-tax and surtax for the current tax year and for the continuance of previous enactments in relation to those taxes.  The distinguishing feature of this clause is the reduction in the rate of standard income-tax by 6d. to 6/6 in the £.</P>
      <P>Section 2, which is also covered by a Financial Resolution, provides that where any company pays corporation profits tax for an accounting period the amount paid will, for income-tax purposes, be deducted as an expense incurred in that period.  It restores the established basis, which was recently upset by a court decision, on which the deductions were granted.  It does not interfere with the decision in that case but provides that it will not affect other cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 3 extends the income-tax wear and tear allowance in respect of plant or machinery to persons chargeable under Schedule E. Sections 4 and 5 have the effect of increasing the income-tax housekeeper allowance from £45 to <Col N="117" /> £100.  Section 6 provides, what I announced as a concession on Budget day, that the income-tax child allowance may be granted in respect of a child if living at any time during the year of assessment.  Hitherto it was required that the child should be living at the commencement of the year. Section 7 increases the income-tax dependent relative allowance from £25 to £50.  Section 8 was covered by Financial Resolution No. 3 passed on Budget day.  That extends the existing anti-evasion legislation in regard to settlements of income by parents on minor children.  It makes the legislation apply to trading profits as it already applies to other income such as income from investments.</P>
    <P>Section 9 provides for the exemption of newsreel films from the customs duty chargeable on cinema films under Section 17 of the Finance Act, 1932. Section 10 provides that the rates of excise duty payable in respect of firearm certificates coming into force on or about the 1st day of August, 1949, which is the first day of the next licensing year, be increased to the rates specified in the First Schedule to this Act.  Section 11 provides that the allowance of 5d. per proof gallon which is at present payable on home-made spirits used for making power methylated spirits, shall cease to be payable in respect of spirits used on or after the 1st October this year.</P>
    <P>Section 12 deals with entertainments duty and provides that the entertainments duty chargeable under Section 1 of the Finance (New Duties) Act of 1916 as amended shall be reimposed with effect from the 1st July on all payments for admission to a ball or dance except as provided for in Section 13.  That Section 13 provides that entertainments duty chargeable under Section 1 of the Finance (New Duties) Act, 1916, shall not be charged in respect of any entertainment held in a place not situated in or within three miles of a county or other borough, an urban district, or a town of more than 500 population.</P>
    <P>The next Section, 14, deals with the tax on wine.  It reduces the duties on wine other than sparkling wine to the rates operative as from 9th May, 1946. Sections 15 and 16 deal with tobacco. <Col N="118" /> Section 15 makes provision for the application, as from the date of the passing of the Bill, of preferential rates of duty to all manufactured tobacco produced in and consigned from a country within the Commonwealth of Nations.  Section 16 provides for a reduction, operative as from the date of the passing of the Bill, in the rates of excise duty on unmanufactured tobacco to the rates shown in the Third Schedule.  This is a consequential provision following the grant of preference in respect of imported unmanufactured tobacco.  That section also provides for the continuance of certain allowances payable by virtue of the Finance Act, 1934, on home-grown leaf tobacco.</P>
    <P>Section 17 is a very limited provision of which I already spoke on Budget day.  It excludes road rollers from the definition of &ldquo;motor vehicle&rdquo; in Section 8 of the Finance Act, 1942.  The effect is to secure that duty will not be charged on the diesel oil used in driving these road rollers.</P>
    <P>Section 18 has a very special objective. It provides that <i>inter vivos</i> gifts of foreign property which are made for public or charitable purposes are to be charged with estate duty only if made within 12 months of the date of the death of the donor.  Section 19 has to be taken in conjunction with the Fourth Schedule.  Its effect is that if property has been disponed in favour of a relative in consideration of an annuity and if the amount of the annuity payments made from the date of the disposition to the date of death exceeds the income received by the relative from the property over the same period, in charging estate duty on the value of the disponed property a deduction is to be made of the excess. It is a relief section.</P>
    <P>Section 20, which also was covered by a Financial Resolution passed on Budget day, is intended to secure that money receivable under a policy of assurance on the life of a deceased person is chargeable with estate duty where the premiums have been paid directly or indirectly out of funds which the deceased has supplied.</P>
    <P>Section 21 has to be related to the Fifth Schedule, which contains an <Col N="119" /> agreement that was made with the British Government for the avoidance of double taxation in respect of corporation profits tax on our side and British profits tax on the other.  This is a reciprocal agreement under which profits tax paid by an Irish company in Great Britain may be allowed as a credit against corporation profits tax, while in the case of a British company operating here the Irish tax will be allowed as a credit against the British tax imposed.  Section 21 gives effect to Part II of the Fifth Schedule that lays down some details of the method of allowing profits tax as a credit against corporation profits tax.</P>
    <P>Section 22 is to provide that as from the 1st January, 1949, profits of foreign companies carrying on trade in this country may be charged to corporation profits tax at the same rate as that applicable to the profits of Irish companies. Section 23 is merely a &ldquo;construction&rdquo; provision.</P>
    <P>The sections in Part V are quite lengthy.  I imagine that they will all be discussed in detail on the Committee Stage.  Section 24 was covered by a Financial Resolution.  Its effect is to apply the same rates of stamp duties to fines or premiums payable in consideration of a lease of property as those applicable to the amount of the purchase money on a conveyance or transfer on sale.  Section 25 is complementary to Section 24 which takes effect only as from the date of the passing of the Act.  It provides that the rate of stamp duties set out in the previous section shall be chargeable on any lease executed on or after the 4th day of May, 1949, and before the date of the passing of this Act.  I should say that I understand there is the view that these stamp duties are being made retrospective from the date of the 4th May.  As far as any lease was executed prior to the 4th May, then that escapes if the proper procedure has been followed.</P>
    <P>Section 26 is also covered by the Financial Resolution, and is designed to counter the methods which have been adopted to avoid payment of the 25 per cent. rate of stamp duty on the <Col N="120" /> transfer of property.  Section 27 is complementary to Section 26 which takes effect only as from the date of the passing of the Act.  It secures that the provisions of the previous section shall apply to transactions effected on or after the 4th May, 1949 and before the date of the passing of the Act.</P>
    <P>Section 30 comes in here.  There will probably be a general section dealing with some general matters that have been brought, in some way, in question as a result of certain remarks that were made during the hearing of certain court cases.  Section 30 deals only with the hearing in camera of appeals in tax cases.  It is to be taken from statements that have been made in court in certain cases that the provisions with regard to hearing in camera would only apply where these provisions have been newly enacted since the date of the passing of the Constitution.  This is to make it clear that, in a matter that is appropriate to revenue, the hearing of tax cases, these shall continue to be heard in camera as laid down in the legislation. Section 31 simply puts these various matters under the care and management of the Revenue Commissioners, and Section 32 is the customary provision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>In his Budget statement last year, the Minister for Finance, in pleading for time to reconsider the general financial and economic position, stated that it was obvious that we were at any rate faced with this fundamental fact that the country was burdened with taxation of unprecedented severity. Last year, the Central Fund and Supply Services cost nearly £72,000,000 &mdash;£660,000 above the Estimate.  There was one word which was very much to the fore in the Minister's Budget statement last year, and that was the word &ldquo;retrenchment&rdquo;.  According to the Minister, retrenchment and economy were to be the watchwords.  This year he has not told us that taxation was of unprecedented severity.  He has given us the same information in another way.  He has told us that taxation absorbs 25 per cent. of the national income, and that the total charges, including national and local taxation and insurance contributions, amount to £27 <Col N="121" /> per head of the population per annum. Last year, the tax revenue brought in nearly £1,833,000, according to my calculation, above the Estimate.  It is a very noticeable fact that, in respect of items which many of us would not by any means regard as luxuries, there has been a substantial increase in the revenue accruing to the State.  For example, in regard to spirits, the revenue raked in £430,000 more than in the previous year; in entertainment, £115,000 more, and in betting, £80,000 more. The Minister claims that beer brought him in £400,000 less than the Estimate, but he forgot to mention that in fact he collected from beer drinkers £353,000 more than in the preceding year.</P>
      <P>The final figures, then, for the Central Fund and Supply Services for the coming financial year amount to £73,135,000, to which were added certain items in respect of provision for increased remuneration for certain public servants, bringing the total expenditure to £73,811,000.  As against that, the Minister explained that the tax revenue which he expected to receive would amount to £64,790,000; non-tax revenue, £8,560,000, making a total £73,350,000 between tax and non-tax revenue.  Certain adjustments are made&mdash;Road Fund, £300,000; borrowing for capital purposes, £600,000, and adjustments in the flour subsidy, £330,000, leaving the final figure £72,720,000.  That is a figure which connotes the largest amount ever to be collected from the people, and the largest ever to be placed upon them, whether by way of direct or indirect taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House has to remember that the Minister was not burdened in respect to his budgetary accounts in the same way as his predecessor was.  He had the advantage of working in a year when circumstances had altered considerably for the better, when the flow of goods had become reasonably sufficient towards meeting demands, when the international situation had improved and when the agricultural and industrial position had shown a distinct improvement not only because the factors militating against industrial and agricultural effort in 1947 had disappeared, <Col N="122" /> but because certain other factors, such as those I have referred to, came into the picture and enabled matters to advance towards more normal conditions.  In other words, the hold-up that we had in 1947&mdash;from the period of a comparative improvement which we looked forward to in 1946, the rather bad period that we experienced&mdash;had passed over, and it looked as if we were well on the way to getting over the economic difficulties in regard to scarcities, the lack of materials for production and so on.</P>
    <P>The general improvement in the situation was revealed in the fact that the Minister was able to make substantial savings in respect to food subsidies.  I think the amount was about £3,600,000. In the Estimates for Supply Services, he made a further saving of £2,500,000. In respect to turf, the savings on the turf subsidy amounted to £1,000,000, and in the case of the Bord na Móna and county council scheme to over £1,500,000.  These two items with the savings on food subsidies, came to more than £6,000,000.  But in spite of the fact that the Minister had the agreeable opportunity of getting these windfall savings, and of putting them to the credit side of his account, it does not appear that the taxpayer has benefited judging by the figure of £72,720,000 which I have mentioned: it does not appear that the taxpayer has benefited to the extent that one might have expected, having regard to these windfall savings.</P>
    <P>There were other items, such as the increased postal charges, under which the Minister was able to pass on nearly £500,000.  He was able to collect nearly £500,000 from the commercial and general public.  He saved, in respect of agricultural and fertiliser subsidies, over £300,000.  The total reduction in respect of Gaeltacht services, mineral exploration, agricultural and fertiliser subsidies and tomato houses, came to £428,000.  There was also a lesser sum spent on farm improvement schemes amounting to £160,000, so that there was a reduction in productive expenditure in respect of these items of £568,000.</P>
    <P>I need not go over the items dealing with the savings in respect of cash <Col N="123" /> grants for social services which the Exchequer is no longer paying and which meant a very considerable reduction, almost sufficient to offset the cost of increased old age pensions. There is also the fact that, by the system of selling certain articles, such as tea, sugar, flour, bread and farm butter, at unrationed prices, the Minister brings in very considerable sums. I do not know what amount it is expected tea will bring in, in respect of sales off the ration, during the coming year.  Sugar brought in £1,400,000 last year, tea brought in £355,000, butter £70,000.  Savings in respect of subsidies on these items, if the savings went against the subsidies, would have amounted to £1,843,000.  Deputies will, therefore, perceive that, in respect of reductions in subsidies, in respect of certain economies in regard to productive expenditure and expenditure which the Minister regards as unproductive, in respect of certain windfall savings and increased revenue from postal charges and other fees, there should have been a very large nest-egg available to the Minister for distribution to the taxpayer for more benefits than seemed to accrue under the Budget statement.</P>
    <P>The reduction in the standard rate of income-tax, the reduction of 6d. in the £, will amount in the present year to £733,000.  On a total collection of £72.7 million that works out at a reduction of about 1 per cent.  It is true that in a full year, with the allowances the Minister is granting, that will amount to considerably more, but the fact is that during the present year, when the Minister is budgeting for the collection of nearly £73,000,000 from the people, he is able to give a remission in respect of that item of only 1 per cent.</P>
    <P>The increased allowance for dependent relatives, from £25 to £50, is a good concession.  I only wish that more could have been done.  It seems to me that an explanation will be required as to why, in the case of a person who has a relative at home who does housekeeping&mdash;if that relative is not in receipt of remuneration&mdash;the income-tax payer who may be only a teacher or pensioner, <Col N="124" /> should not be entitled to the same allowance in respect of the housekeeping of his sister, let us say, who gives practically her whole time to the work, as a business man who employs a housekeeper and is in a position to pay her.  The business man may be able to pay £100 a year or more, but the person on a very small income, who is barely in a position to pay his income-tax charges at present, in spite of the fact that the Minister is going to grant some of these pensioners an addition can, I think, make the case that if the housekeeper allowance is entitled to a substantial addition he should be placed more on a comparative basis.</P>
    <P>In regard to income-tax remissions in general, if the Government believe in private enterprise and in the encouragement of individuals to invest capital in the country and give employment, it certainly seems to me that the incentive given by the reduced rate of income-tax to that particular class is extremely inadequate.  At present the citizens of Dublin have to pay substantial increases in rates and they have to pay increases in respect of other charges.  The Minister told us recently that we would have to pay more for our electricity.  We are paying more for our bus fares, and wherever the citizens have to call upon the services of trade union or professional workers, whereever they have to secure the services of other people, they will certainly find that the fees are greatly increased. These times do not, perhaps, enter into the cost of living, but in the case of the smaller income-tax payer it can be fairly argued that the remission he is getting, even with the addition of the allowance, does not compensate for the increased cost of living.  Admittedly, it has increased.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to the need for increased capital and deplored that we were not doing more to get capital into Irish enterprise and to encourage Irish investors.  If the only encouragement the Minister can give them is the reduction he has given in respect of income-tax, and if at the same time they are to have an increase in the cost of living and in the services that they have to call upon in almost every respect, they will surely be able <Col N="125" /> to show when they examine their balance sheets, if they keep balance sheets, that instead of coming out with a larger amount, or any amount, on the right side, they are probably suffering losses, greater losses.  All those increased charges are ultimately going back to the consumer.</P>
    <P>One of the statements the Minister made last year was that urgent and strenuous efforts would be made to remedy defects in our economic position. The Government have the advantage of securing certain assistance through the agency of the Marshall Aid Plan, but they have rather neglected to show us what urgent and serious efforts they have been able to bring to bear on what they told us were our serious economic problems.  I should have mentioned that when dealing with the figures in the Budget statement the Minister gave us no explanation of the reasons which led him to increase the flour subsidy from the Budget provision which he had made last year of £7,134,000 to £9,860,000.</P>
    <P>One of the promises made by the Minister last year was the promise to investigate the question of excessive profits.  Like the Minister I have always been interested in this question as to whether or not there were people who were taking altogether excessive profits and exploiting the consumer during a period of scarcity when the consumer was unable to defend himself. &ldquo;Excessive profits,&rdquo; the Minister said &ldquo;are still being taken in an number of instances.&rdquo;  I do not see any reference in the Budget Statement, and I do not think the Minister said anything to-day, on the question of profits.  This is a very important matter because a great deal of attention was given to it by the Minister in the past.  In fact, it was the chief theme of his speeches when financial business came before the House. Speaking on the Vote on Account on 14th March, 1947, the Minister, then Deputy McGilligan, said at column 2265:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is also true that what is stated to be the admitted profits only represents 50 per cent. of what was made, so that, if the £35,000,000 <Col N="126" /> be true, these people made £70,000,000.  They paid to the State £35,000,000 and took £35,000,000 to themselves.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister was quoting there from a not very authoritative source, I am afraid, in respect of a revenue question of that kind; but he nevertheless used the figure for all he was worth. He has now had an opportunity of showing&mdash;and he indicated in his Budget Statement last year&mdash;that he intended to go into this matter.  The House is still waiting to see whether the £70,000,000 that the Minister took as the basis for his case two years ago had any reality:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The deduction has often been made that business people &mdash; I do not say that they made this amount, because they had to pay the Government part of it&mdash;extracted from the community over the five years of the war something approaching £100,000,000.  Suppose they took only £50,000,000&mdash;making a reduction of half to allow for any mistake in these figures&mdash;it would appear as if the business people of this country got £10,000,000 a year, over those years, over and above what they were getting pre-war.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then the Minister proceeded to justify this statement in column 2266 by pointing out the effect of these excess profits on work:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Any worker who is asked to produce more at this time, particularly in the light of the admission made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce yesterday, may easily stand back from the situation and say: &lsquo;I was once a £4 a week man.  You have reduced my earning capacity to £2, and you have now given me something in the nature of 15/- or so, but, for giving me a £2 15s. 0d. wage, where I previously had £4, you want me to do more work.  For whom am I working and what will I get out of the new production?&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In column 2270 he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I think the worker at that point would say: &lsquo;Greater production for whom?  Who is going to enjoy the fruits of it?  Give me no greater share than pre-war but give me the <Col N="127" /> old share.  Promise me something better out of the new production and I will see in what way I can bend my efforts to get better production to help everyone in the community.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Last year the Minister told us:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The substantial wage and salary increases already secured by all classes of workers, with such further advantages as shorter hours, paid holidays, children's allowances and other increases in social services, have gone as far as is possible, in present circumstances, to meet the claims of social justice, and I would make a most earnest appeal to all employees not to seek further increases in monetary remuneration or improvement in working conditions unless warranted by exceptional circumstances.  Recent experience confirms that the benefit of an increase in money incomes is rapidly swallowed up by rising prices.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That quotation may be found at column 1057 of Dáil Debates, 4th May, 1948.  This year the Minister again referred to industrial earnings.  At column 493 of Dáil Debates, 4th May, 1949, the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Industrial earnings were, by September last, 82.4 per cent, on average above those for September, 1939.  This increase corresponds with the rise in the cost of living since pre-war, so that workers generally have now been fully compensated for the rise in living costs.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Last year the Minister said the increases, coupled with the improvements in conditions and in social services, had gone as far as was possible in the then existing circumstances to meet the claims of social justice.  This year he tells us that &ldquo;the increase corresponds with the rise in the cost of living since pre-war so that workers generally have now been fully compensated for the rise in living costs.&rdquo; Those of us who take an interest in these matters have noticed that in Sweden, for instance, where trained economists' views are taken very seriously into consideration, particularly in inflationary periods or in a <Col N="128" /> situation where a Government has to consider carefully what steps it should take in regard to these matters, it has been frequently stated by Swedish statesmen that increases in wages have no meaning unless they are accompanied by corresponding increases in production.  The Minister gave us certain figures in regard to the increase in industrial production, an increase which is very welcome and which indicates that the advance made from 1946 to 1947&mdash;and which to a certain extent was held up in 1947&mdash;was again resumed in the past year; and I think the percentage increase from 1948 to 1949 corresponds rather closely with the increase in the industrial production rate from 1946 to 1947.  The Minister, in dealing with this question of wages and the fact that the full compensation for the increased cost of living since pre-war has been made, has made in my view a rather serious omission.  He has failed to tell us what is the increased production.  What is the nature of the increased production which he attributes to the increased remuneration and to the increased wages that have been paid?  I think from the point of view of having statistical information upon which we can base some idea as to where we are going and upon which to make comments worth while on matters of national economic policy it would be very necessary that the Minister should acquaint us with the total amount that is represented by the increase in wages and salary expenditure as compared with pre-war and, as against that, where it is possible to make a relative comparison, the actual increase in production in the volume of goods.  According to his Budget statement, the Minister seems to have some doubts particularly in regard to agriculture&mdash;he has not expressed them in regard to industry&mdash;as to whether we are keeping pace with the needs and conditions of the present time.</P>
    <P>The output in regard to housing is admitted on all sides to be unsatisfactory. The reasons for that unsatisfactory position are attributed to scarcity of skilled workers and so on.  The Minister stressed at great length the very large proportion of building costs which come from the Exchequer.  One <Col N="129" /> almost felt, if one were to take the figures seriously, that there must be a case for closely examining the whole question of costings in regard to housing and the extent to which subsidies improve the situation as regards the supply of houses to all those thousands who are looking for houses at the present time.  I think the Minister should ask his statistics bureau to examine closely into that question and let the country have the benefit of an investigation as to the relationship between the present range of subsidies in regard to housing and the incentive and practical effect of such subsidies in encouraging the ultimate output of houses.</P>
    <P>When one hears so much about extortionists and exploiters, one wonders whether the blame is always put on the right shoulders.  Perhaps it is that too much is being taken by the manufacturers and distributors of building materials.  In any case the important thing for the country to know is whether the output in regard to housing is keeping pace with the increased cost.  The country should be satisfied even now that the improvement in the position which the Minister apparently visualises well may occur.  In regard to the Transition Development Fund, I think the Minister mentioned that he hoped that building costs would settle down.  When one considers the fact that the Transition Development Fund is to be called on at the present time, as well as the State subsidy and the burden that is laid upon local authorities and upon the ratepayers generally, it certainly seems to be a matter that would require careful consideration and investigation.  If the Minister has anything definite to show that, in fact, building costs are going to settle down and that next year the position will be considerably improved, either because the costs of material and labour are going to bear a lesser proportion of the total cost or because so many houses will have been built, then the demand will have been very largely met and the backbone of the problem broken.</P>
    <P>With regard to agricultural output, I think it is quite clear that what farmers demand and what they believe is their right, is that there should be <Col N="130" /> lower costs.  This is largely an agricultural country and I think the history of this country and of other countries where agriculture plays a prominent part, is that agriculture has been forced to assume heavy responsibilities. Obligations have been put on agriculturists as a result of the State interfering in the management of their affairs.  Obligations and responsibilities have been put upon them that might be all right for factory managers, joint stock companies and the industrial world generally, but in agriculture we have many fluctuations to which other forms of industrial activity are not subject.</P>
    <P>The total surplus from the Irish small farmer is comparatively moderate and the special arrangements which the farmer might expect from the State in the way of reducing costs, providing him with better market facilities and giving him a guaranteed price for his produce over a period of years, are after all the real incentive.  If he were to feel or could be persuaded that he has the State behind him in these matters, that he is not being asked to bear an unreasonable burden, if there was a definite State policy by which he could be assured over a period of years of a reasonable return for his produce, and a fair remuneration for himself and his family, I am sure the problem of the agricultural labourer would be very largely settled.  At the present time I think the farmers feel that we are, willy-nilly, forcing upon them urban standards in regard to employment, remuneration and conditions generally without at the same time taking the necessary steps to put them in the position in which they should be, if they are to attempt to face those responsibilities <i>vis-a-vis</i> employers in the towns and cities of the country.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister indicated that the agricultural income per head of the agricultural producing population was about £135 a year at the present time. In 1938 the industrial income per head of industrial producers was £127 a year. I do not quite know what it is at present but it is clear that agriculture is now only reaching the stage, in spite of the increased volume of money, in terms of pounds that the industrial worker had reached in industry in 1938.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="131" /> I should like to deal with the question of profit because I think it is important. We are either dealing seriously or we are not with this question of profit and the incentives that are necessary if the workers are to believe that those who are employing them and who are charged with the responsibility of increasing production and perhaps building up an export trade are carrying out their duties honestly to the community or not.  It is four years since the leader of the Minister's Party, the present Minister for Education, stated, as reported in Volume 100, column 2516:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Industrialists who have kept industrial production going during the war have done so by almost superhuman exertions and by astonishing ingenuity and persistence and very great courage.  The system of taxation of industry adopted during the war was such as to undermine men's courage and to make them feel that it could not be worth while taking chances, because taxation was so imposed that it put as big a burden on the extension of an industry as it did upon the excess profits accruing in an adventitious way as a result of war circumstances.  While the Minister takes a shilling off the income-tax and says that the excess profits tax is to be abandoned after the 1st January next, he does not offer the industrialists the kind of hope or spur that they are entitled to get. The Minister knows that if we are to have industrial expansion here, we must have an additional amount of capital put into industry.  He must know that the most effective and satisfactory way of developing an industry is that such profits as the industry can make and can profitably use in the expansion of business should be put back into the business.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not know how the Minister for Finance can reconcile the statements of his leader with such statements as I have read out made by him two years ago.  He is now in a position to tell the country what exactly is the truth of this whole matter.  I omitted to state in dealing with the question of revenue the increases which have taken <Col N="132" /> place in respect of the consumption of beer and other commodities as compared with pre-war.  It is rather interesting because the Budget, as well as being very important in determining economic trends, has a great deal to do with social conditions in the country.  In 1938 the consumption of beer was 648,516 barrels and in 1948, 897,387 barrels, an increase of 38 per cent.  We consumed 9,471,000 lbs. of tobacco in 1938 and in 1948 12,500,000 lbs.  That is an increase of 32 per cent. In a recent statement, the Taoiseach, speaking, I think, at Tramore Chamber of Commerce, said that we did not pay the attention we might have paid to the portion of the annual Budget statement dealing with capital issues and expenditure. I do not know whether the Taoiseach had time to look at some of the speeches of the Minister for Finance in the past with regard to capital expenditure.  I was listening to the broadcast statement of the Taoiseach and he compared the huge amount of money which the Government is to spend during the present year, inflationary trends notwithstanding, with the amount spent in 1948.  We were all listening to the account of the universal celebrations of D-Day.  We all heard something about them, as we could not turn on a radio without breaking in on them.  The war was not very long over in 1946 and whether the Government takes 1946 or 1947, they are certainly taking a year in respect of economic comparisons which cannot be described as being in any way un-favourable to them.  In the 1947 Budget, however, actually £8.2 million of borrowed money was set aside for capital expenditure; electrical development, £2,000,000; telephones, £1,450,000; local loans, £500,000, plus £850,000 from money already accumulated; turf, £1,550,000; airports, £2,136,000; bloodstock, £100,000; glass-houses and poultry, £100,000; and tourism, £150,000.  We have been told, of course, by some of the Parties now on the Government side of the House that full employment and national production schemes could all be got going without any cost to the taxpayers, without anything being necessary except to apply the produce of the national <Col N="133" /> credit &mdash; whatever that may mean.  Without any cost whatever to the taxpayer, we were told that it would be possible to arrange that the national credit would be pledged to those production schemes.</P>
    <P>The Minister has admitted to being somewhat of a crank in these matters and that he has a certain kinship with Deputies like Deputy Captain Cowan, but in this Budget and the previous Budget the Minister has laid down that the ultimate test with regard to capital expenditure must be whether it is going to pay the charges in respect of interest and sinking fund or not. He admits, I grant, that there may be some advantage to the State from some of these schemes which cannot be measured altogether in these terms, but on the whole he has said that that must be the ultimate test.  He was very much stronger on that last year when he was cutting out some schemes originated by the last Government and put into operation by them and he emphasised the necessity of State schemes paying their way in the narrow financial sense.  I could not resist looking at some of the statements that the Minister and some of his colleagues treated us to with regard to capital expenditure when they were on this side of the House.  I quote column 2273, Volume 104, No. 16, March 14th, 1947:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Government preached very much about inflation.  Inflation is a sort of bogey-man at the moment. The Government's very activities show that they do not know what inflation is.  They are doing what I have mentioned already, but in addition we heard of a vast reconstruction programme, of great telephone extensions, of marvellous stretches of broad straight roads, more money on airports and a lot of luxury hotels.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They were all very strong on the luxury hotels.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I do not know what fantastic business there is that the Government have not accepted.  We have heard of the various Bills for reconstruction, adding £100,000,000 or £200,000,000.  The one safeguard we <Col N="134" /> have is that they are only programmes and no one expects them to be put into effect.  But if they were put into effect, is not every one of those expenses.  I have mentioned inflationary?</P>
    <P>Surely it is realised that to pour more money out to the country, without adding to the stock of consumable goods in the country means inflation?  We can build roads until the country is riddled with straight, terraced roads.  Do we add to production? Only very remotely, very indirectly.  We hear of telephone extensions, putting this country on a par with Sweden, one of the greatest telephone-using nations in the world. What do we want it for?  How much money is to be spent on telephone extensions?  Will it get any more consumer goods produced in the country?  The money we have spent on airports and the money we propose to spend will not bring any more goods in, but there will be more money flowing through in circulation.</P>
    <P>The same applies to these luxury hotels, only we have added to it that you bring in, not merely money to make future claims on our small stock of consumer goods but bring the people to consume the goods.  Yet, these are the designs that the Government have on our economy in the future.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the Minister two years ago. In his recent Budget statement, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On the whole, it appears that the upward surge in prices has spent itself and that, if the forces making for inflation are held in check, further increases will be avoided.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So that inflation, apparently, is only being held in check and there is still danger; and when one regards the increases in prices compared with those of the preceding year and the figures for industrial and agricultural output, it can be stated that there certainly would seem to be danger of inflation, particularly if costs here should continue to rise.</P>
    <P>In that connection, it might be proper to ask the Minister whether any <Col N="135" /> steps are being taken by the Government to consider the situation which will arise here if steps are taken in a neighbouring country to try to put their price level more on parity with price levels in other countries.  There is a general belief apparently&mdash;and reference has been made to the matter in the neighbouring Parliament&mdash;that costs are altogether out of keeping with costs of competing countries, and particularly costs in the United States of America, and that something will have to be done to adjust that situation. Should that adjustment be made, it will have repercussions on us here, and it would be well that we should know what exactly we are going to do should that situation arise.</P>
    <P>I was dealing with the question of capital expenditure.  The Minister set out the amounts that he was providing on electricity and turf development, on housing and telephone capital, all the same type of items that he described two years ago as being disadvantageous in the national interest by reason of the inflation they would help to create, and which he described even last year as being of a megalomaniac nature, schemes which would only be undertaken by a Government which had no regard to the true national interests but simply thought of national advertisement and aggrandisement for themselves. I notice that in the report of his radio address, published in the newspapers of the 26th April, Mr. W. H. Taft, special assistant to the E.C.A. mission to Ireland, is reported as having stated in a broadcast talk from Radio Éireann that one of the chief ways in which we could improve our dollar position and our economic situation generally was by a better organised tourist programme.  He continued:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Another most important source of dollars can come from tourism. Ireland, by its relative proximity to America, with its beauty and attractiveness of character and with millions of Irish-American relatives, is potentially rich as a tourist country.  Its wealth is only potential because accommodations and travel facilities are too few to take care of the American traveller.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="136" /> To build hotels and to attract the tourist from the United States&mdash; who is now flying across Ireland to Europe&mdash;needs energy; the desire to attract foreign investment in hotels; hotel management training; the better preservation of wild life; more money for advertisement; the official preservation of national monuments, which, in a country stimulated by history, are disgracefully neglected&mdash; in a word, a forthright and determined policy&mdash;and that is what Ireland does not have.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In his Budget statement, the Minister referred to this question of tourist traffic and indicated that it had probably reached its peak, while other countries&mdash;not alone the continental countries like Belgium, Holland, Scandinavia and Italy&mdash;whatever their other difficulties may be, are concentrating on developing the tourist traffic.  You have countries like Canada and South Africa doing everything possible to build up the tourist trade with the United States of America.  The Minister has indicated the importance of the tourist industry to us here.  In his Budget statement, dealing with the balance of payments he says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The trade deficit for 1948 was almost as high as that for 1947&mdash; £89,000,000, as compared with £92,000,000.  The improvement in the balance of payments as a whole is attributable mainly to increased income from tourism, the number of visitors in 1948 being about one-third more than in 1947.</P>
    <P>It would be overoptimistic to rely upon a continuance of tourist income at such unprecedented levels and so it is all the more necessary to secure a substantial increase in exports.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then he says that the gap in respect of invisible items is being&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;bridged only if investment income, pensions, emigrants' remittances, sweepstake receipts, etc., remained at their present level and tourist income did not sink below £35,000,000 a year.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As the Minister for Industry and Commerce pointed out, even at the figure of £28,000,000 at which it stood in 1947, it was much more valuable to <Col N="137" /> this country than the whole of our exports of live stock.</P>
    <P>The Minister is making certain arrangements in the Finance Bill in regard to gifts for public and charitable purposes.  With regard to the position of university education and endowments for education generally, I have often wondered &mdash; and I think the matter received some little consideration in the past, but not sufficient to bring it to any definite decision&mdash;about the taking of action towards remission of those who would make endowments for educational purposes.  The Minister has an opportunity now.  I am sure he is much more interested in this question than anyone else here.  He knows that endowments for Irish education, particularly university education, are few and far between.  I think only two or three legacies of value have been left to the National University since it was established, by men of Irish birth or extraction in far away countries.  When the university was founded, I understand, it was anticipated that circumstances would be entirely different from what they have been, and that considerable sums would possibly be given by wealthy Irishmen and women in other countries.  That has not happened, and, when the Minister is making certain changes in the law in favour of those who are making gifts for public charitable purposes, would he not go further and give a special remission to Irish citizens who show their interest in education, and particularly university education, by leaving sums of money to the Irish universities?  It would be a very worthy gesture and a gesture that might be of value to these institutions, if the Minister would indicate that he was prepared to consider it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Derrig has travelled over quite a wide field, but unfortunately his remarks were so confused with in accuracies that it is very difficult to reply to them.  He apparently still labours under the delusion that taxation has been raised since 1948.  One of the first things this Government did was to remit certain increased taxation imposed on beer and tobacco, before the 1948 Budget, at a <Col N="138" /> cost to the Exchequer of some £6,000,000.  This year&mdash;I am taking only the bigger items&mdash;as between income-tax concessions and a reduction in the standard rate, there will be a loss on previous taxation yields of something in the nature of £1? millions in a full year.</P>
      <P>There was last year also the fact that the tea ration was increased, while the subsidy was maintained, which cost a considerable sum in a full year.  There were also the moneys paid to the old age pensioners and to the widows and orphans, and, in between, there have been all the concessions made to public servants in the matter of pay and this year considerable relief has been given to pensioners of different types.  Priority was given to the case of the teacher pensioners, but the particular standards adopted for them have also been applied to pretty definitely all classes of civil pensioners, as well as to the police. There has been a remission of taxation which is not very much short of £10,000,000 and, in addition, concessions have been granted which do not cost less than about £5,000,000.  In the face of the reductions made, how anybody can still go around the country blathering about taxation having been increased passes my comprehension. Probably Deputy Derrig, like his colleagues, has not awakened to the fact that the public at least know what the real situation is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the illusion which has been carefully fostered by propaganda through the country that the cost of living has increased.  I find it hard to distinguish, when Deputies talk about that, whether they are pointing to a cost-of-living figure or to a cost of living or standard of living.  So far as the standard of living is concerned, we have made it possible for people to enjoy a better standard than they had before.  I say that the increased allowances made not merely to public servants but in the outside world, without any threat from us, such as was made in October, 1947, that the standstill Order was about to be reimposed, have made up, as at the end of last year, and certainly as at this time this <Col N="139" /> year, the increase in the cost of living since 1939.</P>
    <P>The cost-of-living index figure, if we take it as measuring certain standards, standards of a limited type, is not going upwards.  It has in fact dropped and has shown seasonal rises here and there, but it has been kept definitely under the point at which we found it when we came in and that has been done without any instruction being given, as was given by our predecessors, that certain items should be taken off the list of things counted in the calculation of the cost of living.</P>
    <P>The <i>Trade Journal</i> published under the auspices of the Department of Industry and Commerce carried the statement in December, 1947, that, by Government instruction, certain things had been taken out of the list of items on which the cost-of-living figure calculations is made.  These were the items upon which taxation had been imposed&mdash;tobacco and certain classes of drink.  They had been weighted before, and, by deliberate Government decision and deliberate Government instructions, as stated in the <i>Trade Journal</i>, these were removed.  We have not done anything to interfere with the calculation made with regard to that cost-of-living figure, and that cost-of-living figure has, in the natural way, through the effects of the action we have taken, been maintained at a stable point and in fact has been kept under the point at which it was in February, 1948.</P>
    <P>Deputy Derrig put certain questions to me, and, if many more questions of the same type are asked, I shall be more encouraged to follow the line which I was very much inclined to follow in May, 1948, that is, with regard to better investigation of profiteering in this country over six or seven years and possibly some better attempt to get back what people did pack away &mdash; what were, I think, properly described as the gains of profiteers.  I need not go any further back than to remind Deputies that, in one of the earliest Budgets after the war had broken out, the then Minister for Finance&mdash;now the President of this country&mdash;stated that he had made up <Col N="140" /> his mind to stop efforts on the part of members of the trading community to take advantage of the exigencies of the situation, that he had found that people were taking advantage of the exigencies of the situation and that he had determined to stop it, and he came in with certain tax proposals in the autumn of 1940.  He abandoned these before he had carried them through, but indicated that he was going to bring them forward again, that he simply reserved them for a better development when it came to the Budget of next year.  When it came to the Budget, however, they had been forgotten.</P>
    <P>He was reminded on several occasions of what he had said and was challenged more than once as to whether he was accurate when he spoke of people making profits, and he then went on to discriminate between profits, excess profits which might have been thrown into people's hands and what he called profiteering. Questioned as to whether he was accurate in saying that what had been done by certain of the trading community did amount to profiteering, he had no hesitation in saying that that was so.  I remember he was challenged in the Seanad on one occasion as to whether he believed&mdash;that is the way it was put to him&mdash;there had been profiteering during the war and he said: &ldquo;Not merely do I believe it, but I know it to be so.&rdquo;  He went on to say that that was a statement which he made with a full sense of responsibility from the figures supplied to him in connection with his Ministerial post.</P>
    <P>I think the then Minister for Finance was right.  There are profits that are always being made in trade and there are even increased profits&mdash; one might call them excess profits, profits which come to people without any piracy on their part, which come simply because the situation works that way&mdash;and there are then the completely extravagant and wrong profits which people can make by using circumstances favourable to profiteering for their own purposes.  I have no doubt that the then Minister for Lands was right when he said that the third point had been reached, that a considerable <Col N="141" /> number of people in this country had abused the trust they had been given connected with the running of trade and industry.  The difficulty I am in about that is that it is next door to impossible for me to get those back because in one year, 1947, from a date in 1946, excess corporation profits tax was remitted.  To reimpose that would be an extremely difficult matter.  I do not think I am saying anything that is not known to the public generally when I say that although that remission was made, with a certain indication here in Dáil Éireann that the purpose of it was to enable these trading concerns to pile up a certain fund against the rather difficult passage they might have from the point of view that they had paid dear and might have to sell cheap, a lot of these people distributed in dividends the funds that came to their hands that they should have put aside against that difficult period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a special class that may require very special attention quite soon.  Most of them did distribute them in a way in which they would not have done had they attended to what was said in Dáil Éireann.  These are moneys that were distributed to the shareholders and proprietors concerned and without doing considerable damage to these concerns it is not possible now to get back what justice demands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I place that, however, as against the other claim that is made to me here in a certain contradictory way.  Two claims were made by Deputy Derrig. He seemed to cast scorn on the idea that there were any profits made.  He seemed to indicate at another point that he believed profits were made and that these should be taken from the concerns.  At the same time he went on to assert that trading concerns in this country did not get the same advantages as on the other side.  Presumably he was referring to the clamour for giving increased allowances for obsolete machinery or wear and tear in connection with machinery. It was to meet that particular claim that these profits were handed over and a definite allowance was given to <Col N="142" /> these people to retain these profits after the war was over.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the firms that did not pay excess profits tax at all were entitled to some concession of that kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Whereas in England the full 100 per cent. of that was taken from them, here, 50 per cent. only was taken as far as one tax was concerned and 25 per cent. was taken in another way.  There was the grant to them of that amount of money which in the other country was taken from them. I am using the comparison.  I think the then Minister for Finance when he was making excuses in this House for not taking the full 100 per cent. said that it was to enable these people to pile up that fund on account of the difficult circumstances of the war.  I am not objecting to them having it but I object to them having it and then making a claim based upon what was happening in England where the full 100 per cent. of these excess profits was taken.  There should be a bit of honesty about the whole matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I say, there was considerable disquiet through the country because there is a recognition that there was profiteering here during the war, scandalous profiteering on the part of certain people, and open profiteering on the part of certain people, and I think there is a certain amount of anxiety and annoyance with the present Government, with myself, I suppose, as an individual, because I have not gone in a more ruthless fashion after these profits.  I would like to get after them but I have also to bear in mind that industry must be kept going. It may be that we will have to let a certain number of rogues away with the loot because we have to pay attention to the generality of the business <Col N="143" /> people in the country who, of course, were not that type.  If Deputies on the opposite side of the House, incidentally, would only remember that there is a division to be made as between business people in this country, they will not fall into the errors that they are constantly falling into. It is easy to quote remarks aimed at certain groups in the community and, for propaganda purposes, to pretend to have them apply to the whole trading community.  I do not know that anybody here has ever said comprehensively that the whole business community were to be regarded as people who just simply made money irrespective of how it was made, but there are certain numbers of them who did and it was recognised by people facing me now when they were here and they had the information under their hands.</P>
    <P>Deputy Derrig has quoted a speech I made in 1947.  I would recommend him to re-read it.  I think he will get a good deal of information from it.  He read a passage from it with regard to inflation and in regard to a variety of other matters.  There is not one word of that that I need contradict.  Deputy Derrig ought to remember that the year 1947 and the year 1949 have seen considerable difference.  I said last year that there was considerable risk attendant on, say, giving a benediction to the increased emoluments being paid by firms through the country and also considerable risk attendant on the fact that I myself decided to increase the payment of servants of the State and considerable risk in putting at the disposal of people through the country moneys for capital works that might have meant a very definite increase of the various inflationary pressures and we asked people and exhorted people to remember the situation, to remember what they were doing.  We wanted to put them in the position in which they would feel that there was an incentive to give a good effort for the country.</P>
    <P>We told them that we would allow their moneys to increase and, as far as this Government had anything to do with it immediately, we would increase payments.  We asked people <Col N="144" /> to hold these moneys and not to spend. They had the advantage of realising, first of all, that they were being paid in a better way.  They knew that the hardship of their case had been recognised and that the increased emoluments were to do away with the hardship.  They were in possession of money but when they might make what looked to be a fairly bad situation worse if they spent those moneys, we asked them to withhold their spending, not to put in circulation the moneys they had in hands.  Over a considerable part of the country for a considerable part of last year they hearkened to that advice and did not spend.  But, there was a danger if those people had spent all the moneys that was certainly put in their hands for free circulation, or there could have been danger.  We decided not to have any threats about the reimposition of standstill Orders. We decided to trust to the good sense of the people and we have got the cooperation.</P>
    <P>This year, I think the inflationary danger is much less.  In fact, it is quite clear as far as America is concerned that there is no longer any fear of inflation. Their only fear is whether they have what they call an orderly readjustment of the circumstances, whether there is what they call a wholesome recession of a business type and whether they will come out in the end to a better situation or there is the danger that they may get into the depths of a very deep depression.  They hope to avoid that and it looks as if the whole system of human controls is better geared to deal with depression than it was to deal with an inflationary situation.  That has also come nearer to us in England and, as far as one can read the signs of things over there, there is no longer than inflationary danger but possible danger of depression.</P>
    <P>The impact of the circumstances that prevail both in America and particularly in England is bound to have a repercussion here.  It is not easy and certainly it is not possible to forecast what the position will be at the end of the year.  However, the danger of inflation is much less now than it was <Col N="145" /> this time last year.  That is why this year, particularly, it was decided it was a time at which we could put at the disposal of those who are interested in these matters very big sums of money for developing in certain directions&mdash; electricity, telephones, roads, housing and particularly that which ought to lead to better production of consumer goods in the country, land reclamation. If Deputy Derrig will relate my words to the time when they were spoken he will find, as I have said, that I have nothing to withdraw and nothing to apologise for except that I may have been speaking above Deputy Derrig's head.</P>

There will be no presents for President Peron as far as I am concerned.  I do not know whether Deputy Derrig is hinting at coming benevolence or not but he hinted that, if the system of taxation were changed, it might be possible to endow educational establishments, particularly university establishments, in this country.  That is something that could be considered.  Is there anything in the offing?  I should be glad to know if he was speaking of anything concrete.</P>

      <P>Before the House adjourns, I wonder if, in view of the fact that the Government is not in a position to proceed with business, it is necessary to meet at 2 p.m. to-morrow, as to-day.  It seems foolish to have met at 2 p.m. to-day when we are adjourning earlier than usual.  It is an inconvenient hour for Deputies but we assented only in the anticipation of a full programme of business.  Perhaps we can discharge that order from 2 p.m. to 3 p.m. by agreement?  I wonder if, at the same time, the Parliamentary Secretary would give some indication of the business for to-morrow?</P>

      <P>As Deputies are probably aware, the suggestion to meet at 2 p.m. was made by a Deputy from the Opposition Party.  I think it is an inconvenient time&mdash;it is during the luncheon interval.  It was not anticipated that the business to-day would have finished so rapidly.  In view of the changed circumstances I think there is no disagreement on this side of the House.  We could meet at 3 o'clock to-morrow.  The business would be the Land Reclamation Bill, the Electricity Supply Bill (Committee Stage) and the Department of Justice Estimate.</P>
