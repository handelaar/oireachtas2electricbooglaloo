    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce on what grounds it was decided not to give retrospective effect to the reduction in motor insurance premiums and if, in view of the findings of the Prices Advisory Body, he will now consider giving retrospective effect to this reduction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The recommendation of the Prices Advisory Body was that the <Col N="647" /> reduction in motor insurance premiums should operate as from 1st December, 1952.  The grounds on which the body made this recommendation were that there would be considerable administrative difficulty and expense involved in giving retrospective effect to any reduction.  The body considered that the most equitable course would be to let the increased premiums run for a full year and to effect a reduction from 1st December, 1952.  As stated in my reply to the Deputy on the 22nd October, the fact that the insurance companies will have the benefit of the increased rates for a full year was taken into account by the body in deciding on the amount of the reduction they would recommend.  If a reduction in premiums were made retrospective the amount of the reduction would be less than 12½ per cent.</P>
      <P>In view of the recommendation of the body, which I have accepted, it is not proposed to take steps to give retrospective effect to the reduction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he received a verbal or written report from members of a technical mission sent here from the United States of America on restrictive trade practices, or if any observations were made on restrictive trade practices by members of a technical mission dealing with other matters; and, if so, if he will state the nature of these observations, or publish the terms of the report; and if he will state the cost of the technical mission concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No technical mission was sent here from the United States of America to report on restrictive trade practices.  In the report on the industrial potentialities of Ireland by the I.B.E.C. technical services corporation there are some general comments on the need to eliminate policies and practices which are inconsistent with the general lifting of production levels. In the report on Ireland's dollar export potential, the experts engaged by Córas Tráchtála Teoranta commented on certain restrictive practices affecting <Col N="648" /> industry which had come to their attention during the course of their investigations.  With regard to the publication of these reports and the cost of the missions I would refer the Deputy to replies which I gave in the Dáil last week to questions on these matters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The publication of the reports is being considered.  In the case of the report to Córas Tráchtála Teoranta it is a summary only that will be published because it contains numerous references to the business of individual firms.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy misunderstands. The references are to restrictive practices of a general kind by Government Departments, local authorities, finance, business, labour and everybody else.  The Restrictive Trade Practices Bill is an attempt to adjust an internal situation in the public interest and has only a very slight bearing on the general question raised in these reports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state (a) the <Col N="650" /> basis and reasons for the statement in his Budget speech of the 2nd April, 1952, that the estimated deficit on the balance of payments for the year 1952 would be £50,000,000, and (b) whether his attention has been drawn to the statements of the Minister for Industry and Commerce (i) made on the 16th July, as reported in Dáil Debates, Volume 133, No. 8, column 1027, that there was a fair prospect that there would be no deficit in the balance of payments this year; (ii) at Ennis, as reported in the daily Press on the 16th September, 1952, that on a conservative estimate the deficit on the balance of payments this year would be £25,000,000; and (iii) as reported in the daily Press on 6th October, that in the light of late statistics the deficit for the year 1952 in the balance of payments would be between £10,000,000 and £12,000,000; and, if so, whether his Department arrived at estimates which agree with those figures and, further, whether these varying estimates of our external payments position have in any way affected Government policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee) Seán MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy at (a) of his question appears to misinterpret the passage in my Budget speech quoted in column 1124, Volume 130 of the Dáil Debates of 2nd April, 1952.  If the Deputy reads this passage he will find that I made no prediction that the deficit in the balance of payments for the year 1952 would be £50,000,000.  What I did say was that the balance of payments deficit which we faced at the beginning of 1952, that is to say three months earlier, was about £50,000,000.  I used the past tense deliberately, as this figure was a reflection of trends carried over from 1951 which I hoped would be radically corrected during the remainder of 1952.  The general scheme of the Budget was, indeed, intended to reinforce other measures which had already been taken to achieve this objective.  I went on to say that the way to secure a reduction in the deficit was for the Government to bring its receipts and expenditure into closer accord and for the community to save more and to spend less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government took steps to <Col N="651" /> achieve a better balance between receipts and outgoings and the public, for their part, responded by saving more and, in particular, by spending less on imports of consumer goods. Moreover, the volume of exports has risen considerably.  The result has been a great improvement in our balance of payments.  If this improvement is maintained for the remainder of the year the overall deficit for 1952 will be reduced to manageable dimensions.</P>
    <P>In association with the improvement in our overall balance of payments there has also been a substantial reduction in our deficits with the dollar area and the rest of the non-sterling world.  In my Budget speech I set limits of $16,000,000 to our deficit with the dollar area and of £9,000,000 to our deficit with the rest of the non-sterling world for the second half of 1952.  It seems likely that we shall come close to these objectives.</P>
    <P>The improvement which has taken place in the balance of payments is consonant with Government policy and is to a degree a direct consequence of Government measures aimed at improving the internal financial position and reducing the deficit in external trade and payments.  The situation, however, still calls for attention and restraint and it will continue to be Government policy to protect the economy, as far as possible, against a recurrence of the serious developments of 1951.</P>
    <P>I decline, however, to make any precise forecast of the future position. The Deputy should by now be aware that external trade, visible and invisible, is subject to major fluctuations not always predictable. Prophetic insight in these matters is denied even to politicians.</P>

In the figures given by the Minister, since May, 1951, to May, 1952, none of the holdings was bought at a public auction.  Seven holdings were purchased, four in Roscommon and three in County Mayo. This is the sole effort of the Land Commission under the 1950 Act to relieve congestion in the West of Ireland.

For this reason the door connecting the original two courtrooms of the District Court in Morgan Place with the main building was kept closed during sittings of the courts.  Subsequently, on the provision of an additional courtroom for the purposes of the District Court in what was formerly the Benchers Chamber, communication between that courtroom and the main building was cut off during sittings of the courts in pursuance of the settled policy by the closing of the door referred to in the question.

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the Galway County Council have been informed by an official that the Department have issued certificates after October, 1951, and that the big delay in sanctioning the grants to people under the county council scheme is the failure of the Department to issue certificates of State grants given to people prior to October, 1951?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Certain difficulties arose because of the need to notify local bodies in connection with grants paid by the State prior to the 1950 Act.  The houses in respect of which these grants were paid were due for rate relief, as the Deputy is probably aware, for a number of years.  When the 1950 Housing Act came along and in cases where local bodies, such as Galway County Council, adopted Section 7 and where the grant was paid, on payment of the State grant, it was necessary to alter the procedure.  Some confusion then arose, because the grants which were formerly notified in bulk for rating purposes had later to be notified as the grant was paid by the Department. These difficulties, as I have said, have been ironed out and we hope that they will not again arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I was saying last night, when the debate adjourned, we would be happy if we felt that the increased funds made available as a result of this tax would be entirely devoted to the maintenance and restoration of our roads, but unfortunately that point of view is not accepted generally by motorists and the feeling that this is more or less a crippling form of tax to push certain types of workers off the road is causing great concern.  However, I do not think that we will have very long to wait to ascertain what precisely is the attitude of the Minister in this matter.  His sincerity will be gauged by the amount of grants made available to local authorities for the maintenance and upkeep of the roads in the coming year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I, for one, as a member of a local authority very sincerely hope that the grants will be very considerably increased because, as I said last night, the burden of local rates is a crushing one and notwithstanding the fact that year after year local authorities have increased the amount of money expended on roads these roads are not improving.  Many Deputies have referred to the fact that our roads were never intended to bear the heavy traffic that now passes over them.  I thoroughly agree with that point of <Col N="683" /> view, but I would like to be permitted to repeat now what I said on the Estimate some months back: in my opinion in certain cases&mdash;in many cases particularly in the West of Ireland&mdash;no amount of money will put the roads in a condition to bear the heavy traffic that is now passing over them.  No matter how much local authorities spend on many miles of road in the West of Ireland they will not put them into condition to bear a laden ten-ton truck often followed by an equally heavy trailer.  It is impossible to do so, because the bog foundations on which they are built could not be put in a proper condition.  I repeat that the only way to tackle the problem is for the local authorities to indicate the roads in their county over which a fiveton laden vehicle, a ten-ton laden vehicle or a 15-ton laden vehicle may pass and to prohibit the use of certain roads for heavy traffic&mdash;roads which they know are not able to bear the heavier types of vehicles.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>

      <P>Deputy Allen is a man who has had much experience and, of course, I accept what he says.  I am surprised, however, that that power has not been exercised.  This is a matter to which local authorities should give immediate attention.  There are some roads in the West of Ireland which have only a bog foundation.  I submit that it is throwing away public money to repair those roads and to permit heavy traffic to use them.</P>
      <P>On the subject of road grants generally, I should like to say that it would help local authorities considerably if they could be informed, before preparing their estimates, of the amount of road grant to be made available to them.  I think it is unwise to delay giving local authorities that news until after their estimates because they prepare their schemes on the basis of their estimates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFinan" hpid="Mr. Finan Mr. Finan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather surprised that, of all men, Deputy Cogan should challenge Deputy Dillon's statement with regard to the ultimate effect of this imposition on the ordinary farmer. Farmers are the primary producers in this country and they form the vast majority of the consumers.  It must be obvious to every Deputy in this House that, since there is no other source of wealth in the country but the soil, in the final analysis every increase in the cost of living is borne by the people on the land.</P>
      <P>I trust that the Minister will take notice of the remarks that have been made in good faith by different speakers here.  Since I came into this House I have tried to deal impartially with every matter that came up for discussion. I think the example set by Deputy Corish in his analysis of the various subjects raised here would be well worth following.  It is incorrect to assume that because a proposal is put forward by the Government it is the duty of the Opposition to oppose it.  I think that it is the duty of the Opposition to examine every proposal that comes before the House and to do everything possible to try to improve it.</P>
      <P>I believe that if this proposal were left to the Minister's own decision he would abandon it completely.  I realise that he has probably been manoeuvred into this position by the Department of Finance.  It seems to be the view of the Department of Finance&mdash;who are seeking to have their policy on these matters put into effect by the members of the Government, probably against their will&mdash;that the people of this country have too much money.  They appear to consider that we are spending too much money and that the only solution is to take the money from the people in one way or another.  If the Government agree to that policy, then I submit that it is unjust and foolish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every form of taxation should be measured in relation to justice.  It is unfair to impose indiscriminately a tax on the community without taking into consideration the question of whether or not it is a just tax.  That is the acid test.  The Exchequer cannot be in <Col N="685" /> such a deplorably bad position; recently it got a very considerable sum of money by way of loan.  Therefore, a shortage of money cannot have been responsible for this proposal.  I submit that if this tax has been imposed in the interests of any monopoly in this country it should not be tolerated.  If it should happen that people were pushed off the road by penal taxation there is no doubt that the community would have to pay well for any road service made available to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. M.E. Dockrell Mr. M.E. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support those who oppose this extra imposition on mechanically-propelled vehicles.  A number of very telling arguments have been made by various speakers on this subject.  I think it is clear from the speeches which have been made that Deputies consider that motorists and the motoring community generally are being badly treated. There is no use in the Government's thinking that motoring generally is a luxury and that the carrying trade which is operated on the roads of this country can be indefinitely taxed.  In the first place we are a small country with relatively short haulage distances, and motor transport is admirably suited to our conditions.  It is not sensible for a Government to impose the almost penal taxation which the motor industry has to bear, considering the fact that undoubtedly it is the most economic and most useful form of transport in this country.  I do not think that anywhere else, nationally, would benefit more by the free and unrestricted use of transport than this country, and yet our motor industry is taxed very heavily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the motor industry has to bear something like £10,000,000 per annum.  If that £10,000,000 were spent on the roads of this country it would go a long way towards giving us the fine roads which we need.  The Minister has not referred to the sums paid by the motoring community by way of petrol tax.  That is a direct tax on motoring and on the transport industry. The idea that the ordinary citizens of this country do not have to <Col N="686" /> bear the taxation on motor-cars is almost an absurdity.</P>
    <P>Various Deputies have referred to the fact that the ordinary man in the street or on the farm will have to bear these costs.  Again the very heavy taxes which are proposed for the heavier types of vehicles will constitute a heavy burden on certain industries.  I cannot but imagine that the building industry will be affected to an appreciable extent by those taxes.  Very heavy lorries are used in the building industry for the transport of sand and gravel and of heavy materials such as cement and timber. Certainly every industry engaged in the distributive trade in this country will be seriously affected by the proposed taxes.  I think it a great pity that a more modern approach to this problem has not been adopted by the Government.  They still seem to think along the line that motoring is something indulged in by wealthy people for their pleasure and utilised to a certain extent by industries and trades generally, just because they do not wish to avail themselves of traditional methods of transport.  That, of course, is not so.  Motor transport is a vital part of the life of this country and we all know that, were it not for the heavy taxation which it already bears, it would have brought even more benefits to the country.  Since the development of the internal combustion engine, it has been possible to open up the country in a way which our immediate forefathers never dreamt of.  Goods can now be brought to the door of practically every person in the country.  That is a tremendous convenience to the people concerned and is a direct incentive to the trading community to increase these facilities and to build up more trade.  That is surely what the Government would like to see.</P>
    <P>I know that the maintenance of the roads imposes an increasingly heavy burden upon the community generally, but it is the community which is being served by the motor-cars that travel over these roads.  Motor vehicles are not dashing about the country maliciously to tear up the roads in <Col N="687" /> order to spite local authorities.  They are going about their lawful occasions, in the main, carrying goods to and from the cities and to and from the rural parts.</P>
    <P>This is a national problem.  Various Deputies have referred to the county roads and suggested that they should be made a national charge.  Successive Governments have recognised that by making specific grants from the Central Fund to local authorities.  I should like to see that principle still further extended so that the cost of the maintenance of main roads would be recognised as an overall charge on the State.  I think we have had this heavy taxation of the motoring community largely because successive Governments saw in petrol a commodity which was in universal demand and, therefore, a commodity which provided an easy medium of raising taxes, forgetting that the industry, of which petrol is the life blood, would itself require money to expand and develop.  The money that comes from the taxation of petrol should go back into that industry in the form of expenditure to ensure better roads.  That is the way in which money for the improvement of Irish roads should be raised.  It is not by paralysing industry as a result of imposing heavy taxes on individual vehicles that the roads can really be improved because what will happen as a result of this taxation will be that the heavier types of vehicles will be put off the roads and the Irish people will be deprived of the type of services which they should get.  That is the spirit in which I should like to see the Minister and the Government approach this question of taxation.  It must be approached in a modern manner, approached in the light of an industry which is giving service to the community and which must not be throttled.  It can be throttled quite easily.  If it is throttled, it will have serious repercussions on the country generally because, as I said before, this is one country, above all, which would benefit by a wider use of motor transport.</P>
    <P>There is one matter which has been brought to my notice by some of my <Col N="688" /> constituents in connection with this proposed taxation.  I refer to the taxation of electrical vehicles, which are not in very widespread use.  They are used in the various types of the lighter distributive trade.  The Government has recognised their special condition and circumstances by not taxing them so heavily as other vehicles up to 25 cwt. unladen but after that they bear the same rate of taxation as other vehicles.  I would ask the Minister to look into this matter to see what he can do to relieve this type of vehicle from the same heavy taxation.  This type of vehicle is very limited in its range and limited in its speed which, at the very outside, is not more than 25 miles per hour.  In fact, I think the average is about 15 miles per hour.  If the taxation of vehicles is based on the damage done to the roads by such vehicles, electrical vehicles do very little damage and I, therefore, think they should be taxed at a much lower rate than ordinary motor vehicles.  I should like to see the Minister extending the concessions given to them above 25 cwt.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would say that I think it is a great pity to impose this very heavy burden of taxation on the motoring industry.  The motor industry as such cannot bear the full cost, or anything like the full cost, of the construction and maintenance of roads in this country.  Even without these additional taxes, it had already to bear a very heavy burden of taxation.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to recast his whole method of taxing motor-cars and to look on the motor industry as being one which, as well as giving a tremendous amount of employment, gives a service to the community. That is something which we think should be encouraged.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>During all the years that the Fianna Fáil Government have been in office they seem to have been obsessed with the unholy desire to increase taxation in every direction possible.  In fact, ever since they took office in 1932 taxation has been increased in all fields year after year. This year, there was an immense increase in taxation as a result of the Budget introduced in April last.  Here <Col N="689" /> we have another increase of almost £1,000,000 by what I may call a Supplementary Budget, even though it is introduced under the name of Financial Resolutions.  In every case where there has been an increase in taxation some section of the community has been affected.  Increased taxation, at any time, will mean for very many people, perhaps for all, an increase in the cost of living.  We can easily relate that to the present taxation which is to be levied on motorists and lorry owners.</P>
      <P>I do not think there are many people, indeed if any, who use a motor-car for what I may call luxury purposes.  The people who own private cars are principally professional men: clergy, doctors and, in fact, all others who require such a method of transport in order that they may carry out their duties with a greater degree of efficiency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us look for a moment at the hackney and taxi owners.  I am sure that in the past all have found it difficult to make ends meet.  The amount of increased taxation that will now fall on them may mean that many of them may become disemployed.  Many of those who purchased a taxi or a hackney car did so on the hire-purchase system, and must have found it extremely difficult to keep their cars on the roads in view of the present heavy road tax, the heavy increase in insurance and the increased taxation on petrol.  When these new taxes come into operation we can well imagine that many of these people will have to go off the roads.  The same will apply to the lorry owners.  We know that very many people who joined the national forces during the emergency and, at the conclusion of it, got a gratuity, invested it in the purchase of lorries.  I am sure that very many of them were misled into doing that when this Government was in office in 1946 and 1947 when they gave the people to understand that the production of turf in all areas in the country was to continue for all time.  In that situation, people purchased lorries for the conveyance of turf and to carry out other types of work such as the drawing of beet.  They purchased the lorries by making a deposit and decided to pay <Col N="690" /> off the balance out of what they earned through their work with the lorries.</P>
    <P>It is a very serious matter for any Government or any authority to increase taxation to such an extent as to interfere with the employment of any individual in the State.  Let us think for a moment of the object that is to be achieved by this increased taxation. The object, as stated by the Minister when introducing the Resolutions, is to increase the Road Fund to such an extent that it will be capable of meeting the financial requirements for the construction and maintenance of roads.  Now, this Government, I think and I believe, was the first to make a raid on the Road Fund.  At various times during their long periods in office, when they wanted to balance their Budgets, they turned to the Road Fund so that it eventually became almost depleted. Instead of bringing forward these Financial Resolutions to increase motor taxation, would it not be more advisable to place a sum from State grants or from the loan that was recently raised or from some Government fund at the disposal of the Road Fund?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  It is not right for any Government to raid a particular fund and allocate it for some purpose other than that for which it was originally intended.  If such raids had not been made on the Road Fund we would now have a sufficient sum for the reconstruction, maintenance and repair of our roads.  Who will pay the increased taxation in so far as the hackneymen and taximen are concerned?  The people who will pay are those who use these services. In remote areas such as those along the western seaboard and in my own <Col N="692" /> territory of South Kerry there are very restricted railway services; indeed, there are no services at all in the greater portion of these areas.  When people have to travel for business purposes, for funerals, for weddings, or for any other purpose they have to hire a taxi or a hackney car to take them to the nearest railway station.  If the hackney driver has to pay increased taxation on his vehicle he will increase his fares.  It is no use the Minister and the Government trying to pass off on the people that these Financial Resolutions were meant to help in the maintenance of our roads in order to reduce local rates, and the Minister and the Government are making a great mistake if they think the people will swallow that.  It is a common experience that when taxation is increased in relation to transport, that increase is immediately passed on to the user.</P>
      <P>In areas where there are no railways and no bus services&mdash;and this is true particularly of South Kerry&mdash;goods are distributed principally by means of lorry.  Increased taxation on these lorries will mean that the consumers of these goods will in future have to pay more for the goods.  The shopkeepers will have to pay more for the carriage of the goods and the shopkeepers will pass on that increase to the purchasers of the goods.  Cattle, sheep and pigs are carried by lorry.  So is agricultural produce.  The buyers of cattle, sheep and pigs will have to pay more for the transport of these animals and that will result in a consequential reduction in the price they will give to the farmer.  The Government may think this taxation is popular simply because it may be put over on a gullible, backward people&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;who will think that the Government has no pity for the owner of the motor-car and the motorist who blows dust in their eyes. But it is these people who will have to pay the increases ultimately.  The ordinary people in the country will have to pay extra for their transport. Those who use hackney cars or taxis <Col N="693" /> will have to do likewise.  Really these Financial Resolutions hit everybody. The standard of living of the people will be reduced because the cost of living will be increased.</P>
      <P>Yesterday Deputy O'Reilly said that horses and carts had been put off the roads by the motorists.  Nobody believes that.  We live in a progressive age and, while the horse and cart is used around the farm, it is no longer used for travelling to fairs, markets, sports meetings or entertainments. People now join together in hiring a car.  These people will have to pay the increased taxation in future and that will hit those engaged in agriculture in particular.  In the area from which I come we have travelling creameries under the aegis of the Dairy Disposals Company for the purpose of bringing milk to the creameries and having it manufactured into butter.  These travelling creameries will now have to pay increased taxation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt that.  It is the producer of the milk who will eventually pay.  It is the farmer who will pay.  Deputy O'Reilly also stated that there was no increase in motor taxation since 1926.  Was there not an increase of 50 per cent. in 1947?  There were two recent increases in the price of petrol.  Indeed, whenever an increase in taxation is necessary everybody seems to think it is a good thing to hit the motorist, the lorry owner and so on.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose the Government will try to claim credit for that but that is due solely to the petrol companies.  It does not matter what the companies do.  Any reduction that is <Col N="694" /> made will not meet the £830,000 odd that the Minister is now putting on the backs of the people.</P>
      <P>This is a most peculiar way of endeavouring to improve the condition of our roads.  The whole system of road repair at present is primitive and the repair of our roads is entirely too costly.  It is impossible for the taxpayer, even with the assistance of the Road Fund, to maintain the roads in proper condition especially in a county like Kerry where we have the highest mileage in proportion to size of any county in the country.  Instead of asking officials to find out what can be done to increase the allocations made for the maintenance of the roads and to find out what extra taxation may be required and how that taxation should be raised, it would be much better if the engineers concerned with the maintenance and upkeep of our roads came together, with the help of any other experts who may be required, and evolved some scheme by which the cost of construction and maintenance might be reduced.  In order to bring some relief to an over-rated county like Kerry&mdash;and possibly this is applicable also to other areas&mdash;there should be some regional council set up to deal solely with the construction, improvement and maintenance of roads.  I have often thought that Kerry, Cork and Limerick should have such a regional council to deal solely with roads.</P>
      <P>I refer to this matter because I hold that there should be other methods, not of raising money, but of reducing the cost of the upkeep of the roads.  Until that is done, any Government which may be in office will always be inclined to take the easy way out, namely, increased taxation.  That is entirely wrong.  In fact, not only in connection with the making and repairing of roads but in connection with the work of other Departments there is a great deal of overlapping and unnecessary expense. But in no Department are there more expensive and more primitive methods, if I may say so, than in connection with the making and maintaining of our roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hold that increased taxation on the lorry owners, the hackneymen, the taximen and even the private motorist <Col N="695" /> will hit or interfere with every member of the community.  It is the ordinary members of the community who will eventually have to pay the extra taxation.  One suggestion I would make to the Minister and the Government or to any future Government is that some steps should be taken by which road construction and maintenance will be altered in such a way that they will be less expensive and carried out with greater efficiency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasBrennan" hpid="Mr. T. Brennan Mr. T. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on taking the necessary steps by introducing this Resolution to show that he is determined as far as possible and as far as it is equitable to provide the necessary moneys, not alone for the upkeep and maintenance of the main roads, but also for the long-needed reconstruction of county roads.  It is admitted by all Deputies, irrespective of Party, that the upkeep of the roads is necessary. Any Deputy who is a member of a local authority, I am sure, is well aware of the incessant demands made over a number of years by organisations in the rural areas, such as local development associations, young farmers' clubs and other types of organisation for the reconstruction of particular roads in their respective districts. These Deputies must be aware that at almost every second meeting of the local authority&mdash;it applies to the local authority of which I am a member&mdash; there are deputations waiting on them in connection with the reconstruction of roads in their area.  The attitude of the members of these local authorities which are composed of different Parties is to guarantee that if the necessary moneys become available they will meet the demand of these deputations.  I cannot understand, therefore, the attitude of some of those Deputies who are members of local authorities in criticising this effort on the part of the Minister to provide the necessary moneys to meet the demands of the community, in general, in connection with the roads.  One would expect that they would show their appreciation of the effort of the Minister, or show to the people I have referred to, by <Col N="696" /> accepting this Resolution, that they are genuinely interested in providing good and proper roads.</P>
      <P>To provide the people with proper county roads would need a very large amount of money.  The Minister has informed us that there are 34,000 miles of county roads which have not been brought into a proper state of repair. If we take the cost of reconstructing a mile of road as something in the region of £4,000 it will require a colossal sum of money from the Government and the ratepayers to put these roads into a condition in which they will be able to carry normal traffic.  In his Resolution the Minister has set himself a figure of somewhere in the region of £850,000.  The point so far as the Minister is concerned is: where are we going to get that money? Can we hope to get those moneys by an increase in rates, by calling on the rate-paying community to pay more towards the cost and upkeep of the roads, a community whose rates have doubled since 1939 and whose rates on roads, speaking of my own county, are very much increased every year?  The unfortunate thing about that act would be that up to the present, at any rate, a very large proportion of the rate-paying community in any county is from the rural areas.  So far as the roads approaching to their respective farms are concerned, they get very little return for the moneys they are compelled to pay by way of rates towards the county roads.</P>
      <P>The amount of money expended on main roads during the last five or six years was colossal and as regards my own county I have no hesitation in saying that the money so expended was well spent.  We have good, first-class roads but the traffic on those roads has increased to an abnormal extent in the same period of time.  In order to keep those main roads, the main arteries between Dublin and all the big provincial towns in the south eastern area, we must still expend quite a large sum in maintenance so that the roads will stand up to that impact of traffic that they are called upon to carry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ratepayers have, up to the <Col N="697" /> present, borne the brunt or at least a large portion of the burden.  I must say that the Department, particularly in the last three years of the Fianna Fáil régime, provided nine-tenths of the amount expended on the main roads by way of reconstruction and otherwise due to the deterioration that has set in on those roads as a result of the emergency.  Nevertheless, the heavy traffic requires an added outlay every year even though those roads have, from the point of view of appearance at any rate, reached a state of perfection.  It is only fair that that type of traffic which is responsible for the wear and tear of the roads should bear its share of the upkeep and maintenance of the roads so that the particular business carried on by the users of those heavy vehicles may still be carried on in safety by having roads up to the standard.</P>
    <P>In relation to county roads I am glad to see this effort on the part of the Minister whereby he has taken steps, in conjunction with the local authority, to provide moneys so that county roads will be reconstructed to an adequate standard, thereby giving to that element of the rate-paying community some little return for the amount of money they have been paying, down through the years, into the coffers, through the rates of the local county councils without getting any return from that source.  I am glad, as I said, that the Minister has that in view.  Speaking personally, I have had a feeling for quite a number of years that that element of the rate-paying community in rural areas were the most patient people in the country, and any effort to relieve them or give them amenities by way of decent roads would always have my support and, I am sure, the support of every man who believes in an equitable position as between man and man.</P>
    <P>As I have already stated, what I cannot understand is the attitude towards this Resolution taken up by the Opposition, of all Parties, and in particular the attitude of and the criticism applied by members of the Labour Party, some of whom are members of local bodies knowing the <Col N="698" /> position and knowing the demands that are made from time to time on the county councils&mdash;individuals who themselves, or through their representatives on the county councils, are constantly, or at least annually, making application to the local authority for increased wages for the road workers.</P>
    <P>How do they expect that the money necessary for the execution of certain work on the roads will be found if it is not provided by a method such as is being adopted under this Resolution? When they consider it their duty to draw the attention of the local authority to unemployment in a particular district and to demand that employment be given, how can they hope that the money to provide that employment can be found if it is not made available by a method such as that adopted in the Financial Resolution? The criticism of this Resolution that has been expressed by Labour representatives is criticism of an effort on the part of the Minister to provide moneys to meet the demands of local people and of Labour representatives on local authorities for increased wages or increased employment, and, in my opinion, is hypocritical.</P>
    <P>This is an effort on the part of the Minister to provide the rural community with roads that will be passable and safe.  Whatever may be said here by those who claim to represent the farming community, I am sure that this effort on the part of the Minister will be welcomed by the farming community.</P>

      <P>I wonder at the poor attempt made by Fianna Fáil to defend this tax.  Their one cry is that we want bigger and better roads.  To my mind, this tax is the direct result of the cowardice of Fianna Fáil 16 years ago. If they had been manly, they would have stood up to the problems at that time.  They did not do it.  This tax is the direct result of the muddle in transport that has been allowed to remain over all those years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a double purpose in this taxation.  The first purpose is to get money.  That has always been the cry of Fianna Fáil.  Secondly, they are attempting, by taxation, to force <Col N="699" /> people off the roads so that they can give a monopoly to a big transport system.  The muddle has been allowed to develop to such an extent that it is very difficult to deal with the position now.  If Fianna Fáil had tackled our rail and road problems 16 years ago we would not be in the plight that we are in to-day.  They allowed transport enterprises of all types to grow up. Private lorries and private vans were being operated all over the country. They served the people well.  Of course, that means nothing to Fianna Fáil.  They want money and it is easy to get money by taxing the people in respect of their cars and vans out of which they make a livelihood.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, it is a national scandal and disgrace to tax people out of their way of living.  It is typical of Fianna Fáil.  They must sell the small man all the time.  They shout: &ldquo;We want bigger and better roads.&rdquo;  For whom do they want them?  They want them for the monopolists, the carefree, the moneyed class, the men with the big vans, the men with the Chryslers. The small man who has built up a way of living over the past 16 years must sell his van, must give up paying instalments on his van and must close his doors.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil stands for the big man, the moneyed class.  Rural Ireland must suffer decay and we must keep the emigrant ship going for the plain simple Irish.  They want to crush out to-day the men who served this country.  These men brought turf from Cork to Dublin when Dublin was famishing and crying out for fuel.  It was not the big monopoly, the railway, that performed that service.  These men are not wanted now.  Coal is coming in.</P>
    <P>All the talk about the Road Fund is the greatest bunkum and nonsense. The Minister tells us that the Road Fund will not be raided.  He forgets about the man called Minister Johnny MacEntee, who will raid the Road Fund&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance, yes.  There should be the strongest protest from Deputies, even those on the Government side, and from the people, against this taxation. It will upset rural life.  Rural life should not be upset.  Business has been carried on over the last four or five years by private transport.  Córas Iompair Éireann did not serve the farmers' interests.  Private enterprise was employed in transporting cattle, sheep, pigs and poultry.  That enterprise should be protected, instead of being stabbed in the back.  For 30 years we have had native Government. Now we see the small trader being taxed out of existence.  He has no alternative but the emigrant ship, which means breaking up family life, the most precious thing we have got. That is happening to thousands of small men, farmers' sons and men in cottages.  It is disgraceful that an Irish Government would not think twice before putting on taxes like that.  We have taxes on petrol, on oils, on driving licences, on tractors and cars.  Where are we going to stop?  The farmer is carrying the nation on his back, but Fianna Fáil is making sure the farmer is well loaded even before he starts to carry the nation on his back.  He is doing it morning, noon and night and it is time he got some relief.  We should see that there is fair play and stop these grinding taxes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hear Fianna Fáil tell us the main roads must be made bigger and better. What the devil do we want them for? Our roads are better than most roads in Europe.  Talk to men from the Argentine, from Spain or Australia and ask them how they like the old country. What is the first thing they say? I have met scores of them&mdash;it is: &ldquo;How did you ever get these grand roads, I have never met the like of them before.&rdquo;  Our main roads are the best in Europe&mdash;except, perhaps, those of Germany.  For this little country our mighty main roads are far too good. The by-roads and secondary roads are a public disgrace, because of the Government manipulation of the road grants.  We on the county councils have been crying for the last 20 years for <Col N="701" /> justice for the secondary roads, but we have never got it.  The Department of Local Government turns us down every time.  We want the same grant for secondary roads as for main roads.</P>

      <P>We will not get the money because the secondary roads are the roads where the small farmers live, the men who carry on the life of the country.  They must get secondary consideration. I say that you need none of those taxes if you give the county councils power to do the secondary roads as they do the main roads and give them the same grant for each, instead of spending all the money on the main roads.  We on the county councils must keep spending our money on the main roads, otherwise we will not get the big grants.  There is only a small, insignificant grant for secondary and by-roads, so we are forced to spend the taxpayers' money on the main roads.  I know main roads in my county which have been done up like skating rinks, for no other purpose than to collar a Government grant.  Keep on the main roads and the Government will pump the money in&mdash;because the Government stands and serves the moneyed classes.</P>
      <P>If the Government of the day 15 or 20 years ago had done its duty when the roads were being put in a serviceable condition, they would have made sure that no lorry or haulage vehicle carrying over five tons was allowed to use them.  If that were done, would not the railways be humming to-day?  They allowed these giants and monsters which should never be on the roads. Even to-day I would ask the Government to put a time limit on these monsters so that, after two years, no lorry carrying more than five tons would be allowed on any Irish road.  That would give them time to get out, instead of striking them overnight.  It could have been done 15 or 20 years ago.  If it were not for the meanness of an Irish Government, looking for cheap support and cheap votes, it would have been done.  If we had a dictator for one year, do you mean to tell me he would not do it?</P>

We know it is floundering because no one has made an honest attempt to solve the problem&mdash;they did not want to, because there were too many votes involved.  But they will keep muddling and interfering with the ordinary little man who is carrying on the country. We have bread van drivers and fleets of lorries going from door to door, serving the people well and indispensable to rural Ireland.  These taxes will put them off the roads and I say that is an un-Irish thing to do.  We have the small men who serve the farmers every week by their lorries&mdash;they bring the cattle and pigs to the fairs, they bring the sheep to the market and they are able to make a living doing it, asking nobody for anything.  The Government wants to put them out of the way and give it all to one big monopoly. We know what that monopoly would do and what trade unionism will do&mdash; aye, perhaps led by Deputy Dunne and those who believe in him.  If we give this monopoly, it will mean handing over to trade unionism the life and death of this country.  It will be at their beck and call and they can hold the country up to ransom.  If a man is dismissed&mdash;perhaps rightly so&mdash;the whole nation may be held up for a fortnight, with strikes week after week, because of the monopoly.

      <P>I am satisfied that there is no need whatsoever for these taxes to bolster up the Road Fund. Fianna Fáil, however, wants to keep on putting bigger and bigger taxes on the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The driving licences are to go up by the insignificant sum, we are told, <Col N="703" /> of 10/-.  It is said that that means nothing.  It is 100 per cent. tax.  The ordinary family private car is not driven by one man but by four, five or six of the family unit.  That means each has to pay 10/- extra and it means £3 or £4 more in a year.  That is a crushing tax and an unjust one.  I could understand an increase from 10/- to 12/6 but an increase to £1 is too much.  A few years ago a similar thing happened, when gun licences were driven up to £2 5s., to provide another tax for the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, but it is useful to make the comparison.  We are increasing the tax on the farmer's tractor&mdash;instead of £5 he must pay £8 &mdash;yet he still has to produce the food for the people.  Why not have a flat rate of tax for small cars and make up the difference in petrol and oil taxes, so that the more you drive the more you pay?  These taxes are driving the farmers off the roads.  We saw them with the ass and cart, then we saw them with the pony and trap, and, thanks be to God, we now see them driving their own motor-cars.  They will not be doing so very long if Fianna Fáil get a chance.  They want to take the car from under the farmer &mdash;&ldquo;He is too well-off, the old red hat, and we will crush him down.&rdquo;  They say: &ldquo;Why should he have a car?&rdquo; but I say that he is as entitled to it as anyone else and more power to him if he has a car and I hope he will be able to keep it.  Fianna Fáil say the farmer is a simple old fool; they want to keep him poor and ground down, saying that he will do twice as much work.  They want to continue that old slavish way.  That is Fianna Fáil for you, and always was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to stop spending all this money on the high roads.  The secondary roads should be given a chance.  The Minister for Local Government should give the same grant to the secondary roads and put them into the condition they ought <Col N="704" /> to be in.  That will not happen. To-day is a day of speed.  If you saw a car coming into Dublin at 30 miles an hour 30 years ago you would say you were crazy.  At the present day one can see Chryslers coming into Dublin at 70 miles an hour.  Does one see an Irish face in one of them?  Not at all.  You would not find in one of them a person who would do a day's work.  Yet these are the kind of people who must be served but the farmer in his third-rate car must be kept to the side roads.  That is not what we fought and suffered for.  We fought for the little men in the hills and bogs, the men whose sons and daughters should be called back from Britain to work in Ireland.  Fianna Fáil do not stand for that.  They stand for the big man.  The day will come when we will curse that kind of legislation in this country.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to withdraw these taxes and come to the assistance of the little man.  He should not try to serve the spivs who will not live in the country or the idle rich who will invest money everywhere but in Ireland.  The Government is trying to crush out the little man who has his private motor-car.  They are preventing the farmers from being served by the man who is doing trojan work to-day, and the curse of Ireland will come on the Government if they do that.  Members of large families will have to trek to other lands if those taxes are imposed.  They will have to trek to other lands in order to earn a living and send home a few pounds. These taxes will destroy family life and the Minister knows it.  Instead of having those people emigrating they should be looked after and encouraged to stay at home and live in their own land.</P>
    <P>Private enterprise is the life of this country and it should not be killed.  If private enterprise is killed what is intended to be put in its place&mdash;Córas Iompair Éireann?  Córas Iompair Éireann will not take its place.  It never will.  It is 20 years floundering and is still floundering.  Bread-van drivers and the others to whom I have referred have served the people.  They <Col N="705" /> have given rural Ireland what it needs &mdash;real, good, national service.  I would ask the Minister not to curtail that service.  If he does so he will do a great deal of harm to this country. The little man has done great work for Ireland.  It is for him that we fought and suffered.</P>

      <P>There is no harm in saying it too often and I wish others would say it in this House.  I would ask the Minister to withdraw these taxes and give the simple countrymen a chance in their own country, where they are fully entitled to live, to ply their own trade, keep their own vans, cars and little shops.  By imposing the taxes it is proposed to impose you are damning the people of this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that for those of us speaking at the close of this debate there is hardly anything we can say that has not already been said.  It is not my purpose to repeat arguments that have been advanced <i>ad nauseam</i> over the past three or four days.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether the pleas which have been made to the Minister in regard to the imposition of these extra taxes will have any effect. Deputy Corish adverted to the fact that many of the Minister's own Party had endeavoured to exercise upon him some pressure to give consideration, particularly in regard to the proposed imposition of these taxes upon taximen and taxis.</P>
      <P>In the City of Dublin there is approximately 450 taxis plying for hire. It could be safely said that any steps which are taken to make the living costs of these men higher will affect anything up to 1,000 people when you take their families into consideration. I have no doubt whatsoever but that the proposed increase in tax will put many men in this city completely off the road and will probably have the same effect in other parts of the country, particularly in relation to hackneys and, to some extent, in relation to taxis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="706" /> In view of this fact, is it good economics for any Government to take the step it is proposed to take?  I do not believe it is, and I join with others in appealing to the Minister, even at this stage, to reconsider the whole matter and try to arrive at a more equitable rate of tax to be imposed on the taxis of this country.  I have no doubt but that my appeal, or the appeal made by the members of the Minister's own Party, will not have any effect.  Nevertheless, I make the appeal.</P>
    <P>The organisation representing the taxi owners has suggested that there should be a flat tax of £20 in respect of all the larger types of vehicles.  That seems to me to be reasonable enough. If that suggestion were adopted by the Minister, it does not seem to me that the Exchequer would lose any great amount.</P>
    <P>I am concerned also with one inevitable development in consequence of the proposed taxes.  One result would be that the costs of Córas Iompair Éireann would take a jump as a result of these taxes.  The increased cost of that concern will inevitably be passed on to the travelling public and the ordinary working-class people of the City and County of Dublin.  It is from that point of view that I think the matter is of very serious import. The population of the City and County of Dublin, almost 750,000 human beings, are facing quite enough difficulties as it is trying to live without having to face what appear, as I say, to be inevitably higher charges in relation to their travel.</P>
    <P>There are many thousands of city workers living in the suburbs and in the County of Dublin.  They find their employment in the city and must necessarily travel to and from their employment every day.  Any increase in the fares which those people will have to pay must inevitably impose a very considerable burden upon them. That is a step which should not be taken by the Government in present circumstances, particularly bearing in mind the quite recent very high increase in the cost of living which these city people and suburban dwellers have had to meet in probably greater <Col N="707" /> degree than the people who live in rural areas.  The people in rural areas can, perhaps, get certain necessaries of life at a lower price than the people who live in the city.</P>
    <P>The Road Fund has been the subject of discussion.  The Minister said that he proposes to devote the maximum he can from the Exchequer to the Road Fund.  In fact, he proposes to devote the entire collection the Exchequer will make of this tax to the Road Fund. There was criticism of the previous Government's cutting of the road grants.  I and others in this House remember the political racket that developed when the Road Fund grants were cut.  It was based upon the allegation that the then Government had one design, the reduction of employment of county council workers throughout the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>It was referred to by previous speakers and there did not seem to be any objection to their referring to it at the time.  I simply want to make the point that, in the event, there was not that immense unemployment which is perfectly obvious now and that that campaign was no more than political blackmail and political misrepresentation.  It is essential that the roads should be well looked after, but more money was spent during the period of office of the previous Government upon the improvement and maintenance of county roads than at any previous time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the information I have&mdash;that more money was spent then than at any time previously.  All Deputies at all times are at pains to appeal to the Government of the day to improve the county roads particularly, and, while doing what they can with main roads, to give particular attention to the county roads.  In my county we have been successful in maintaining our county roads at a very high standard, but it is quite obvious <Col N="708" /> to anybody travelling through the country that the county roads are in great need of attention, and in any future decisions the Government have to make, they should come down heavily upon the side of making greater provision for county than for main roads, although I appreciate that you will find counties where the main roads are in a deplorable state.</P>
      <P>When we talk of the principle of imposing taxation upon the users of the roads, it should be realised that more people use the roads than merely those who travel in motor cars. Everybody must necessarily use the roads, and, while Deputies representing the farming interests particularly have deplored the fact that farmers have had to contribute to the upkeep of the roads, it should be remembered that farmers use the roads as much as anybody else.  I do not subscribe entirely to the idea that it is the heavy lorries which have reduced the roads to their present condition.  It is impossible to say that any particular class of the community have been responsible for that development, and therefore I do not think it is entirely fair that the entire cost of the upkeep and maintenance of these roads should be imposed upon motorists.  The cost should be levied proportionately all over the community who use these roads.  All this has probably been said before and I do not want to weary the House by repeating it.  I simply want to say that I support the pleas made to the Minister particularly in relation to the imposition of this tax on taximen and hackney owners.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesOGorman" hpid="Mr. O'Gorman Mr. O'Gorman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Gorman</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not a whole lot that any Deputy can bring into the discussion at this stage because over the past few days every avenue has more or less been explored.  I am wondering whether the Minister is really so impervious to argument that he will not pay any heed to the requests made to him, particularly by Deputies from the Opposition side.  I look upon this proposal as a very serious matter for the people and I believe that this heavy imposition will have a very bad effect from many points of view.  Every one of us realises that, as a result of the Budget <Col N="709" /> introduced in May last, the cost of very many essentials has risen to a point which the ordinary man in the street finds it very difficult to reach. Over the past few months, the heavy imposts of that Budget have been felt very keenly and I do not think that any unbiased Deputy will disagree with me when I say that.  The further taxes to be imposed under these Resolutions are bound to fall heavily on many classes of the people.</P>
      <P>As we all know, business in Ireland nowadays is different from what it was 25 or 30 years ago.  In those days, people living three, five and ten miles away came into the various towns and villages for their foodstuffs and other necessary commodities. The market day, as many of us who live in rural Ireland must realise, has more or less disappeared.  The day of the market day is gone, and in the competitive world in which we live to-day, the people in rural areas, instead of coming to the town for their supplies, expect the people in the towns to carry to their doors the commodities they want and competition is so keen that, if you wish to make a living, you must do it.  Every Deputy knows as well as I know that every day eight, ten and 12 vans leave the towns with the requirements of the people of the rural areas.</P>
      <P>I said here on a few occasions already that I visualise for the towns and the cities a rather ominous future and it is being made more ominous and dark for the people living in the towns by the taxes which they are now being asked to bear.  Everything is competitive in this world to-day and, as we get older, we realise that it is getting harder for people to live and that over the past 12 months it has been made far more difficult for every one of us to make a living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many points of view which one must look to in discussing this Resolution.  It is hitting everybody. Like other Deputies I have received the various pamphlets issued by people who feel that a grave wrong and injustice is being done to them by the severity of these taxes.  There are many men in my own locality&mdash;sons of small farmers and cottiers&mdash;who over <Col N="710" /> the past eight or ten years, and particularly during the war, through hard work&mdash;and I mean genuine hard work &mdash;accumulated a certain amount of money in the region of £300, £400 or £500.  During the war, when the ordinary distributor of lorries saw that these were good, hardworking fellows and that no risk would be involved in giving them lorries on hire-purchase, they took their chance and gave them to those men.  The future for them at that time was bright.  I do not think that any Deputy can disagree that as a result of the severity of these taxes their future will be less bright.  Take the ordinary man down the country who paid £1,000 or £1,200 for a lorry. If my memory serves me correctly the usual lorry is four or five tons net weight.  The present rate of tax on those lorries is from £75 to £90, and now it will rise to a sum between £112 and £225.</P>

I would hate to think that men were put out of business by the severe taxes we impose on their means of livelihood.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Exchequer is bound to receive a considerable amount of money from road taxes and the tax on petrol. Judging by the pamphlet on the White Paper, in 1939 the number of private cars in Ireland was 52,401 and in 1951 the number of cars on the road had risen to 96,714.  It is particularly significant, too, that in 1939 the number of goods vehicles&mdash;I suppose you could put in that category the vans that deliver necessaries throughout the country to the people of rural Ireland&mdash; was 10,741 and it had risen in 1951 to 26,721.  It is also very significant that this will come down very heavily on the people who bought tractors and agricultural vehicles, because in 1939 the number was 1,422 and in 1951 it was 14,569.  It is the same with the smaller categories.  The number of public service vehicles rose from 5,120 in 1939 to 8,214 in 1951, and the number of motor-cycles, etc., also rose.  The <Col N="712" /> Exchequer must benefit from the taxes on these vehicles.</P>
    <P>Another damaging blow to the country was the fact that the tax on petrol has been increased during the past 12 months by 33 per cent.  Where is the money from all these things going? Surely the Exchequer should have benefited sufficiently as a result of those sums pouring into it from the tax on petrol and the tax on cars, the number of which has jumped up so considerably.  I do not know exactly what it is, but the petrol duty was increased this year by approximately 33 per cent., the tax on commercial vehicles was increased by 15 per cent., and insurance is threatened to rise by 15 to 20 per cent.  That is serious for the people of the country and will have a very damaging effect.  I was glad to hear the Minister reply to a question put by another Deputy a while ago.  I have been a believer that what the users of motor-cars pay into the Exchequer should be given back to them by means of better roads and should not be put into other channels. I dislike very much the raids which were made on the Road Fund on numerous occasions over many years past.  The cost of motor-car licences, which has also been increased by 100 per cent, and the tax on petrol, which costs 3/10½, should be put into a fund for the benefit of the people who pay them.  I hope and trust that these raids which we have had for many years, not for two or three years but for 20 years, will cease.</P>
    <P>I have covered the categories of lorries, and now I come to hackney cars.  I know many men in the South of Ireland who served in the Army during the emergency.  When they came out, finding themselves without any avenue to explore for a decent livelihood, they used their gratuities and any little sums of money they had put aside to purchase hackney cars.  These men will be hard hit and every Deputy in this House realises that as well as I do. They will be hit very hard and I believe that many of them will be put off the road.</P>
    <P>I do not want to keep the House too long but I would like to know when <Col N="713" /> this heaping of taxes is going to cease. There is not a week or a month that we come into this House but something happens to make life harder for everybody. I think we have had enough of it for the last few years.  I do not want to make any political capital out of this but the existence of all of us has been made harder particularly over the last 12 months.  I am not one of those who say what this Party should have done or what that Party should have done but I think it is the bounden duty of everyone in this House to do our best for the people who sent us here. We should speak out genuinely and sincerely the contents of our minds without thinking whether we are going to win or lose a few votes.  Many of us, if we left this House to-morrow morning, would hope to leave it honourably and decently, not promising what we are incapable of fulfilling and not bidding up or bidding down, fearing that we might lose the support of somebody outside.  Some of us are in the position, thank God, that if we do go out we shall not find ourselves in the poorhouse.</P>
    <P>Many points have been made during the course of this debate.  I do not intend to advert at length to Córas Iompair Éireann.  As Deputy Dunne has said, it has been discussed <i>ad nauseam.</i>  I said to the Minister for Industry and Commerce some time ago, when speaking on the Estimate for his Department, that the problem of Córas Iompair Éireann was extremely difficult. It is even more difficult now because Córas Iompair Éireann is bound to suffer further impositions as a result of this Financial Resolution. Those of us who have occasion to travel throughout the country cannot but notice the difference between conditions as they exist to-day and the conditions which obtained 12 months or two years ago.  Take, for instance, the bus route between Youghal and Cork. Twelve months or two years ago the buses travelling on that route and, in fact, on other routes too&mdash;used to be full of passengers, but nowadays all one sees are four or five passengers or half a dozen at the most.  People nowadays just cannot afford to travel.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Gorman</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is so, then it is a further instance of the progress which was made during the three years of inter-Party Government.  That Government helped people so much that they have cars of their own now. Before I was interrupted, I was pointing out the great difference which exists in the number of people who use the buses nowadays as compared with the number of people who used them 12 months or two years ago.  The same difference is to be noted on the railways. Most of us have occasion to travel by train to Dublin from time to time and I can assure the House that nowadays the trains travelling between Cork and Dublin are half empty.</P>
      <P>The present bus fares are so high that the ordinary person finds it well-nigh impossible to pay them and that is the reason why fewer people are travelling by bus.  Perhaps that, in its own way, is a good thing for the country towns because it compels the people to shop in their own areas.  However, in general, this Resolution, if implemented, will have very heavy repercussions on Córas Iompair Éireann.</P>
      <P>I trust that the Minister will give careful attention to what every Deputy has said in this debate.  This is a serious matter for us all.  I think that the Minister is not impervious to the arguments which have been made and I sincerely hope that he will see his way to amend the terms of this Financial Resolution.  May I express the wish that this Financial Resolution will be punctured&mdash;that is a word which, I think, is applicable in this instance&mdash;by the vote of the House? If it is not, then, genuinely and sincerely, I believe that the livelihood of many people who depend on motoring and on the use of motor vehicles for their living will be punctured forever.</P>

      <P>As was remarked in the course of Deputy O'Gorman's speech, it is a problem of finding the money.  A question arises in a more narrow way which has already arisen on the general financial proposals for this year.  We should not lose sight of the fact that the particular proposals under review now are part of the over-all <Col N="715" /> financial scheme to set the monetary affairs of the State on a proper footing.  As the White Paper recalls, this was mentioned and foreseen and actually planned and published in all but detail at the time of the Budget. Just as in the case of these general revisions which we have already discussed, the following problem arises. There are certain commitments to be met.  If they are to be met the money must be found.  The choice is either to forgo something that has to be done or else to find the money.  When we discussed this before there was the usual easy criticism.  I am not blaming the Opposition at all for taking their easily found ammunition, if you like to put it that way&mdash;perhaps it is their function, anyway, to do it.  However, in taking it up, this question is posed for the Opposition: What will you cut? Where do you suggest we should cut in capital services, current services, development or anything else?  Not one proposal was put forward to suggest that these things proposed should not be done.</P>
      <P>It might appear that I am expanding into the general but I am not; the same thing applies here.  Are we or are we not going to maintain the roads and with them our mechanical transport, quite apart at the moment from the Córas Iompair Éireann organised transport and all that goes with it? Remember, that to the motorist, to the user of the road commercially, the roads are as big a factor as the vehicle. Without adequate roads the development of motor transport, based on the internal combustion engine in modern times, could not have been achieved. That can also be said in regard to the pneumatic tyre.  These are as essential a service for transport as the permanent way is for a railway system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first question that arises is this: Are we or are we not going to have the roads and the network of roads that a modern transport system requires? Deputy Giles suggested that we should not.  He says that we do not want the roads.  I can understand his argument but what I cannot understand is the attitude of people who say: &ldquo;We want the roads.  We want <Col N="716" /> advanced development.  We want this expansion,&rdquo; and who at the same time, try to say that we should not get the money.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that in a moment: I want to deal with the broad aspect of the matter first.  I am sorry that Deputy O'Gorman is not here because he would understand the point I am going to make now and, I may say, I am making this point in perfectly good heart.  It struck me that it was the hard, down-to-earth question in relation to Youghal Bridge&mdash;a matter which affects his own constituency&mdash;that made Deputy O'Gorman see the point immediately when Deputy McGrath mentioned it. Deputy O'Gorman wants Youghal Bridge repaired or the matter attended to.  As any man of common sense would realise, he realised that in order to have Youghal Bridge attended to money would be required and that someone would have to find it.  It is a concrete example but the same principle applies over-all.</P>
      <P>It seems to me to be a waste of the time of this House and a betrayal in a sense of our own trust, as supposedly representative members of the community here, to give in to the temptation to talk all that sympathetic type of talk about crushing somebody, taxing the poor man, and so forth, when we do not relate such things to the reality of the situation. Admitting all that, the question arises: Are we going to have the roads or are we going to save the money? If we save the money and take off these taxes, as the Opposition would have us do, is the motoring community ultimately going to be satisfied with the roads?  At the moment I am taking this question in sections: the question of employment and so forth will come up later.  If we save the money and let the roads deteriorate, will that be good for the motorist, for the community, and particularly for the motorist for whom so much is being said to-day&mdash;the motorist who uses his vehicle for purposes of business?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="717" /> The Opposition cannot have it both ways.  The Opposition have been talking about vehicles and seem to be a little bit sensitive to the fact that a lot of motoring might be described as in the semi-luxury class, as has been suggested by certain speakers, or in the category of leisure.  They have been very careful to talk about people who are earning a living through mechanical transport.  Very good.  It is just these very people who want good roads.  It is just those very people who want a good network to open up all the potentialities of the country to their transport.  To anybody else it does not matter so much. If I am out for a Sunday drive, merely taking the air, and if I have to avoid a certain road because of its condition, it will not incommode me very much but if I am a businessman, dependent on my vehicle for the transport of goods, it is very important that I have an adequate choice of routes and that the roads along these routes are adequately good.  Remember, a deterioration in the condition of the roads can hit that particular type of person a good deal more than has been admitted in this debate.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, the cost of wear and tear of a vehicle goes up if the roads are not in good condition.  Very many of us can remember the early days when cars first came on the roads. I shall take this opportunity to pay a tribute to a vehicle that I think will be remembered with gratitude, in this country, anyway, the old model T Ford, which was the only motor vehicle that would stand up to some of the roads at that time.  Offhand, I can go back to 1926, and I can think of a stretch of the road between two towns on the way from here to Limerick that was practically impassable and could only be negotiated at about ten miles an hour.  That meant considerable rerouting.  I can remember the frequent punctures which one encountered and the wear of tyres.  We have less of them nowadays and, although there has been a great improvement in the standard of vehicles and the quality of tyres in recent years, I think I can say that the infrequency of punctures and similar troubles is not completely <Col N="718" /> attributable to improvements in the vehicles or in the tyres.  The improvement in the quality of the road surface, I should imagine, is almost as big a factor.  These breakdowns not only meant repair costs, but they meant loss of time and loss of efficiency.</P>
    <P>It is all right to suggest that we might allow deterioration of a particular road for one year and to say that if it is attended to then, it will not be too bad.  I grant you that, but if you allow that deterioration to drift on&mdash; and, goodness knows, we have had enough experience of drift in recent years&mdash;you are going to land yourself in a pretty kettle of fish at the end of the period.  We know that during the emergency, for instance, because of certain other demands on available labour and other circumstances, there was a certain inability to repair roads.  We know the condition into which the roads fell in these circumstances and the cost of putting them into repair afterwards. I think everybody will admit, if we are not to be faced by some enormous expenditure later, that we have got to maintain the condition of the roads.  I think everybody will admit that, as a general policy, the right line is to have a gradual plan, a set programme, development and then maintenance of that development, rather than going sharply to the crest and then letting things deteriorate, pulling up with a jerk again.  It is surely wasteful and bad business to approach it in that way.</P>
    <P>I have laboured that, but the point I want to make, and let us be very clear about it is: Do we want good roads?  If we want good roads, we will have to pay for them.  We then come to the question of the methods of paying. How many times have we had questions in this House about roads? How often has the point been made of the great importance it is to a local community to have an adequate local road service dovetailed into the main road?  As a city Deputy, I had not a particularly active interest in these questions, but I have noticed, as long as I have been in this House, the frequency of that type of question.  It is obvious that good roads are a benefit to the community, both locally and over-all.  Very good.  We then come <Col N="719" /> to the question of finance.  I am assuming that my friends on the opposite side will at least admit that if you want good roads it means money.  The question is where are we to find it.  To develop and maintain the condition of the roads requires money.  Whatever administrative body is actually going to supervise that job, the money will have to be found.  It can be supplied through the agency of the Central Government, it can be supplied locally, through the local government organisation, or it can be supplied by a combination of both agencies.  There are several possibilities and these are the mechanisms with which we are concerned.</P>
    <P>If the Government is going to supply the money, the Government has got to get the money, and the only way the Government can get the money is by the expedients open to them&mdash;borrowing, taxation and so forth.  This Government has been forced as the result of three years' drift&mdash;and the situation in the country was allowed to drift during these three years&mdash;to fall back on all the expedients available to them to raise money.  If the money is not to come from that source, it has to come from the rates.  In other words, the local body has to raise the money, and the only way they can do it is through the rates.  That we want a good road system I do not think any member of the Opposition will deny, with the possible exception of Deputy Giles, who told us: &ldquo;Do not worry about the roads.  They are only used by the big fellow.&rdquo;  I do not think the Deputy was really serious in that statement.  I think the Opposition, if nailed to it, would have to admit that we need roads.  Very good. They come in here to-day&mdash;many of them are members of local authorities &mdash;and they tell the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Local Government: &ldquo;Do not collect this money.&rdquo;  At the same time, they want roads as much as anybody else.  I should be very much surprised, if a proposition were brought before this House to curtail road development or to do as was done by their Government&mdash;to cut road grants and so forth &mdash;if we would not hear a howl from <Col N="720" /> them that would reverberate over the whole country.  Let these members of local authorities ask themselves this question.  They want roads.  In fact, I should be surprised if they did not make it a point of their local programme to say: &ldquo;We are going to have more roads and more employment on the roads.&rdquo;  There is one particular section that I know would come out very strongly on that line.</P>
    <P>I ask the Deputies opposite to face the facts.  If the money has to be found, you are asking your local ratepayers to find it.  All right.  It is an arguable proposition.  Are you going to ask the local ratepayers to raise the money completely for this purpose?  Deputy Giles talked about the farmers. Remember, the farmers are very substantial ratepayers.  I think that when the Deputies opposite do face the facts there will be no question of throwing the whole burden on the rates.  The roads are a national concern and there will be no question of throwing the burden clean back on the local authorities in that way.  The rates are up already and have been rising for years, and to stimulate a further increase in that way would certainly not be justified, particularly when the mechanics of balance are more readily available to the Central Government than they are to the local authorities.  In the case of the local authorities, you could easily get discrepancies as between county and county and area and area so that it is much easier for the Central Government to keep a proper balance.</P>
    <P>We reach the position therefore that we cannot ask the rates to bear the burden completely.  We then have to fall back on the Minister.  At this stage, I think it is fair to ask what generally would be a fair approach to this.  I know that in principle you could crystallise this into far too rigid a form that would admit of various answers, but I suggest that, in broad terms it is an equitable and a reasonable proposition to-day that we will collect this money from the road users, from the people who are getting the immediate benefit, and that the other economic adjustments will work themselves out.  Further, it is a reasonably <Col N="721" /> general proposition, which I have never heard assailed in principle, to say that the Road Fund should be a special fund&mdash;that it would be just as well to maintain that fund and introduce some kind of order into your general finances.  That is all the Minister is trying to do&mdash;trying to get money for the roads, and trying to get it in what has been more or less the accepted way. If the money has to be got, and it seems the money has to be got, that is the unfortunate and unpopular fact of the situation.  It is one of the facts of life, just a necessity in life that has been there ever since the days of Adam, that if you want something you have to pay for it&mdash;to work for it.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Gorman spoke about raids on the Road Fund.  Here we are up against a type of juggling that was brought into our finances by the Coalition playing around with them and in the meantime letting things drift.  I turn up an instance of it here and it is no harm to give it.  I do not want to do this in the same spirit as Deputy O'Gorman, but we get from it an instructive lesson.  I refer to Volume 110 of the Dáil Debates, column 1048, which contains the first Financial Statement by the then Minister for Finance in the Coalition Government. It is worth reading this paragraph from it:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The additional motor vehicle duties imposed by the Supplementary Budget are expected to yield £300,000 this year as compared with £200,000 last year.  Provision will be made in the Finance Bill for the transfer of the former sum to the Exchequer from the Road Fund.</P>
    <P>The customs duties on motor spirits (mineral hydrocarbon light oil) and on propellants such as diesel oil (hydrocarbon oil, other sorts) were reduced from 1/3 to 9d. per gallon as from 1st June, 1946, with reductions in the excise duties on home refined oils from 1/1 to 7d. The amount of petrol retained for home use has risen from 18,000,000 gallons in the year 1945-6 to 31,500,000 in 1946-7 and to nearly 38,500,000 in 1947-8.  This is almost equivalent to the figures for 1938-9. Hydrocarbon oil (other sorts) has risen from 600,000 gallons pre-war to <Col N="722" /> 2,400,000 for 1947-8.  The number of new private cars registered for the first time in 1947 was 8,294, nearly three times as many as in the previous year, and this in spite of enhanced prices.  In a time of financial stringency such as the present, it seems not unreasonable to look to petrol and oil as a proper source of additional revenue.  I have also in mind the fact that petrol entails dollar expenditure.  I propose, therefore, to raise the customs duty of 9d. per gallon to 1/2 in each case, with an increase to 1/- in the case of the excise duties.  The additional yield of tax for the current financial year is estimated at £910,000.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have read the whole paragraph so as to avoid the possible accusation that I was taking bits of it.  In that quotation we find the case made that we should take money specifically from the road users, over and above other people, for general purposes. Where do the Opposition stand now? Let us face the fact that they said then it is only fair in times of financial stringency not only to take money from the road users, but to transfer it to the general account for the benefit of everybody else.  In other words, that it was fair to do that in the case of a specific tax on road users.  To-day, they come in here and tell us the exact opposite, the implication in their words being that somebody else will subsidise the road users.  The two points of view are completely contradictory, and I think I am justified in drawing attention to that.  Not only, as I say, was the money collected on the lines set out in the quotation which I have given, but the same policy was carried out in the following year, as Deputies may see by referring to Volume 115, column 484.  Not only was the money collected in that way, but it was transferred over to the general account, and on top of that there was a cut in road grants. Everybody knows that the road grants were actually cut, and although I do not want to press the point unduly there was a certain deterioration in the condition of the roads as a result&mdash; and a certain employment problem. The witness to that fact is that the question was fully debated on a <Col N="723" /> special motion in this House in February, 1949.  Actually, there was a reduction in the road grants, so that you had the two things: (1) a raid on the Road Fund and (2) a reduction in the road grants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Now the Deputy wants to go into all the lame apologies that were given at that time.  There were certain other adjustments.  If the Deputy wants the information, Deputy Childers gave it very fully at that time. So did other Deputies, including Deputy Murphy, then Minister for Local Government, in the discussion on the motion in February, 1949.  I will give the Deputy the reference, and he will find the whole story there.  I do not want to be side-tracked at the moment.</P>
      <P>What is the situation?  Will you maintain the present road system?  Let us approach that question from another angle.  Firstly, I approached it from the point of view of the community as a whole and the service of the motor users.  They are two very important aspects.  Now, I shall approach it from another aspect, and one that is perhaps closer to the hearts of the Labour Party.  Will we maintain the programme of road development and maintenance?  If we do that, will we supply the labour to maintain it?  If we intend to supply the labour, will we use this particular form of development as far as we can in order to give as much local employment as we can?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard a great deal of talk about the necessity for local schemes of all kinds in order to provide employment for those who are seasonally employed.  We have heard a good deal about the importance of that type of work.  It has been generally admitted by all Parties that this type of road work has a special usefulness in that connection.  Will we maintain that position?  If we do, are we prepared to supply the money necessary for it?  Is the need so great&mdash;and I think some Deputies hold that it is&mdash;<Col N="724" /> that any particular form of taxation necessary to maintain it is justified? Certain Deputies go so far as to say it is.</P>
    <P>In the last analysis, it is on the roads the money will be spent.  That is where the money we are collecting in this way will be spent.  The people who will benefit in the long run will be the road workers.  It does not matter to local or central administrators, because they will have their employment and their work irrespective of whether or not we go on with the road programme, but it is absolutely vital to the road-workers themselves that we should, and particularly to the casual employees. It is vital that the money should be found in their interests.  They are the first beneficiaries in the financial sense.  It is they who are being maintained.  That is the important consideration in the much-debated aim of finding employment for our people. That is an important social consideration.</P>
    <P>Secondly, benefit accrues to the road users and to the community as a whole. Perhaps I have laboured the matter. Perhaps I have been somewhat elementary, but it is never any harm to get down to first principles and enumerate certain points with clarity.</P>
    <P>The justification for this, however, is a little broader than that.  I do not want to widen the scope of the debate or indulge in any rcriminations, but, speaking quite objectively, the experiment we had in State finance during the years 1948 to 1950 was not a fortunate one because of a financial policy which resulted in a gap between overall expenditure and overall revenue.  A gap of the dimensions we had to face here this year and last year was too much, and the closing of that gap and the adjustment of our financial position has involved great difficulty and entailed great hardship.  It is the existence of that gap which has necessitated the Government falling back on all the revenue-producing means at its disposal.</P>
    <P>When the present Minister for Finance introduced his Budget he was attacked because he imposed taxation and did not borrow.  When he borrowed <Col N="725" /> he did not escape scot-free. Now, he is endeavouring to get money for a particular purpose and relating that particular purpose to the source of revenue and he is attacked for doing that.  It might be well at this stage to remind the House that the Road Fund was raided for general purposes including.  I think, subsidies. If the Road Fund had been maintained the problem might be easier now and we are now, in short, facing part of an extremely difficult problem that has arisen because we let things drift and because the Government of the day did not handle the business of the country from year to year in the business-like manner that would have been adopted by a prudent board of directors.</P>
    <P>One Opposition Deputy actually boasted about all the motor-cars and so on that were on the road during the Coalition period of office.  We had our spree and now we have to pay for it.  We have to pay for it in a difficult time.  If we had been prudent in building up reserves during those three years we would in the long run have found things easier and we would have faced a safer future.  The burdens that have to be imposed all at once now could have been added almost imperceptibly.  I will leave it at that. I am speaking, I hope, with complete objectivity in an attempt to explain just what the Coalition experiment was.</P>
    <P>This effort on the part of the Minister now to relate motor taxation to the Road Fund and to get finance back again into order is just one aspect of the attempt to bring order into the chaos that resulted from the Coalition Government.  There are legitimate differences of opinion and far be it from me to suggest that the Opposition is not quite right in raising and ventilating every point that comes up. That is the function of the Opposition. The only appeal I make is to ask the Opposition to be reasonable.  Some members of the Opposition are reasonable. There is one ex-Minister who is always reasonable.</P>
    <P>I have made a number of points that must be faced in relation to the hard facts of the situation while realising <Col N="726" /> and sympathising fully with the hardship aspects and other aspects of the problem.  In the net result these problems must be faced and the question we must ask ourselves is: what can we in this Dáil, on this day and at this time do?  What decision can we take? Is it the contention of the Opposition that we should forget all about the roads and all that is involved in them? Is it their contention that we should not raise the money, or do they hold that we want the money?</P>

      <P>He can go anywhere if he wants to.  He has provided a particularly useful service in a concentrated community.  I personally feel that taximen are a group that should be treated separately.  The question of evening out the local taxation is a different matter.  The question is how far it is justifiable to exempt them or tax them more, as the case may be, if you are considering this problem as a whole. What I am saying is that they should be regarded as in a very specific category. They are subject to a very strict control.  They are subject to a very strict fares charge, which is of a type exclusive to them.  They operate in local areas, and they give a very important service both to the community as a whole and to the municipality in the sense of their being available to visitors and so on as one of the amenities of a big city.  They are definitely one of the amenities which are important in a city, and from a tourist point of view and some other points of view they are in a different category.</P>
      <P>I think that in fairness both to the hackney drivers and the taximen, the actual taxing should be considered in its own particular sphere.  Having said that, I would say that to that extent they should be specially treated.  On the other hand, if we have the unfortunate situation where you have to apply a principle, where you have got to try and average things out, I think it is still better that the person who has a taxi and who has a direct interest should be treated in much the same way in the approach as the other direct interests, rather than that the ultimate charge for their benefit should be levelled out over the community at large.  I say that in the sense that I would add my voice to the things which have been said to the Minister in connection with the tax.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to speakers on both sides of the House expressing their views on this Resolution. I want to say at the outset that I agree with the members of my Party who have spoken in opposition to the passing of this Resolution.  I also agree with the other Deputies on this side of the House who are in opposition to it.  When it became known that it was proposed to increase the tax on hackney cars, taxis, motor lorries and other motor vehicles a number of meetings were convened in different constituencies.  Meetings were convened in my constituency and also in South Mayo and Deputies of the different political Parties were requested to attend these meetings.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil Deputies, Fine Gael Deputies and myself attended on one occasion at Castlebar and discussed the problems of the various people concerned in this matter of increased taxation on their vehicles.  Deputies of the different political Parties listened to the views of those people for quite a considerable time.  On that occasion I personally gave an assurance that when this matter came up in Dáil Éireann I would oppose any increase in taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt that the Fianna Fáil Deputies who were at that meeting were really at heart in sympathy with <Col N="729" /> these people and with the viewpoints expressed, because all these Deputies, regardless of political leanings, know well that the majority of the people who own hackney cars or commercial vehicles are in poor circumstances. They are not a wealthy class.  They must use these vehicles for the purpose of making a living.  Judging by the trend of the debate here, however, despite the fact that Fianna Fáil Deputies gave their assurances then that they would use their influence within their Party to do what they could to persuade the Minister to relax or modify this imposition, I feel now that it is the intention of those particular Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party to vote with the Government on this measure, and, accordingly, to impose on the very poorest sections of the community additional taxes.  It is a rather strange thing to me, in any case, that individual Deputies would express their opinion and tell these people they were in sympathy with them and, at the same time, when they come back to Dáil Éireann, vote for the imposition of these taxes.  It is a rather peculiar system of Government that that should be the case.  I am not accountable, I suppose, for other people's actions.  In this matter I am only accountable for my own, and I repeat that I intend to vote against this measure.</P>
    <P>Throughout the length and breadth of rural Ireland, particularly in my own constituency, the hackney car is availed of to a great degree.  People in my county going to hospitals must avail of and pay for taxis or hackney cars in many instances.  If, as seems to be the case, these increases in the rates of taxation are to be imposed, it will mean in turn that the ordinary citizens of this State, let it be in my constituency or in any other constituency, will be obliged to pay increased fares.  I say that is an imposition on a section of our people who are not a wealthy class.</P>
    <P>I am not concerned with the few millionaires we have in this country; neither am I concerned with the extremely wealthy people who are not millionaires.  I am just concerned with the ordinary, plain people who, as I have already stated, must use cars in <Col N="730" /> the course of their business or profession, or, in other words, in order to make a living.</P>
    <P>I have in mind the case of a teacher in my constituency who, for five mornings of the week, has to drive her car over very rough roads for a distance of 22 or 23 miles.  She is the mother of a family and, in her case, her car is an absolute necessity, her home being that considerable distance away from her place of business.  There are thousands of other people throughout the country who are in the same position&mdash;poultry instructresses, agricultural instructors, road engineers and the members of other professions.  Many of these people. when they have finished their educational courses in college, must buy a car on the hire purchase.  It takes, in some cases, two years to clear off the hire-purchase debt that is incurred on that car.  To increase the tax on such a section of the community is, it seems to me, most unfair, and I will go so far as saying entirely unnecessary.</P>
    <P>From the Government side of the House it has been argued that our roads need to be put in a better state of repair than they are in at the present moment.  Personally, if I thought we could afford it, I feel that it would be a very desirable thing that that should be brought about, but I feel that we cannot afford these luxuries and, as has already been stated on this side of the House, it is not the ordinary plain people who stand to benefit most from any improvements that may be brought about.</P>
    <P>First of all, let me say that it is not the ordinary, plain people who use 8 h.p., 10 h.p. or 12 h.p. cars&mdash;let them be private individuals, hackney or taxi owners&mdash;who have damaged the roads of this country.  It is the heavy vehicles.  I have seen them.  I have travelled the roads of this country for the past 20 or 25 years, and have seen where these 12, 16 and 20-ton vehicles have been travelling; they have broken up the roads, particularly where the foundations are weak and completely destroyed our roads.  In the neighbourhood of the Curroy alcohol factory, near Ballina, I have seen a road completely destroyed because very heavy <Col N="731" /> vehicles have been used along it.  Now, if this Resolution goes through, we are going to impose on the poorer sections of our community a tax so that we can restore these roads to the condition in which they were originally.</P>
    <P>Speaking of taximen, I know many of them in the town of Ballina and in other towns.  Some of them are married men; some of them are single men who have no homes of their own and who are obliged to live in &ldquo;digs&rdquo;. Some of these people at the present time are trying to build up homes of their own, and with the increased rate of interest under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act, with the increased impositions on foods by the removal of the subsidies, with the increased cost of petrol and other things, I can certainly foresee that for such people as these there is a very lean time ahead.  As other Deputies have suggested, they will be obliged in the very near future to emigrate to a foreign country.  These views are expressed to me, to members of the Fianna Fáil Party and to members of the Fine Gael Party when we meet these people.  We know them personally and we know them individually. We know how they live.  They definitely have our sympathy, but by the passing of this Resolution the Government are going to crush these people.  I would ask the Minister seriously to consider the position before he has this legislation passed; otherwise, he will crush out of existence people who are so necessary to the welfare of the ordinary rural community, and also to the city dwellers.</P>
    <P>I have given very serious consideration for a long number of years to this whole question of road repair and maintenance.  I am a member of Mayo County Council and have about ten years' experience of local administration. When I first became a member of that body, I felt that in many ways we had not advanced or we had not progressed from the point of view of applying efficiency to the methods of repair and maintenace of our roads. I have seriously considered what I am going to say now and I am well aware that what I am saying or about to say <Col N="732" /> here may be twisted when the politicians get at it down the country. However, I will say it, having, as I said, carefully considered it.  I say it without fear because I believe it is in the best interests of the nation and in the best interests of having improvements brought about in our whole road system.  We see to-day as we go along the road our young men with the shovel, the pick and the brush. When I was a young lad the same implements were used for road work as are used now, whereas in progressive countries modern machinery is employed.  There are bulldozers and other types of modern machinery too numerous to mention that could be employed on the roads.  If such machinery had been used in this country 20 or 30 years ago there would be a very small mileage of roads in need of reconstruction to-day.</P>
    <P>It may be suggested that by advocating the use of modern machinery for this work I am advocating something that will result in disemployment. I am doing no such thing.  I live in a country village where the valuations are £4 to £4 10s.  My neighbours depend a great deal on this type of employment and therefore it would be very wrong if I were to advocate in the national Parliament a policy which would deprive these people of employment on the roads.</P>
    <P>I would not do that.  I do suggest that, instead of doing a mile by inefficient methods, we should do one and a half or two miles by efficient methods and that the young men who are employed on the roads and who, at present, have to work extra hard by reason of the fact that they use the pick, the shovel and the spade should be employed on the lighter side of the work such as the filling of pot holes, laying straw, widening corners where the only difficulty would be the removal of soil, and that machinery should be used for the removal of heavy obstructions.</P>
    <P>I heard a Deputy saying this evening that it cost approximately £4,000 per mile to do a road.  That is an extraordinary admission on the part of a Fianna Fáil Deputy.  I am quite convinced he was telling the truth.  In my area, some years ago, two miles <Col N="733" /> of road were done for £900.  It goes to show that we have not progressed in this matter.  The Minister tells us that there are so many miles of road in need of reconstruction to-day because we have not tried to bring efficiency into this matter.  Better methods and increased mechanisation would produce better results.</P>
    <P>The lorry owners are being mulcted. The question of increased taxation has been dealt with very fully in this debate, and I do not want to repeat what has been said scores of times. I would add my protest to that of other Deputies against the imposition of increased taxation on lorry owners.  If lorry owners, particularly those who engage in the haulage of consumer goods, have to bear this increased taxation, the cost of the articles that they carry will be increased to the consumers.</P>
    <P>There is the further consideration that many young men have bought lorries on hire-purchase agreements and are finding it difficult to repay the cost. This additional imposition will cause increased hardship.  This section of the community have already suffered considerably by reason of the fact that less goods have been hauled over Irish roads since the restriction of bank credit and since the scaremongering started.  Wholesalers and retailers were compelled to restrict their purchases by reason of the fact that credit in many instances was curtailed and, therefore, the quantity of goods hauled was reduced.  That has had a very adverse effect on the owners of commercial vehicles.  That was a very serious handicap on those people.</P>
    <P>Even at this late stage, I appeal in all sincerity to the Deputies opposite&mdash; who have been approached as I have been and who know as well as I do the hardship that these impositions will cause the poorer sections of our community&mdash;to oppose this measure here to-night and let the Minister see that he cannot get away with every type of legislation, regardless of the injustice it may cause.  I do not know whether I am wasting my time in making that appeal, but I do so because I feel that I am performing a public duty that I am bound to discharge in this House. <Col N="734" /> In conclusion, I appeal again, even at this late hour, to those opposite to make up their minds to vote against this measure and defeat it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Hara seems to think it strange that a Deputy could have sympathy with lorry owners and still vote for this tax.  Deputies often have sympathy with themselves, but must tax the goods they use.  Whenever any section of the community about to be taxed or interfered with starts an agitation, must the Government bow down to that?  That happened in the three and a half years before Fianna Fáil came back into power, and we know what happened then.  Trying to please everybody is something you cannot do.  A Government that is so weak as not to raise money from the best source possible and inflict the least hardship on the people as a whole should get out of power&mdash;and the last Government did.</P>
      <P>Someone has said the roads would not be in the position they are in now if proper improvements had been made 30 or 40 years ago.  The roads then were quite good for the traffic on them. Those roads to-day are quite good enough for the traffic of 30 years ago &mdash;indeed too good, in that horses cannot walk on them as they are so slippery.  If these roads are not good enough for motor traffic&mdash;and undoubtedly they appear not to be&mdash; who should pay for them?  Is it the man with the motor lorry, or is it the county council labourer or farm labourer who should pay it in rates? Is it the ordinary worker?  Or is it the people who are making money out of the roads and who, in effect, will not lose any money by this tax, as less damage will be done to their vehicles when they have proper roads under them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Someone mentioned £2,000 a mile for roads.  Deputy MacCarthy and myself are members of Cork County Council and the deputy engineer has told us that all he is allowed for the roads is £30 per year per mile&mdash;as he put it himself, the wages of a labourer for seven weeks&mdash;without any materials supplied.  I have been listening to people in the Cork County Council condemning the heavy lorries for the <Col N="735" /> damage they are doing to the roads and saying they should be made pay for that damage, that the ratepayers should not be asked to pay for it, but when those people come up here they take a different attitude and are all against the tax.  Anyone who is a member of a county council must know that the ratepayers cannot afford to pay any more rates for the maintenance of roads for motor traffic.</P>

      <P>The position is so bad in County Cork that a Labour member who is a Deputy of this House put in a notice of motion that the county council raise £5,000,000 to put the roads into a proper state of repair.  I seconded him, as I believe that £30 per mile is only wasted in patching roads at present, and I believe that ultimately it would be a big saving if we raised the £5,000,000, and put them once and for all in a proper state of repair.  However, neither Deputy Desmond nor myself got his way.</P>
      <P>We all know that Córas Iompair Éireann are compelled to keep the permanent way of the railways in repair, spending a lot of money and employing men on it.  They have to do that out of their receipts and the subsidies they are getting.  They must do it, to keep the permanent way in a safe and proper condition.  Why should not motorists be compelled to keep their permanent way in a proper condition?  It is quite equitable that motorists should be in the same position as the railways.</P>
      <P>We had another new entrant into Fine Gael complaining that the cost of everything had gone up since this Government came in, including the wages the farmer has to pay.  I would like the Labour members to consider that aspect of it.  Are they in favour of wages going up or not?  Do they favour another £1,000,000 being spent on the roads to give employment to the workers that we hear so much talk about at certain times, in county councils and elsewhere?  The Minister has said that all this money will go into the roads.</P>

      <P>This talk about the increase in tax on lorries is a bit overdone.  I have friends with motor lorries, too, and they are not worried about the increase at all.  The one thing worrying them&mdash;let me be honest and admit it&mdash;is the fear that the area they can work in may be restricted.  They say the tax means very little.</P>
      <P>We had Deputy O'Gorman a while ago saying that the increase per head in the tax on buses would result in less people travelling.  He should remember that, from 1926 to 1932, the tax per head on buses was £5.  That continued until Fianna Fáil came into power and reduced it by 33? per cent. to £3 6s. 8d.  Now it is being increased by 20 per cent., bringing it up to £4, which is still £1 less than it was in 1926.  Everybody will tell you that the £ is not worth half what it was worth in 1926.  No Deputy on the opposite side will contradict that.  You are charging only £2 as against what Cumann na nGaedheal charged from 1926 to 1932.</P>

If I was on the other side of the House I suppose I would do the same thing, but the Government that would give in to that kind of proposition and that kind of propaganda should, as I said before, get out. Every section of the community at the present time&mdash;doctors, vintners, chambers of commerce&mdash;are all organised to look after their own interests. I suppose nobody can blame them for that, but one cannot give in.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief in my remarks.  I am opposed to this Money Resolution.  I believe it will create a hardship.  That hardship will not be felt in the first two or three months but as time goes on it will be felt plainly.  The Government have come to a decision.  They say they are going to put into operation a scheme, costing anything from £800,000 to £1,000,000, for the repair of main roads and sections of county roads.</P>
      <P>We have to ask ourselves from whom this money will be collected.  Who are the people who will be called upon to pay?  We must ask ourselves whether they can afford to do so.  I have been a member of a local authority for 20 years and I know that roads require to be repaired in a general way, main roads, county roads, cul-de-sac roads and the numerous other minor roads that serve very big sections of the community.</P>
      <P>The £800,000 to £1,000,000 which we are going to spend on the main roads would, I agree, encourage people to travel and come to the country.  I am certainly not in agreement with the manner in which that money has been spent for years back nor do I agree with the manner in which the money that will be collected from this present source will be spent.</P>
      <P>I wish to mention two roads, the road from Kilcock to Enfield and the road from Enfield to Kinnegad.  The money that is being spent on those roads would have been much better spent, perhaps, on improving sections of other roads in the County Kildare and County Meath and in other counties throughout the Twenty-Six Counties. I am satisfied that the main roads require a certain amount of repairs, but I am of opinion that money spent in the way it has been spent over the last eight to ten years on the roads could have been saved and employed to better use.  If the money which it is intended to collect is to be spent in that way I say it will not be of such service as the Government maintains.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Very useful work can be done on <Col N="738" /> main roads.  Work is necessary on the main roads to-day.  There are plenty of main roads, certain sections of which are very bad.  There is great room to widen them.  Money spent on widening the roads would be money wisely spent.  It would give a great deal of employment.  Money employed in that way would show a very good return. I may be wrong but this scheme of steam-rolling the county roads is not very long in existence.  Having regard to the manner in which it is proposed to spend the money it is intended to collect now, only a very small area of a county will get the benefit of what I call a county road steam-rolling scheme.  The Government and the Department will make their own decisions in regard to where this money should be spent, how it should be spent and whether this town and that town should be connected and so on.  A very small proportion of the money the Government is providing will be spent on steam-rolling roads.</P>
    <P>I am opposed to the amount of money that is being asked to cover the period of one year as the amount to be expended is in excess of what we can afford.  Every householder would like to provide himself and his family with a better service in the way of improvements to his house but, in doing that, he has to take heed of his resources.</P>
    <P>In this particular case we cannot afford to spend £1,000,000 in excess of what we spent last year as far as repairs to main and county roads are concerned.  If this £800,000 to £1,000,000 was more evenly distributed it might give me some hope.  If the small farmer living on a by-road or boreen, miles away from a main or county road, was to get some benefit from the expenditure of this money, I might be somewhat more favourably disposed towards this proposal, but that section of people will not get any return from this expenditure, except in so far as they may get a day's wages. Some of them will not be able to avail of it, however, because of the distance involved in travelling to get employment on the road works.</P>
    <P>There is also the point that we should consider who are the people who are to be asked to make this contribution of £800,000.  The businesslike <Col N="739" /> way to approach it is to have a general investigation made as to the people called upon to make the contribution, and if the Minister and his officials made that general survey, got information from all over the country and consulted Deputies, members of county councils and so on, it would be found that only a very small percentage could afford this increased tax.  In my area, we have small hackneymen, some of them living in big towns, others in small towns and still others out in rural areas, far away from the districts in which they can get business.  These people have to pay this increased tax and I know that they cannot afford to pay any such increase.  I know that they are making no money and that it is only because they have a hackney car, together with some other little occupation, that they are able to earn a living at all.  The same applies to the man with the lorry, the travelling shop or the bread van, as well as the fowl and egg collector.  These people cannot afford any increase in the rate of tax.</P>
    <P>It has been said that it is a long time since there was a review of these scales of taxation in return for road accommodation, but surely we do not want to go back so far.  I am not far out in saying that it is not so long since petrol was available at 1/- a gallon and perhaps less, and it is almost four times that price to-day. That, in itself, is a very big tax on the ordinary motor owner, the owner of the hackney car, the hiring car and the lorry owner.  It is gradually going up every year and in that way his contribution towards the upkeep and maintenance of roads is going up every year.</P>
    <P>It has also been said that this money, when collected, will be put into a fund and will go back to the roads.  That may be so.  The intention may be the very best, but promises are made to be broken, and there are many Deputies here who can recollect the use that was made of money which was taken out of the Road Fund in previous years, money which was used to balance Budgets.  The money may be available at the end of a certain period, but the Minister for Finance <Col N="740" /> may call upon it to balance his Budget, as happened before and could happen again.</P>
    <P>Consider the section of people called upon to meet this increased cost. I know many of them in my own county and I know them here in the City of Dublin&mdash;men like the taximan who keeps his taxi at Stephen's Green or down in O'Connell Street.  I could not support any proposal to increase the tax on any one of these sections. We hear talk of decentralisation of industry and surely this is a little industry in itself.  It is doubtful if there were five lorries in my part of County Mayo in 1917.  It was in that year that this question of lorry traffic and road services started.  They were built up on the hard-earned money of individuals and to-day these people are finding it very hard to make a living, not to speak of reaching a stage at which they will have built up a small amount of savings to enable them to buy a new lorry when the old one has seen many years of service.  The hackney owner probably buys his car on hire purchase and it takes two years to pay for it and then the trouble starts in the way of repairs.  That continues for two or three more years and a large percentage of these people then find that they cannot replace the old car.</P>
    <P>I do agree that there should be some distinctive mark on public service vehicles, that is hackney cars, to show that they are public service vehicles. Anybody who wishes to own and operate such a car should identify it with some specific mark.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned main and county roads, cul-de-sac roads and small roads leading into villages, and I have mentioned the section of the people who will be called upon to pay the tax.  If this tax is put into operation there is no question or doubt that, while it may not show itself in a month or two, it will gradually show itself and increase the cost of living by increasing the cost of commodities purchased, collected and delivered. This is bound to happen, because those who remain in business will have to meet the increased cost.  Very few of them are making money or getting an existence as they are, so they are <Col N="741" /> bound to add to their prices, and this increase will find its way into the house of every consumer.  I agree with Deputy Dillon about the cost that this will involve.  It will grow and grow and grow, and eventually, in my opinion, it will wipe out a big percentage of the people in that business.  It boils down to the creation of a monopoly. When that monopoly is created, it will be free to make its own charges and to make deliveries in any way it wishes.</P>
    <P>The section of the people hit by this tax will be in competition with other organised motor transport, with Córas Iompair Éireann motor lorries, with Córas Iompair Éireann buses, with the Army as far as their traffic is concerned, with Bord na Móna and with the Post Office.  The cost is immaterial to Córas Iompair Éireann, the Army, the Post Office and Bord na Móna, because it will be made good when the Estimates are put before the House.  In the meantime, private lorry owners, private hire-car owners, private hauliers and business people in a small way who serve rural areas are faced with the increased tax and with that competition.  The effects will grow.  Only in about two years will people see the result of these increases when they are passed over to the ordinary consumer all over the country.</P>

      <P>Deputy Alderman Byrne interrupted Deputy Major de Valera during his speech, and claimed that my colleague Deputy de Valera had no intention of referring to the Dublin taximen until he was reminded by the lively alderman.  I am sure that Deputy Alderman Byrne will accept my word when I tell him that Deputy de Valera and myself have discussed the question of the Dublin taximen during the past week.  It will, I am sure, be generally agreed by those who know Deputy de Valera and Deputy Byrne that Deputy de Valera requires no inspiration from the very astute alderman now or at any time or on any matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For my own part I arranged an interview on behalf of one section of the taximen with the Minister's officials. I endeavoured also to arrange <Col N="742" /> that a deputation would be received, and I say with regret that I failed.  I feel myself that the Dublin taximen should be dealt with separately from the hackneymen and specially treated. It will be claimed that the increase is not a large one in respect of the Dublin taximen.  I quite agree with that.  It would be all right if the Dublin taximen were doing good business, but they are not.  They have never made a fortune, and they are not making one now.  I claim to know the Dublin taximen quite well, and I would like again to tell the Minister that they are by no means a rich body of men.</P>
    <P>I had occasion a few years ago to help in drawing up the will of a taximan, who was more than 40 years in the business, first as a jarvey plying from the hazard in Gardiner's Row.  I am sure that Deputy MacEoin, when he frequented that district, and Deputy Dillon knew the man well.  He stood at the corner of Gardiner's Row with a cab at first, and then progressed and got a taxi.  He was a shrewd, careful man.  He was married and had no family.  After 40 years he left a few miserable hundred pounds.  He was a very careful man, so anybody who claimed that taximen die rich made a very great mistake.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ColmGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The taximen would not object to paying this increase if the business were there, but it is not there at the moment and the Minister should try to meet them if at all possible.  It has been suggested that they should increase their fares.  I say that that is no answer at all to this question because the taxi business is bad at the moment, and if they increased the fares business would be much worse.  I feel that the taximen have a case for special treatment, and if the Minister could do it I think he should make every effort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been said during the debate that the taxi service in Dublin is important as far as tourists are concerned. We feel here in Dublin that the taximen give very good service to the <Col N="743" /> tourists and to the people of Dublin. They are doing a good job of work and are on the whole a decent type of man. We hear at all times that great things should be done for the tourists and the tourist industry, that we should keep the pubs open until 12 or one at night and do all sorts of things, but if we provided a decent taxi service it would be a great thing for the tourists.  Any Deputies who travel outside Ireland know that some of the taxis abroad are very poor.  When they come back one thing upon which they comment is that taxis in other countries are very poor and that the charges are very high. You could get from here to Cork on some of the fares taxis charge on the Continent.</P>
    <P>The other side of the House are not being entirely fair on this.  On the one hand they have been complaining down through the years that we should do more to improve our roads.  You hear especially from provincial Deputies that more money should be put up for the roads and to give employment. Now you cannot have it both ways.  If we are to improve the roads and give more employment we must find the money somewhere.  This method, I agree, is not a very popular one, but I think it is the only way at the moment.  Take us here in Dublin at the moment.  I heard a Deputy on the far side complaining a short time ago that it was impossible in the main streets of Dublin to drive a car.  I think that even Deputy Flanagan's bicycle would find a few bumps in O'Connell Street. We are doing a good job of work and giving a great deal of employment.</P>
    <P>I say that not because I am a member of the Dublin Corporation but because I feel that we are doing a good job of work.  We are going to continue to do that and to give employment to the men of Dublin.  I appeal to the Minister to do anything he can to help the Dublin taximen.  The increase will not bring such a great deal of money into the Exchequer.  I think the Minister should try to meet them eye to eye.  I have read their memorandum and I have had conversations with some of their officials.  They have made their case very well.  I think the Minister <Col N="744" /> should give their memorandum and their representations every consideration. I understand that at the moment they cannot meet this increase but, at the same time, it is not right to say that it will put them off the roads.  I do not agree with their officials when they say that it will put every taximan off the road.  I am sure they will make an effort to meet it if the Minister does not change it.  I think the Minister should endeavour to have a further talk with their officials. He will find them reasonable and he will find that the Dublin taximen will not try to put anything over on him. They would be quite prepared to pay this increase if they could afford it, but they cannot afford it at the moment.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I again appeal to the Minister to try if possible to meet the officials again and to see if, at this late stage, something can be done for these men.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to refer to any of the statements which have already been made by Deputies during the course of this debate. Neither do I intend to go back again on the matter of the hardships which this Resolution will impose on those to whom it will apply.  To do either of these things would simply waste the time of the House because there is no point in repeating the stories which other Deputies have already told to the members of this House.</P>
      <P>This debate so far has not convinced me in any way that there is not a twofold objective behind the Resolution. This matter has been brought before this House for the purpose, we are told, of making and maintaining the roads of this country out of taxes which will be collected from the people who are supposed to pay them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall take, first of all, the question of the drivers of hackney cars and private motor cars.  I think that, for years, these people have been paying what might be called a sufficient tax for their usage of the roads.  For years, those people have been paying a tax which was supposed to go into the Road Fund.  It now transpires that whilst the money so collected did go into the Road Fund it was taken out again, thereby depriving those people <Col N="745" /> of the benefit of the maintenance of roads for which they had paid.  I consider that that was altogether wrong.</P>
    <P>I come now to the owners of private lorries and the owners of heavy lorries. As a member of the Clare County Council, I supported a resolution years ago to have those lorries taken off the roads but I should like to remind the House that we did not put forward that resolution for the sole purpose of putting only the private lorry off the road: we put it forward to take the Córas Iompair Éireann lorries off the roads&mdash;lorries which, at the time, were the greatest trespassers on the roads.</P>
    <P>I feel that the manner in which the taxes have been levied under this Resolution on the different people to whom they are applicable will give Córas Iompair Éireann a monopoly of the roads of this country inasmuch as a tax is being placed on the heavily-laden lorry which it will be well-nigh impossible to pay.  In that way this Resolution will remove quietly all the traffic from the roads and leave the monopoly to Córas Iompair Éireann.</P>
    <P>A lot has been said by members of this House about the manner in which this Resolution will affect the owners of different vehicles, but to my mind this tax will hit nobody harder than the already over-burdened taxpayer. For instance, I am sure that some hackneymen will still be able to keep on the roads and that some lorry owners will still be able to keep their lorries on the road, but, whether they do or not, Córas Iompair Éireann will be on the roads and undoubtedly the extra tax will be a grave hardship on the hackneymen and lorry owners, and some of it will be passed on to the people whom they serve and whom they employ.  This Resolution is another imposition on the already over-burdened taxpayer of this country.  I believe that had our transport services been handled as efficiently as they should have been handled for some years past, there would be no need for this Resolution to-day.  When I say that, I do not want the House to think for one moment that I want to be in any way caustic in my remarks about <Col N="746" /> the management of that transport.  I would remind the House that only a short while ago we brought an expert to this country to examine our transport situation and to regulate, as it were, our transport and traffic.  We paid £4,500 for the work done by that expert.</P>

      <P>I desire to intervene to make a comment on the case made by Deputy Major de Valera. In the course of his remarks, he stated that he wanted to give an impartial or an objective appreciation of the situation as he saw it.  He made the case that this impost was now forced on the Government because the inter-Party Government, during its three and a half years of office, raided the Road Fund to the extent of £300,000.  He quoted from the Official Record, which, I presume, is correct, a statement made by Deputy McGilligan when he was Minister for Finance to the effect that he was extracting £300,000 from the Road Fund in a particular year.  He said he was doing this in an objective fashion. I interjected that he should state if that was the first time that the Road Fund made such a contribution to the State services.  He did not accept that invitation beyond saying that I could make my own case on that matter.  I want to point out that the Government in the year 1939 took a contribution of a very substantial amount from the Road Fund.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>To the tune, to be correct, of £150,000.  At various other <Col N="747" /> periods, there were similar raids, as they were described, on the Road Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have this one here about the year 1939 and I am sure it is correct.  In 1939 the contribution from the Road Fund was £150,000 when the total revenue of the State was £32,532,000&mdash;a time when there was no financial stringency.  Deputy Major de Valera said that if the inter-Party Government had taken proper precautions and had exercised the intelligence of an ordinary business executive, they would have built up a reserve.</P>
      <P>The Deputy should have also told us that these pre-war years were the years in which a reserve should have been built up.  A very great reserve should have been built up in these years, but the Minister for Finance of the Fianna Fáil Government in 1939 took very good care to extract that contribution from the Road Fund.  I am citing that only to show that the case made by Deputy de Valera was not the objective one that he would have us believe he was making, and I shall leave it at that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This impost was defended on two grounds&mdash;(1) that roads are necessary, and (2) that this is the only method by which money can be got to make these repairs, and the Government threaten the rural community that if they do not get it in this way, the expenditure will have to fall on the rates.  We have proved conclusively that that is not correct, that there are other methods of taxation, which would be more equitable, to provide funds to make and repair roads.  We have no evidence from the Government or from the Minister in charge of these proposals that these other methods have been examined.  Several proposals have been made from time to time by the motor owners.  The Minister has not told us whether he has accepted any of these views or positively rejected them.  I presume that the Government have rejected them, when he comes in with these proposals instead and pins his <Col N="748" /> faith on them.  I have not the figures before me, but I presume that Deputy de Valera did not misquote, but even assuming that in the three Budgets introduced by the inter-Party Government the contribution from the Road Fund was £300,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;is it reasonable that the Government should come in to-day to take a whole £900,000 from the ratepayers in one year?  Does it mean that you are going to punish the lorry owners, the taximen and the hackney owners who supported the inter-Party Government by fining them £900,000 in one year?  If you said: &ldquo;We are £900,000 short because of the conduct of the inter-Party Government&rdquo;&mdash; a proposition which I do not accept&mdash;&ldquo;and we propose to collect it in two years,&rdquo; one could perhaps understand, but you do not make that proposal. With one fell stroke you are going to get £900,000&mdash;£830,000 to be exact.  We will not fall out over the ha'porth of tar; a small item of £70,000 does not matter in the calculations of the present Administration.</P>
      <P>It is rather peculiar that Deputy Gallagher and Deputy de Valera should talk in the way they did about the hackney-car owners in the City of Dublin.  Deputy Gallagher did make the case, which I know to be correct, that hackneymen and taxi owners are ordinarily poor men.  He went on to prove that by saying that he assisted in the making of a will of one of these men.  I do not know exactly whether he said that he made the will himself or assisted in the making of it, but anyhow he said he was present at the making of the will of one of these taximen and that when he came to ascertain what assets the man had to bequeath, he found that the man had only a miserable few hundred pounds. If he had only a few miserable hundred pounds under the taxation previously levied, would he not certainly have less now?</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the length of time we were on bicycles, I think I could outride the Minister on that at any time.  I want to tell him that, in 1916, 1917, 1918 and 1919, when I rode a bicycle along wet country roads with a wet coat on my back, I was not one of the few who had a car to do the nation's work.  However, we shall let that be.  The fact remains that the taximen of Dublin, for whom Deputy de Valera and Deputy Gallagher have now such sympathy, are going to pay heavily as a result of this increased taxation.  From the way these two Deputies spoke, one would think that they were going to vote against this Resolution.  Of course they will not.  They will answer the Whip, but they will be able to say to their supporters in the city: &ldquo;Read the speech I made on it.&rdquo;  I think that is unfair.  Deputy O'Hara stated that the Fianna Fáil Deputies in Mayo attended a meeting convened by the lorry owners and motor vehicle owners of that area and that these Fianna Fáil Deputies promised to support the demand that this impost should be remitted.  Deputy O'Hara is very young in public life or he would have known that when they were saying that, they had their tongues in their cheeks and that they did not mean that.  They probably used that grand phrase, that they would support such a demand within the Party, but then, of course, once the Party majority was in favour of the Minister's proposals there was no question but that the poor fellows would have to obey the Whip.  As I say, I did not want to intervene except to make that short comment and to point out that <Col N="750" /> there were contributions taken from the Road Fund at various stages.  That was not unique.  It was done at various times.  It was certainly done in 1939 when the total revenue of the State was £32,000,000 and when the value of money was much greater than it is to-day.  I cannot see how the Minister or the Government can justify the raising of the whole of this £900,000 in one year.  Even assuming that the claim they make is correct, that the Road Fund was short after the inter-Party Government had taken that sum from it, they should not try to recover the whole of it in one year. The argument they make is, in my opinion, a false one.</P>
      <P>It is unfair and should not have been made.  The Government claim that this impost is going to be devoted to the maintenance and the making of the roads.  I think that is not correct. They are really making a prohibition against a certain type of people so as to put them off the roads.  I think it would be far more decent to say to those people that they were going to stop the heavy lorries and a particular type of trader and were going to put them off the road, and were going to increase the taxation on other small motor vehicles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFlynn" hpid="Mr. J. Flynn Mr. J. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to be very brief.  I want to say, at the outset, that the Minister had no option but to do the honest thing, to face up to the position and to impose this tax.  It was inevitable that something should be done in regard to road construction in the country.  As a member of a local authority, I had experience of what our position was in County Kerry. Time and again, over the past four or five years, we have been in extreme difficulty in regard to adequate grants, not only for the main and tourist roads but for the roads necessary for our farmers&mdash;the roads in isolated districts, the county roads.  We had not sufficient money to do a fraction of the work which we should have done.  I visualise that as a result of this arrangement by the Minister, we will at least have an adequate amount of money made available to us for this purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to stress the case on <Col N="751" /> behalf of one section of the people whom I represent because I think that an exceptional case can be made for them.  I refer to the private lorry owners in isolated areas.  They provide transport to these inaccessible districts.  There is no question at all of Córas Iompair Éireann or of any other organisation being able to cope with the transport there.  These people operating the private lorries haul sand and turf and other commodities which the small farmers in these areas require. I think that they deserve consideration.</P>
    <P>In that connection, I would refer the Minister and the House to the fact that some years ago the farmers in other parts of the country got a special concession in regard to a remission of tax on tractors with a view to enabling them to increase production.  I think that a somewhat similar concession should be granted in this case that I am referring to.  I am not making a special plea in regard to transport in general, but I am making a case on behalf of these people because they are serving a very useful purpose.  If they get the concession which I am seeking they will continue to be an asset to the localities and communities which they serve and will themselves, in turn, be able to carry on their business in a proper way.</P>
    <P>I did not like the statements which were made by some Deputies who, so to speak, painted the picture from the political end.  My friend Deputy Palmer tried to make the case that this was a penal tax on all types of vehicles.  He even made the case that the tax would be levied on the travelling portable creameries in South Kerry although the Minister assured him that that was not the case.  Despite that, he persisted in trying to make us believe that there would be a penal tax imposed on those people.  I do not think that is a proper way to approach this matter.  As the Minister has said, we will have to find the money somewhere. We have to face up to the fact that it is unpopular, but we must do the unpopular thing and at the same time do the honest thing.  In conclusion, I would ask the Minister to take note of what I have said about <Col N="752" /> these hauliers.  They served a very useful purpose during the emergency. Most of them, so far as I know, were ex-Army men.  They purchased these lorries on the instalment system.  They worked through the emergency, and they are now serving a useful purpose in these isolated and inaccessible districts.  I think they deserve special consideration, and I hope the Minister will be able to see his way to do what I ask.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me say at the outset that I am not concerned in any way with any tax which the Minister or the Government may impose on the cars of the plutocrats, but I am very much concerned about the tax which is being imposed on the lorries and hackney cars throughout rural Ireland. I was associated with two inquiries as a result of which railway lines were closed down.  On each occasion the officials of the local authorities and of the Ministry assured the public that the roads would be sufficient and would be fit to carry any traffic which might be placed on them as a result of the closing of the railway lines.  To-day we are told that the roads are in such a state of disrepair that it is essential that the Road Fund be augumented by additional taxation on cars and lorries. I say that the closing of the railways was the thin end of the wedge for the monopolisation of transport in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all aware that during the emergency our transport for commercial merchandise and hackney transport became disorganised.  We are also aware that, when the emergency ended and young men came out of the services and obtained their gratuities, they got a preference in respect to S.P.S.V. licences and with that preference invested their gratuities in the purchase of hackney cars and small lorries.  These men, particularly the lorry owners, were unable to obtain plates other than through a public transport company.  We have had cases of that in Donegal where men invested in lorries and then found that they had to go to local railway stations and obtain a transport plate from the railway company. For every piece of work these lorries do on the road the public <Col N="753" /> transport company obtain a percentage of the money which they earn.  In other words, they are merely paying for the purpose of using the plate. They have to contribute 10 per cent of their earnings, I think, to the railway company in order that the railway company will give them the facilities for obtaining plates.  I think that is blackmail.</P>

      <P>I merely put that in to build up the case I am endeavouring to make.  In rural Ireland most churchgoers have to depend upon hackney cars for bringing them to church.  In the particular part of West Donegal where I live we have no bus service whatsoever on Sunday.  We are dependent upon hackney cars to bring us to church.  If the Minister persists in taxing these hackney cars the owners of them will either go off the road altogether or pass the buck <Col N="754" /> on to the paying public.  I am aware of a number of these hackneymen who have sold their cars and cleared out to Scotland.</P>
      <P>I heard Deputy Colm Gallagher and Deputy de Valera make an earnest appeal to the Minister to-day on behalf of the Dublin taximen.  I do not wish to say anything against Dublin taximen.  Indeed, I add my voice to theirs in that connection, and I ask them to extend their appeal to the hackneymen all over the country. There is no use in appealing to the Minister here unless one intends to go further.  There is no use in making a case unless one has the courage of one's convictions and votes in support of one's appeal.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture has told us in West Donegal that the best method of disposing of our surplus herrings is by selling them to the small lorry owners who, in turn, will deliver them all over the country.  I think that is a method of distribution which should be encouraged. But the Parliamentary Secretary's colleague, the Minister for Local Government, is endeavouring to drive these small lorry owners off the road.  A few years ago when the Minister was in opposition we heard a great deal about hand-won turf.  We who live in a turf area know that, were it not for the lorry owners in the past couple of years, we would have had no hand-won turf.  If these lorry owners are taxed they will go off the roads, and that will finish hand-won turf.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to give careful attention to what the Deputies on his own side have said.  If we cannot convince him, I ask him to consider earnestly what his colleagues said with regard to the hackney-car drivers.  If he does that, he will do something to help the people of rural Ireland and encourage them to remain there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the views already advanced by this side of the House in relation to the proposed taxation.  This Resolution is, in effect, another Supplementary Budget.  It asks a section of the community to contribute almost another £1,000,000 to <Col N="755" /> the Exchequer.  The section of the community that will be hardest hit by this imposition, apart from the hackney-car drivers and the taximen, will be the farming community, particularly those who have their lorries taxed as agricultural vehicles. These lorries are taxed at a rate of £25 per annum for a lorry not exceeding 40 cwt. unladen weight.  The proposed new tax will be £46 per annum.  In other words, the Government intends to put a further £21 per annum tax on to these farmers' lorries. That will obviously hit the consumers in the long run, because it will make the production and marketing of food more expensive.  Now many of the trucks used by farmers are slightly over 40 cwt. unladen weight, and the result will be that farmers' trucks, instead of costing £25 per annum in future, will cost £50 or more.</P>
      <P>Emphasis was placed in this debate by some of those anxious to defend these proposals on the tractor tax. They pointed out that the farmer can tax his tractor for 5/-.  Everybody knows that that tax merely permits the farmer to go out on the road, cross the road and go in on land on the far side of the road.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not.  I regret I should have to advise the Deputy on a legal matter of this kind.  He ought to know it himself.  The 5/- tax permits the farmer to cross the road, perhaps to go up the road with his tractor <Col N="756" /> provided there is nothing attached to it except a plough, some other farming implement or its own equipment.  It does not permit the farmer to cross the road with a load of agricultural produce. This tax does not permit him to load produce on one side of the road and bring it across the road to the other side.  He will in future be forced to pay £8 per year if he wishes to bring produce across the road from one part of his farm to another.  That applies to all crops.  He will have to pay a tax of £8 per year in order to cross the road with his produce.</P>
      <P>The scale is even higher in the case of farmers who find it necessary to use tractors on the roads for trailers.  Many farmers will be obliged now, when the tax on their trucks is increased from £25 to £50, to dispose of their trucks and use tractors even at the figure of £8 tax instead of the previous figure. As a result I feel that the Road Fund will not receive the amount of money estimated here.  But, while the amount of money estimated for will not be collected, this will completely alter our whole economy.  It will have the effect of putting trucks which are now being used off the roads and forcing the farmers to use tractors instead.  There will also be a loss in revenue from the tax on petrol if the use of lorries is discontinued.</P>
      <P>Deputy de Valera seemed to make the case that the money proposed to be collected now in the form of motor taxation would be used for the relief of unemployment by giving employment to men on the roads.  That is a new angle on this subject.  No other speaker has gone so far as to say that the money to be collected in motor taxation is to be given out in the form of relief. It is just another admission of the failure of the Government in the matter of providing employment for our people and creating a stable economy. We have had a complete departure on the part of the Government from house building which was in full swing when the Government took office.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I want to make is that the argument is put forward <Col N="757" /> now that this money is being collected for the purpose of road building.  Road building is apparently the new activity into which our economy is to be directed instead of completing the housing programme which has got a very serious jolt during the last few weeks.  I think it was Deputy Cogan said that the lorry owners would not object to this extra tax if they received an assurance that a distance limit would not be applied to them.  I do not agree with that.  I feel that the lorry owners are objecting to this extra taxation and that what is agitating their minds is the possibility that there will be a distance limit applied to them on the recommendation of Córas Iompair Éireann.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corish yesterday suggested that all the money for the roads should come from the Central Fund and that the Road Fund should be scrapped. There is a good lot of sense in that suggestion, because the roads were constructed and are being maintained by money subscribed by ratepayers and motor vehicle owners.  People using the roads who are not ratepayers or motor vehicle owners are not contributing to the construction and maintenance of these roads.  Motor vehicle owners and ratepayers therefor would feel that they would have no grievance if all other sections of the community were contributing so far as they can towards the upkeep of the roads which all sections are using.</P>
      <P>The tax on the heavier lorries is certainly prohibitive.  It has reached such a high level that it would have been more decent to tell the owners of these heavy lorries that the roads were not constructed for lorries of such weight, that they are not suited for use by such heavy lorries, and that such heavy lorries will not be permitted to be used on the roads.  Instead of saying to them that this is the view, having regard to the damage done to the roads, it is proposed to increase the taxation to such an extent that they will be forced off the roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the argument has been put forward that this money will be used in the form of relief for the purpose of creating employment on the roads, <Col N="758" /> surely we should expect that the Government would have some kind of plan in connection with unemployment. Unemployment is continually growing. Many people who are unemployed are not suitable for working on the roads. Yet it is proposed, according to Deputy de Valera, to collect this money for the purpose of paying men for working on the roads.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of the view expressed that men should be properly equipped for working on the roads.  At present they are using similar implements to those used 50 years ago&mdash;the pick, the shovel and the brush.  In many other countries the workers on the roads are properly equipped with good gear, mechanical hedge clippers and different types of tools which enable them to do a good job on the roads quickly and efficiently and which cut out a lot of the drudgery to which road men are subjected here owing to the primitive equipment made available to them.</P>
    <P>There is considerable dissatisfaction amongst the hackney and taxi owners in Dublin and the rest of the country. The proposals to increase the tax on these vehicles has met with considerable opposition from them.  They cannot afford this extra tax.</P>
    <P>They must pass it on to the people who will be obliged to use taxis and hackney cars.  These men do not use motor vehicles for the fun of it.  They are their means of livelihood.  Just like a person on the farm or in the shop, they are trying to give a service to the public.  But these proposals here will place an even heavier burden on them than the extra petrol tax which was imposed upon them during last year.  These men will be left without a livelihood.  Many of them were encouraged some years ago by the Fianna Fáil Government to purchase taxis or hackney cars when they came out of the Army; others of them were encouraged to purchase lorries.  These people with the hackney cars who thought they were investing in what would give them a livelihood now find themselves wavering.  They do not know whether to go on or to go back. They do not know whether to dispose of their taxis or chance remaining in business by increasing their fares in order to meet these extra expenses. <Col N="759" /> These Army men who bought trucks with their gratuities and who got facilities and permits to purchase them at that time are in a still worse way because when they were receiving the facilities so that they could use trucks on the road a decision was taken by the Minister for Industry and Com- &mdash;at the time, Mr. Lemass&mdash;to abandon the hand-won turf scheme.  That scheme was abandoned early in 1948.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>North County Dublin. There are well over 100 trucks in the parish of Rush alone, and every one of those trucks will have their tax doubled when the next taxation date comes along on the 1st January.  You can imagine what extra amount of taxation that will be.  If you have 100 trucks each paying an extra £25, it is an extra £2,500 upon those who are engaged in the provision of vegetables and other food for Dublin City.  Those extra taxes are going to be passed on to the consumer.  Somebody mentioned here in the debate that the extra charges in the matter of motor taxation would not reach the consumer. It is quite definite, however, that it will, because they have two alternatives. They must pass on the expense or they must bear it themselves. Naturally enough, they cannot bear it themselves, and the temptation is&mdash;it is a human temptation&mdash;to pass it on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>How will they be put out of business if they can pass it on that way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>If they decide to remain in business they will have to pass it on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Then they must stay in business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>They may be forced out of business, but if they remain in business they must pass the taxation on to <Col N="761" /> the community.  If they remain in business, as the Minister thinks they will, it means they are going to collect £1,000,000 some way or another from the consumers; in other words, these proposals will increase the general taxation to the extent of almost £1,000,000.</P>
      <P>There are many people using cars in order to get to their work from remote places if they have no bus services; possibly they are too far away to cycle or perhaps the mountainous countryside where they live is not suitable to cycling.  Therefore they are obliged to use their cars.  Possibly they are not very healthy, and the car is used going to and coming from their work in order to preserve their health. There are quite a number of people using cars who have to use them for these reasons.  There are not so many people using cars for pleasure purposes.  Most people have good reason for using cars, and find that it is necessary to use them in connection with their business or as commercial travellers.  Of course, commercial travellers will be hit in the same way as all other sections of the community. It is remarkable to see that the 12 h.p. car will go up by £2 per annum, just the same as the 30 h.p. car.  There is a very big difference between the type of person who uses the 12 h.p. and the 30 h.p. car, because the person who is using the bigger car probably has a better method of keeping the car on the road, of financing and meeting the expenses of using the larger car.</P>
      <P>This extra taxation on private motorists will make itself felt as well. Somebody here suggested that the 12½ per cent. reduction in insurance premiums would offset the increase in taxation.  Obviously whoever suggested that did not go into the figures; they did not calculate what it would mean. The reduction of 12½ per cent. on the insurance of an agricultural lorry would work out at about £3 third party, but the increase in tax will amount to approximately £25.  Therefore the reduction of 12½ per cent. insurance will not bring any very great benefit to the user of an agricultural truck.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is all very well for the Deputies on <Col N="762" /> the Fianna Fáil side of the House to cry salt tears here for the hackney and taxi owners.  It is only lip service at this stage.  The time to speak was before these proposals were put to this House.  Will they support the sympathy they expressed for the taxi and hackney owners by voting against the proposal to increase the rate of taxation on hackney and taxi cars?  That is the test.  We should discount arguments put forward here in favour of these men if the Deputies concerned support the Resolution.</P>
    <P>Somebody put forward the argument that this extra money for road building and maintenance will have the effect of easing the position for ratepayers.  Anyone who knows anything about the money that is made available to local authorities from the Road Fund knows that ratepayers must put up a percentage of the amount given to the local authorities from the Road Fund.</P>

      <P>I want to draw the attention of the Minister to the seriousness of the situation in County Laois.  Very recently the Donoughmore Co-operative Society were given instructions to reconstruct and improve the creamery at Spink, which is near the town of Abbeyleix.  The company saw fit to purchase new equipment and plant, and were about to undertake the erection of a new creamery at Spink when their attention was directed to the serious effect that would flow from this Resolution.  The Donoughmore Co-operative Society have a number of lorries engaged in collecting milk.  It will not pay the society to keep the number of lorries that they operate on the road.  The lorries are of the heavier type, in respect of which taxation will be increased to a very great extent under this Resolution.  I and other Deputies who represent that constituency have been informed that the Donoughmore Co-operative Society have decided not to proceed with the erection of the creamery.  This means that the milk will be left on the hands of the local farmers; that less work will be provided in the area; that drivers and helpers will be disemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister to put this matter back for serious consideration by the Government. This decision on the part of the Donoghmore Co-operative Society will <Col N="764" /> have a very serious effect in the southern parts of my constituency and in North Kilkenny, where the society purchase milk from the farmers.  If the Donoughmore Co-operative Society are compelled to tax their lorries at the proposed new very high rate, the services of some of their employees will have to be dispensed with.</P>
    <P>I view this matter with grave concern.  On behalf of the Donoughmore Co-operative Society, I protest in the strongest possible manner against the very serious inconvenience that will be caused by this very heavy additional burden of taxation.</P>
    <P>I would remind the Minister of the case of the jute factory at Clara, Offaly.  The firm of Goodbody's are the largest employers in the town and the only industrial concern in the area. The company employ practically every available man and woman in the district.  The lorries used by this company travel between Waterford and Clara daily.  The company are considering laying off the drivers and helpers on the lorries.  That will have a very serious effect on the firm, both in Waterford and Clara.  On behalf of that concern, I make the strongest possible protest.  I protest on behalf of every worker employed by Goodbody's in Clara.  Some of these workers are bound to lose their employment as a result of the proposals which the Minister has put to the House.</P>
    <P>The firm of Goodbody's have a number of lorries, apart from the heavy type of lorries that they operate between Clara and Waterford, which will be severly taxed as a result of these proposals.</P>
    <P>Any time Deputy Major de Valera speaks in this House he expresses his views coolly and calmly.  He is one of the few Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party who can address this House without insulting his opponents or hurting their feelings.</P>
    <P>I want to point out that, whilst I give Deputy Vivion de Valera all the credit due to him for the manner in which he deals with political opponents, he must be dishonest with himself.  Like Deputy Colm Gallagher, I can only compare him to Mohammed's coffin, neither up nor down, or to Lannah Machree's dog, <Col N="765" /> to which Deputy Cowan has been compared on many occasions&mdash;that goes a bit of the road with everybody but the whole of the road with no one.  Here they are, worried about the plight and the serious inconvenience of every hackney owner and taximan in Dublin &mdash;why?  Because Deputy Vivion de Valera and Deputy Colm Gallagher knew that Mr. Kelly, the secretary of the Hackney Owners' Association was in the Gallery listening.</P>

      <P>I want to point out, with respect, that in order to get into the good books of the association of the hackney owners, it was necessary for the Deputy and his colleague, Deputy Gallagher, to place on record their sympathy; but I, with all respect, ask in the presence of every Deputy here, Deputy Colm Gallagher and Deputy Vivion de Valera to show their practical sympathy, their genuine sympathy, their real regret at the inconvenience being caused to the hackney owners, by voting against this.  I believe that they will be found in the Division Lobby with the Minister for Local Government in order to put those people out of business, while at the same time they say: &ldquo;We are sorry you are being put out of business.&rdquo; They will walk into the Division Lobby to make sure they are put out of business. I can safely say that that type of tactics has not been carried on on this side of the House.  Any speeches that have been made on this side are speeches of sincerity, of genuineness, from the hearts of the Deputies who make them.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Local Government has interrupted in the course of my address.  I was endeavouring, before the Minister interrupted, to point out that he knows quite well that the speeches that have been made by his colleagues are speeches that carry no weight and are for the records of the House only, that any Deputy opposite who has made a speech in favour of the lorry owners or hackney owners or any other concern that is going to suffer as a result of this legislation knows quite well that the Party whip is on and he must vote for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure that Deputy Davin will agree with me when I say that in his native district, Rathdowney in Laois, <Col N="767" /> the brewery&mdash;which is the only source of employment in Rathdowney, which gives employment to a large number of workers, which has given lifelong and good service in solving any unemployment problem that would arise&mdash;will be very seriously affected as a result of the Minister's legislation; and on behalf of Messrs. Perry, Rathdowney, I desire to take this opportunity to protest against this severe and brutal tax that this firm will have to pay in order to keep lorries on the road. Everyone knows that Perry's Ale is transported by lorry to every town in the south of Ireland and to other areas as well.</P>

      <P>I would not dream, Sir, of mentioning the name of any firm in this debate without the full sanction of that firm.  I have been approached by Messrs. P. &amp; H. Egan, of Tullamore, by Messrs. D. E. Williams of Tullamore; I have been approached by their employees&mdash;and I consider the employees of any concern more important to me than the directors.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>You are quite right, Sir, but on each occasion on which I have disclosed the name of any firm, they admit publicly they are anxious to avoid these additional taxes and cannot pay them, or cannot afford to pay them.  On last Sunday in Tullamore I was approached by one of the directors of P. &amp; H. Egan, and was given permission to mention that firm as one firm in this House.  The same refers, and Deputy O'Higgins and Deputy Davin know, to the Donoughmore Creameries, who have written to the Deputies for the constituency asking that these matters be ventilated. We all know quite well that all those concerns, as Deputy Cowan has referred to them, give good employment, both Perrys of Rathdowney and Salts (Ireland), Limited of Tullamore. The seriousness of it for Salts (Ireland), Limited is this.  As the Minister and the House will realise, they have a number of heavy type vans on the road for the purpose of bringing their employees from other towns into Tullamore to work in the mills.  It is now going to mean that the employees living in towns surrounding Tullamore will not be taken into the mills, because there is the possibility <Col N="769" /> that it will not pay the company to tax the heavy type vans they use for transporting the workers, and it is going to mean unemployment in those areas.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Local Government knows&mdash;and we all know&mdash;that in the constituency of Laois-Offaly at the moment we have enough of Fianna Fáil monuments.  Mountmellick Maltings, a lasting monument to Fianna Fáil, closed down.  Belmont railway station closed down.  Clara railway station is on the verge of closing down. Ferbane railway station is closed down as is also Banagher railway station. The toy factory in Portlaoighise closed down and the Roscrea-Birr railway is in danger.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ensure that no more concerns go out of business. This type of legislation is only driving concerns out of business, factories out of business and workers out of employment.  It is driving people to paying higher taxation who cannot afford to do it.</P>
      <P>We believe that this is an unnecessary tax.  It is a tax that can be avoided.  It is a tax that should be avoided and it is a tax that was avoided when the inter-Party Government was in office.  To us on this side of the House goes the credit for giving more employment, more work in industry, more work in agriculture and more work in business and less taxation. We did that successfully for three and a half years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, I want to take this opportunity of expressing my protest, and in order to express my protest in a practical manner I am, unlike Deputy Gallagher and Deputy Vivion de Valera, prepared to back up my protest by my vote.  I am prepared to vote against this legislation.  I challenge Deputy Gallagher and Deputy Vivion de Valera that I will be prepared to meet them any time or any night at the meeting of the Dublin hackney owners and I guarantee that I will give them a job to explain why they expressed sympathy with them <Col N="770" /> to-night and yet voted against relieving them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>With the others who have spoken to-night, I wish to assure the House that I will not detain it for long.  It is acknowledged by Deputies on all sides of the House that the taxi owners of Dublin and hackney owners throughout the country have been very badly hit. Appeals have come from members of the Fianna Fáil Party but they had no effect.  It now remains to be seen whether they will support the case they made in the House by voting in opposition to the impost which this Resolution will mean to the taxi owners of Dublin.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Gallagher but I do not agree that Dublin hackney owners should get any more favourable assistance than the hackney drivers throughout the country, all of whom have to pay very heavy costs in the maintenance of their vehicles.  The fact that they are away from home increases their financial liabilities. Since we spoke on the increased cost of drivers' licences, two particular towns in my own constituency are very much concerned at the moment in relation to transport.  It is acknowledged by many members of this House and by people in the country that there is a designed effort, a distinct intention, in this legislation to drag many of the heavy vehicles off the road and divert them to the railways. Why should two of the five towns in my constituency, with a population of over 1,000, be deprived of rail facilities. Why should the traders in those towns be denied the opportunity of transporting their goods by rail?  Why should all the cattle that are sold in Kanturk and the pigs and other agricultural produce put up for sale at the markets be diverted to the roads at a time when there is in this Resolution an effort to make it impossible for the people at present engaged in road transport to carry on their business?  We feel that the people are certainly up against it inasmuch as the Minister has turned a deaf ear to their appeal.  Before the year is out, there will be increased costs in every Government Department if this legislation is passed to-night.</P>

This evening we had a statement from Deputy Rooney which, I think, will cause considerable surprise even to those of us in the House who have heard him speak on many occasions here.</P>
      <P>His proposition was an outstanding one, that the more money the central authority gives to a local authority for road improvement the more money the county council or local authority will themselves have to spend for that purpose and the more money the ratepayers of that local authority will have to provide.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>The farmers of North County Dublin will themselves, <Col N="773" /> as intelligent people, realise that under this Resolution, when it is passed into law, there will be a much larger contribution for road improvements from the Central Fund. Consequently, the farmers who are ratepayers will have to contribute less than they might have to contribute, if this Resolution was never passed.</P>
      <P>Deputy Rooney had a further extraordinary point to make, that it was unfair that the owners of motor vehicles should have to bear this burden and that other sections of the community should be called upon to bear it.  Who does Deputy Rooney want to bear this burden?</P>

Does he want the farmers to contribute more than they are contributing? Does he want the ordinary trader in his constituency to contribute more than he is contributing at the moment?  If the roads are being used and worn mainly by motor vehicles, and particularly the owners of very heavy vehicles which do most damage, why should not the owners of these vehicles pay for the damage they do to the roads?</P>

      <P>Does Deputy Rooney think that the people with the horses and carts or the person with the bicycle should be taxed so as to relieve the obligation which this Resolution imposes on the owners of motor vehicles?  There is altogether too much loose thinking in regard to this whole problem.  It has always been the contention of the farmers and farmers' representatives that the main responsibility for the upkeep and improvement of roads should be on the shoulders of those who do the damage to the roads.  That has always been put forward by representatives of farmers and, when that provision is being made in this Resolution, we have a Deputy who, as I say, purports to represent farmers, saying that it is wrong that the burden should be <Col N="774" /> placed on the people who wear and damage the roads and that it should be put on the shoulders of the cyclists, as Deputy Flanagan suggested the other day&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Present progress and development, not only here but elsewhere, should be taken into account and, if it were I do not think we would have had the length we have had in this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been invited by Deputy O'Higgins to make some reference to the taximen, and I have already on the first Resolution spoken with regard to them.  The taximen have not made the case to anybody that they wanted the old rates of tax to remain as Deputy Alfred Byrne suggests in his amendment, nor have they suggested as <Col N="779" /> Deputy MacBride suggests in his amendment that the rates should be 25 per cent. lower than the rates proposed in the Resolution.  What they have asked is that the Minister should consider that they have a special case for a flat rate of duty of £20 per annum. That is what the representatives of the taxi and hackney owners have put forward to the Minister and that is what they have asked Deputies to support. I heard Deputy Dunne supporting that to-day.  That was the request they made to the Minister, but Deputies, at least some Deputies, think that they can do better than the organised opinion of the representatives of the taxi and hackney owners and have put down two amendments, which they invite us to support.</P>
    <P>One is that they should get a 25 per cent. reduction on the new rates.  That was Deputy MacBride's suggestion, something not even proposed, something not even suggested, by the representatives of the taxi and hackney owners.  Deputy Alfred Byrne puts down an amendment that there should be no alteration in the present rates of duty with regard to taxi and hackney owners, again something which the association has not asked anyone to advocate, recommend or vote for in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy think that the association is against that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have put forward already and put forward again now what Deputy Dunne put forward to-day and what I have been requested by the Taxi and Hackney Owners' Association to support: that they should have a flat rate of duty and that that flat rate should be £20 per annum.  I think that is a reasonable suggestion.  I thought, when I first read it, that the representatives of the taxi and hackney owners had taken a sound constructive line and I think that those Deputies who supported that and asked the Minister to consider it sympathetically and seriously are doing more for the taxi and hackney owners than will be done by amendments just drawn out of the hat and put down.  Then I am <Col N="780" /> asked by Deputy Rooney to go into the Lobby and vote for something which I have not been asked to support by the representatives of the Taxi and Hackney Owners' Association.  Deputies cannot have it both ways.  If I had been asked by the association I would have put down an amendment on the lines of their suggestion but we had Deputy MacBride jumping in the moment the Resolution appeared and writing out an amendment to give them a 25 per cent. reduction without any realisation of what they intended and we had Deputy Alfred Byrne following on the next day with an amendment that they were to remain at the old rates of duty.  I have not been asked to support that and I have no intention of supporting it.</P>

      <P>I feel that Deputy Major de Valera, Deputy Gallagher and other Deputies have strongly advocated that the case put forward by the Taxi and Hackney Owners' Association is a fair case, and the Minister has some time to consider that case on its merits.  I sincerely hope that that consideration&mdash;backed up by the support the case has got in this House from Deputies on all sides&mdash; will result in those taxi and hackney owners receiving the request that they have made to the Minister, his representatives and to the Deputies. I do not think it serves a useful purpose for Deputies to suggest that one makes that suggestion to the Minister but does not give two hoots whether or not the Minister agrees with it.  Deputies are entitled to say that if they wish but if, every time a Deputy speaks in this House, his motives are to be open to question in that way I do not think it will lead to this House's doing the business of the country in the successful way in which it ought to be done.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before paragraph (h) to insert a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(h) Motor vehicles used for questing and owned by charitable institutions supported by public subscriptions and used solely by such charitable institutions shall be exempt from the increases provided in the foregoing paragraphs.</P>
      <P>I presume that the Minister is aware that there are a number of charitable institutions solely supported by voluntary subscriptions which care for old and infirm people.  There are at least three homes in Dublin run by the Little Sisters of the Poor, one in Cork, and one in Waterford.  The cars owned by these communities are used solely for questing for food and other necessaries for the maintenance of the hundreds of old people kept in these homes.  Due to the rising costs of all classes of materials, etc., these and similar homes dependent on voluntary support are finding it difficult to meet their commitments for the upkeep of the homes, and if called upon to meet a further burden by the imposition of this tax, these communities will be placed in a very serious position.  I, therefore, move that such charitable institutions be exempted from the tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy who has just moved this amendment would, I am sure, be the first to realise that, once you start to consider making exemptions of one kind or another, the list can become a very formidable one. Apart altogether from that consideration, there is the administrative difficulty, the difficulty of determining what particular vehicle and what particular type of charity should be relieved in this fashion.  No previous representations have been made to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an amendment that might, with more effect, be considered on the Committee Stage of the Bill which will follow these Resolutions.  I want to say to the House that, whatever the case might be for this or any other similar plea for any particular class, I would have to take the line that, once you give the concession to one particular class, then of course the pressure is increased in order to effect a similar concession in other directions. Although, during the course of this discussion it was charged against me and the Department and, indeed, the Government, that we did not give careful considerations to these proposals, I want the Deputies opposite to take my word that that is not the case.  These proposals are the result of a very careful examination carried out by an inter-departmental committee.  Indeed, the recommendations of that committee have been modified very substantially by myself and by Government decision.  For that reason then, much and all as I dislike having sort of to stand firm, and maybe give the impression to the Deputy making this plea that I do not <Col N="787" /> want to meet the House in any way, I ask him and the House to appreciate my difficulties.  I must, therefore, resist this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever case the Minister may have for resisting the amendment, the reasons which he has given are far from convincing.  These were that one of the difficulties of meeting a claim of this kind is that if you start making exemptions you get into difficulties. The House will remember that this year it was presented with a Finance Bill.  The purpose of the Finance Bill was to exempt dance-hall proprietors from paying tax on their dance halls, and this House, with its eyes wide open, put £140,000 into the pockets of the dance-hall proprietors in the same way as we are now going to impose increased taxation on motor vehicles owned by charitable organisations which are being kept out of debt, if they are being kept out of debt, by public subscriptions.</P>
      <P>It is a bit thick to tell us in the month of October, 1952, that you cannot make exemptions from taxation for charitable organisations which have to run motor vehicles when, in the month of April or May, we handed over £140,000 to dance-hall proprietors with a special exemption for them.  Where is the heart of the Minister in the matter?  One hundred and forty thousand pounds for dance-hall proprietors as a special exemption, while the unfortunate people who run charitable organisations are going to get the full impact of the Minister's new motor-car taxation proposals.  I do not think it is fair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the House is dividing on this matter, it ought to remember that we <Col N="788" /> cannot lightly, with any pretext of holding ourselves respectable before the public, in the same year give a grant of £140,000 to dance-hall proprietors and inflict the impact of this taxation on charitable organisations which run motor vehicles.  It is unfair to tax these charitable organisations which are doing their best to keep their heads above water.  I hope that when Deputy Doyle's amendment is put, the House will show its sympathy with these charitable organisations.</P>

      <P>Deputy MacBride is not able to be present to-night and has asked me to move amendment No. 3 for him:</P>
      <P>Before paragraph (h) to insert a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(h) notwithstanding anything contained in this Resolution, all the owners of mechanically propelled vehicles which are used solely or mainly as taxis or hackney cars plying for public service shall be entitled to a rebate of 25 per cent. on the rates of duty provided in the Schedule to this Resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of the amendment is to <Col N="791" /> provide that the owners of mechanically propelled vehicles which are used solely or mainly as taxis or hackney-cars plying for public service shall be entitled to a rebate of 25 per cent. on the rates of duty provided in the Schedule to the Resolution.  In short, the object of the amendment is to provide that the impact of the increased rates of motor taxation will not apply to hackney owners or taxi owners.  We all know the general pattern of life of taximen and hackney owners.  In the main, they are people who manage to get a small sum of money together and invest that sum in taxis or hackney cars.  Those of us who are familiar with their occupations know only too well that they get from the occupations a hardly-earned and precarious livelihood.</P>
    <P>In recent years the position in respect of earning a decent livelihood by these two occupations has, if anything, seriously deteriorated; firstly, because of the influx of new persons into the business and, secondly, because, on the hackney owners' side, there is a certain amount of pirating going on.  By that I mean individuals taking out a small public service vehicle licence and operating a private car on a public service vehicle licence, using that car in the main for their own private purposes or perhaps using it in order to skim off the creamy traffic that may be going.</P>
    <P>In this Resolution the Government are seeking to impose a heavy tax on these hackney and taxi owners.  I know nothing in these two callings which entitles us to feel that they are capable of bearing the tax which will be imposed under this Resolution. They are men whose resources are slender and who earn a precarious livelihood and I do not think that in the year in which we have imposed on the people the toughest Budget they have known for the past 30 years we should impose this additional taxation on persons who follow the occupation of hackney or taxi owners.  It is unfair that they should be asked to bear this burden in present circumstances, especially having regard to the small <Col N="792" /> return which they get from following these occupations.</P>
    <P>Anybody who knows the Dublin taximan knows that he is on the streets morning, noon and night endeavouring to earn a livelihood.  There is no livelihood for him unless he can manage to ply for hire at all hours of the day and night.  Similarly, with the small hackney owner in the country whose burden in respect of running his car is so heavy that he gets a very meagre livelihood from his occupation. Although we have clear evidence and although abundant evidence can be furnished to the Minister that these two occupations are in no sense remunerative, yet the House is asked to pass this Resolution which imposes a heavy burden on those two particular avocations.</P>
    <P>This impost is an unfair one on people with such slender resources, and if there were a free vote of this House there certainly would be such sympathy with the taxi and hackney owners that the House would express itself in favour of waiving this new burden so far as these two classes are concerned. I cannot understand how the Minister can be impervious to appeals for relief for these two classes.  I believe there is widespread sympathy on all sides of the House with the claim made in this amendment.  If the Minister wants to test the real feeling of the House on the matter he ought to leave the amendment to a free vote of the House.</P>

      <P>My amendment asks for complete exemption for taxi and hackneymen.  I know of the conditions just outlined by Deputy Norton.  These men are working 12 hours a day and until the early hours of the morning. This is the same as putting a tax on workmen's tools.  You first tax their bread and butter and their household goods.  You tax their tyres and their petrol and their oil, and then you tax the machine which they use to earn their living and to pay the other taxes. I appeal to the Minister to exempt taxis and hackneys from this extra taxation.  If the Minister will not <Col N="793" /> exempt them completely, I ask him to accept the recommendation of the taximen's association for a £20 flat rate.  There are at least six Deputies of his own Party, whom I could name, but it would not be right, who promised faithfully that they would approach the Minister and ask him to accept the £20 flat rate.  Deputy Moran yesterday, Deputy de Valera to-day and Deputy Gallagher, pleaded with the Minister for these men. Deputy de Valera said that the taximen had a splendid case, and had a claim on his generosity.  Deputy Norton asked for a free vote of the House, which he is not likely to get. If the Minister does not wish to give way to the Opposition, at least he should give way to the pressure put on him by his own followers, who were approached in the country, and gave a definite guarantee to these men that they would see that their means of livelihood was not further taxed.</P>
      <P>As I say, Deputy Moran pleaded with the Minister yesterday and Deputy de Valera to-day made an earnest plea to him, and I think Deputy Cowan also made an appeal.  Yet the Minister will not listen to these Deputies who know the conditions under which these men work.</P>
      <P>If I can challenge a division on my amendment that there should be complete exemption for them I will do so.  I ask the Minister, however, if he cannot give a complete exemption at least to accept the recommendation of the taximen's association for a £20 flat rate for hackneys and taxicabs, which are at present so heavily over-burderned, and give them an opportunity to continue in their business. Most of these men were in the National Army and got a gratuity, having served the country well.  They put their gratuities into taxis and hackney cars and now the Minister is driving them out of business, and they will get nothing for their cars.  I support the appeal made by the other members of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already, in the course of this discussion, dealt fairly fully with the pleas that I admit have been advanced to me in the House and to pleas that have been made to <Col N="794" /> me within the past few weeks by all the interests, I might say, that are affected by these proposals.  We have disposed of an amendment by Deputy Doyle, in which he sought to relieve charitable institutions.  I was pressed by interests who were concerned about taxi owners throughout the country. Both from outside this House and in this House pleas were made to me that I should exempt certain types of lorries and exempt certain types of owners.  Now there are members of this House who are members of local bodies and, as has been pointed out here by Government speakers, the question I must ask myself is&mdash;Is it reasonable to permit a situation to continue in the case of taxis, hackneys and lorries in which the charges fixed upon these vehicles were determined as far back as 1926, when costs were entirely different from what they are to-day and while the rates struck by the different local bodies in the country for the maintenance and the making of roads have increased by 100 per cent. since 1939?  Is it reasonable to suggest that, with these growing costs and with the growing pressure of the increased traffic from motor-cars, lorries and all such vehicles on our roads, we should allow a system of taxation to prevail that was determined as far back as 1926?</P>
      <P>It is all very well for Deputies of this House to make pleas to me.  It is their duty to make those pleas whether they are members of the Party to which I belong or members of the Opposition.  They often come to me privately and they often make the case that perhaps here is a class that should be met in such and such a way; here is a class that should be treated differently from all other classes.  If I have to set myself out, as I had to in this case, to increase the Road Fund by a certain amount&mdash;and I did not manage to make the round figure of £1,000,000 per annum&mdash;I must, having considered the interests of every class and the extent to which they will be affected by the proposals, resist those pleas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me say this in regard to the hackney owners and the taxi owners. The concessions which they obtained <Col N="795" /> in the Supplementary Budget of 1947 were extended to them because of the special circumstances which existed at the time in regard to them.  There was no protest made previously because of the fact that taxis and hackney cars were treated on the same basis as private cars from 1926 to 1947.  As I admitted in the course of the discussion here every day, when any class get a concession such as was given to the taxi owners and hackney owners in 1947, it is only natural that they would strive to hold on to those concessions. But, just as in the case of other vehicles, in regard to which an amendment which we will come to later proposes to deal, I do not think a real case can be made having regard to the necessities of the Road Fund, having regard to the condition of our roads, having regard to the cost of road improvement and road maintenance, and having regard to the fact that the tax on those vehicles was fixed as far back as 1926 except for the increase that was imposed on private cars in 1947.</P>
    <P>Looking at my responsibility and looking at the responsibility of local bodies all over the country, and listening to all the clamour that I hear day in and day out while the Dáil is sitting, asking me to contribute more substantially from the Road Fund, to contribute to Youghal Bridge, to the bridge in Wexford, to Gweebarra Bridge in Donegal, to provide funds for one purpose or another, I am sure that no reasonable person will deny the necessity for increased funds being made available.  Deputy Norton's speech drew my attention to the fact that there was some unemployment among road workers in his area.</P>
    <P>He sought to influence me to make a special grant in the case of the county he represents, although the entire sum of money in the Road Fund this year had been allotted to the different county councils.  In reply to those who question me as to whether or not the funds which I am endeavouring to get to-day will be used for the purpose of repairing and maintaining roads, I can at least point to the Road Fund for this year and say <Col N="796" /> I have established here for the first time in years the principle of giving, and I have persuaded the Government for the first time in years to give, the entire Road Fund for the making of our roads.  I do not like to resist all those pleas that have been made to me. I do not want to be obliged to take up the position of fighting every corner and resisting every plea.  That is really not my nature.  If I could dissociate my responsibility from what is my nature I would not deserve the description sometimes applied to me of being rigid and unbending.  I must resist those pleas because I know the money is required.  In asking this House to give me the money for the purpose I have stated, I will give a guarantee to the House that while I am responsible for local government my behaviour will be in accordance with my performance this year and I will struggle to see that every penny that comes into that fund will be used for the purpose for which it was put in there.  The roads of our country are crying out for more money now.  It must be got in some way and as far as these proposals are concerned we have examined them very carefully indeed and we are imposing the tax without doing any real hardship to any deserving case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I was discussing the Road Fund.  The dance tax was discussed here.  It was discussed in three by-elections down the country and you can discuss it on the hustings again as much as you will.  I am here to do the nation's business and the nation's work as I see it.  I do not want any irrelevancies introduced into this discussion.  I am making a plea for a deserving cause and I am taking a stand for a worthy cause.  That is why I am asking all the tender hearts pleading for one section or another to see the reasonableness of my approach to what our problems are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us see what the additional hardships are, and, mind you, I admit that in the case of hackneymen and taximen, every shilling counts.  That is the <Col N="797" /> case with the ordinary working man, too.  I am not denying that, but let us see if there is as much in the claim that has been made by Deputies during the course of this discussion. I will give you some figures that have been supplied to me by the Hackney and Taxi Owners' Association, showing their methods to keep their business going.  These are their own figures:&mdash; Weekly outlay on taxi: garage rent, 12s. 6d.; maintenance, 5/-; workmen's compensation, 3/-; petrol, £4 19s. 2d.; oils, 10s. 6d.; depreciation, £1 5s.; insurance, £1 7s.; p.s.v. licence, 1s. 6d.; total, £9 3s. 8d.  That is the burden the taximan has to carry in the ordinary way.  These are his overheads. Now, add road tax and driving licence, 4/- per week.  The total addition to his overheads arising from road tax and driving licence amounts to 4/- a week.</P>
    <P>I admit that 4/- a week can be an important item to a working man, but it is extravagant to suggest that, if a man's overheads are already £12 13s. 8d., the addition of 4/- will put him out of his business.  This 4/- is important, but that claim is complete and absolute exaggeration.</P>
    <P>I ask the members of the House to stand firmly behind these proposals, because, as I have already said, most of them, during the past years, have been advocating increased expenditure on roads.  Most of the Deputies who are criticising me now will be back in this House next week or the week after &mdash;and they are entitled&mdash;asking me parliamentary questions as to why bridges are not built, roads are not made and more money is not made available.  They must realise that money can be provided for these purposes from only two sources, the rates on the county they represent and the Road Fund.  The rates for roads have gone up 100 per cent. since 1939.</P>
    <P>These taxes have not been moved, except in the case of private cars, since 1926.  If political considerations are eliminated, and if Deputies could speak according to the dictates of their hearts on these matters, I know which way Deputies, especially those who are members of county councils and who hear the complaints of the ratepayers in regard to the rates, would vote <Col N="798" /> when the division bell rings and the count is taken.</P>

The speech to which we have just listened boils down to this: &ldquo;The hackney and taximan have made a case showing the load they are carrying and have asked me to relieve them of some of the load.&rdquo;  The Minister's reply is: &ldquo;No, I will put more on you.  I will weigh you down more.&rdquo;  That is the Fianna Fáil philosophy throughout the country&mdash;to tax and tax and, if you grumble or growl, to put more taxation on you.  That is an astounding situation.  The Minister barefacedly admits that he has the figures that the hackneymen gave him to show that they should be relieved of some of the burden.  He comes in here and says that because there was no change since 1926 he will put more on them.  He says that if the people could vote according to their consciences they would vote fully with him.  If he wants to test that, let the consciences operate, take off the Whips.</P>

      <P>I support the amendments. With Deputy Byrne and Deputy MacEoin I appeal to the Minister to allow a free vote of the House in this matter.  When the Minister quoted that figure of 4/- a week, in respect of road tax and driving licences, what horse-power car was he referring to?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely he was not referring to a car of a higher horse-power than ten?  The average taxi owner and hackney owner pays at least from £16 to £20 and will now have to pay at least £6 per car.  The figure given by the Minister is misleading inasmuch as it applies only to ten horse-power cars, very few of which are in use as small public service vehicles.</P>
      <P>I remind the Minister that the majority of taxi owners or hackney car owners are not wealthy.  The proof that their occupation is not over-remunerative is the fact that very few of them continue operating these cars for a very long time.  In many cases they are people who are not very robust and who engage in this enterprise as being a light form of work.  The Minister represents a rural constituency.  Has he adverted to the fact that a hackney car performs a very useful service in a locality?</P>
      <P>I would put two points before the Minister.  In many cases, ex-soldiers, ex-civic guards and other retired persons who are not fit for other work engage in this business.  The second point is that these people are already paying tax on petrol.  If the Minister wants money for the Road Fund, I would appeal to him not to place this burden on a section of the community that is not able to bear it.</P>

      <P>The Minister put on a Casabianca act to-night.  The heroism of Casabianca has nothing on the Minister this evening.  The Minister was the one person who had so re-organised the Road Fund that, in future, everybody could look with pride <Col N="800" /> to the Road Fund, even though it is now going to be built up by additional taxation to the tune of £800,000 some of which is to be got by asking an ordinary motor driver to pay more for his licence, by making the hackneyman and the taximan pay more for his road licence and by making a whole lot of small people in the transport industry pay additional taxation.  The Minister takes pride in the fact that he is building up a Road Fund by imposing these burdens on a lot of relatively small people.</P>
      <P>I was rather amazed at the analysis which the Minister made of the burdens which are at present imposed on taxi owners.  The taxi owners apparently went to the Minister and said: &ldquo;Look here, Minister, have a look at the taxes we are compelled to pay out of the total of £500 a year to keep a taxi going&rdquo; and they asked would the Minister meet their viewpoint.  They were told: &ldquo;You come here with a grievance saying you are opposed to more taxes on your taxis; go away out of that; look at the burdens you are bearing already; do not annoy me, my main concern is to build up a Road Fund by another £800,000.&rdquo;  That was a cheery message for every sufferer going to the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>On the motion for the Adjournment, Deputy Norton has given notice that he would raise the subject matter of Questions Nos. 46 and 47 on the Order Paper for Thursday, 23rd October.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>On the 23rd October I addressed a parliamentary question to the Minister as follows&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;To ask the Minister for Social Welfare whether he is aware of the serious inconvenience caused to insured persons by reason of the suspension of dental benefit; if he will state what steps have been taken to bring about a settlement of the dispute between his Department and <Col N="801" /> the dentists, and how the matter now stands.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In reply to that, the Minister said that there was a dispute and that since the 1st April last no dental benefit whatever had been made available to insured persons.  He indicated that in March last he made what he described as a final effort to keep the dental benefit available, but as the dentists at that time would not withdraw some demand which they had made&mdash;described by the Minister as &ldquo;a demand for contracting out&rdquo;&mdash;he had done nothing since March last.</P>
    <P>In other words, seven months have now gone by during which the Minister has maintained a magnificent indifference to the hardships imposed on insured persons throughout the country by reason of the suspension of dental benefits.  Surely if he is going to adopt that attitude also during the next 12 months, no dental benefit whatever will be available for insured persons for another year?  Normally, dental benefits were regarded as necessary in order to provide facilities for dental treatment for insured persons.  They have had no such benefit made available to them for the last seven months. This situation may go on for another seven or another 12 months&mdash;because the Minister says that since March last he has done nothing.  In reply to supplementary questions, he indicated that there was apparently to be no change of attitude as far as he was concerned.  Insured persons, therefore, have been denied this benefit for the past seven months, and there is now not even a glimmer of hope that they are going to get it.</P>
    <P>People who suffer from dental ailments cannot decide to abstain from going to dentists.  They have to go, day after day and week after week, for treatment.  As a result, the insured person is not merely paying his national health insurance contribution for dental treatment, but is being compelled to pay the dentist himself, even though he has contributed to a State fund to provide that benefit for him.  Even though the Minister may have a personal point of view to defend in this matter, he must recognise that <Col N="802" /> it is a thoroughly unsatisfactory position.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to import any heat into this discussion, as it is far too serious for the importation of heat, but I cannot congratulate the Minister on the magnificent aloofness he has displayed. We have unfortunate people on very slender resources being compelled to-day to pay the entire cost of dental treatment, including the entire cost of fitting new dentures.  That is a burden they cannot bear except at heavy sacrifice in some other directions &mdash;either by borrowing money or by stinting themselves in some other field.  Instead of getting half the cost of dental treatment&mdash;which is their right under the National Health Insurance Acts or under the current code of social security&mdash;they are getting no benefit whatever.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the Minister intends to fight this case with the dentists to the last tooth of the insured person. The Department is engaged in a deadly struggle with the dentists.  They are not suffering and neither is the Department: it is the unfortunate insured person who is getting all the bullets in this war.  If the Minister or the dentists want to wage such a war, it is thoroughly unfair of them to make the insured person the target.  The war was not caused by the insured person, but he is the sole victim.</P>

      <P>Is not that always the way in a strike?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Usually a strike is caused by the workmen going on strike. In this case the insured persons did not cause it and cannot settle it, they have no influence in the matter.  Those suffering from dental ailments are now carrying all the wounds of this battle of high principle between the dentists and the Minister.  It is unfair to use-those people as a weapon and compel them to pay out of their own resources to meet these demands.  That situation does not reflect credit on anybody. Here in 1952 a war between the dentists and the Government compels the entire insured population to forgo all claims. to dental benefits.  The Minister will not deny that they are entitled to a proper dental service and that it is his function and that of the dentists to see <Col N="803" /> that they get it as in the past.  It is essential that that should be continued for them in the future.  Both sides must try to settle this dispute on terms which will enable this service to be restored.</P>
      <P>I asked the Minister the other day if he was prepared to submit this matter to arbitration.  He said he was not. On the other hand, the dentists may not be prepared to submit to arbitration either.  Is that not most callous indifference by both sides to the insured persons, the victims in this battle of high principle?  This war should not be allowed to continue for another seven or another 12 months. The Minister and the dentists should endeavour to settle it between them. If, however, as often happens between two litigants or two sides in an industrial dispute, they cannot settle it between them by discussion and contacts, they should find some other means of settling it.</P>
      <P>If the Minister will approach the matter from the standpoint that this thing has got to be settled on some equitable basis, then other means ought to be found of settling this dispute if it cannot be settled by direct negotiation between the Minister and the dentists.  It is clearly unfair to the insured persons that this tug-o'-war between the Minister and the dentists should continue imposing, as it does, such serious hardships on the insured population.</P>
      <P>I put it to the Minister that he ought to take the initiative.  The Minister can afford to be big and broadminded. Often it is harder to appear to be weak than to be strong.  The Minister ought to take the initiative in making another effort to get a settlement of this dispute between himself and the dentists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not said, in the course of my remarks, that he ought to concede the claim of the dentists.  I am not expressing any opinion on the merits of the dispute between the Minister and the dentists.  I want to see the matter settled by direct negotiation, but if it is not possible to settle it that way the only way it can be settled is to refer the matter to arbitration by some independent person or group of independent <Col N="804" /> persons.  Both sides can put their case before the arbitrator or group of arbitrators.  If we are going to have this service provided in the future a tribunal of one or three persons could, I am sure, find a satisfactory settlement of the matters which are now in dispute.  This dispute will have to be settled some time, but if both sides adopt the existing attitude then the insured person is going to pay heavier in the future than to-day.</P>
    <P>The Minister ought to have regard to his heavy responsibility, as the provider of these services, for the insured persons who have paid for them, and take the initiative in having a further conference with the dentists. If he cannot resolve the difficulty that way, the matter could be referred to an arbitration tribunal to decide on the merits.  Let us have some satisfactory settlement by submitting the matter of the dispute to the arbitrament of a competent and fair-minded arbitration tribunal.</P>

      <P>I put a question down in connection with this matter on the day on which Deputy Norton put his question down.  The same reply was given.  I agree with everything Deputy Norton said but let me give a typical case.  I know a girl&mdash;she is an insured person&mdash;who is waiting and waiting and was about to get the benefits.  When this trouble started she had to go ahead.  When she felt there was no hope of a settlement, she went to her own private dentist.  When the dispute is settled will that girl and others in similar circumstances who went to their own private dentists, paying somewhat more than they would in the ordinary way, get retrospective payments and the grant they were normally entitled to and put it towards the expenses they have undergone?  If the Minister says they can do that the grievances of those people will not be such serious ones.  If they can go now to the dentist and get treatment knowing that whatever they were entitled to in the ordinary way under the insurance will be forthcoming, it would be a great help.</P>

      <P>The matter to which Deputy Norton and Deputy <Col N="805" /> Byrne referred was brought home forcibly to me on receipt of a letter from the mother of a large family whose husband is an invalid.  Some months ago, this woman had teeth extracted but as a result of this unfortunate difficulty in the Department she has been unable to obtain her dentures.</P>
      <P>Accompanying the letter was a doctor's certificate to the effect that another ailment had resulted in consequence of the fact that she did not have her dentures during those months.  She will now have to undergo a course of treatment away from home. This woman, who is the mother of a large young family, was unable to pay for the dentures.  I am sure there are other cases such as the one I have outlined.  With the other Deputies who have spoken, I would ask the Minister to bring this matter to a conclusion, so that these people will get their dentures before any other evil effects result from the position which now exists.</P>

I could quote a number of cases to the Minister.  A month ago, a young man was ordered to get 16 teeth extracted, and the first thing he had to do was to pay three guineas.  I know of a number of people who have had their teeth extracted for the past four months and their doctors have advised them to get dentures.  When this dispute is settled, will these people be compensated for the extra charge that will be made on them?  What is the cause of the dispute?  What is the nature of the dispute between the Minister and the dentist?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>At that time, Deputy Norton took a different attitude.  He said that if he got any more trouble with this scheme he would hand the whole thing over to the Minister for Health, that if any further expenditure was incurred under the scheme, he did not want any more to do with it.  He talks now about me doing nothing for the past six or seven months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The dentists not only looked for increased scales, but they asked for this matter of contracting out.  I believe that this concession they are looking for is most unjust to the insured person, because they were prepared to <Col N="807" /> accept, if they got it, ten guineas for dentures if the insured person would take the dentures as prescribed under the scheme; but they wanted to be at liberty to say to the patient: &ldquo;If you come to me as a private patient, I will give you the same dentures as I give to my private patients at £21.&rdquo;  They wanted us to agree that we would give the five guineas, whether the patient took the ordinary dentures at ten guineas or agreed to come in as a private patient, and let the unfortunate patient pay roughly £15.  I think that is very unfair because I know very well that if a dentist says to a person who goes to him: &ldquo;Will you have the ordinary dentures or the same dentures as I give my private patients?&rdquo;  the patient will do his utmost to get the best.  He will say: &ldquo;I would rather have the dentures you give your private patient&rdquo; and will pay this exorbitant price of £15 extra. We made inquiries, and so far as we could find out the extra charge to the mechanic who makes the dentures was in the region of 35/- and not £10 for the private patient's dentures.  That is why we would not agree to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Why should we agree to it?  It would be a scandal to agree to it, because I know from experience, from hearing people talking about these things, that when a person goes to get dentures, glasses or for an operation, he likes to get the best and, in this case, will take the other dentures as being much better than the ordinary dentures prescribed by the Social Welfare Department and will make every endeavour to get them.  We said to the Dentists' Association that we were quite prepared to negotiate with regard to increased fees and to pay them more than they were being paid in 1948 and more than they were paid in February, 1951, when Deputy Norton could see no reason why they should get more.  At that time, he told the people negotiating with him that he could see no reason why they should get more.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I kept the dental service going.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>You did.  You kept it going until they sent in an ultimatum which had not expired at the time the Deputy expired out of the Department, but that ultimatum was there and we had to meet it.  They got an increase in fees, but they were not satisfied. They said they would only take it&mdash;it was 15 per cent., a fairly substantial increase&mdash;on their working to 31st March of this year and when it came to 31st March of this year, they wanted a further increase of something like 15 per cent., and, as well, this contracting-out arrangement.  We said that while we were quite prepared to negotiate with regard to increased charges&mdash;we did not think they were really justified but we were anxious to settle the matter&mdash;we said we would not agree to the contracting-out provision. If I am pressed by Deputy Norton, Deputy Byrne or any other Deputy to settle the matter, the dentists will get to know that and it will be more difficult to negotiate with them.  I am quite prepared to meet the dentists to-morrow, if they are prepared to meet me but they sent me word in the middle of May that they had taken a ballot of their members and that there was a substantial majority against accepting.</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton says that this is unfair to the insured person.  It is, but I want to make this correction in that regard&mdash;the insured person is not paying for these dental benefits.  It was an uncovenanted benefit up to the end of September last because there was a surplus coming from the contributions paid up to that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Where did you get the contributions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Now, since 1st October, the contributions are calculated on a basis barely sufficient to meet the benefits, apart from these medical benefits, and these medical benefits will be taken charge of by the Department of Health.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows but <Col N="809" /> does not want to tell his followers behind him, because it would not suit him, that that was actuarially necessary to meet the benefits accruing under the insurance at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It was never necessary after amalgamation and you know it well, if you know anything about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows there was an actuarial examination for five years and whatever was surplus at that time was put aside for medical benefits. The medical benefits were paid, and whatever was left was deemed to be actuarially necessary for the payment of benefits.  The Deputy is now out of the Department and can make all these demands as a free man, as the heroic Leader of the Labour Party.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not paid at the moment but that is not going to stand in my way, because I would do everything possible to get these dental benefits restored, and the Minister for Finance provided in his Budget a sum of £500,000 for the payment of medical benefits to insured people.  In the White Paper on health which was issued, these benefits are again guaranteed, in a better way, I hope, than in <Col N="810" /> the past.  I do not think that anybody in my place would be prepared to give the dentists their demands if they are extravagant, and I consider them extravagant.</P>
      <P>I think the only way to meet this problem&mdash;unfortunately it will take a little time&mdash;is the way we are proceeding to meet it in the Department, that is, by getting local authorities to appoint full-time dentists.  These are now beginning to give dental treatment to at least the lower income group, those entitled to free treatment at the moment.  As soon as that full-time staff under the local authorities is further increased, we hope to take in the middle income group, and the first class in that middle income group will be the insured people, because they were entitled to these benefits up to this moment.  So far as I am concerned, I can assure the Dáil that I will do everything possible to have these benefits restored as soon as possible, but that is all I can say at the moment. What is more, if Deputy Norton or anybody else can get the dentists to meet me any day, I am quite prepared to talk to them.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Friday, 31st October, 1952.</P>
