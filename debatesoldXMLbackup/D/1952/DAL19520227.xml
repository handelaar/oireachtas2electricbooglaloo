      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if, when customers are required to transfer their tea, butter and sugar ration coupons to a new supplier on the closing of the shop from which they had been in the habit of getting those foodstuffs, he will arrange that the new supplier will be granted quotas of tea, butter and sugar at the subsidised prices as soon as the customers' coupons are surrendered to him.</P>

      <P>Early this year I had occasion to review the previous practice in such cases and I decided that, from then on, the practice should be modified so as to take account of circumstances created by the closing of a shop.  Under the revised arrangements, appropriate allowances of rationed tea, butter and sugar will, in circumstances such as the Deputy has mentioned, be made available on application to the traders concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state (a) the present capital value of each of the hotels owned by Córas Iompair Éireann, and (b) the net profit made by each of these hotels in the last three years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The hotels of Córas Iompair Éireann are operated on a commercial basis and consequently I <Col N="1074" /> do not think it would be desirable to give separately for each of the hotels the particulars sought by the Deputy. The capital value of the six hotels owned by the company was £313,504 at the 31st March, 1951.  In the calendar years 1948 and 1949 a net profit was derived from the hotels amounting to £2,967 and £1,403 respectively.  The accounting year for the company was subsequently altered and in the 15 months to the 31st March, 1951, there was a net loss in the operation of the hotels amounting to £14,741.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>I think these figures are rather important because this is one of the few activities which Córas Iompair Éireann undertake which is known to be a profitable enterprise, and I wonder would the Minister consider them satisfactory from an hotelier's point of view.</P>

It is anticipated that these improvements will have been completed in time for the summer tourist traffic this year, and I am assured by British Railways that sufficient steamer sailings will be provided to cope adequately with the traffic offering.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of a Press advertisement on the date mentioned in relation to the Powerscourt estate.</P>
      <P>Charges for turf-cutting are regulated by the Turbary Rights Order, 1951, which, in general, relates such charges to those obtaining in 1947.  The question of authorising increases in charges for turf-cutting does not, therefore, arise.  The Order provides that if an excessive price is charged the amount of the excess may be recovered as a simple contract debt in any court of competent jurisdiction.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether it is to be inferred that the following paragraph in the official statement issued in Dublin and London on the 19th February, 1952, concerning the conference which took place in London between Irish and British Ministers (a) refers to our sterling assets, and (b) constitutes a limitation as to the utilisation of Irish sterling assets in Britain, and if he will elaborate on the exact meaning of this paragraph:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The Irish Ministers referred to the statements of policy already made in public on behalf of the Irish Government expressing their concern at the extent of the existing deficit in the Irish balance of payments and the Government's intention to ensure that Irish external resources would, as far as possible, be used only to <Col N="1080" /> improve living standards permanently by promoting an increase in domestic capital development beyond that for which normal current savings would provide.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee) Seán MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>The paragraph quoted by the Deputy refers to the deficit in our balance of payments and the use, to meet the deficit, of Irish external resources, which are in the main sterling assets, and to the Government's policy and intention in that regard as already publicly announced.</P>
      <P>In the foregoing connection, I would remind the Deputy of the speech which I made in the Dáil so long ago as the 18th July last, in which I dealt exhaustively with the balance of payments problem and warned the House of the grave situation with which the country would eventually be confronted by the greatly increasing deficit thereon.  In that speech I outlined categorically the measures which, in my view, were required if the position were to be retrieved.  I described that position in equal detail in my speech on November 14th in the debate on the Supplies and Services Bill, 1951.  The grave warnings contained in these speeches were repeated and supplemented in other statements made by the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and myself in the Oireachtas and elsewhere.  I would commend the study of these speeches to the Deputy if he desires a further elaboration of the meaning of a paragraph which, to my mind, is in its terms clear and unambiguous.</P>
      <P>If by the terms of (b) of his question the Deputy wishes to inquire whether or not the Irish Ministers in London discussed, or agreed to any limitation on the use of our sterling assets, the answer is in the negative.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he received any indication from the British Chancellor of the Exchequer as to the steps which were contemplated by the British Government in order to restore convertibility of the pound sterling by the second half of 1952.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It would appear that the Deputy has misunderstood the statement issued at the end of the Conference of Commonwealth Finance Ministers on 21st January, 1952.  The references to the second half of 1952 were to the effect that immediate corrective action was needed to bring the sterling area as a whole into balance with the rest of the world at latest in respect of that period.  This action is <Col N="1082" /> intended to maintain as far as possible the present degree of convertibility. As regards the general convertibility of sterling I can only refer the Deputy to the concluding paragraphs of the statement which were as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;While steps are thus being taken to overcome the immediate problems of the sterling area and to accelerate its development we agree that its recovery will not be complete until the conditions have been created in which sterling can become and remain convertible.</P>
      <P>Accordingly it is our definite objective to make sterling convertible and to keep it so.  We intend to work towards that goal by progressive steps aimed at creating the conditions under which convertibility can be reached and maintained.</P>
      <P>It is primarily the responsibility of the members of the sterling area themselves to create these conditions (including the achievement of adequate gold reserves); but they cannot be completely realised without the active co-operation of other countries notably those countries which are consistently in surplus with the rest of the world.</P>
      <P>We have arranged for an investigation of the steps which should be taken along the road to convertibility to begin forthwith.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is clear from the foregoing that the conference recognised that the question of general convertibility was a long-term objective quite distinct from the immediate problem of overcoming the present difficulties of sterling.</P>
      <P>In this connection the Deputy will doubtless have observed from statements published elsewhere that a committee was set up under the British Minister of State for Economic Affairs on the steps to be taken towards the convertibility of sterling.</P>

The original and Supplementary Votes form one provision out of which expenditure is defrayed and, apart from services for which the Supplementary Estimate is the sole provision, it is not possible to distinguish between expenditure from original and Supplementary Votes.  Exchequer issues for Supply Services (original plus supplementary) in the period 1st April, 1951, to 23rd February, 1952, amounted to £73,535,174.

      <P>I hope to be in a position shortly to circulate the text of the Social Welfare (Insurance) Bill, 1951. The Bill is intended to come into operation generally in the autumn of this year and the beginning of next year.  It will, however, contain provision which, if the measure is passed through the Oireachtas in time to permit it, will, I trust, enable increased rates of unemployment benefit to operate from the beginning of July of this year.

Before the motion referred to in the question was put to the House a definite statement was made by the mover of the motion to the effect that the acceptance by the Government of the motion would be regarded as acceptance of an obligation on them to increase the rates before the submission of the Social Welfare Bill to this House.  The Government was represented by the Minister for Education&mdash;who was sitting on the Front Bench while the mover of the motion was making that point clear to the House&mdash;and no exception was taken by the Minister for Education to the statement which was made by the mover of the motion.  The silence of the Minister for Education implied acceptance. Are the Government accepting the obligation now or are they rejecting it?</P>

I do not think that any temporary measure could be framed to give these increased benefits much sooner than the 1st July&mdash; perhaps it might be possible to put them into operation on the 1st June, but certainly not sooner than that.

      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with your permission, a Chinn Chomhairle, to take Questions Nos. 24 and 25 together.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any specific cases of Irish citizens having been compulsorily drafted into the United States forces in contravention of the terms of Article III of the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation, concluded with the United States on the 14th September, 1950.</P>
      <P>The text of Article III is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;1.  Nationals of either Party shall, except as otherwise provided in paragraph 2 of the present Article, be exempt from compulsory service in the armed forces of the other Party and shall also be exempt from all contributions in money or in kind imposed in lieu thereof.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>2.  The foregoing paragraph shall not apply when both Parties are, through armed action against the same third country, in connection with which there is general compulsory service, concurrently conducting hostilities or enforcing measures in pursuance of obligations for the maintenance or restoration of international peace and security.  However, in this event, nationals of either Party in the territories of the other Party who have not lawfully declared their intention to acquire the nationality of the latter, shall be exempt from service in its armed forces if, within a reasonable period of time, they elect in lieu thereof to serve in the armed forces of the Party of which they are nationals; <Col N="1092" /> and the Parties will make the necessary arrangements for that purpose.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>From the terms of the article I have just read, it is clear that if he avails of the exemption provided for by it, no Irish citizen need be drafted into the American armed forces.  The most recent confirmation of Article III was given on 25th September, 1951, by the United States Executive Order, No. 10,292, the relevant paragraph of which reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In Class IV-C&rdquo; (that is, one of the exempted classes) &ldquo;shall be placed any registrant who is an alien and who is certified by the Department of State to be, or otherwise establishes that he is, exempt under the terms of a treaty or international agreement between the United States and the country of which he is a national.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This paragraph shows that the American Government do, in fact, adhere to Article III of the treaty and that no representations or other steps are called for on our part.</P>
    <P>As regards ensuring that young Irishmen are made aware of the position before leaving this country for the United States, I can only say that considerable publicity was already given to the treaty of 1950 and I am prepared to reply in the fullest terms possible to any inquiries which may be addressed by interested persons to my Department.  At the moment, many such inquiries are being dealt with by the Irish Embassy and the various Irish consulates in the United States.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>They are all compelled to register, but the registration is not actually the draft and, under the terms of Article 3 of the agreement and of the announcement which I have read, they are entitled to be registered in a special category.</P>

      <P>Very many young men going to America are not aware of this treaty and I would, therefore, ask the <Col N="1093" /> Minister to give it publicity so that they may know of it because they are told on arrival in America that if they do not sign with the draft board their cases will be prejudiced at a later date if they try to get American citizenship. I would ask the Minister, therefore, through the Irish News Agency, to give this question and his reply full publicity.  It would serve a useful purpose as several young men have been drafted for service in Korea.</P>

      <P>Irish exports of shell fish to France are covered by the trade agreement with that country concluded last year, and I have no reason to doubt that the French Government will honour their undertakings.

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he will state how much of the Murtagh estate.  Rooske, Dunboyne, which was in the possession of the Land Commission, was sold to Mr. Galway-Greer; further, if he will state whether the remaining portion is still in the possession of the Land Commission, and, if so, when it is expected to be allotted to deserving cottage tenants and uneconomic holders.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The Land Commission did not acquire a Murtagh estate in this area.  Perhaps the Deputy has in mind the Higgins estate at Rusk and Castlefarm, which appears to have been purchased privately by Mr. Galway-Greer.  The Land Commission have no proceedings for the acquisition of these lands.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he is aware that the Land Commission have let for grazing to large landholders the Arthur Harmon estate at Summerbank, Oldcastle, County Meath, and that around this estate there are many uneconomic holders and cottage tenants who are denied grazing accommodation for their cows and if, in view of this undesirable situation, the Land Commission will arrange that grazing rights will be afforded to these people on the remaining portion of the estate not yet let for grazing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Part of the lands in question were recently let in grazing and tillage by public auction.  An area of some 35 acres remains to be let in grazing by the auctioneer and it is open to any persons requiring grazing accommodation to bid for this letting. There is little or no congestion in the area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he will state why Mr. Fintan Mongey, Stackallen, Navan, County Meath, an uneconomic holder whose land adjoins the Myles estate, and who has made repeated application to have his farm made economic was <Col N="1096" /> ignored and not interviewed by the local inspector dealing with the Myles estate and if the Land Commission will now ensure that this uneconomic holder has his case examined with a view to making his farm economic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The Mongey family was interviewed by the Land Commission inspector when he was preparing the scheme for the allotment of this estate. Mr. Mongey, Senior, then held two holdings comprising 44 acres of P.L.V. £39 5s. od.  His son Fintan did not hold any land.  Mr. Mongey subsequently transferred one of his holdings of 18 acres to Fintan who then applied for an enlargement.  The commissioners were aware of these circumstances when sanctioning the scheme, and I see no reason why they should reconsider their decision in the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">

      <P>The answer to the first two parts of the question is in the affirmative although the information set out therein is not quite accurate. Mr. Lynch was employed part time only as a herd on this estate and the holding on which he resides with his three unmarried brothers, all elderly, comprises 29 acres of P.L.V. £27 10s. od.</P>
      <P>After consideration of all the circumstances the Land Commission, at their discretion and in accordance with their statutory powers, decided not to allot a holding to Mr. Lynch but to award him a gratuity of £150.  The Deputy has not furnished any information of which the Land Commission were not already aware, which calls for a review of this case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the Circuit Court only sits in Wicklow town?  A litigant cannot make the judge move his court to Baltinglass if the judge decides to sit in Wicklow as he persists in doing, and is within his rights in doing.  The purpose of my question is not to ask the litigants in West Wicklow to go to Dublin and then travel down the other side of the coast in order to get to Wicklow town if they can get their cases heard within ten miles of where they live, at much less expense to themselves, and if they had a court sitting in County Kildare.

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if he will publish the rules under which the Referee defines active service under the Military Service Pensions Acts, 1924, 1934 and 1949, if he is aware that applicants find it difficult to make their case in support of their claims owing to the absence of the rules and if he would consider referring the matter to the Rules Committee <Col N="1101" /> of the Courts of Justice to draft a set of rules that would be equitable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that applicants experience any difficulty in presenting their cases owing to the absence of published rules defining active service for the purposes of the Military Service Pensions Acts of 1924, 1934 or 1949.  The interpretation of the term &ldquo;active service&rdquo; is a matter exclusively within the jurisdiction of the Board of Assessors constituted under the Act of 1924 or the Referee appointed under the Act of 1934, as the case may be.  I do not propose to ask the Rules Committee of the Courts of Justice to draft a set of rules as suggested.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">

      <P>Is it not quite obvious, when the rejections in the month of November were 38, December 17, January 95 and February of this year 69, that there are as many sets of rules as there have been Referees, that each Referee has a set of rules defining active service and that no applicant is aware of what these rules are?  In view of the fact that every applicant has the difficulty which the Minister I am sure is aware of&mdash;and if he is not aware of it his staff is&mdash; will he not agree that the set of rules which the Referee has should be available to the applicant to enable him to make his claim?</P>

      <P>Is the Minister not aware that the Referee decided active service in the case of a person who was a member of the Executive of Oglaigh na hÉireann; that the High Court gave a different decision and the person qualified?  In the case of an applicant from Galway for a 1916 Certificate the Referee gave one decision and the High Court gave a different decision under which the applicant qualified.  Therefore, you had the Referree deciding what constitutes active service.  Every person should be equal before the law and we should not have the position that active service <Col N="1102" /> before one Referee means this and before another Referee means that so that there are different decisions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>

What did the Deputy, who was then a Minister, himself do about it?  Did he voice his opinions on that matter in council?  He was Minister for Defence for a short period.

If you give me permission to raise this matter on the Adjournment to-night I will tell the Minister what I did do, though I believe that is not the right procedure.  I am looking for information.

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that a corvette with its peculiar construction and high superstructure, which is visible miles away, is proof that this vessel is not effective for fishery protection duty?  Furthermore, proof that they are not effective fishery-protection vessels is the encroachment of foreign trawlers along the Wicklow-Wexford and south coast of Ireland in increasing numbers every year.

      <P>The ration in Dublin and some other districts is at present being supplied entirely in New Zealand butter.  There is not sufficient Irish creamery butter to meet Dublin's ration requirements in such butter and it is impossible to devise a scheme whereby all retailers would be able to supply Irish and New Zealand butter in uniform proportions.  The present arrangements in Dublin were instituted at the request of the trade and, in my opinion, have given general satisfaction.  The New Zealand butter is, of course, of excellent quality.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>I should imagine that it is not necessary, in moving this Bill, to stress the importance of the tourist industry in the national economy; I think that is now generally recognised.  However, as the Bill does propose to authorise the expenditure of substantial sums from the Exchequer on the development of the tourist industry, it may be no harm to emphasise how important to the national economy its development may be.</P>
      <P>At the present time over-all earnings from the tourist trade are second only to earnings from agricultural exports and as a matter of particular current interest it may be mentioned that receipts from tourism represent the largest single item in the list of our dollar earnings.  During the year 1950 the gross receipts from tourism were estimated at £32,400,000.  They exceeded by about £3,000,000 the gross receipts from all live-stock exports and fell short by only £12,000,000 or £13,000,000 of the receipts from all agricultural exports.  These figures help to demonstrate the value of the tourist trade as a source of revenue and that it is, in so far as its effect upon the national economy is concerned, an export trade.  It would be no exaggeration to describe it as a corner stone of the national economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certainly on the success or failure of our efforts to expand tourist revenue will depend whether we can maintain, much less improve, the present standard of living of our people.  As was made clear in recent debates here, the deficit in the nation's balance of payments in 1951 constituted a very serious threat to the stability of our economy.  That deficit last year was in the region of £66,000,000.  It is obvious that an adverse balance of that magnitude cannot be permitted to continue for any appreciable time.  The only satisfactory way, the only way of solving the problem which it constitutes <Col N="1119" /> without hardship to our people, is to step up both production and exports.  Any other solution would involve undesirable social and economic consequences.  Plans for the expansion of agricultural and industrial production have been made but they are likely to provide a long-term rather than an immediate solution of that problem.</P>
    <P>The tourist trade, however, offers an opportunity of expansion and the prospect of a quicker return than any other trade.  We believe that if the approach to the problem of expanding the tourist revenue is properly planned a substantial increase in tourist earnings can be achieved.  I have expressed the view already that it is conceivable that tourist revenue could be doubled.  I am sure that the House will recognise, however, that an expansion of that dimension and having such consequences for the welfare of the country cannot be achieved unless the State takes a far more active part in securing it than it has heretofore and is prepared to undertake expenditure in promoting it to a much greater extent than previously.  State expenditure alone will not, of course, produce the results desired.  There must also be a considerable investment of private capital.  The aim of State policy should be to secure that investment.</P>
    <P>At the present time we have, as the House is no doubt aware, excellent opportunities for expanding tourist revenue. The reduction in the currency allowance to British citizens travelling to continental countries should result in an increase of British visitors coming here; the reductions in transatlantic air fares which are coming into operation in 1952 create conditions favourable to an increase of dollar earnings from tourists.  I think it is true to say that many Americans could come to this country for holidays at an all-in cost including transportation substantially below the cost of holidays in their own country.</P>
    <P>These opportunities, however, must be fully exploited if we are to get the most out of them.  The aim must be to get the maximum number of visitors from abroad, English and American <Col N="1120" /> visitors in particular, to visit this country and to do so in circumstances which will keep the trade expanding when the temporary favourable conditions are passed, when travel to continental countries becomes easier for British citizens and despite the attractions which these countries may have to offer to American visitors.  If these opportunities are not fully exploited, we may lose the chance of expanding our tourist earnings.</P>
    <P>Under existing legislation, that is, the Tourist Traffic Act, 1939, the Irish Tourist Board, which was established by that Act, may be paid an annual Grant-in-Aid fixed at £45,000.  My predecessor early last year authorised the board to incur expenditure above that limit in the present financial year, with the intention of submitting to the Dáil&mdash;and and securing the enactment of a Bill revising that statutory limitation.  That is the reason why a Supplementary Estimate is now before the Dáil&mdash;and I suggest that that Supplementary Estimate be debated, if it requires to be debated, in conjunction with the Bill&mdash;and why it is necessary that this Bill should be passed before the end of the financial year.  If for any reason it should be delayed in its passage through the Oireachtas, it will be necessary to put through a short Bill within that period, authorising the expenditure which the Tourist Board has already undertaken in this financial year.  Under that Act of 1939 also, the board could be given repayable advances within a limit of £1,250,000. These advances, save as otherwise authorised by the Minister for Finance, were confined to works, investments and loans which were certified by the Tourist Board to be profit-earning.</P>
    <P>When I resumed office last year, I undertook a very careful and thorough review of policy in relation to tourist development.  I considered the legislation which had been prepared by my predecessor and which did not secure enactment by the Dáil because of the dissolution last year and I studied the reports on tourism which had been presented as a result of a number of technical assistance projects under E.C.A., and particularly the report furnished by Mr. Christenberry and his colleagues.  I think the Dáil will <Col N="1121" /> expect me to express appreciation of the help given to the preparation of plans for tourist development by the Government of the United States under their E.C.A. technical assistance programme.</P>
    <P>I had a number of discussions with members of the Tourist Board and with representatives of the Irish Tourist Association, and I also had the benefit of a personal discussion with Mr. Christenberry.  His report had been submitted before the change of Government, but I invited him to come back here to review the position as it had developed since his report was made and to advise me upon ideas which were under consideration by me at the time.  The technical assistance project under which Mr. Christenberry operated provided for that second visit by him.  I perhaps should mention that he indicated almost complete agreement with the plans I outlined to him, except in regard to the establishment of a separate publicity board.  He was not in agreement with that step, although he said he appreciated the considerations which led me to take it. The drafting of this Bill took somewhat longer than I anticipated, but the delay was unavoidable.  It will be seen, however, that the Bill is a fairly comprehensive one and one which, I hope, will form a sound basis for the development of the tourist industry over the next five years.</P>
    <P>I have expressed the view that the aim of doubling our revenue from the tourist industry will not be achieved unless expenditure, both by the State and private interests, is substantially increased.  Mr. Christenberry said in his report that the State must get completely into the swim of tourism and not be content with merely wetting its feet, as it has been doing heretofore. This Bill is designed to enable the Government to contribute funds towards tourist development and publicity on a scale which is substantially in excess of anything previously attempted.  There is power for the making of State grants amounting to £500,000 a year, if that much is required, for general development and publicity purposes.</P>
    <P>I should, perhaps, make it clear that <Col N="1122" /> the method of financing the activities of the tourist organisations is changed. In the Act of 1939, the Tourist Board received a Grant-in-Aid of a fixed amount per year and was not obliged to surrender to the Exchequer any portion of that sum which was unexpended and its expenditure was entirely at its discretion within the limits of its powers as fixed by the Act.  The proposal here is to fix a ceiling to the amounts that may be given for tourist development purposes. That ceiling cannot be exceeded without further legislation, but the intention is that the organisations set up under this Bill will prepare annual budgets of expenditure, and, subject to their approval by the Government, will receive whatever amounts they require within these limits, the amounts being indicated in the Estimates for the year.</P>
    <P>There is also provision in the Bill for giving over a period of five years guarantees of loans amounting to £3,000,000 for the improvement of holiday accommodation and tourist resorts.  Deputies who are familiar with the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Acts will understand that the provisions of this Bill relating to these guaranteed loans are similar to those of the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Acts, with this difference, that the purposes for which these loans may be guaranteed are those defined in the Bill and the further important difference that the advisory committee which will consider applications for loans will be An Bord Fáilte, the Tourist Board, and not the advisory committee under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act.  These provisions are designed to assist private interests who are willing to invest their own money in the tourist industry.</P>
    <P>I express the hope that private interests will avail of the opportunity given them by this Bill to the full. Unless all those who are directly or indirectly concerned with the tourist industry play their part, the efforts of the Government and the two statutory organisations which will be functioning under this Bill cannot achieve a full measure of success.  The public in general, the hoteliers, the local authorities <Col N="1123" /> and groups interested in the development of particular holiday resorts must be educated to understand how important the industry is in the national economy and how important it is that they should co-operate with the two official organisations in making a success of it.</P>
    <P>I think I should say that the evidence is that we have not yet succeeded in arousing sufficient interest in the potentialities of the tourist trade, even among those whose livelihood would seem to depend on its development. When the various reports were received under the E.C.A. technical assistance projects, it was decided to publish a synopsis of these reports in the form of a brochure, of which Deputies have received copies.</P>
    <P>Two thousand five hundred copies of that synthesis, as it was called, were printed.  Up to the 19th of this month, only 260 were sold.  When one realises that there are over 1,000 registered hotel and guest houses in the country whose business it should be to learn the opinions of experts upon the potentialities of their industry, of what they might do to exploit those potentialities, it is very disappointing to find that so few were sold.</P>

      <P>Under this Bill there will be two organisations, the first of which will be the present Tourist Board under a new name, An Bord Fáilte.  I think it is desirable that we should get away from the unimaginative kind of name that we established in 1939. I am not particularly wedded to the name suggested in this Bill and if some Deputy can suggest a better name I would be prepared to consider it, provided it conforms to the requirements, the first being a name likely to be used and the second that it is sufficiently clear to make its meaning known to people coming from outside.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 4 provides for the change of the name of the Tourist Board to An Bord Fáilte.  Section 5 gives a picture of the future functions of An Bord Fáilte.  Its general duty will be to encourage and promote the development of the tourist traffic in and to the State but apart from that general duty it will have the specific functions set out in that section.  Those functions are, in the main, similar to those given to the Tourist Board by the Act of 1939.  The two important additional functions which are being given to An Bord Fáilte are (1) in relation to historic buildings and (2) in regard to the signposting of roads. Because of the establishment of a separate board to deal with tourist publicity, it is not proposed to give An Bord Fáilte power to provide publicity and the power it had under the 1939 Act to build, establish, operate and equip hotels and guest-houses is not being repeated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps I may refer at this stage to these two new functions.  The first, as I have said, relates to national monuments and historic buildings and is probably the most important of the new functions for which the Bill provides. The Christenberry report stressed very definitely the tourist <Col N="1125" /> potentialities of many of our historic buildings, sites and shrines.  In the discussion which I had with Mr. Christenberry, he represented himself as being particularly impressed by the large number of those shrines and sites of historic and general interest.  He thought that if they were properly maintained and easily accessible they would prove a great attraction to Americans of Irish origin.  He pointed out, however, that in his tour of the country he found&mdash;as all of us know to be true&mdash;that many of the shrines were in a state of disrepair and others were practically inaccessible.  There is, of course, also a great lack of the type of descriptive notes which visitors from abroad would expect to find.</P>
    <P>That state of affairs appears to be due primarily to the fact that many of those places are not under the protection of any national organisation. Though the national monuments which are in the ownership or under the guardianship of the Commissioners of Public Works or of local authorities are properly protected and maintained, they are not always easily accessible to people who wish to visit them.  It is proposed here that An Bord Fáilte should be given power to protect and maintain historic buildings, sites, shrines and other places of particular interest to the public and also power to erect notices and fences and provide means of access.</P>
    <P>I should stress that the board will not undertake that work solely from the tourist point of view.  Apart altogether from the tourist angle, it is most desirable that places of that sort should be preserved for reasons of national dignity.  Under the National Monuments Act of 1930 the Board of Works and local authorities have certain powers of protection in relation to national monuments.  In the case of those monuments, monuments which are in the custody of the Board of Works or of local authorities, it is proposed that An Bord Fáilte will not exercise its powers under the Bill without the consent of the commissioners or of the local authority, as the case may be.  The board will, however, be able to help the commissioners or a local authority financially in any case <Col N="1126" /> where these bodies opt to do the required work themselves.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to give the board power to acquire land compulsorily where a private owner refuses to permit the erection of fences or notices or to provide means of access.  I hope that the board will never be called upon to use this compulsory power and that private owners will co-operate fully with it in its task of preserving these historic buildings and shrines and making them accessible to the public.  I should mention that the board will not be able to use any compulsory powers in connection with a national monument which is in the guardianship of the Board of Works or a local authority.  I have stressed in this connection monuments, shrines and buildings of historic interest, but the powers of the board are not necessarily limited to such.  Access to places of public interest, such as the Cliffs of Moher in County Clare, could also be arranged by the board under the powers given to it here.</P>
    <P>The second of the new powers provided relates to the signposting of roads.  I think there is no doubt that there is room for considerable improvement in the present standard of signposting of Irish roads.  I have no desire to belittle the voluntary efforts of the Automobile Association, which provides the present signs, or the work of the local authorities in the matter. They have been doing good work within the limits of their resources.  I trust that they will continue and, in fact, intensify their efforts.  Nevertheless, the present standard of sign posts is deficient in many respects.  Mr. Christenberry told me that when he arrived in Dublin, for the purpose of carrying out his tour, he hired a car there and that his driver lost his way 20 times during the course of the tour because of inadequate sign posts.</P>
    <P>It is thought that all the main tourist routes should have on them distinctive signs directing the attention of visitors to places of interest on these routes.  This would enable them to make short detours so as to visit such places.  At the present time most tourists, especially those from abroad, <Col N="1127" /> might pass close to an important shrine, monument or other place of interest without even being aware of its existence.  It is considered that the ordinary direction signs, especially those on the tourist routes, could be improved in design and erected at more frequent intervals.  That is a field in which Bord Fáilte can usefully engage itself, and I feel that the best way for it to do so would be to help by providing local authorities with special signs for erection and maintenance by them, subject to the approval of the Minister for Local Government.  Section 5, sub-section (2) (g) of the Bill gives Bord Fáilte the necessary powers to do that.  It is intended that Bord Fáilte should co-operate with the Automobile Association in this task, and it is hoped that the local authorities will play their part by maintaining the sign posts in their area in a proper state of repair.</P>
    <P>One other important function has been given to the board and that is to provide, or assist in providing, financially and otherwise, staff training schemes.  The present Tourist Board has been considering this, has hopes of establishing a staff training centre and expects to be able to encourage vocational education committees to co-operate with local hotel interests in the extension of staff training facilities. They are working on the idea of &ldquo;on the job&rdquo; training schemes in which experts would instruct and train hotel staffs under actual working conditions.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that a vigorous programme of improvement and extension of hotel and guest house accommodation is necessary if there is to be any hope of attracting a considerably increased number of visitors as well as providing adequately for the holidays of our own people.  In fact, it is true to say that the increased tourist earnings which we are hoping will materialise will depend largely upon the provision of increased accommodation.</P>
    <P>Deputies who have read the reports will realise that a great deal of consideration has been given by all who have examined this question to the <Col N="1128" /> best manner in which the problem of increasing the accommodation available should be tackled.  In accordance with the general policy of the Government and, I feel, of the House, it is considered desirable that the initiative should come from private interests.  It is true that the hotel industry must have made substantial profits in recent years and should, therefore, be able, to some extent, to finance independently any improvements which are required.</P>
    <P>There are cases, however, in which State assistance and encouragement would be justified, and the proposals in this Bill are in general accord with the recommendations we have received. The Government accepted these recommendations, which were in accord with its own view, that the stimulus which was required could best be provided by means of a system of guaranteed loans for the construction, extension, modernisation or improvement of hotel accommodation.</P>
    <P>Deputies will note that I use the term hotel accommodation whereas the Bill speaks of holiday accommodation. The intention is that the facilities which will be available under the Bill for the extension or improvement of hotels will be confined to hotels which cater in any way for the tourist trade.  The term &ldquo;holiday accommodation&rdquo; as used, therefore, was intended to indicate that the Bill is limited to the extension of tourist facilities and, of course, that term covers both hotels and guest houses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Would that exclude hotels in the boroughs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  In fact, as the Deputy will remember, the reports received indicated that the cities were likely to prove as strong an attraction to visitors from outside as any other part of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under Part III of the Bill the Minister for Industry and Commerce is given power, upon the recommendation of An Bord Fáilte and with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, to guarantee loans for the construction, extension, modernisation or improvement <Col N="1129" /> of holiday accommodation and may, with similar consent, give grants towards meeting, for a period of three years, interest charges on the loans in respect of which guarantees are given. It is recognised that substantial capital investment on the construction, extension or improvement of hotel accommodation might not begin to yield increased revenue to the proprietor for some years and, therefore, it is proposed to authorise the giving of grants against interest charges up to a period of three years.</P>
    <P>I should perhaps say something in that connection with reference to the provisions in the Bill introduced by the former Government which made reference to incentive grants.  It was contemplated that money would be provided out of the American Grant Counterpart Account for an incentive grant scheme, and a sum of £100,000 had, in fact, been earmarked by the previous Government out of that account for such purpose.  The intention was that that amount would be increased to £500,000 and it was, I think, agreed amongst the Departments concerned at the time that the making of that fund available was conditional upon the allocation of the money from the grant account. Deputies will understand that under the agreement with the American authorities they have to concur in any proposals for expenditure from the grant account as distinct from the loan fund.</P>
    <P>Before that Bill was passed, however, and before any action had been taken to secure consent to a higher allocation from the grant account for these purposes there was a change of policy or a change of outlook amongst the American authorities and it was made clear that proposals for the utilisation of any further part of the grant funds for tourist development purposes were not likely to be approved in the changed international circumstances. The emphasis had come upon more material forms of production and the position, therefore, was, as I found it, that whereas provisional agreement had been made to provide £100,000, there was no likelihood of any more than that being provided.  The Tourist <Col N="1130" /> Board considered they would prefer not to have that sum; they could not see how they could operate any effective incentive grant scheme with such a very small amount and they thought it would be only an embarrassment to them to have any obligations in that regard without additional funds.</P>
    <P>The question as to how that £100,000 earmarked for tourist purposes will now be utilised is an open one.  As the House is aware, E.C.A. has wound up and the present position is that the scheme for the utilisation of the whole of the grant funds has to be submitted to the American Congress for approval.</P>
    <P>It is not intended that loans should be confined solely to the improvement or extension of hotels and guest houses. There is also the matter of our holiday resorts.  Deputies who followed the course of the debates on the 1939 Bill will realise that the providing of help or inducements to secure the improvement of holiday resorts is fraught with considerable difficulty.  Under the 1939 Bill it was intended that advances should be made by the Tourist Board for resort developments but only where the Tourist Board was in a position to certify that the developments would be profitable and likely to yield a revenue that would repay the advances.  That did not always turn out to be easy.  It was not always possible for the Tourist Board to co-ordinate their plans with those of local authorities in the matter of extending water supply and sewage schemes and other necessary adjuncts to such development.</P>
    <P>Apart altogether from the fact that there was a change of policy following the change of Government, it was clear before that that the plan of the 1939 Act was not working out as we had hoped.  That may have been due to the abnormal circumstances that prevailed between 1939 and 1948.  But I am not proposing now to revive that plan.  I have become doubtful whether it is in fact possible to direct any useful scheme of resort development by means of a central organisation and the aim of this Bill is to encourage the formation of local companies in each holiday resort for that purpose.  Inducements are being provided to encourage <Col N="1131" /> the formation of such companies in the shape of grants towards their formation expenses and if established and approved by an Bord Fáilte they will qualify for guaranteed loans under the Bill.</P>
    <P>I think there is no doubt that many of our holiday resorts are lacking in the facilities, amenities and services, including indoor and outdoor amusements and sports, which the majority of holiday-makers expect to find when they go on holiday.  There is no doubt also that if these resorts were improved in respect to those matters they would attract many more visitors from both Ireland and from abroad.</P>
    <P>Again, it is proposed to try to get work done in that direction by private enterprise, by encouraging the investment of private capital aided, as I have indicated, under this Bill.  If these local resort development companies are organised&mdash;there are a couple in existence already&mdash;they will be able to plan the provision of amusement and recreational centres, and other amenities and facilities which they deem suitable in the locality and which they think are likely to yield revenue which will permit the liquidation of the loans advanced for the purpose of financing them.</P>
    <P>It would be necessary, of course, for these local development companies to procure the active co-operation of local authorities.  It was mainly in that connection that the 1939 scheme broke down but I think it is possible that local development companies will be able to secure the co-ordination of their plans with the plans of the local authorities and obtain help from the local authorities in greater degree than the centralised national organisation under the 1939 Act was able to realise.</P>
    <P>It would, of course, also help if local authorities would utilise their existing powers to remove derelict and unsightly buildings in the vicinity of these resorts and, in fact, in any other part of the country.  I have spoken of that already.  It is a depressing experience to enter many otherwise thriving towns in this country to find on the outskirts of these towns ruins of mud wall cabins <Col N="1132" /> that have long since been out of occupation and which give an air of depression and poverty to the whole locality.  Legislation was passed before the war giving local authorities power to deal with these matters.  That legislation, I admit, was hedged around with legal safeguards against possible claims from the owners of the property but I am sure that the Minister for Local Government would be prepared to revise it if that was thought necessary, but I am not sure that it is.  The fact is that very few local authorities, even though they were often offered funds out of the Unemployment and Emergency Schemes Vote for the purpose, have, in fact, taken action against these unsightly ruins.  These loans which may be made for the improvement of holiday accommodation or resorts are limited in the aggregate to £3,000,000 and in time to five years.</P>
    <P>In putting that figure into the Bill, there was a great deal of estimation. It is not possible to say to what extent the facilities given in the Bill will be utilised.  If the limit of £3,000,000 should be reached before the five year period, I am sure there will be no difficulty in securing the enactment here of amending legislation to raise it and most of us will be glad to vote for it.</P>
    <P>I should, perhaps, give the House at this stage some information concerning the advances made under the 1939 Act.  Under the provisions of that Act, these advances were repayable by the Tourist Board and were spent chiefly on the acquisition of various properties. All the hotel properties which were acquired by the board have been sold.  Most of the other properties have also been sold or will be disposed of in the near future and the board has repaid advances totalling £110,000.  The capital sum outstanding amounts to about £311,000 and it may be assumed that most of that will have to be written off eventually.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that the Grant-in-Aid to An Bord Fáilte may not exceed £250,000 in any one financial year. There was a rather careful calculation of the amount which the board might require to discharge its functions and <Col N="1133" /> it was felt that, on the basis of present costs at any rate, it could do so within that limit.  That amount includes provision for the making of grants towards interest charges on guaranteed loans as well as the cost of the board's own organisation and head office expenses.</P>
    <P>It is not considered that An Bord Fáilte will be able to develop its plans so as to involve expenditure to that limit in the present year.  In fact, the Estimate prepared for this year is £85,000.  That is a realistic Estimate. It represents the extent to which the Tourist Board, which has been consulted, believes it will be possible to carry out its present and new functions during the present year.  If it does not prove to be sufficient, then a Supplementary Estimate can be taken.  It is expected that the activities of the board will expand and continue to expand and that in future years the sum required will be substantially in excess of £85,000.</P>

The calculation made in the Christenberry report indicated that there is available at the present time in the country 3,046 hotel bedrooms, providing sleeping accommodation for 4,763 and it was estimated that it was necessary, on the basis of their estimation of what was required, to increase the number of bedrooms by 150 rooms in the Dublin area, 100 rooms in the Cork area and a further number in other areas.  I will find the figures for the Deputy.  Perhaps he may look them up himself.  It is in Section 3 of the Christenberry report.</P>

      <P>I mentioned here last year that I was not convinced that the decision announced by the Tourist Board to suspend the grading of hotels in the present year was a wise one.  I have accepted that decision, however, because the board convinced me that it would not lead to any deterioration in the standard of hotel accommodation in the present year, that, in fact, it is on the basis of inspections carried out this year that future gradings will depend and that, consequently, the hotel proprietors are more likely to be maintaining and improving the standard of accommodation this year than otherwise.  A new system of grading is required, a more intricate system than we have at present and that is being prepared by the board.  I discussed this matter with the board and I have pressed on them my view as to the necessity for their securing the full co-operation of the hotel industry in the improvement of hotel accommodation. I have asked the board to arrange for a trained staff of inspectors who will be qualified to discuss with hotel managements, on the basis of equality of knowledge of the subject of hotel management, the improvements which are necessary or desirable in their premises.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill provides for the amendment of the Tourist Traffic Act, 1939.  The amendments are in the main <Col N="1135" /> similar to those which were proposed in the Bill introduced by my predecessor last year and probably it will be considered by the Dáil more appropriate to discuss them on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>There are certain other minor matters relating to An Bord Fáilte to which I should refer.  The Bill permits the increasing of the number of members of Bord Fáilte from the present limit of five to a new limit of seven.  Deputies will have read the comments of the Christenberry report upon that point and on the need to extend the membership of the board so as to permit of the inclusion of persons with certain specialised knowledge. In fact, the Christenberry report indicated some nine types of specialists that should be on the board but it also intimated that some of these classifications could be grouped together and, generally, the creation of a board of seven members would appear to be in accord with their recommendations.</P>
    <P>There are some minor changes in that regard which I may also mention. At the present time the remuneration of members of the board is fixed at the time of their appointment and cannot be changed during their appointment and it is proposed to permit variation of the remuneration from time to time if circumstances should require it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Are they full-time men?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Not full-time, not at present, anyway.  Under the 1939 Act it was provided that the accounts of the board should be audited by qualified auditors approved of by the Minister. It is proposed in this Bill to require the accounts to be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor-General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also a proposal to authorise the board to prepare a superannuation scheme for its members and its staffs. I think it is desirable in an organisation of this kind that such a scheme should exist.  There is no scheme in the Bill; we are merely empowering the board to prepare a scheme, which will require to be sanctioned by the Minister for Finance before it comes into operation.  The board has been in <Col N="1136" /> existence for a long number of years now and if it is to remain in existence, as we hope, and to attract into its service people of the quality required, I think it is necessary to have some provision for the payment of superannuation allowances on retirement.</P>
    <P>I want to deal now with the proposal to establish An Fógra Fáilte because it is likely to be the more contentious part of the Bill.</P>
    <P>An Fógra Fáilte is the organisation which has been already set up to handle tourist publicity.  When we enacted the Tourist Traffic Act of 1939, we intended that all tourist development activities would be divided between the Tourist Board and the Tourist Association on the basis contemplated here, that the Tourist Board would be responsible for hotel improvement, resort development and all activities designed to attract visitors and to make them comfortable here, whereas the Tourist Association would be in sole charge of publicity activities. That was the 1939 scheme but, when the war ended and the much larger potentialities of the tourist industry became apparent in the post-war years, the Tourist Board came to the view that the publicity activities of the Tourist Association were inadequate. The Tourist Association has limited funds.  Its total revenue varies between £15,000 and £18,000 and its revenue had not increased as against the pre-war period.  So the Tourist Board also began to undertake publicity activities, as it was empowered to do so under the 1939 Act.  We then had two separate organisations engaged in publicity&mdash;the Tourist Association and the Tourist Board.  That was a situation which obviously called for examination. The Christenberry report said that there should be only one body handling all aspects of the tourist trade, the Tourist Board.  In fact, they were prepared to wipe out the Tourist Association altogether.</P>
    <P>I think I am right in saying, although Deputy Cosgrave can correct me in this, that at one time that view was accepted by the members of the former Government.  At any rate, they took a decision which was acted upon in <Col N="1137" /> one instance, to permit local associations to secure certificates under the 1931 Tourist Act.  The 1931 Tourist Act empowered local authorities to strike a rate within certain limits for tourist publicity purposes but the proceeds of that rate could be paid out only to organisations that were certified by the Minister for Industry and Commerce under the Act.  From 1931 to 1950 only one association, the Irish Tourist Association, was so certified and so had the benefits of the proceeds of the rate struck by various authorities for tourist publicity purposes.  At one stage early last year, my predecessor decided to license local associations. In fact, one such association was formed, in Sligo, and inevitably succeeded in persuading the local authority to divert to it a proportion of the proceeds of the rate which would otherwise have gone to the Tourist Association.  It was clear, therefore, that the recognition under that Act of local associations would reduce very substantially, and might wipe out altogether, the revenue of the Tourist Association from local authorities.  It was also decided by my predecessor to withdraw the financial assistance which the Tourist Board was giving to the Tourist Association in connection with its publicity activities.  These decisions naturally caused great perturbation in the ranks of the Tourist Association and there was a number of recommendations made in favour of a change of policy.  In fact, there was a change of policy decided upon, at least on a temporary basis.  Deputy Dr. O'Higgins, my immediate predecessor, decided to leave things as they were for a period of a year, that is, to permit the Tourist Board to continue to give financial support to the Tourist Association for that period.</P>
    <P>That is the situation as I found it, with the future of the Tourist Association in doubt, its position established only for a period of a year, and I had to do something about it.  Having still the view which I held in 1939 that the work of publicity, in the widest sense of that term, is sufficiently big to require a separate organisation, I felt that there were many reasons why it was desirable that it should not be handled by the same organisation <Col N="1138" /> which has responsibility for hotel improvements and resort development. I met the Tourist Association to consider whether we could not get back to the 1939 position.  Of course, the situation had changed enormously since 1939.  Then it was contemplated that the total expenditure on tourist publicity would be what the Tourist Association succeeded in getting from local authorities or raising by voluntary subscriptions.  It is now recognised that a very much larger expenditure will be required and also that by far the greater part of the publicity funds must come from the Exchequer and through the Tourist Board.  I do not think that the Dáil would contemplate the payment out of the Exchequer of substantial funds to be disposed of by a voluntary body like the Irish Tourist Association.  I think the Dáil would feel that some statutory control of the funds and of the body administering them would be necessary.</P>
    <P>I met the Irish Tourist Association and discussed the matter with them.  They agreed that the best course was to set up a body on which they would have equal representation with the Tourist Board, and which would be entrusted with the management of all tourist publicity work.  I accepted that proposal and that is the origin of Fógra Fáilte&mdash;a board consisting of three members of the Tourist Board and three directors of the Tourist Association chosen by me from a panel of six submitted by them.  Probably if the slate was cleared, if we were starting <i>de novo</i> in building up an organisation to develop the tourist trade, we might not create precisely that type of organisation but the slate is not cleared and we have to have regard to the fact that this Tourist Association exists, that it was, in fact, the first organisation that ever undertook the development of public interest in the tourist trade, and that it had been operating under the sanction of legislation and of certificates from the Minister for Industry and Commerce authorised by legislation, for a number of years before the Tourist Board was set up.  Therefore, I think we would be taking the risk not merely of controversy and agitation, if we were to decide to elimininate <Col N="1139" /> the Tourist Association from this picture altogether, but that we would be losing something of real value and that it is better to arrange for their continued participation in tourist publicity work in conjunction with the Tourist Board through the joint organisation which was created and which it is proposed to put upon a statutory basis by this Bill.  The name given to the organisation is Fógra Fáilte.  I have the same to say about that name as I have to say of the name which it is now proposed to give the Tourist Board.</P>
    <P>The amount which it is contemplated would be made available as a maximum for tourist publicity work is £250,000 per year.  Again, the procedure will be as I described for An Bord Fáilte.  That figure represents the maximum that can be voted by the Dáil without amending legislation. It may be that in some particular year the actual expenditure will be below that figure.  A budget will be prepared and an Estimate brought to the Dáil. It is contemplated that in this year the expenditure will not exceed £150,000.</P>
    <P>Deputies must not think all publicity work is being confined to the publication of brochures, maps or literature of that kind, or the insertion of advertisements in newspapers abroad.  By far the most important part of the publicity work intended is the operation of tourist bureaux both here and in other countries.  I understand that Fógra Fáilte have made an arrangement with the Tourist Association under which that association will, as their agents, operate the tourist bureaux in Ireland and that Fógra Fáilte will operate the bureaux outside Ireland.  There is a bureau in London.  It is considered that there would be advantage in having similar bureaux in certain other English cities.  There is a bureau in New York, too, and an extension of activities there may also be practicable. I think there is need also for the extension of the number of bureaux in Ireland and that there should be in every place of entry of visitors from abroad some facilities for visitors to get detailed information concerning hotel <Col N="1140" /> accommodation, resort areas and all the other knowledge about the country which any visitor to a foreign country would like to receive.  These will be the functions of Fógra Fáilte&mdash;to engage in any kind of publicity inside or outside the State; to prepare and publish guide books, time-tables and other publications; to establish and operate the information bureaux and any other similar form of activity in connection with tourist publicity, and to co-operate with other bodies in that connection.  While Fógra Fáilte will be engaged in the publication of guide books, maps and tourist literature, I hope private enterprise will do so also. As most Deputies are aware, in other countries some of the most useful tourist guide books and maps are published by private firms and sold by way of commercial enterprise.  I should hope the same will happen here.</P>
    <P>Some doubt was raised in recent statements, published outside, concerning the future position of the Irish Tourist Association.  I am quite anxious, within the limits of a workable and efficient organisation, to utilise the widespread connections of the Tourist Association and the goodwill which it has enjoyed and the enthusiasm and the ability of its council, while at the same time giving it functions which will not clash with any of the official organisations.</P>
    <P>One of the most important things which have to be done in this country&mdash; and it is a function which, I think, the Tourist Association is particularly equipped to do&mdash;is to educate the Irish people in regard to the economic importance of the tourist trade and as to the methods by which they can co-operate in developing it.  The American experts&mdash;Mr. Christenberry and his friends&mdash;came here and gave us the benefit of their views.  They said, in effect, that it would be a waste of money to spend anything on the tourist trade unless we first succeeded in getting the Irish people to understand its value.  I think that the Association, having regard to its constitution and widespread connections, can do very valuable work in that field.  In addition, it will have, I understand, the <Col N="1141" /> function of operating the tourist bureaux as agents within the country for Fógra Fáilte and will have, through its representation upon that board, the opportunity of influencing the whole tone and direction of tourist publicity. It will also be&mdash;what I hope it will regard as its major function&mdash;the critic of these organisations and the channel by which useful suggestions and ideas may come from those who are involved in any aspect of the tourist industry to the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Government.</P>
    <P>The provisions for election to Fógra Fáilte, the appointment of its members, its powers, the appointment of staff, the auditing of accounts, the preparation of a superannuation scheme and the submission of an annual report to the Dáil are, generally speaking, similar to those under the 1939 Act and which, in the present Bill, operate for An Bord Fáilte.</P>
    <P>There is one further matter to which I must refer.  I am quite certain it will prove to be a matter of some debate and perhaps controversy before the Bill leaves the House.  Certain amendments of the licensing laws are proposed here.  The first one is simple enough.  It is based upon the recommendation in the Christenberry report. Its purpose is to provide that any person proposing to build an hotel or to spend capital upon the extension of an hotel can find out, before the work is put into operation, whether or not he will get a licence for the sale of intoxicating drink.  As the law stands at present, an hotel having not less than ten bedrooms and no public bar may apply for a licence to sell liquor but there is no certainty that they will get the licence and, in fact, in many cases there have been refusals on account of the number of licences operating in the locality or on some other ground not related to the suitability of the premises or of the applicant. The proposal here is that a person who is about to invest money in the building or extension of an hotel can bring the plans of the new hotel or the extension to the court for approval and get an undertaking that <Col N="1142" /> if, when the work is completed, it is found to be in accordance with the plans, he will get a licence and that licence must be issued to him without any further reference to the suitability of the premises&mdash;that having been decided in advance&mdash;or to his personal character&mdash;that having also been decided in advance&mdash;or to the number of other licensees in the locality.</P>
    <P>Having made that provision in relation to hotels, I came to the consideration of the conditions which exist in holiday camps.  This matter was discussed in the Dáil on a Private Member's Bill which was introduced in 1949.  While I think the attitude of the Dáil to that Bill may have been influenced by the view I held at the time&mdash;that it was not a suitable Bill to be introduced by a Private Member but that, rather, it was the type of Bill that should be promoted by a Government&mdash;we have to record the fact that it was defeated then.  At the present time there is no provision under the licensing laws to deal with facilities for the sale of drink in holiday camps and these holiday camps have to seek occasional licences which permit of the selling of drink to residents. The proposal here is that a holiday camp which is registered with the Irish Tourist Board or, after this Bill passes, with An Bord Fáilte, which has accommodation for not less than 250 guests at one time, a rateable valuation of not less than £250, and consists of buildings which are wholly or mainly of a permanent character, should be authorised to sell drink to residents and non-residents on weekdays and to residents only on Sundays and certain other days which are restricted under the existing licensing laws.</P>
    <P>I think I should emphasise that it is not proposed to permit of the sale of drink to bona fide travellers in these holiday camps.  That is a matter which we can, perhaps, discuss more fully in Committee, if the House desires to express any view regarding it.  In my view, it is important for the development of the tourist trade that we should, to some extent, liberalise the law regarding the sale of drink to residents in hotels and, if we do that, it is obviously desirable that we should <Col N="1143" /> make a similar provision in relation to holiday camps.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will understand that that would not be a matter either for the Minister for Industry and Commerce or relevant to this particular Bill.  We are dealing with the development of the tourist trade, and the amendment of the licensing laws only arises because it is felt that it will assist the development of the tourist trade, which is considered to be important for this country.  In conclusion, I should mention that I am advised that, if the proposals in relation to the licensing of holiday camps is passed by the Dáil in Committee, some amendment of the Long Title will be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is correct to say that the main provisions of this Bill are the outcome of a series of reports on investigations conducted by a number of experts which were published in the synthesis made available to Deputies and which had received careful consideration by the previous Government.  I say the main provisions because the Minister has mentioned a number of changes.  But, in the main, the Bill is the outcome of a careful examination of tourist potentialities and an evaluation of the steps necessary to develop the trade to the maximum extent.</P>
      <P>The investigation which was conducted by the various bodies represented in the synthesis which was published was carried out over a period of some months and involved the examination of tourist potentialities in this country and a consideration of the trade elsewhere with a view to advising the Government and the trade of the steps necessary in order to avail to the full of the attractions which this country is in a position to provide for visitors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that connection, it is essential to reiterate a number of the comments made, in particular by the group of <Col N="1144" /> American experts referred to by the Minister.  The important part which the tourist trade plays in our economy is not sufficiently recognised yet by the people as a whole.  It is difficult to appreciate that it has grown to such an extent in recent years that it now plays a part second only to agricultural exports.  In addition, it offers the best hope of a rapid expansion. It was because of these considerations that the Government decided at the time that the question required the most careful examination and that the proposals which would be brought before the Dáil should meet with universal approval.  In that regard, the speech which the Minister has made and the general proposals in this Bill meet with the approval of the tourist trade and, I believe, will meet with the approval of Deputies.  There are, however, one or two notable exceptions.</P>
    <P>The tourist trade in this country has grown very rapidly in recent years, and when the E.C.A. decided to assist the industry by direct action the Government expressed their appreciation at the time, which has been endorsed by the Minister to-day, of the gesture which the E.C.A. made and undertook to accept the services of a mission which has come to be known as the Christenberry mission.  When the delegation arrived here, I had the privilege of addressing them.  The delegation undertook a rapid and exhaustive tour of the country and they submitted in the course of a few weeks a lengthy report.  Almost at the same time a commission consisting of a group of hoteliers, selected by the Irish Hotels Federation and a number of members of the Tourist Association undertook, under E.C.A. auspices, a tour of the county, and then some of them visited the United States of America.  In addition, there were a number of other reports, mainly from representatives of the existing Irish Tourist Board, the general manager, the architect, and one or two other persons selected with the assistance of the Irish Tourist Board and the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>These delegations submitted the reports which have been referred to <Col N="1145" /> and, in view of certain references to a possible difficulty over personalities, it was decided to publish the reports in the form of a synthesis.  It is disappointing to learn that so few copies of that report have been availed of, because the report, as published, is short, it is easy to understand and it will serve as a guide to everyone who is anxious to learn from the study which these experts made what steps are necessary to develop the tourist trade and what attractions should be provided.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to discuss the reports except to say that the Americans concentrated on a number of aspects of the tourist trade and, in particular, the fact that there is in this country a wealth of attractions for tourists and that we should not attempt to compete with other countries by providing something that we have not as a natural-asset or by the adoption of certain American techniques to attract tourists here.</P>
    <P>I believe that was sound advice.  They did stress the necessity of proper hotel accommodation and facilities, good food and a number of other matters concerning information and guidance to persons anxious to visit particular parts of the country, and especially the suggestion, which has been incorporated in the Bill, of making the same body responsible for national shrines and monuments and designating them, as well as providing literature and information of historical or topographical interest. I should say in that connection, that the booklet which was published recently by the Tourist Board and the Tourist Association represents a distinct advance on anything that was published before, and it will, no doubt, serve, as the Americans expect it, as a guide and a source of information to those who visit any of the national shrines or monuments.</P>
    <P>The provisions in the Bill deal with that matter.  It will require consideration by the Tourist Board as to what steps are necessary and desirable in order to provide the facilities which should be provided and can readily be provided in that connection.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1146" /> The main provisions of the Bill deal with the establishment of the new board, the board which the Minister has referred to, and the financial assistance.  In that connection, I would like to know how it was decided to call the board &ldquo;An Bord Fáilte&rdquo;. I confess I do not know what that is intended to translate or describe.  I think the Minister should consider, before the Committee Stage, an alternative title.  Part II of the Bill provides a number of directives to the Tourist Board on policy.  In the main, those directives are additional to the powers and functions of the Tourist Board under the 1939 Tourist Traffic Bill.  Part III of the Bill deals with the financial provisions.  The original proposals were somewhat different, but I do not think anyone will disagree with the financial proposals in the Bill because, if availed of, they should enable all those who are prepared to expand, modernise or equip their hotels to do so.  In addition to the funds which are being provided for the Tourist Board itself, that is the parent body, these seem adequate to their requirements.</P>
    <P>I think it is necessary to say in that connection that, when the Tourist Board was reorganised at the end of 1950, it was reorganised on the basis of the recommendations made in the Christenberry report, as well as some of the recommendations made in the other reports, and on the assumption that the legislation which is now being introduced would be introduced with one or two differences to which I shall refer later.</P>
    <P>Deputies will notice from the report, the synthesis and the Christenberry report, that the Christenberry delegation recommended a board composed of nine named categories, or representatives of these, but agreed that it could be reduced in number by amalgamation, or by combining some of these functions under one particular individual. At that time, the statutory number which the legislation provided for was five persons.  It was decided, when the legislation was being drafted, that the number would be increased to seven, and this Bill amends the law in that respect.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1147" /> When the board was reorganised, it was decided to put on the board, for the first time, persons connected with the hotel trade because it was recognised that if a board concerned with the development of the tourist trade in general was to function, while there may be arguments for and against it, experience had proved that the best hope of a satisfactory development would result from the establishment of a board of business men and of persons competent to advise and, in addition, of persons trained in hotel management. That was a departure from previous practice, but it enabled, I believe, valuable knowledge and experience to be acquired by the Tourist Board, with the availability, through the personnel placed on the board, of knowledge and experience that would otherwise have to be got from outside sources.  Therefore, I think it is correct to say that the board as established, with whatever additions may be made to it, fits the conditions laid down by the Christenberry report.  The many improvements and advances that have been made since, in collaboration with the Tourist Association, are themselves indicative of the manner in which the Tourist Board is approaching its responsibilities.</P>
    <P>The various reports agreed, in the main, with the principle of having one body responsible for tourist development. On that, I think it is right to say that the previous Government agreed with that view.  It is undoubtedly true that the fact that two bodies had been charged with different responsibilities for the administration of the tourist industry complicated the problem of establishing a single body. Undoubtedly, the fact that the voluntary organisation preceded the establishment of the statutory body, although the voluntary organisation was assisted or maintained by a statutory contribution, gave rise to a good deal of confusion and, to some extent, of resentment on the part of the members of the Tourist Association.  the problem of harmonising these two conflicting authorities and establishing a single body charged with responsibility for guiding and directing the activities <Col N="1148" /> of the tourist industry as a whole had to be examined when earlier legislation was under consideration.  There may be something to be said for continuing the Tourist Association and for availing of the goodwill and widespread connection which that organisation has established over the years.  Nevertheless, I think that the method adopted in this measure is entirely contrary to the best interests of the industry and entirely at variance with the recommendations of all the commissions which have reported on this matter.</P>
    <P>The Christenberry report recommended that the Tourist Board and the Tourist Association should be merged into one body on the basis that, while many of the present functions appeared to be individual ones, there is at least some duplication and the ultimate aim of both groups is, or should be, the same, namely, to promote tourism.  It also recommended the introduction of a new name for whatever body was eventually established.</P>
    <P>The Irish Hotels Commission said that it considered the function of the Irish Tourist Association in the light of modern conditions&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;and desires to record its appreciation of the pioneer work which was performed by this body on a voluntary basis&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The creation of a statutory body has, however, altered matters and it is difficult to justify the present decision under which two bodies would appear to be looking after the interests and development of tourism.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is, I think, significant that both of these bodies&mdash;one composed of outside experts brought in to advise here and the other a group of hoteliers, some of them members of the Irish Tourist Association, who recognised the practical difficulties in the way of the proposed establishment of a single body&mdash; agreed on the necessity and the desirability of establishing one body charged with the direction of the tourist trade and tourist industry.  It was obvious to anyone that with either or both of these bodies charged with responsibility <Col N="1149" /> for the tourist trade there was bound to be overlapping and a good deal of confusion.  This Bill now proposes the establishment of two bodies in effect and with the existing Tourist Association we shall have the extraordinary position of three bodies guiding or in some way having responsibility for directing the tourist industry.</P>
    <P>It is essential in a matter of this kind to avoid any merely personal considerations or any question of personalities and to recognise that the interests of the tourist industry transcend both personalities and the importance of any of these organisations, however long established or however well-intentioned the members of them may be.  The industry is far too important to allow it to be handled in a way which will result in either confusion or overlapping of functions.</P>
    <P>The proposals in Part V of the Bill and in the Schedule contemplate the establishment of a board which has already been functioning, namely, the Tourist Publicity Board.  That board will be given the same funds as the Tourist Board with the exception of the question of guaranteeing loans for development.  The funds available to the Tourist Board and to the Tourist Publicity Board total £500,000, £250,000 to each board.</P>
    <P>Anyone who has any experience of the functioning of the Tourist Board or the Tourist Association will readily recognise that, even though it may take some time, the desirable end to be aimed at is the establishment of a single body, having on it, if necessary, representatives of both organisations. In that respect, I think this Bill should be radically amended on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Minister, when he addressed the Irish Tourist Association last year, said that when the terms of the legislation were published he would like all associations and organisations concerned directly or indirectly with the tourist trade to examine them critically and send him their observations and suggestions and he added: &ldquo;When doing so I hope they will pull no punches.&rdquo;  This third board, or third <Col N="1150" /> organisation, with responsibility for tourist publicity must inevitably mean overlapping and confusion.  Anybody concerned with the tourist trade or anybody visiting the country is bound to be confused by the tripartite establishment proposed under this measure if the Bill goes through as it is at present framed.</P>
    <P>It is desirable, I admit, to avail of the reservoir of goodwill, experience and the wide connection which the members of the Tourist Association have.  In that regard, the experience of the personnel available in that association could be utilised by having representatives of that association on the Tourist Board and by the establishment of a consultative committee which would be in a position to advise on tourist publicity.  To have a separate board with the same amount of financial assistance and consisting of a very large number of persons for whom superannuation and other schemes are made available obviously contemplates the establishment of a board of a permanent character.</P>
    <P>Any statutory organisations that are intended to continue for any period of time should have superannuation schemes and I do not think there will be any objection to the principle in the Bill of providing a superannuation scheme for the staffs of the Irish Tourist Board.  To have two boards with large staffs, with separate directors, plus a Tourist Publicity Board with two or three directors drawn from the Irish Tourist Board, dealing with the same problem or different aspects of it, must create confusion; I believe it is getting the worst of both worlds because it will increase the administrative personnel and administrative costs without any commensurate gain in the development of the tourist industry or without increasing the efficiency of the organisation established to deal with the potentialities of the tourist trade. I think it is desirable, therefore, that this proposal in Part V of the Bill should be deleted, and the Tourist Board should be expanded to include representatives of the Irish Tourist Association; and both the Irish Tourist Association and Irish Tourist Board should collaborate in providing a publicity <Col N="1151" /> scheme and in dealing with publicity matters.</P>

    <P>The background of the Foyle fisheries problem is by now well known to Deputies but it may not be out of place to give a very brief review of the events leading up to the situation which has given rise to this Bill.</P>
    <P>The salmon fisheries of the River Foyle&mdash;an extremely valuable asset&mdash; which were declared forfeit to the British Crown following the Flight of the Earls were, along with certain lands in the then Counties of Donegal, Tyrone, Armagh and Coleraine, entrusted to a body styled &ldquo;The Society of the Governors and Assistants London of the new plantation in Ulster within the realm of Ireland&rdquo; which in later years has come to be known simply as the &ldquo;Irish Society.&rdquo;  This body, drawn from the merchant guilds of London, had no easy task it would seem in carrying out its undertakings as in the course of time, particularly in the past century, it has figured in many legal disputes concerning its claim to an exclusive right of fishery in the Lough and River Foyle.  The latest and, as it happened, final challenge which the society had to meet developed in the early twenties of the present century.  At that time the fishermen of the Donegal shore commenced a vigorous campaign to establish their right to fish in the Foyle waters, both lough and river.  The lessees from the Irish Society in possession at the time&mdash;the Foyle and Bann Fisheries Company&mdash;resisted the intrusion and serious scenes of violence were of frequent occurrence and local feeling ran high against the lessees.</P>
    <P>The existence of this state of affairs <Col N="1153" /> was viewed with grave concern by the fishery authority in view of the grave danger of irreparable harm being done by indiscriminate exploitation to the productivity of the river.  The fishery authority had no power, however, to intervene in a dispute as to title&mdash;even for the preservation of a fishery in the national interest&mdash;and when appeals for intervention came from time to time from either side only one course of action could be recommended&mdash;recourse to the courts.  Claims to several fisheries in other parts of County Donegal were also challenged about the same time and in 1934 the Erne fishermen obtained a declaration from the High Court of the existence of a public right of fishery in the estuary of that river.  Legislation passed in that year&mdash;the Fisheries (Tidal Waters) Act, 1934&mdash;provided the fishery authority with the necessary powers to administer in the public interest any fisheries so declared public.  But the powers so provided could be invoked only where the courts declared that a several fishery no longer existed or where a voluntary surrender was made by the quondam claimants of exclusive rights.</P>
    <P>With substantial increases in the market price of salmon, incursions on the Foyle fishery from the Donegal shores grew more intensive and by 1947 the Foyle and Bann Fisheries Company found itself powerless to preserve those waters for their own use.  At length, that company, as lessees in possession, decided to join with the Irish Society claiming ownership in reversion in seeking a declaration by the High Court, Dublin, to establish exclusive title to a several fishery in that part of the River Foyle called the branch stream, which lies entirely in County Donegal.  The Attorney-General and certain local fishermen were named as defendants in the action.  It is not necessary for our present purpose to recount the course of the action or the considerations which weighed with the plaintiffs in making the branch stream the subject of their application.  By judgment given in the High Court in October, 1948, Judge Gavan Duffy found in favour of the defendants on all three grounds of claim.  The plaintiffs in the action gave notice of intention <Col N="1154" /> to appeal to the Supreme Court, but it was already evident to both sides that a protracted legal battle could result only in barren victory for the contestants and that, while the courts deliberated, the fishery would be reduced to ruin.  The régime appropriate to a public fishery in tidal waters was duly established for the branch stream by means of Orders made under the Fisheries (Tidal Waters) Act, 1934 and, as a corollary, certain areas of sanctuary were created within the waters under our jurisdiction and other restrictions as to type and length of net were imposed by bylaws made in 1949 and 1950.  It had to be admitted that such measures could have no more than partial success so long as the river remained in divided jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>The practical difficulties of fisheries administration in border areas has long been recognised, and an early, but unhappily, abortive attempt was made to deal with them under the Council of Ireland provisions of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920.  When, therefore, it was learned early in 1949, through the medium of discussions between the Attorneys-General in Dublin and Belfast respectively, that the Irish Society was prepared to enter into negotiations for a settlement of the legal proceedings and that the Belfast Government would be willing to join in a scheme for State acquisition of the fisheries, the late Government authorised the undertaking of the necessary negotiations.  There ensued a series of negotiations in two spheres, firstly, that of finance in seeking agreement between the Irish Society and the two Governments on a fair consideration for transfer of the property, and, secondly, that of administration, in which the problem of co-ordinating the two jurisdictions within the fishery had to be solved. It is in no small measure due to the goodwill and sympathy displayed on behalf of the Irish Society that the Governments found themselves in July, 1950, in a position to announce that agreement had been reached providing for the acquisition on behalf of the public of all fishing rights in the tidal waters of the Foyle held by the Irish Society.  The further intimation that it <Col N="1155" /> was proposed to set up a new joint authority with responsibility for the regulation and conservation of fisheries within that water-shed marked the attainment of a considerable measure of agreement between the two Governments on broad principles of joint administration of the fishery.</P>
    <P>On this aspect of the matter, too, it is right to pay tribute to the ability and resource displayed by representatives of the two fishery authorities in evolving the scheme to which the present legislation is designed to give effect.</P>
    <P>It may be asked why this legislation is only now before the House.  The answer is that, although the first draft had been signed with the Belfast authorities when the first Foyle Fisheries Bill was introduced by the late Government in May last, I found on taking over the measure that the Belfast authorities would not be in a position to proceed with their Foyle legislation until certain enabling powers had been granted by the West-minister Parliament.  This enabling legislation has been enacted only within the past month or so and circulation of the Dublin and Stormont Bills has been effected at the earliest date consistent with simultaneous release in both Legislatures.  I might mention that the last six months have by no means been wasted; on the contrary they have afforded an opportunity of revising the draft Bills in certain material aspects with results which I am satisfied will inure to the better administration of the fisheries in the Foyle area.</P>
    <P>Coming to the Bill itself, I take it that Deputies will have gathered from the explanatory memorandum which has been circulated with it that despite its 83 sections and five Schedules, most of the matter contained therein exists already in the general fisheries code, and at this stage I propose to confine my remarks to those provisions in which new ground is broken.</P>
    <P>Section 8 authorises the Minister to enter into an agreement (jointly with the Ministry of Commerce for Northern Ireland) with the Irish Society, the terms of the agreement <Col N="1156" /> being set out in the Second Schedule. On execution of the agreement the section will operate to vest in the Minister and Ministry an absolute and indefeasible title to all rights of fishing in the tidal portions of the Lough and River Foyle and of its tributary, the River Faughan.  There will also be acquired certain buildings and land necessary to the operation of a fishery.  The financial commitment entailed in this agreement may be summarised as follows:</P>

    <P>I might mention here that, as part of the settlement with the Irish Society, that body withdrew its appeal to the Supreme Court and agreed to pay the costs of the Attorney General and of the special defendants in the High Court action, just as if they had not lodged notice of appeal and the court had proceeded to award costs against them as unsuccessful plaintiffs.</P>
    <P>The total sum disbursed by the Irish Society in this way is not within my knowledge, but it is safe to say that it goes a long way to offset the sum of £55,115 which is being contributed on behalf of the public on the Donegal side of the river.  I have mentioned a sum of £4,400 as being that part of the total acquisition price attributable to the Green Brae Fishery.  These waters had for long been fished as part of the Irish Society's property.  That body had not, however, succeeded in establishing exclusive rights in that stretch and, by paying certain rents, acknowledged claims thereto by superior interests.  It was open to the <Col N="1157" /> Governments to exclude this particular fishery from the scope of the vesting agreement, and had it been so excluded the commission would have had the responsibility of regulating fishing operations therein without having powers of management as it will have over the vested fishery.  This was, of course, to be avoided if at all possible and it was, accordingly, put to the Irish Society that they should buy out these superior interests with a view to having the Green Brae Fishery transferred under the agreement.  The price of £4,400 indicated is the outcome of negotiations in which the fisheries administrations in Dublin and Belfast took part.  I understand that the formal conveyance of this fishery to the Irish Society is in course of being concluded.</P>
    <P>The tenancy of the Foyle and Bann Fishery Company in these tidal waters ended on 30th September, 1950, and in recognition of the fact that the Irish Society had abstained from making a further letting so as to facilitate acquisition by the Governments, interest as from an agreed date&mdash;1st March, 1951&mdash;is being paid on the main purchase consideration of £102,485 for fishing rights, buildings, lands, etc.</P>
    <P>Finally, Section 8 contains provision for compensation with a right of recourse to arbitration in respect of any fishing rights other than those claimed by the Irish Society, which may be extinguished.  So far as is known, however, no such rights exist.</P>
    <P>Section 11 establishes the Foyle Fisheries Commission, with constitution, powers and duties as set out in the Third Schedule.  The commission will, in general, be vested with all the powers of the two fishery authorities in Dublin and Belfast which are required for the conservation, protection and improvement of the fisheries in the Foyle area generally.  In this respect the commission may be said to be a projection of the two Departments concerned, so that the administration of the fishery laws in the entire area will be in the hands of a single organisation, with powers derived from both legislatures.  This is the answer evolved by the law officers to the problem of how to administer the law <Col N="1158" /> in an area in which there are two jurisdictions, the precise extent of which, in the Lough and River Foyle, has never been determined with finality.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for a commission of four&mdash;two from the Dublin Department and two from Belfast.  Each Department will nominate a senior and junior member and the commission will itself select which of the two senior members is to be first chairman.  He will hold office for the first year, and the other senior member for the second year, and so on.  In the case of an equal division of votes at a meeting of the commission at which all the members are present and voting, the chairman will have a casting vote.</P>
    <P>The commission is, by Section 13, given power to make regulations for the conservation and protection of the fisheries in the Foyle area, and by means of such regulations will seek to administer the acquired fishery for the benefit of the public on both sides of the river with due regard for the necessity for maintaining an adequate spawning stock of salmon in the river system.  Generally speaking, it is possible to control intensity of fishing by imposing restrictions such as areas of sanctuary, length of net, distance between nets shot at the same time, and so on, such regulations being recognised by the fishing community to be ultimately to their own interest. The position that has grown up on the Foyle, however, is that year by year increasing numbers of persons have ventured on the river, many of them lacking the experience and appreciation of the well-being of a fishery which one associates with the professional netsman.</P>
    <P>In short, the salmon of the Foyle have tended to become the victims of short-term exploitation.  This being so, the Governments have agreed that the commission should be given specific authority to impose a limit from time to time on the number of licences which may be issued for fishing by commercial methods, that is by means other than rod and line.  The effect of Section 14, therefore, is that the commission may prescribe a maximum number of licences from time to time and, like all other <Col N="1159" /> regulations under the preceding section, the regulation as to maximum number of licences will require the approval of the Minister and Ministry and will be laid before each house of the Oireachtas, where it may be annulled by resolution.</P>
    <P>At this stage, it is appropriate to refer to the special powers to be given to the commission for a transitional period of three years by Article 3 of the Third Schedule.  The effect of this provision is that the commission will be enabled to deal at its discretion with that part of the Foyle which flows entirely through the County of Derry, and which it is considered should for an initial period continue to be worked as a private fishery.  For this purpose, it is intended that the commission should make annual lettings which will be open to public tender.</P>
    <P>This special arrangement, it will be observed, is intended to operate for a transitional period only, and it is expected that, by the end of that period, the commission will have found an acceptable solution of the problem as to how this portion of the river can best be administered on a public basis within the framework of the general scheme.</P>
    <P>Of the remaining provisions in Part II it will suffice, at this stage, to refer to Section 19, whereby the Moville Board of Conservators will be dissolved, and Section 22, which provides for the establishment of an advisory council in accordance with the terms as set out in the Fourth Schedule. The establishment of this advisory council on the basis of elective and ex officio members similar to that which applies to boards of conservators will ensure for the benefit of the commission the continuance of the system of local representation in regard to fishery matters which operates throughout the country through the medium of boards of conservators.</P>
    <P>As to the subsequent provisions of the Bill, I would refer Deputies to the explanatory memorandum, from which it will readily be seen that these provisions consist, in the main, of an adaptation of the general fisheries <Col N="1160" /> code to the requirements of the Foyle area.  The relationship of the various sections to the corresponding provisions of the Fisheries Acts is set out in the form of a table appended to the explanatory memorandum, and I do not propose at this stage to go into further detail in the matter, save to draw attention to the somewhat unusual procedure provided for in Section 62&mdash;apprehension of offenders.</P>
    <P>The procedure proposed here is in effect the answer to the problem of the offender who breaks the law in one jurisdiction and takes refuge outside that jurisdiction in order to avoid the consequences.  The intention here is to provide machinery whereby such a person can be dealt with in the jurisdiction in which he normally resides. A complementary provision in the Foyle fisheries legislation which has been introduced at Stormont secures full reciprocity with the Belfast Administration in this matter.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would recommend to the House that this Bill is deserving of the strongest support.  It can be fairly said to be the outcome of most cordial negotiations with the Belfast Administration.  I have great pleasure in presenting to the House a measure which represents the outcome of a concerted move by the fishery authorities to preserve a national asset.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I take a certain satisfaction in seeing this Bill introduced. The first time I heard of the Foyle fisheries problem was when I contested a seat in Donegal in 1931 and the late Canon John McCafferty, Lord be good to him, was much concerned by the fact that our own people were, in effect, excluded from exercising what he conceived to be their manifest right in the Foyle fishery.  I remember that very violent speeches used to be made in the general elections and by-elections in East Donegal in those days about what everybody was going to do to the base, bloody and brutal British Saxon who prevented the Gael from access to the waters of Lough Foyle; but 18 years passed and nothing was done.  Then, I am happy to say, as a result of sensible agreement and without anyone <Col N="1161" /> shaking his gory locks at anyone else, a <i>modus vivendi</i> was arrived at, whereby the fishery has been transferred into the hands of a body representative of two Governments, both of which are constituted from our own people, and the fishery has a prospect of surviving as a source of very considerable wealth, whereas, in the absence of such an agreement and consequential legislation which the Parliamentary Secretary has expounded here to-day, it is virtually certain that, within a limited time, there would be no fishery on the Foyle at all.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to travel the same ground as the Parliamentary Secretary travelled.  I noted with appreciation the graceful tribute he paid to me for the part I played in the drafting of this Bill.  I feel that it was overgenerous of him to dwell in such detail and at such length on the success which has attended my humble efforts in bringing this happy development to realisation, but there are two specific points which I think may with propriety be mentioned at this stage.  A great many people make the mistake of believing that when a several fishery ceases to operate in estuarine waters, and there is substituted therefor a public fishery under the control of the Government on behalf of the people, it means that all and sundry can cast their nets into the water and drag out whatever they can get.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The only useful purpose served by having control of the fishery at all, once a several fishery has ceased to exist, is to restrict fishing within limits which make it possible for the fishery to survive. Any salmon fishery promiscuously fished by all and sundry, at will, will have a very strictly limited lifetime, and inasmuch as a fishery of this character can have a capital value, at a conservative estimate, of £250,000&mdash; and the House will notice that the consideration given in this case is £100,000 &mdash;it would be a pity to allow that vast potential wealth, that vast permanent potential wealth, to be swept away by permitting indiscriminate fishing at present and in the immediate future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The important thing is that from <Col N="1162" /> this time forward the right to fish there commercially is equally accessible to every citizen&mdash;it is not a matter of privilege&mdash;but the Parliamentary Secretary did not go so far as to tell us whether, when he has approved a limited number of licences&mdash;whether 40, 60 or 80&mdash;and apportioned them, it is the Government's intention that they should be divided as to one-half to licensees in the Six Counties and one-half to licensees in the Republic of Ireland or whether they are to be dealt with locally.</P>
    <P>In either event, what is the Government's intention here as to the method whereby licences available to our people in the Republic are to be allotted?  Will applicants be placed upon a list and a ballot held, placing applicants in the order of priority thrown up by the ballot or lottery? Then, if there are 60 applicants and 30 licences, will the applicants be registered from number one to number 60 and the first 30 get licences this year and the second 30 licences next year? Is it the intention that if there are 30 licences available&mdash;I am taking that figure just for convenience, without any pretence that it is relevant to what is going to happen; it might be 300, but I merely take 30&mdash;and if there are 50 applicants this year for these 30 licences, will a ballot or lottery be held and 30 applicants told that they are successful and the remaining 20 told that they have failed to get licences, with, next year, a similar procedure, or will the 20 unsuccessful applicants of this year have some preferential status in regard to the allocation of licences in the following year?</P>
    <P>I think this is a matter which it would be much better for the Parliamentary Secretary to face now.  This is the nettle of the situation and it must be grasped firmly <i>ab initio,</i> so that conviction can be carried to the minds of those who believe themselves to have a grievance that the alternative to control of this character will be the disappearance of the fishery altogether.  Politically, it would be sounder for me to keep off this thorny problem and leave the Parliamentary Secretary and his political adherents to fight it out between them.  I never <Col N="1163" /> was a politic politician.  I was responsible for promoting the legislation substantially as it is presented to the House.  It was my intention, as Minister for Agriculture, to recommend to the House a limitation of licences.  Had I remained in office I would have made that recommendation and I would have asked the House to sustain it on the ground that the only alternative was the destruction of the fishery&mdash;and you can all go up to Inishowen and dance the &ldquo;can-can&rdquo; about that and say that if the Parliamentary Secretary were only given his way he would have let everybody have a wallop at the fishery. But there was no decision taken up to the time of my relinquishing office about the method of allocating licences for the reasons set out by the Parliamentary Secretary to-day, that progress in the detailed presentation of this Bill was arrested by the fact that the Northern Ireland Government had to get permissive legislation in Westminister before they could proceed.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any useful purpose to be served in wearying the House with the record of the extraordinarily delicate and difficult negotiations that had to be carried through before the problem was brought successfully to the point which it has reached.  Apart from the inter-governmental negotiations, there was a number of charges of an ancient and historic kind that had to be removed from the property and a number of by-ways of a devious legalistic character which had to be explored and disposed of.</P>
    <P>It is very rarely that it is proper or permissible to refer to the work of a public servant, but I conceive in this case&mdash;where I refer to the case of an individual who is no longer a public servant, having honourably retired at the end of a long period of public service&mdash;that it is correct for me to say that so valuable was his advice and his capacity for negotiation in this most delicate matter that I, when Minister, requested and secured from the Government permission to continue him on a limited basis in the public service to carry the negotiations requisite for this <Col N="1164" /> Bill to their successful conclusion.  I want to say quite frankly that without his help it would have been quite out of the question for me to have carried this matter as far as I was able to carry it before I left office.  It is true that in this whole business I had the invaluable help of two successive Attorneys-General and that their superb legal equipment made possible the solution of many difficulties that might have confounded either party to this negotiation and that very often it was their wisdom which carried the two parties through difficulties which sometimes appeared insoluble.  It is a pleasure to recall that in so far as this fishery has been preserved for our people, its preservation is in no small measure due to the skill, the patience and the assiduity of a public servant uniquely equipped to do his job and to whom I think a very special measure of gratitude is due for the work he has done.</P>
    <P>I know the House and everyone else will realise that in saying that I do not desire to diminish in any way the credit due or to denigrate the invaluable assistance which is always provided to every Minister, from whatever side of the House he comes, by the Civil Service as a whole.  All the officers of the Department made the contribution which every Minister knows he can depend on, in the completion of a task of this difficulty. That was so in this case, but there was the outstanding and exceptional contribution of one individual without whom I have no doubt whatever this most desirable development might not have taken place.</P>
    <P>I do not think it should pass without comment that this legislation does more than acquire a fishery.  I think I am justified, Sir, in drawing the attention of the House to the fact that this legislation is the second of two steps that were taken during the tenure of office of the Government to which I belonged, which resulted in a degree of collaboration between ourselves and our own people in Northern Ireland, for which it will be hard to find a precedent. I would remind the House that the ability to reach such agreements and so high a degree of cooperation was not brought about by a <Col N="1165" /> reluctance on the part of the Government of Ireland to do from time to time what it thought right, proper and necessary to do.</P>
    <P>It was quite possible when it became expedient and desirable to establish the constitutional position of this country as a Republic, at the same time by a show of firm goodwill, to make it manifest without raising constitutional issues or requiring either party to such an agreement to concede the other's point of view. Where the mutual interests of all our people were concerned, two bodies such as our Government and the Government of Northern Ireland, divided by the profoundest possible divisions that could exist in the spheres of politics and constitutional law, were still able to find common ground where public interest was concerned.  I think it is just and reasonable that we can regard it as a good augury for the future of this country and as an event from which certain people outside this country might profitably learn a lesson, to wit, that if the people of these 32 Counties were left alone it would be quite possible for them to get along all right without either side eating the other.</P>
    <P>There are certain detailed provisions in this Bill which may require study on the Committee Stage; upon the points of principle, that is, the acquisition, the compensation paid to the body from whom we acquired the fishery, the provision for the constitution of the new governing body, the decision in principle to control the fishery for its own preservation&mdash; for all of those I share and accept responsibility.  I think I am right in saying that for the subsequent detailed matters to which the Parliamentary Secretary referred I can claim neither credit nor blame, because I do not think we had reached the stage of working these things out at the time I ceased to be responsible for these matters.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary can depend, so far as it may be of service to him, on unswerving support from me in the difficulty which he will undoubtedly have in bringing the people in the Moville fishery district to a <Col N="1166" /> realisation of the desirability of preserving the fishery for the people at large by control.  I do not know why he is going to abolish the Moville Fishery Board&mdash;that is a new one on me.  It may be necessary under the new set-up and, doubtless, whatever proposals are now put forward, the Parliamentary Secretary will explain to us in greater detail on the Committee Stage, and will show that the new body will fulfil whatever functions the old body used to discharge.</P>
    <P>I am not quite clear in my own mind and I am not quite easy in my own mind about the procedure for the distribution of the restricted number of licences.  In this connection we must be most scrupulous to remove from the minds of anybody, great or humble, in East Donegal the idea that there is any discrimination whatever.  We must bring home to them that every individual who legitimately applies for a licence, rich and poor, great and small, will stand an equal chance, that there will be no privilege and no preference for anybody, and that this acquisition is done clearly and certainly not for the benefit of the few, but for the benefit of all.</P>
    <P>I am glad to have had a hand in the acquisition of this fishery for our own people, and in so far as it is something to rejoice in, I would like to think of it as a tribute to the memory of the late Canon McCafferty of Stranorlar, who made this cause his own throughout a long life spent in the service of our people.  If this Bill does as much good as I hope it will do, I shall look on its passing&mdash;and I offer him this little tribute&mdash;as an affectionate remembrance from the people of Donegal who had every reason to love him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I think thanks for this Bill are due primarily to that valiant group of fishermen who by great expense and much very hard work on their part had fought a High Court case and got a decision there as to the rights to fish in the Foyle or certain parts of the Foyle as a public fishery.  For the last year or so the fishermen of the Twenty-six County side of the river had doubts as to whether their rights would be safeguarded <Col N="1167" /> by such a Bill.  They had become very anxious once they knew that a Bill was in the offing and they made very many efforts to find out what was being done.  When the Second Stage was mooted some time ago, in the last few months, the Parliamentary Secretary took the trouble of going to the Foyle, meeting the fishermen, hearing their views, and in that way finding out for himself at first hand what was necessary to be done and what could be done.</P>
      <P>It is agreed, of course, that in a Bill like this where one has to deal with two Governments there must be a certain amount of give and take.  The fishermen did appreciate the fact that their views were listened to and they are hopeful that any rights which they have built up over the years will not be taken away from them either by the commission or through influence worked through the commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Further, my own first reactions to the Bill were whether or not, in the passing of it, we were surrendering any part of our national rights.  I feel with regard to the other agreements that have been made&mdash;in the case of the Great Northern Railway and the River Erne&mdash;that none of our national rights have been sacrificed.  I do not hold the same views as Deputy Dillon, that agreements such as these will speed the day when we can and must be masters of our own house&mdash;the 32 Counties.  I have not the same faith as he has that these agreements will lead in that direction.  However, this agreement was needed for the preservation of the Foyle as a public fishery.  In this respect, I must give credit to our fishermen because, although they had opportunities, very little illegal fishing took place along the stretches of the Foyle.  I know that the commission will have a very difficult task to face and I am sorry that more direction was not given in the Bill.  I feel that too much responsibility for the drafting of certain measures for the preservation of the fishery is being handed over to the commission.  They will, of course, have the preservation of the Foyle as a fishery in mind but <Col N="1168" /> it seems to me that more direction could be given by both Governments.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon has mentioned the matter of limitation of licences.  It has not been decided how many licences will be issued.  I understand that there are very few changes in the Bill as previously brought in.  However, one of the most important changes embodied in the Bill as it now stands is that no mention is made of any specific number of licences.  I understand that in the Bill, as previously drafted, 200 was the number mentioned.  Once a specific number is mentioned the temptation immediately comes to the small number of fishermen who operate on the Six County side to go all out for a 50-50 basis of allocation, but the Twenty-Six County fishermen strongly object to any such allocation of licences.  At the present time there are 380 licences on the Twenty-Six County side and only about 40 on the Six County side. That position has obtained over the years, and it would, therefore, be very unjust to have a 50-50 basis of allocation. I feel that a direction should be given to the commission to preserve the <i>status quo</i> in the first year of operation.  The commission should bring into account the number of licences which were issued in 1951 and should attempt very little in the way of limitation for a year.  A new body, such as they are, must find their way about and, with regard to the question of the Foyle, there is a lot to be found out.  Therefore, I would suggest that limitations should be gradual over a period of three years.  I know that one fool-proof method of limitation should be the cutting down of the number of licences issued to individuals.</P>
    <P>There are people who last year and in other years took out four, five, six and, in some cases, more licences.  By cutting down that type of thing a limitation will take place which will be fair to the fishermen themselves. The fishermen as a body are in complete agreement with the idea of such limitation of licences because they are fully aware that the Foyle is a good fishery, and that it must be preserved. They agree that it is only right that this should be done, and they have <Col N="1169" /> pointed out to the Parliamentary Secretary and the public representatives for that area that this is one fool-proof method of reducing the number of licences, that is, by issuing each person with one licence and one licence only.</P>
    <P>Another matter of which I am wholeheartedly in favour is the establishment of an advisory committee.  If the fishermen have grievances of one kind or another they have been worrying as to whom they will make application to have these grievances remedied when the new board is set up.  They wondered would each fisherman have to go to all the trouble of getting in touch directly with the commission, and they visualised this as a very complicated procedure.  They now know that an advisory committee will be formed from amongst themselves having contact with the board, and they realise that this will be a much more expeditious and a much more satisfactory procedure.  It is feared that, when the advisory committee is being selected from licensees, the line fishermen or the rod fishermen on rivers such as the Fauhan will be allowed to vote in the setting up of such committee. There is a large number of such people, and they might not have regard to the interests of the net fishermen.  Therefore, I would be very much interested to see that such an advisory committee should be selected from those who hold net licences.</P>

      <P>In conclusion, I would say that the Foyle fishermen, as a group, are more concerned than any other people to see that the interests of the fishery will be preserved.  They will work wholeheartedly in cooperation with the commission.  They expect, in return, a fair deal.  The Twenty-Six County men on this side of the river who make and have made a livelihood from the fishery expect that, in the allocation of licences, full regard will be given to the fact that they number 387, as compared with very much less than 100 on the other side.</P>
      <P>The fact that the Derry stretch is being or is likely to be put up for tender is, to my mind, a great step forward, from the national point of view.  I do not like to crow about it at the moment.  There are two sides to that question.</P>
      <P>I am in favour of the Bill.  I know very little of the trouble that the ex-Minister, Deputy Dillon, went to, but I do know that the Parliamentary Secretary, who has charge of the matter now, has gone to great trouble to get first-hand information.  I say to him that our fishermen appreciate that and they will, in return, co-operate in the preservation of the Foyle as a public fishery.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to start off by praising this Bill.  It is evident from what has been said on all sides that the Bill is acceptable to the House.  I will content myself merely with dealing with a few aspects of the Bill which occur to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, some little credit for this Bill should be given to the late District Justice Walsh.  He was one of the first in this country to challenge the right of the Irish Society to fish on certain stretches of the Foyle.  As a result of that decision, there has been considerable contention as to the rights of the various parties to fish in certain stretches.  We all know the historic fight of the fishermen in the recent protracted legal action which was heard before the High Court&mdash;one of the longest legal battles in history.  We must also remember that the decision was appealed and that, so far as the <Col N="1171" /> law was concerned, the case was still <i>sub judice</i> when the former Minister decided to intervene, and rightly so, in my opinion.  Between the efforts of the former Minister and the present Parliamentary Secretary they have succeeded in drafting this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I interrupt to establish one point of principle?  I did not intervene until requested to do so by parties to the litigation.  So long as the matter was <i>sub judice,</i> I would not have attempted to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I presumed that that was exactly the position, but I would rather have the Deputy's assurance of it than proceed with my presumption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That was quite right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>On Committee Stage I will offer certain criticism of the Bill, but I would like now to refer to one of the matters mentioned by Deputy Cunningham.  He spoke strongly in favour of an advisory body to advise the commission on various aspects which may arise.  What better advisory body could we have than the Moville Fishery Board?  Here we have a board comprised of the licensed anglers, draft net, drift net and the other various licensed nets on the river, representative of all sections of fishing, democratically elected.  Under this Bill that board is being abolished and we are not told what advisory body is being set up to succeed it.  That is one main criticism which the House should express of the Bill as at present before it.  If we are assured that the new advisory body will be elected in the same constitutional, democratic manner as the Moville Fishery Board was, then it is only a question of changing the name.  I cannot understand why the board is being abolished.  I am the servant of a fishery board.  I know the good work it does.  I know the limitations to the work which it could do which are imposed upon it by legislation. I am aware that, in addition to acting as policemen of rivers and angling generally, they are doing great work for the fisheries of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already referred to the protracted legal battle.  We must not <Col N="1172" /> forget that, were it not for the fishermen of Donegal, that battle would not have been begun and the intervention of the Minister, possibly, would not have occurred.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the distribution of the licences.  What percentage or proportion of the licences which will be issued by the commission will be issued to these fishermen?  Surely we should be told&mdash;and it should not be left to the commission to decide&mdash;the proportion of licences to be issued to those in the Six Counties and those in the Twenty-Six Counties.  The fishermen of the Twenty-Six Counties, of County Donegal, were the men who brought this matter to a head, and they are the men who should be considered under the Bill.  I agree with Deputy Cunningham that we should be told the proportion of licences which we of the Twenty-Six Counties will get.  If the Bill passes without a division, it may be too late then for us to object to the proportion of licences issued or proposed to be issued by the commission. We may have no redress.</P>
    <P>We are not even told how this advisory body will be constituted.  If we knew that, we might take it that the advisory body would be consulted as to the distribution of the licences. That is my main concern in regard to this Bill.  My main concern is for the fishermen of Donegal.  I agree with Deputy Cunningham.  That is his concern also.</P>
    <P>Portion of the Foyle fishery extends into the West Donegal constituency. I hope that when it comes to the appointment of the commission that will not be overlooked and that the anglers on the upper stretches of the Finn will be considered.  That is a matter that could be more appropriately raised on the Committee Stage but I know that the definition of the area goes back to the old Londonderry Fishery Board area of 1855.  If we are going to abolish the Moville Fishery Board, it will be very interesting to know who is going to take over the responsibilities for the protection of the fisheries of the upper stretches of the Finn.  My recollection of the section of the 1855 Act was that the Londonderry Board will not <Col N="1173" /> exercise jurisdiction over the upper reaches of the Finn.  I may be wrong, but if my recollection is correct I am anxious to know who will take over the protection of the upper reaches in future.  Will it be handed over to the Letterkenny No. 14 Board or will a new board be set up for this purpose? That is something to which the Parliamentary Secretary might give consideration.</P>
    <P>As I stated at the outset, I welcome the Bill and I am grateful for the spirit in which it has been received by the House.  I was glad to hear the Parliamentary Secretary compliment Deputy Dillon and the reciprocal congratulations coming from Deputy Dillon to the Parliamentary Secretary as to the manner in which the Bill has been brought before the House.  I sincerely hope that on the Committee Stage the Parliamentary Secretary may consider the nomination of the commission and the nomination of the advisory body to be set up and also the percentage of licences which will be issued to licensed fishermen in the Twenty-Six Counties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>While welcoming this Bill I do so with a certain amount of reservation because I regard it purely as something of an experiment.  Congratulations have been extended from all sides of the House, both to the present Parliamentary Secretary and the former Minister, but I for one do not intend to have any great rejoicing about it for the reason that, in the first instance, we had to agree, before bringing the Bill before this House, that the Government of the Twenty-Six Counties should contribute a sum of approximately £50,000 to purchase a part right in that which we claimed as our exclusive property previously.  I believe that we shall have to face very many difficulties in trying to carry out the provisions contained in the Bill, in a way that will be beneficial to the fishermen in our part of the country. The question of the number of licences to be issued and the proportion of these licences which should be granted to the Twenty-Six County fishermen as against the proportion to be given to the fishermen from the Six Counties has been raised by a number of <Col N="1174" /> speakers.  Whether their real fears in that connection are that too many licences may be granted, and that thereby the fishery may eventually be ruined, or whether they fear that sufficient licences will not be granted to fishermen on the Twenty-Six County side is something which none of them made clear.  When we take the question of the conservation of the fishery in the Foyle one thing we must remember&mdash;and we should not confuse it with the position that might arise from the number of licences granted to fishermen, no matter from which side they come&mdash;is that you are not really affecting the conservation of the fishery, for the reason that on any particular shoot or &ldquo;run,&rdquo; as it is known up there, three boats fishing continuously, one behind the other, in other words three licence holders, can fish as much as 12 boats working in a similar manner could fish in the same length of time, so that we can discard this fear of granting too many licences. It is not the number of licences that matters; it is the time during which fishing will be permitted by the commission when it is set up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coming to the other question that has been raised, the very thorny question of the proportion to be allotted to the different fishermen in the two parts of the country, that to my mind is where this Bill becomes very much of an experiment.  Had this matter not been raised two or three times already, it is a matter which I think might well have been left out of the discussion now&mdash;that is, the matter of the number of licences to be granted and the proportion which should be granted to either side.  It is a rather serious difficulty but it is a difficulty which the commission will have to face.  I think if we had left it to the commission and hoped for the best, it might have been the better thing to do.  Now that it has been brought up, the points raised by other speakers throw some light on the difficulties that will face those men when they come to decide who should get licences and who should not.  So far as the number of last year's licence-holders are concerned, the numbers are somewhere in the ratio of five or six to one in favour of the Donegal fishermen&mdash;in other words, for <Col N="1175" /> every one held in the Six Counties five or six are held in Donegal.  If the licences are to be distributed, therefore, on the basis of the distribution which existed heretofore, we would hold that the Donegal fishermen should get licences in the ratio of five to one for those held by fishermen in the Six Counties.  On the other hand, if we regard it on the basis of territory it would work out somewhere in the proportion already mentioned&mdash;five or six to one.  In the last analysis, it would appear that if there is to be a division of licences&mdash;so many to the Twenty-Six Counties and so many to the Six Counties&mdash;it is clear that the Donegal fishermen are entitled to five or six to one as against the number allotted to Six County fishermen.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell expressed a fear that by not stating specifically in the Bill the number of licences to be granted and the proportion in which they should be divided we might find the commission doing something which we could not remedy later.  So far as I can see, if we do not like what the commission does either this year, next year or at any time in the future then this House can decide to be no longer a party to this particular agreement&mdash; and therein lies our safeguard and the safeguard of our fishermen on the Donegal side of the river.</P>
    <P>We are glad to note the efforts that have been made to bring about this agreement.  To all those connected with the drawing up of the Bill, and particularly to the Parliamentary Secretary, I extend my congratulations.  I should like to repeat that I look forward more in hope than in confidence to the successful outcome of this particular legislation.  If it succeeds, as I sincerely hope it will, then truly we shall have achieved something.  I again congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on the introduction of this Bill and I hope it will succeed in every way he intended.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to believe that this Bill will solve the problem which it purports to solve but I am rather sceptical about it.  I think it is unfortunate that some one of our Governments&mdash;particularly our Government, for preference&mdash;should not <Col N="1176" /> have purchased the entire rights of this river because, human nature being what it is, one is quite sceptical about the result of the operations in this particular regard.  My first objection is that there will be people fishing on that river from our side of it and also from the Six Counties side of it.  It may be that, with practice, the arrangement will work out quite well but, knowing the mentality of the people on both sides of the river in that region, I am not at all hopeful. It may be that this Bill in this House, and the Bill in the Northern Parliament, will reconcile the two peoples and that they will settle down and work out the arrangement as best they can.</P>
      <P>There is a lot connected with this matter that is not in the Bill and the sooner we take cognisance of that fact the better.  The main reference of this Bill is to that stretch of river from Derry City to the town of Lifford.  A particular part of that river is exclusively in the territory of the Republic. I wonder if it is agreed that the commission will have complete control over the entire river, from Derry to the town of Lifford, with regard to the issue of licences, and that they will have control over the portion included exclusively in the Republic&mdash;or will it be a free gap?</P>

    <P>The next matter for consideration is the position of the fishery board.  To me, that matter represents a considerable difficulty.  Provision is made for the propagation and the protection of fish.  I wonder if the Parliamentary Secretary intends that the commission will operate that part of the Bill.  Take, for example, the stretch from Lifford to Fintown.  That entire stretch of the river is in private property.  As far as I can see, this Bill gives the commission no power to interfere with the private rights of an individual.  The main supply of fish to be caught in the territory covered by this Bill must be reared in the stretch from Lifford to Fintown.  What is the commission going to do about that?  They are not given authority to restock that river, which is the main source of supply, under this Bill&mdash;and there is no point in issuing licences to people to fish in the Foyle unless there are fish in the <Col N="1177" /> river.  Although the fishermen on this stretch of the river will not be convinced of the facts, I assure the Parliamentary Secretary that there is no supply of fish in the River Finn; that the fishing of the Foyle stretch&mdash;the stretch covered by this Bill&mdash;has been so intensive that a sea-trout would not get through or pass it.  In that way, it is unfortunate that this Bill is too late, at least for a number of years, and too late at any time unless the commission are given power, which is not contained in this Bill, to enter upon the River Finn and restock it.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether that can be done.  I do not know whether or not the joint owners of that property would be agreeable to recognise this commission at all.  I wonder if the Parliamentary Secretary, or the officers of his Department, has consulted these men as to how they would react to this Bill.  They feel that their property has been destroyed by the manner in which the stretch of river from Lifford town to Derry has been operated in the past number of years.  Are they now to be asked to restock this river at their own expense and that, having done so, the benefit will go to the commission?</P>
    <P>The keystone of the success of this Bill is that we will provide for these fishermen as we are supposed to provide for them.  There is no use in issuing licences to these men, and charging them for them, unless we have some hope of putting money back into their pockets.  Most of the men on the Donegal side are poor, and it would not be just to charge these men excessive sums for licences to fish in the river if there is no fish there for them to catch.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to look over that part of this Bill.  Any advice which I can give him will gladly be given. It is essential for the success of this Bill that something be done with regard to the restocking of the River Mourne and the River Finn.  Until that is done, this Bill will have no effect, and this commission will be utterly useless.  I am sorry to have to admit that.  The fishermen on the Donegal side do not take that point of view. They think the spawning stock on the River Finn is not as low as it is, but <Col N="1178" /> I know, for a fact, that it is low.  I am sorry that the facts are as they are, and I am sorry that this matter was allowed to drag on until conditions are as we find them to-day.  These conditions will continue next year and for the next six or seven years, and even longer, unless active steps are taken now by the Department of Fisheries in conjunction with the commission, or by the commission in conjunction with the Department of Fisheries, with regard to the restocking of this river.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I was saying when the debate was adjourned that the proposals in this Bill, while maintaining the independence of the Irish Tourist Association and the Irish Tourist Board, in fact will probably result in the ending of any real functions by the Irish Tourist Association.  That being so, I believe it would be better openly to face the fact that tourism in this country can be best developed by the establishment of a single statutory authority; that, if necessary, the membership should be extended beyond the seven members proposed. Allowing for the extension from five to seven, it should be possible to secure adequate representation for all the associations concerned, and at the same time maintain the goodwill of the members of the associations at present in existence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Deputies consider what the alternative is they will realise that the proposals in this Bill may lead to a fantastic situation.  It is true that there is provision in the Bill that in its publicity programme the publicity board will have regard to the tourist policy.  But, with one statutory body dealing with one aspect of the tourist situation, such as accommodation and development of the facilities which we need in order to attract tourists, and another independent statutory body charged with the responsibility of conducting publicity, it is obvious that there will be overlapping, confusion <Col N="1179" /> and a top-heavy administrative machine.</P>
    <P>If any consideration is to be given to the suggestion that expenditure at the moment is running beyond income and that we must endeavour to restrict unnecessary expenditure to the lowest limit compatible with essential needs, then administrative expenditure should be kept to a minimum.  The proposal in this Bill to establish a separate board for publicity purposes will, I believe, clog up the whole tourist industry with overlapping and unnecessary administrative responsibility. I do not think that any argument which has been advanced concerning the establishment of a separate tourist publicity board justifies the proposal or will convince Deputies that it is desirable to have a separate body dealing with tourist publicity.</P>
    <P>One can picture a position in which a body charged with publicity, anxious to attract the maximum number of tourists, would run far ahead of the accommodation available here.  It is much easier to attract tourists than to provide adequate accommodation, and this year will likely see the greatest influx of tourists ever to this country. It is questionable whether the accommodation available or what may be provided between now and the opening of the tourist season proper will be adequate to cater for the numbers who will come here.  The fact that the British have restricted the tourist allowance to travellers, the impact of taxation and other restrictions in Britain, will have an effect on the number of persons likely to come here and I believe will result in a substantial increase in the number of tourists from Britain this year.</P>
    <P>The E.C.A. in its earlier operations laid particular stress on the value of the tourist trade and the members of that mission lacked nothing in enthusiasm or energy.  It was noticeable. however, that as the period during which Marshall Aid would run drew to a conclusion there was a change of viewpoint which the Minister referred to.  The same anxiety to secure an influx of American tourists here was not as obvious as it had been in the earlier period.  We should, at any rate, profit by the information given <Col N="1180" /> and the suggestions made by the members of the Christenberry mission and the other representatives of the E.C.A. who came here, and the advice which they gave as to the steps necessary to be taken.</P>
    <P>If we are prepared to adopt some of the suggestions made, such as the suggestions which have been incorporated in this Bill, if the members of the various organisations in the country accept them in the spirit in which they were offered and profit by them, I have no doubt that we can attract a very considerably increased tourist traffic to the country.  We must be prepared to make an effort and we must recognise the potentialities of the tourist trade. In the past, insufficient attention has been paid to that aspect of the matter. As I said earlier, it is probable that very few people recognised the economic advantages of the tourist trade.  This year it offers the best hope of bridging the gap in the balance of payments, because it is capable of expansion more rapidly than any other aspect of our national economy.  Benefit will result not only to hoteliers and other people directly concerned with the tourist trade but to the various cities and towns by attracting the maximum number of tourists possible.</P>
    <P>The Christenberry report recommended increased accommodation. They found it difficult to lay down a definite figure, because it is not possible to get accurate statistics of the number of rooms required.  It was estimated that approximately 50,000 additional tourists would come here in the years immediately following the submission of that report and that at least 1,500 additional beds would be required.  In addition to these suggestions, the report recommended certain improvements which are indicated in the synthesis.  It is in the interest of every hotelier in the country to study that report and to profit by the suggestions contained in it.</P>
    <P>Other provisions in the Bill may, I think, more appropriately be left to the Committee Stage, with the exception of a reference to Section 5 where it states: &ldquo;It shall be the duty of the board to encourage and promote the development of tourist traffic in and to the State.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1181" /> I think that in a Bill of this nature it would be better to say: &ldquo;In and to Ireland.&rdquo;  It is somewhat unusual to limit the operation of a measure of this nature to the State itself.  We should, I think, encourage people to come to the country.  If they come to one part of it, they are likely to go to another part, and we should not distinguish between the area within our jurisdiction and that which is at present outside of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not have intervened in this debate but for the fact that this is one of the most important industries we have especially from the point of view of the agricultural community.  I agree that it is easy enough to attract tourists to the country, but it is extremely difficult, apparently, to handle them either in regard to transport or when they go to the hotels.  I have noticed from time to time that the hotels in the City of Dublin are thronged out with tourists, some sleeping in smoke-rooms and elsewhere, while down through the country, where we have some magnificent hotels surrounded by the most magnificent scenery, with good shooting and good fishing, you hardly see anybody at all in them.  I think we have two bodies dealing with that position and I wonder very much why they cannot do something about it.</P>
      <P>I know there is something to be ashamed of because, on occasions, I myself have been fairly ashamed when I went to certain parts of County Dublin and even certain parts of the County Meath.  I have noticed, for instance, in the case of signposts and of danger signals, that all the reflectors were picked out of the danger signals, while the signposts were always turned in the opposite direction.  That, to my mind, must be very disconcerting to a tourist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When he goes a little bit further he will see a dilapidated house, the walls standing gaunt and naked, all stained with the weather and indicating dilapidation and misery.  Further on, when he comes to a magnificent road, there will be few people around who can tell him anything about it.  There is no literature of any description to tell him anything.  Behind the road he will see <Col N="1182" /> a graveyard covered with nettles, dirt and weeds of every description.  These are some of the reasons why, it seems to me, a tourist prefers to go to the Museum even or into the Picture Gallery to view some of the middling pictures hanging there.  He cannot see the good ones because they are in the cellar mainly, I suppose, because there is no room to hang them.  The same thing applies to the Museum.  There is more underneath in the cellar than there is upstairs, and the reason is that there is no room for it upstairs. Now, I want to say that tourists pay a lot of attention to that sort of thing.</P>
    <P>I was speaking to tourists in Trim during the summer who were anxious to get a hold of some pamphlets giving a description of the many ruins that are to be seen there.  They could not get any.  They asked me for a few books.  If pamphlets were available, these tourists could have spent a few days amusing themselves in that district, particularly if they could get any idea as to whether the ruins there were Cromwell's ruins or Norman ruins. They faced then for the Boyne and the same thing happened there.  They got down to the Loughcrew area.  They could have spent days there examining all the mounds that are on the top of the hill.  There was nobody to tell them anything, who built them or anything else.  There were no pamphlets to be found in the hotels giving any description of them.  If they were to go further, the people around Loughcrew would tell them: &ldquo;Oh! Blessed Oliver Plunket was born there, but do not go down to Loughcrew churchyard because if you do you will be drowned in the weeds; all that is to be seen there is an old tumbled down gate with the entry walls collapsing.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that is no attraction for tourists.  If we take last year, I had occasion to go to Dún Laoghaire.  The going in part seemed to have been happy enough but not the going out part.  I had occasion to go to an office here in the city which is called the London, Midland and Scottish Office. No man could get into that place, and I had to leave.  I was trying to get tickets for passengers.  In order to do so, I had to go to Cooks where I must <Col N="1183" /> say I got every possible service and information.  It was all right getting to Dún Laoghaire, but when we got there the conditions were such that they could have posted up &ldquo;We do not want any tourists.&rdquo;  There were long queues of people, young and old. There were women with children streaming up along the quayside. There were heavy showers occasionally coming down on them and they moved gradually along at a prilgrim's progress. They must have been there for two or three hours before they got in. There were two fierce-looking gentlemen in a box with uniforms on them, who would frighten anybody, refusing to give or to tell these people anything.</P>
    <P>Now, I think that is a public disgrace.  It is all right to make the excuse that the rush season was on. They all knew that.  I never in my life was so ashamed of anything as I was at the conduct and conditions I saw there.  They seem to have improved things a little since.  Since Christmas I have paid another visit, and I intend to continue paying visits until they throw me out.  The conditions were a little different from what they were earlier in the year. They now allow people to get in under the shelters.  Deputies know the big awning over the railway track.  There was a fairly strong wind blowing in from the Channel through the tunnel. I was just wondering how people stick that.  The assistants and the porters had changed their attitude and were rather civil.  Somebody in the meantime had apparently given them a good lecture.  They did tell me this: &ldquo;You know that the customs officials do not come out here until a certain number of people have collected.&rdquo; About 2,000 people had collected.  They were sitting on their bags.  There was a shelter there, but why could not the customs officials come out and operate by allowing those people to board the ship?  If there are not enough of customs officials, then more should be put on, but people should not be kept hanging around there with children in their arms, or old people, some of them lame, with no place to rest or sit down. I think that is highly improper.</P>
    <P>Tourists are not so particular about <Col N="1184" /> luxury hotels.  Our hotels in the West of Ireland did excellently last year, because they are really good hotels.  I know tourists who, when they come here, expect to get Irish stew.  We cannot give the Americans or the French the type of food to which they are accustomed at home, and it would take us a long time to reach that pitch of perfection; but these tourists do not want what they normally have at home.  They want some native product. They want comfortable beds and the ordinary amenities to which they are accustomed.  They get those in the ordinary country districts here.</P>
    <P>Some tourists have talked to me in the past about shooting.  Some of them were fond of shooting and had evidently procured licences.  They asked me where they would get shooting. I had to tell them quite frankly that I could not tell them, because I did not know whether it was the landlord, the tenants or the Land Commission who owned the rights.  I went to the local sergeant and he said: &ldquo;That place up there along the hill is owned by the land owners; the next place the Land Commission owns it and the tenants own the other part.&rdquo; These people could get no shooting, because they did not know where to go to get it.</P>
    <P>Fishing is an excellent attraction, but it is not properly attended to. Lough Sheelin was an excellent trout lake 40 years ago.  During the season numbers of people went down there in the past for fishing.  Only last Sunday I was told by someone living beside the lake that pike have completely overrun the lake and that trout have ceased to exist.  Tourist do not want pike fishing.  There are no trout, and so the tourists keep away.</P>
    <P>As far as the Department of Industry and Commerce is concerned, it did a good day's work for tourism when it insisted on clean shops and put the attendants into white coats.  It might be a good thing to have the meat in the Dublin shops covered, so that the dust from the streets will not get on to it.  Tourists object very strongly to that sort of thing, and they are inclined to say that we are still the &ldquo;dirty Irish.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1185" /> The country people are beginning to realise the value of this industry.  It is to-day more valuable than the cattle industry, the sheep industry or the pig trade or, indeed, all three combined. I think it is a pity we cannot develop the tourist trade from the United States more.  If that could be done it would go a good way towards solving our problems.  If it were properly organised we could almost live by tourism alone.</P>
    <P>With two bodies looking after this industry I am surprised that so many little kinks remain.  One of the things I would like to see rectified is the signposts on the roads.  Their present condition is a clear indication that we have many irresponsible people throughout the country.  The people who remove the reflectors are doing a great deal of damage.  In Northern Ireland every dangerous turn is done with reflectors, so that a motorist knows exactly where he is going and has some protection.  Here reflectors are removed.  I think the Tourist Board should take steps to stop that pernicious practice in order to provide safety for our tourists, who do not know our roads.  As a result of that unfortunate accident on the quays here in Dublin, in which two girls on holiday here were drowned, there has been some criticism in Great Britain and some talk about the lack of safety here.  I hope the bodies concerned will take the necessary steps to prevent any such unfortunate occurrence in the future.</P>

      <P>Possibly most of what Deputy O'Reilly has said, as far as tourism is concerned, is true, but I do not think there is any use at this stage in blaming us for being what we are because, while this may be an attractive country at the moment for tourists, I do not think anybody can maintain that it was ever a Mecca for tourists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of the Bill, the object of the contribution made by the Minister, by Deputy Cosgrave and, indeed, the object of the country as a whole, is to try to make the country tourist-conscious. By a trick of fate this country in the last few years has been singled out to be a tourist centre.  Because <Col N="1186" /> Europe at the present time is not so attractive and Britain has cut her allowances to prospective travellers to European countries, we find ourselves to-day in the position that there are hundreds and thousands of people anxious to come here for their holidays, and the plain fact is that we are not quite ready for them.  That is not the Government's fault.  It is not the fault of the last Government; neither is it the fault of the people generally. It just happens to be that way.  We are not ready for the windfall that has come our way.  It behoves every one of us, and especially the Government, with the co-operation of the hoteliers and every section of the community, to pull our weight to try to cater for the people who will undoubtedly be attracted to our shores this year and for some years to come.</P>
    <P>It is an astonishing fact that the tourist industry here is second only to agriculture.  That is something that never occurs to the man in the street until it is pointed out to him.  We are inclined to laugh at tourists.  We are inclined to have but little respect for the people who come here because we regard them more or less as freaks. We do not appreciate their value.</P>
    <P>Some of our people have had the experience of going to countries like France and Italy and coming back to tell us that they were fleeced.  We are pretty new in the tourist industry.  If we go hell-for-leather in trying to get all we can out of our tourists they will soon get wise to us and take their custom and their money elsewhere. There is another danger in that respect.  If tourists are fleeced and if a deliberate attempt is made to put up prices, that will react on the cost of living generally through the cost of increased commodities, and there is, therefore, the possibility that the very presence of tourists here will adversely affect the cost of living for our own people.  There is another danger, and it is one which the Minister for Industry and Commerce should guard against.  The people in Wexford have had the experience of finding themselves short of essential foodstuffs because of an influx of visitors from some of the Welsh towns.  Such commodities as bacon, ham, cigarettes, <Col N="1187" /> butter and so on could not be purchased over certain week-ends in Wexford town because so many people came across from Wales.  Now I have no objection to their coming over here, but I would ask the Minister to try to ensure that, in a case like that, the presence of tourists will not adversely affect the people of the town where the tourists are visiting.</P>
    <P>I would join with Deputy Cosgrave in making a plea to the Minister&mdash; possibly he has no set views on the matter&mdash;to have both the publicity and the general running of the tourist industry here under the one board. Call it Bord Fáilte, or the Tourist Board&mdash;whatever you like&mdash;publicity should not be divorced from the ordinary business of the Tourist Board in any attempt to assist the industry and to assist those who run our hotels. I think both of them should go hand in hand.</P>
    <P>I also make this complaint.  As far as publicity in the past is concerned, I have had several complaints from people, especially in Britain, with regard to the infinitesimal publicity in connection with Irish resorts and the country generally compared with the publicity that other agencies for other countries give in respect of the attractions in countries in Europe and elsewhere. The offices from which information is supposed to be available are not very largely staffed, and posters, such as are seen at railway stations, are nothing compared with similar posters advertised in other countries. Generally, the efforts in regard to publicity engaged in in Britain by the Tourist Board seem to be puny alongside the efforts that are made by Britain and by the agencies of other European countries.</P>
    <P>In respect of this Bill I want to say that I consider it a good Bill generally, but I am sceptical as to whether or not the functions of the board, as set out in Section 5, will ever be carried out to any great extent.  It is my hope&mdash;I am sure it is the hope of the Minister&mdash; that they will.  I believe that the money that has been proposed is a very, very small investment for an industry which <Col N="1188" /> has been described as second only to the agricultural industry and which is the biggest dollar earner that this country has.  I agree that it is only a start. If the sum represents, to some extent, a token in that way I suppose it will be an inducement to hoteliers and other people who are interested in the tourist industry.  It would be a sort of lead to the people in general to become, as I stated in the beginning, tourist-minded and try to make tourists in this country feel that Ireland is a place worth visiting.</P>
    <P>I want to make a few comments with regard to a few functions of the board as laid down in Section 5 but, before going on to that, I want to say that one of the most important parts&mdash;if not the most important part&mdash;of the tourist industry in this country is our hoteliers, the state of the hotels and the type of accommodation they can provide.  For that reason, I would suggest to the Minister that he should bring in an amendment on the Committee Stage to provide that the hoteliers be given representation on the Tourist Board.  As the Bill stands, I do not think it provides for that but I think it would help the industry generally because they are people who should know the hotel business inside out.  As I have said, they represent the most important part of the tourist industry because everybody will readily admit that we have the attractions here in places of historic interest. We have lakes, rivers and mountains which usually attract visitors and which are usually reckoned to be the best scenic value in the world.</P>
    <P>Might I also at this stage risk a stabbing remark by advocating that there should be a workers' representative in the hotel business on this board?  It must be admitted by all who are in the habit of dealing with hotel workers that the hotel worker knows his business inside out.  Any man conversant with the work of an hotel and who is from day to day dealing with the members of his union who are on an hotel staff knows that the hotel porter, waiter or waitress would be able to tell you more about the likes and dislikes of tourists than possibly the manager will.  I throw out that suggestion to the Minister.  Perhaps, <Col N="1189" /> he would in any case give consideration to the appointment of a workers' representative on the Tourist Board.</P>
    <P>There are just a few matters of detail which I propose to expand on the Committee Stage but, perhaps, it would be no harm to mention them now.  I give them for what they are worth, qualifying my remarks by saying that I have gone to the trouble of interviewing some hotel people, who have given me this information.  One of their objections is that those people who come from time to time to inspect hotels for the purpose of grading them have no experience in hotel work and management.  Most of them&mdash;I do not question their competency in respect of the work for which they are trained&mdash; were originally trained in domestic economy.  As students of domestic economy, they will have a certain knowledge of kitchen management, cooking and things like that.  As far as hotel management is concerned, they would not have the experience or the knowledge that any person who had worked in an hotel would have for such a job.</P>
    <P>There is also the complaint that these hotel inspectors come at inconvenient times.  Possibly it is right to come at inconvenient times to test the efficiency of the staff and to catch the hotel on the wrong foot, if you like, to see in what state the hotel is.  My complaint, however, is that overzealous inspectors come at some ridiculous hours of the day, between 9.30 and 10 a.m., when the bedclothes are thrown down at the end of the bed, and when the hotel is rather topsy turvy as you would expect.  Neither the management of the hotel nor the hotel staff has the time to be answering questions or showing these visitors around, because it is the busiest time of the day.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Tourist Board, through the Minister, that these inspectors endeavour to conduct their inspections at some other hour. I should also like to see the Tourist Board give a report on the inspections to the hotel owners or management. It is not this year or last year that I have heard this complaint but over the <Col N="1190" /> years I have heard the complaint that these inspectors come to the hotels look around, make a few comment and then go away.  Subsequently, word is received by the hotel manager or proprietor that the grade is A, B, C or D.  If it happens to be B or C, no report is given to the hotel management and there is no advice as to how the hotel could be managed with a view to getting it a better grade.  I would suggest that the Tourist Board consider sending a copy of the inspector's report back to the hotel as soon as it is available.</P>
    <P>With regard to the advancement of either grants or loans to the hotels for the improvement of accommodation, I should like the Minister to try to see also that this money is made available during the off season, the slack season&mdash;that is, between October and December.  He may reply to the effect that they may carry out these improvements or renovations during October or March, but I think that the board should make an effort to see that it is available for that particular time because as everyone will appreciate it is only then, during the slack season, that hotels can carry out any big scheme of reconstruction or renovation.</P>
    <P>I would like also to advocate that the Tourist Board have an architect, a man who has made a special study of hotel construction, who would be available to advise those who intended to enlarge or reconstruct their premises.  Many of the hotels in this country were not built as hotels but as ordinary dwelling houses and when the proprietor discovered that he could make a go of the hotel business he added a room here, another room there and then started to build on top of that.  The result is that we have in this country hotels that look very crooked and very funny indeed.  It would not be easy to reconstruct many of our hotels especially in the old towns.  I have in mind my own town. The Minister and many members of the House know it and I do not think that they could visualise any artistic improvements in our hotels.  They are good hotels all right, but if extensions or renovations were to be carried out the proprietor would benefit by the advice of the board's architect if he <Col N="1191" /> were a man who had made a study of that type of building.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to some of the reports which I have only just scanned to-day.  I do not know whether the Minister has responsibility or not&mdash;he had not responsibility for the mission to which I referred to-day&mdash;but why send old men to America?  I mean no reflection on their age or ability, but we have young men who have made hotel management their profession. Many good men come from Shannon Airport and from hotels in Dublin who have taken up the hotel business as a career.  If in future a mission is to go to America I would suggest that the majority representation should be men under 35 or 40.  At least let them be young men.  I do not know whether the Tourist Board could help in this respect or not, but we have young men who have taken up the hotel business as a career and are trained in that business and, consequently, I suppose one can assume that they are trained in the tourist business.</P>
    <P>As far as general hotel work is concerned the Minister for Education should endeavour, with the cooperation of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, to set up in the big provincial centres or to have set up by the county vocational education committee classes for those who are engaged or who intend to engage in the hotel business as waiters, cooks, chefs, barmen or anything else.</P>
    <P>I think that the Minister made an excellent contribution here to-day when he talked about the general look of the country as it appears to a tourist.  We should start at the starting place.  The main bulk of the visitors&mdash;I should say all the visitors&mdash;who come into this country come to&mdash;I will mention the most important first&mdash;Rosslare, Dún Laoghaire, Cobh or Shannon, and I think we should make a big effort to make those places attractive in appearance.  I cannot say that they are attractive in appearance.  Shannon and Dublin airports are attractive by reason of the fact that they have been recently constructed, but I do not think that one could say the same for Rosslare or the approaches to the town of Wexford.  I do not think I would <Col N="1192" /> be impressed if I came to Rosslare for the first time and drove into the town of Wexford because&mdash;the Minister mentioned this aspect&mdash;we have so many derelict sites at the entrance to the town that the tourist would be inclined to shudder.  The corporation have responsibility and the county council may have some responsibility, but if the Tourist Board or the Department of Industry and Commerce could by means of financial encouragement or even ordinary encouragement induce them to clear up those derelict sites and make the approach to these towns attractive, it would go a long way towards making the country attractive to tourists.</P>
    <P>I suppose that this is one of the most badly sign-posted countries in the world.  As a public representative I have to travel around County Wexford a good deal, and more so during election times, and as often as I have gone to South County Wexford I have been lost more often than Mr. Christenberry was in the whole country merely because the place is not sign-posted. We are peculiar in County Wexford in having too many roads.  If the Tourist Board fulfilled one of their functions by inducing the Automobile Association, the R.I.A.C. or the local authority to provide many more sign-posts where they are needed, the tourist and traveller would not feel so frustrated as they must be at the present time. If a tourist comes into Rosslare Harbour and wants to go to Cork by road, I certainly do not envy him because to get from Rosslare to New Ross would take about a fortnight, especially if he were driving in the dark.</P>
    <P>While I am on the subject of Rosslare might I mention that it is the principal port through which tourists bring their cars into the country? About 75 per cent. of the tourist cars coming into the country come through Rosslare.  An important point is&mdash;the Minister may possibly have heard of it from Rosslare people before&mdash;that each car has to be transported on a railway wagon for 100 yards and then travel up over a crooked road for another quarter of a mile, and then the tourist gets it.  How much better it would be <Col N="1193" /> if the tourist could get off the boat and step into his car on the pier, and drive off wherever he wants to go?  There is a roadway or street along the pier that could be used for the transport of cars direct from the boat to the main road.</P>
    <P>In this country and in the hotels there is not half enough information for the tourist who comes to the country. He has not the slightest idea of where he may find some place of interest, a place to fish or a place to amuse himself generally.  Again, the reason is that we are not tourist-conscious and do not avail of the opportunities which present themselves to us in the tourist business.  In the first place we have not guides.  I do not say that we would have a lot of work for guides but there are many places in this country that need to be described to the tourist, especially the Americans who will give you all the money they can, if you show them some place and persuade them that their mother, grandmother or some of their relations lived there.  There are many opportunities for guides because there are so many places of interest in the country and so many people anxious to hear about them.</P>
    <P>With regard to the portion of the Bill which deals with the granting of licences for hotels and holiday camps, I do not know whether it is desirable that there should be any relaxation of the licensing laws even to facilitate tourists.  I think the <i>bona fide</i> racket, as one might call it, is being too much exploited.  The <i>bona fide</i> traveller may be served with intoxicating liquor up to 12 o'clock but the local man has to go out at ten, and I rather imagine that if there was a flat time for closing, a compromise between 10 p.m. and 12 midnight, it would be more satisfactory, because, while the visitor can go into a public-house or an hotel for a drink and can stay there until midnight, his friend who lives in the town must get out at 10 p.m., so that there is confusion and a certain sense of frustration on the part of the local man.  However, all these things can be discussed on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on the introduction of this Bill, to congratulate the former Parliamentary <Col N="1194" /> Secretary and the members of all the missions which went to the United States, because, between them, they have given a fillip to the tourist industry which will have the effect, as I hope and believe, of making this country tourist-conscious and bringing so many much-needed dollars and business generally into the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOCarroll" hpid="Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on the introduction of this very comprehensive Bill in so short a time since the new Government came into office.  It is a Bill which does about everything the Government could possibly do to help the tourist industry, and if the hoteliers, with the assistance given under this Bill, cannot make good business for themselves and for the country, I do not think it will be the Government's fault.  The Bill provides for a special board to deal with publicity. We here apparently have been living in rather glorious isolation in the matter of publicity, and we have only wakened up to the fact that, from the tourist point of view, people in America and outside the country generally know very little about this country and its tourist facilities.</P>
      <P>I have spoken to a number of hoteliers over the past few months and they all stressed the importance of this matter of publicity.  One thing which I find very interesting is the fact that in the Bill the Minister has gone much further and has provided much more money than many of these many experienced hoteliers expected would be made available or thought, in the first instance, necessary.  The sum to be expended should give a very good return. I should imagine that there is very little known of Ireland's tourist facilities in the United States, but, through the various bureaux abroad and through the dissemination of publicity within the country, once the tourist has arrived here very good results will accrue for the whole industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tourist usually came to this country picturing Ireland as a land with plenty of food and very beautiful scenery.  On arriving here, the first thing he found very often was that the weather was bad.  He looked out of the window of his hotel on a wet day, not <Col N="1195" /> knowing how to use his time.  The facilities were not there and the publicity was not there to enable him to know how to get around and see the many very wonderful traditional things in our history, the various sights and so on, which he should have been able to see, so that this money to be spent on publicity will bring tremendous advantages from the tourist point of view.</P>
    <P>I think the question of our ports and landing facilities is frightfully important. It is practically the most urgent thing to be dealt with under this Bill. We are all ashamed&mdash;everyone here admits it&mdash;of our ports&mdash;not only of their appearance but the landing facilities available, with the queueing that takes place, the delays involved and the fact that at most of them a motor car cannot be landed at all. That is a very great disadvantage and something that should be looked into right away, because the modern tourist, the wealthy tourist, the man whom we want to attract here, whether he comes from the United States, from England or from the Continent, is going to bring a car with him, especially when he realises that he is coming to a country whose attractions are scattered.  If he is coming here for fishing, shooting or hunting, he will need to travel from one county to another, so the fact that his car cannot be landed at most of our ports is a very great disadvantage.  At Cobh, you cannot land a car at all, and the same applies to Dún Laoghaire, so that the question of port facilities is one of the most urgent matters to be attended to for the coming season.</P>
    <P>Under other sections of the Bill, there is provision for the giving of grants, loans, technical assistance and help of various kinds to hoteliers. I feel that the questions of the general standard of our hotels and how this money is to be used are tremendously important.  It would be a very great pity if these grants and loans were used to encourage the building of a large number of luxury hotels throughout the country.  This is a problem which we have to face very seriously.  If we are going to build extra hotel accommodation at high cost, say, at a couple of <Col N="1196" /> thousand pounds per room, that expenditure is going to be reflected in our tariffs, and it is on our future tariffs that the success of this industry is going to depend to a very great extent.</P>
    <P>I notice in the Bill that hotels with accommodation for over 20 people are particularly mentioned.  I do not mind the setting of a certain standard of size, but we are trying to develop an Irish tradition and an Irish style in the hotel industry, and we should try to keep outside the cities, and, to a certain extent, even in the cities, to the moderate-sized hotel, with the personal touch, the hotel which is proprietor run.  That is the type of hotel which is the backbone of the industry on the Continent and elsewhere. It is the type of hotel where you get good value, good service and well-cooked food.  It would be a tragedy if an effort were to be made either to Americanise or Europeanise our cooking, or if anything were done to try to force our hotels up to a foreign standard.  So far as food is concerned, we should be able to create a standard of good Irish cooking and we should be proud of it.  We should not try to copy French or American cooking, except as a speciality.  For the basis of our catering and the menus in our hotels we should be able to develop an Irish style of cooking and we should keep to that.  I agree with Deputies who have said that when American or Continental visitors come here what they want is Irish food and, therefore, it is up to us to give them Irish dishes and to see that they are properly cooked.</P>
    <P>Another question is that of cleanliness. Many of our country and city hotels are far below the standard of cleanliness which is absolutely essential to an efficiently run tourist industry. On the question of technical advice and assistance under this Bill, the board can be of tremendous help.  I hope it will be able to guide our hoteliers to learn right at the start that, if tourism is to be a big business, it must be on the basis of a big turnover with a small margin of profit.</P>
    <P>We are a young country so far as business is concerned and I feel that many of the business opportunities we have had so far have been somewhat <Col N="1197" /> spoilt by people seeking too big a margin of profit from the start.  The money being provided may attract people to Ireland&mdash;I am sure it will&mdash; but the important thing in the years ahead is whether they will come back or not.  They will not come back if, when conditions are more normal again, they can get cheaper accommodation on the Continent.  In our whole approach to the enlarging, extension and modernisation of our hotels, we should encourage our hoteliers to do that economically. There is no reason why we should not provide the plumbing, heating and other modern amenities, but that can be done without a good deal of the tiles, fittings, mahogany and expensive furniture.  Many hotel rooms can be very adequately equipped by very simple and cheap built-in furniture, providing better accommodation than most of the mass-produced furniture and making the running and the cleaning of the rooms much easier. All this will be reflected in our costs.</P>
    <P>I would like to know from the Minister what steps he is going to take to see that our tourist industry will not be affected by overcharge.  We are going to give this money out to this industry.  I have the Tourist Board Official List for 1952 here.  I have the charges in front of me and I notice in little ways here and there all sorts of alterations in the classification which mean all the time gradually rising costs.  Formerly it was the custom to charge a high season rate from June to September and on certain Bank Holidays.  I notice in looking through this now that in many cases &ldquo;sports fixtures&rdquo; are put in as an occasion for the high tariff.  There is not one day that there is not a sports fixture somewhere and if a man arrives in Dublin and seeks accommodation late at night he may be told by some hotelier who wants to make the maximum amount: &ldquo;There is a sports fixture on and we are charging the high season tariff.&rdquo;  Steps will have to be taken to see that this industry is not spoilt by overcharging.</P>
    <P>There is the very important question of licensing.  Perhaps it is an unfair allegation to make, but I think the hotels of this country have completely <Col N="1198" /> ruined and destroyed the use of wines in hotels by the very high prices they charge.  It seems to me that the licensing laws at present, whatever they are, do not control the price of wines.  Hotels are allowed to buy and rebottle wines and charge in some cases 100 per cent. or more profit on them.  If this industry is to mean something to our country, these points must be considered very carefully.</P>
    <P>I am very glad to see the return of grading.  I am sorry it was ever dropped, and I hope that, in future, the hotels will be graded much more strictly than before.  I noticed in the past that a hotel which was described as Grade A apparently reached that classification on certain amenities, and because it reached that classification it was allowed to charge a certain figure for its luncheons, dinners and other meals, but the grading never laid down what it should provide for that charge. I suggest to the Minister that that is something which should be taken into account very seriously when grading is enforced again.  It is not very much satisfaction to you if you go into a Grade A hotel and sit in luxury accommodation, but get a thoroughly bad and inadequate meal, and when you are charged the top rate you are informed that they are entitled to charge it as a Grade A hotel.  The grading should take into account the food provided, the number of courses and the type of meals.</P>
    <P>I am making these criticisms only because I want this to be a success from the start.  I think it is a wonderful opportunity, and I hope hoteliers will avail themselves of it.  In fact, I am sure they will, and certainly if the hotel industry does not prosper in this country it will not be the fault of the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say at the outset that I welcome this Bill and, with one grave exception, I have not very much criticism to offer to it. That criticism of mine is one that has been voiced already by my colleague, Deputy Cosgrave&mdash;it is in relation to having more than one board.  I think that the Minister is making a grave mistake in creating a third board under this Bill, and I do not believe that any <Col N="1199" /> convincing reasons can be advanced for that.  It is my opinion&mdash;it was also the opinion of those inside the country and those whose advice from outside was sought&mdash;that we should have but one board.</P>
      <P>We certainly require a first-class advertising organisation or department, but that could be a department of the Irish Tourist Board.  To have three boards operating must lead inevitably to confusion and overlapping and to very heavily increased administrative expenses.  We are to have one board to deal with publicity, trying to induce or entice visitors to come here from abroad; and when they reply to these advertisements they will get a reply back from the Publicity Board referring them to the Tourist Board for particulars of accommodation and whatever other information they may require. I would appeal to the Minister to reconsider this whole question of having more than one board.  From my knowledge of the tourist industry over the last few years, I believe that no convincing case can be advanced for more than one board.</P>
      <P>The criticism that has been offered already by Deputies O'Reilly and Corish and to some extent by Deputy ffrench-O'Carroll, has been in relation to matters that require attention but which are or should be entirely outside the functions of a tourist board. They are matters which call more for the attention of the local authority.  I agree that our sign-posting is something we have no reason to be proud of but we should not leave it to the Automobile Association to do that job for us.  Even so, although the sign-posting may be done badly at present, if it were not for the Automobile Association we would probably have no sign-posting at all.</P>
      <P>Deputies are still inclined to talk as if there had been no advance and no improvement in facilities for tourists. I have travelled probably as widely as anyone in this country and I know as well as anyone else that in some parts there are certain hotels which are no credit, but on the other hand it is only right to say that there has been a very decided improvement in the hotels generally all over the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1200" /> It must be remembered that many of these improvements were carried out under grave difficulties, and it must also be remembered that, because of shortages of material and the shortage of skilled building workers, it was only within recent times that hotels could get permission to engage in any sort of heavy structural alteration or additions to their premises.  I feel that very considerable progress has been made.  We have many hotels in this country which can compare more than favourably with the general run of hotels in most other countries. Deputies, and still more so, members of the public, are inclined to compare the average hotel in this country, not with the average hotel in some other country, but with the Waldorf Astoria in New York or with some other elaborate hotel in Paris or London.  As I said already, the average hotel in this country can compare very favourably with the average hotel in every other country.  As a matter of fact one of the statements made to me by Mr. Christenberry, the head of the American Mission who came over here, was that he and his colleagues had been pleasantly surprised to find that some of the smaller hotels and guest houses in this country could compare most favourably with the hotels and guest houses of similar standards even in America.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll made a reference to hotel charges.  I suppose the costs for those who operate hotels have increased as much as the costs for those who operate any other sort of business.  I doubt if the proportionate increase in hotel charges is any greater than the proportionate increase in any other charges in this country as against pre-war days.  I certainly know that hotel charges in this country, taking standard for standard, the standard of food and the standard of service, are lower than those in Great Britain or in most of the European countries.  I think Deputies will find that this is quite true.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1201" /> Quite a number of points which I had intended to make have already been made.  However, there is one aspect of this whole tourist industry which I want to put as strongly as I possibly can to the House and to the Minister.  We want something more than just the fair name of Ireland to bring tourists here and to bring them back again.  We can get, and will get, a big influx of tourists at the peak season, but our problem, which is the problem of most countries, is to get off-season tourists, to attract people here in the off-peak periods, so to speak.  This country could, in my opinion, within a comparatively short time and for a comparatively small expenditure of money, be made a tremendous attraction for the best type of tourist&mdash;the tourist who is less exacting than the average tourist who comes here now, the tourist whose requirements are reasonable in relation to either accommodation or food, the tourist who will come back again and again year after year, and the tourist who is responsible for giving more employment than the average type of tourist.  I refer to the sportsman type. We have never attempted to exploit our fishing, shooting and hunting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOCarroll" hpid="Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>Fishermen will eat anything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to stress that.  I feel that in our fishing, shooting and hunting amenities we have something we can sell.  With the exception of the Irish-American, I doubt if we have anything to offer the ordinary American tourist coming to this country.  The inland salmon and trout fishing and even the coarse fishing in this country could be responsible for bringing us an enormous number of tourists who would come back year after year and bring others with them.  However, the rivers and the lakes in this country have been and are being seandalously neglected.  There is no question whatever about that.  We have some remarkably beautiful stretches of water in this country, vast expanses like Lough Derg, but&mdash;except for a few weeks when the mayfly is hopping about&mdash;you could not get a trout out <Col N="1202" /> of them for 11 months of the year. Deputy M. O'Reilly mentioned Lough Sheelin.  What he said in relation that Lough is true of practically every lake in the Midlands in this country. There is no money worth talking about set aside by this Government for the stocking or protecting of the inland fisheries of this country.  It was certainly my intention, had I remained in the Department of Industry and Commerce and had the responsibility for bringing this measure before the House been mine, that a considerable sum of money provided for tourism under this Bill would be earmarked for the proper protection and stocking of the lakes in this country.  We have a system of protection known as boards of conservators.  They can employ very few people and they have not the funds at their disposal even to pay those they do employ.</P>
      <P>I have not any knowledge or experience of shooting in this country but I have gone to the trouble of discussing the matter with people who do know something about it.  I understand that, through neglect and for other reasons, shooting in this country is rather poor except in certain areas but I am assured that, within a reasonable time, it could be very much improved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will leave the question of hunting to be discussed by those Deputies who are better equipped with the knowledge to deal with it than I, but I think it is something on which we ought to concentrate.  I want to say this and, of course, like a lot of other things I say I will be misunderstood and misrepresented, but no matter.  For goodness' sake do not let us be codding ourselves by exaggerating the importance of the American tourist to this country.  It is all nonsense.  But we can bring dollars, and, in my opinion a substantial quantity of dollars, particularly nowadays when the cost of trans-Atlantic flights has been reduced to a comparatively reasonable figure, by attracting those who have only a fortnight or three weeks at their disposal to come to this country.  I believe we could bring a considerable number of our own people back from America for a holiday here if they are approached in the right way in <Col N="1203" /> America.  These are the type of Americans that we want, and they are the only type we are likely to get.</P>
    <P>Let us face up to this, that with the attractions we have here for the ordinary wealthy American doing Europe, we cannot compete with Nice, Paris and Monte Carlo, and they will not come here except for a very short stay. It is no exaggeration to say that if our salmon fisheries were properly protected, our rivers properly stocked, we could attract a fairly considerable number of wealthy American sportsmen over here for salmon fishing, in addition to attracting our own people here.  That, in my opinion, should be one of our easiest tasks.  We have very big advantages.  We have in America, if we like to make use of them, readymade organisations that could be turned into tourist agencies for the purpose of getting Irish people to come here.  I refer to the various Irish societies and communities that are spread throughout the whole of the States.  I do believe that that is an aspect of the American tourist traffic, and perhaps the only one, that is worth developing.</P>
    <P>In passing, may I say there is one omission from this Bill that I do not understand?  I hope it is only an oversight, or if it is not, I would like to get some reason for it.  I notice there is no reference to or provision made for restaurants whether in regard to being subject to inspection or enjoying the privileges of the Bill.  I think that is an omission that the Minister might have considered.  It must be remembered that a very considerable number of our tourists will be frequenting our restaurants.  Quite a number of them will be moving through the country having odd meals in restaurants and not in hotels; and a number of them will be staying in hotels, having bed and breakfast and having the remainder of their meals out.  It is important that there should be a proper grading system in relation to restaurants and that these restaurants should not merely be subject to inspection and grading but they should be brought into the Bill to enable them to take advantage of the financial provisions that are there if they want to do so.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1204" /> There is another aspect of the matter which I would like the Minister to consider. I know it is difficult but I would ask him to make a supreme effort to attract, particularly into the publicity department if he can get them, people who have years of experience in the tourist business.  I know that there are Irishmen abroad who have obtained invaluable experience in the working of the tourist trade, in the tourist and travel agencies and in regard to tourist publicity, whose services would be of immense value to us.</P>
    <P>That is not to be taken as in any way whatever casting any reflection upon the existing staffs of the Tourist Board or the Tourist Association.  Having regard to the way in which their activities were limited by a shortage of money, they have put up a very creditable performance indeed.  When Deputies are inclined to compare in regard to type and volume our publicity as against that of other countries, Deputies ought to remember that up to now, in so far as the Tourist Board was concerned, they were limited by statute to, I think, £40,000, and £40,000 in relation to an industry like this was just a drop in the bucket; so I think in fairness to the Tourist Board that ought to be said.  In fairness to the Tourist Association it ought to be said also that they were limited by the amount of money which they could extract from the various local authorities in the country and having regard to the difficulties under which they tried to carry out their work they did not do too badly at all.</P>
    <P>Having said that, let me say this, that I hope that the type of publicity that we had, the periodicals and folders, and so on, will be all scrapped and that, as we are at long last facing up in a realistic way to the value of this industry and are prepared to put something like an appropriate sum into the building up of an organisation worthy to deal with the tourist traffic, we will design and devise something more worthy of the country from the publicity point of view.</P>
    <P>May I say that I agree entirely with what was said about not spending any of our money on luxury hotels?  We get a lot of advice from people at home.  A lot of Americans were coming <Col N="1205" /> over here two, three and four years ago, telling me about the huge volume of American tourists that we should be getting and finding themselves very dissatisfied with me that I was not prepared to go ahead right away and build a 400-bedroomed hotel in the City of Dublin.  I felt that I had to ask that if we were going to build a 400-bedroomed hotel in the City of Dublin what guarantee we would have that the Americans would keep them filled for us?</P>
    <P>I also agree with Deputy ffrench-O'Carroll and one or two others who spoke about food.  I think that too many of our hotels who have not the experience, the staff, the skill or the technique to do it, try to put before their guests continental and English dishes.  I believe that the average tourist who comes here from abroad comes to see Ireland and to study the habits, manners, customs and, perhaps, the food of the Irish people.  I know that if I am fortunate enough to find myself on the Continent I do not want a Frenchman trying to put down before me a plate of bacon and cabbage, because I know he could not do it as well as it can be done at home.  Incidentally, when the Christenberry team was on tour in this country, at least one proprietor had the courage to set down before the Christenberry team of American experts a purely Irish dinner, the same as we would get in the average Irish house in this country, together with a bottle of Guinness.</P>
    <P>Mr. Christenberry and his colleagues told me it was the most enjoyable meal that they got during the whole of their tour.  They also told me it was their opinion that if most of our hotels, particularly throughout the provinces, would try to give that type of food to the average visitor to this country, they would save themselves a whole lot of worry and headaches in trying to make out French menus and would probably give more satisfaction and less indigestion to their guests.</P>

With reference to the suggestion that, pending the completion of the scheme, in view of the grave hardships caused to the farmers concerned, suitable compensation should be paid to the landowners who cannot use their lands owing to continuous flooding of the area, if the principle of giving compensation to landowners whose lands are flooded were accepted by the House, I do not know where it would lead us.

      <P>How the compensation would be calculated, how the farmers' losses would be computed, the extent of the liability which would come upon the State if it had to provide suitable compensation, are matters on which we may feel the gravest doubts.  I think it is absolutely impracticable.  Whatever case might be made for the drainage of the Shannon basin, the provision of compensation on this scale, which could not possibly be confined to a particular area, would mean enormous costs for which no Government would be prepared to assume liability.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and myself suggested that the proper way to approach the problem of alleviating the condition of landowners whose holdings are periodically flooded in the Shannon area is to try to improve their circumstances in other ways.  I pointed to the fact that the Land Commission over a period of years have been trying to migrate some of these landowners and that, although alternative accommodation was provided for them, they were allowed to retain their original holdings which, as the Parliamentary Secretary pointed out, in spite of frequent flooding, are valuable summer grazing grounds.</P>
      <P>At present a further scheme is under consideration by which it is hoped to migrate two tenants from the Esker district near Banagher who have fairly substantial holdings, and from the surrendered holdings to enlarge the smaller holdings in that flooded area. Since 1945, when this matter has been under examination, the Land Commission would have been very glad indeed to try to solve the problem by getting houses built if suitable sites were available, but in a number of these cases in the Banagher area, which had been surveyed, it was not possible to provide sites and the alternative of trying to transfer the tenants altogether was adopted, although more costly.</P>

      <P>The general problem of the rearrangement of small holdings in the West of Ireland is at present under active consideration in the Land Commission.  There was a recent conference of inspectors representing the areas from which people were being transferred and the eastern areas to which they might be expected to be transferred, we hope with the goodwill of those amongst whom they were coming to live.  The whole problem was the subject of consideration and discussion. In that connection the question of these flooded areas and what might be done to relieve or improve the situation of the tenants affected was considered.  Following a recommendation from my colleague, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, to have a survey carried out of the economic conditions in the flooded areas near Athlone, which have received a good deal of attention in this discussion and which seem to have suffered a great deal recently, the Land Commission have arranged for a survey to be made of this area.  This survey would aim at getting a general picture of the situation and the opinion of the technical officers who would be entrusted with carrying it out as to the steps that might be taken to improve matters in this particular district. Some of the matters, for example, that might be considered would be the question of the rearrangement of holdings, how best that might be effected and speeded up; what improvement might be possible in agricultural methods; what further steps might be taken to improve the housing conditions; whether or not more could be done with a view to the exploitation of bogs and the marketing of turf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1209" /> It is hoped to start this survey fairly soon.  I can assure the House that when that survey is completed, the Land Commission, in close consultation with the other Departments concerned, such as the office for which the Parliamentary Secretary is responsible, will consider any recommendations that may be made, as a matter of urgency and of great importance and if we can agree upon the constructive steps that may be taken to improve the situation, there is no lack of goodwill on our part or lack of desire to see that these steps will be carried into effect as speedily as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider that the motion with which the House is dealing is one which should be given very careful and sympathetic consideration. I welcome the statement that has been made by the Minister for Lands in this connection but surely the House has been hearing similar statements from Ministers, former Ministers as well as the present Minister, for many years past, so far as the Shannon area is concerned.  I can say that the present Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Beegan, has a very good knowledge of the conditions that prevail in the Shannon area and it is my honest opinion and sincere belief that if there is any man likely to devote his energies and determination to relieving the plight of the people in that area, it is the present Parliamentary Secretary.  All during the years he has represented Galway he certainly has taken a keen interest in the plight of his constituents in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why do I say this?  Because of the fact that for the past five or six years, a committee has been established in that area under the chairmanship of the Parish Priest of Clonmacnoise and they have been actively engaged in making representations to the Land Commission, the Office of Public Works, the Electricity Supply Board and everyone concerned.  The Parliamentary Secretary has been closely connected with the work of that committee. I hope, now that he is in charge of the Office of Public Works, that he will use the same assiduity with the <Col N="1210" /> officers of his Department as he has shown by his keen interest in the people in the Shannon valley for a number of years past.</P>
    <P>In considering the plight of these people we must realise that it is their very livelihood that is at stake.  The conditions that prevail in Shannon Bridge, the Shannon Harbour and Banagher are certainly conditions of which no Irish Government, past or present, can feel proud.  I, in supporting the inter-Party Government, certainly left no stone unturned to put forward the case of these unfortunate people at every available opportunity.  Anyone who knows the history of the Shannon valley knows quite well that flooding has been going on in this area so long as people can remember.  As year after year passes, the area is becoming more seriously affected.  Some of the older people in Shannon Harbour, Shannon Bridge and Banagher area will tell you that at one time when Mr. Reddy represented King's County in the House of Commons, whenever the Shannon floods rose to what was considered a dangerous level, the local people wired Mr. Reddy and he immediately got in touch with the Chief Secretary and, by whatever means was at the disposal of the Chief Secretary, in 24 hours the level of the Shannon was lowered.  It is most remarkable to hear these statements of old people as to what happened when Mr. Reddy was M.P. for King's County.  I remember an occasion in more recent years when the Grand Canal Company lost a number of porter barrels from a boat in Shannon Harbour.  The Gardaí were making inquiries as to where these barrels went and the Parliamentary Secretary will remember that in 24 hours the level of the Shannon was lowered to find the barrels.</P>

      <P>I am concerned only with what happened.  They <Col N="1211" /> lowered the level of the Shannon to find the porter barrels, and they found the porter barrels, but there is no question of lowering the level of the Shannon to enable the people there to save their hay or their live stock. Surely the Government must consider that the live stock of the people in the Shannon Valley are more important than the porter barrels which the Grand Canal Company lost on that occasion?  The Parliamentary Secretary is well aware of the fact that the floods there are becoming more serious every year.  In recent years a very comprehensive drainage scheme has been carried out on the Brosna, and one result of the carrying out of the Brosna scheme is that more water is flowing into the Shannon.  If another drainage scheme is carried out on the Suck, as is proposed, still more water will flow into the Shannon.</P>

      <P>Agreed.  A committee representing the local people in the area&mdash;and I am prepared to accept the information imparted to me by the local people&mdash;employed the services of an expert, an engineer of very high standing in the city.  He came down and carried out a survey in the area. He reported that, as a result of the drainage of the Brosna, the floods were much more serious than before the Brosna drainage was carried out.  He also reported that in his opinion, if the Suck were drained, it would have a very serious effect on conditions in the area.  The Parliamentary Secretary was present at a meeting on the 22nd February, 1951, when this engineer reported.  After carrying out a survey <Col N="1212" /> in the area the engineer made a number of suggestions in order to relieve the plight of the people there. I believe those suggestions were practicable. The suggestions were (1) the removal of certain obstructions in the main channel between Athlone and Meelick; (2) a reduction of the navigational level by deepening the channel where necessary; and (3) the removal of the weir at Meelick.  These suggestions were considered and were put forward to the Board of Works.  The meeting was held in Leinster House very shortly afterwards, and I think Deputy Beegan was present at the same meeting. The chief engineer of the Office of Public Works was present and the engineer representing the Shannon Drainage Committee was present.  The chief engineer of the Office of Public Works said that it was nonsense, codology and trash, and that it could not be done, while the engineer representing the Shannon Drainage Committee said that it was a common sense and practical scheme which could be done.  What is the use of the Minister for Lands quoting opinions of engineers.  They will report in order to suit themselves.  I cannot envisage Office of Public Works engineers reporting against the policy of the Government nor against the policy of the Parliamentary Secretary or the Minister in charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the removal of the weir at Meelick would give quite a considerable amount of relief.  I have never been able to discover the objection to the removal of the weir there.  Like the engineer whom the Shannon Drainage Committee employed, I cannot understand why the removal of the obstructions in the main channel cannot be undertaken.  As the Parliamentary Secretary is aware, the lands in that area are useless for practically eight months of the year.  It is well known that in the same area most of the live stock die from fluke.  Fluke is a disease which is caused by waterlogged lands.  The homes of the people in that area are often completely flooded and the people have to take to the high road.  On many occasions live stock are lost in that area.  At the same time, the lands in the barony of Ballycastle in the Shannon Valley <Col N="1213" /> district in my constituency are as highly valued as the rich fertile lands of Meath.  The people in the Shannon Valley district are obliged to pay their rents, rates and taxes and yet we are told that a measure of relief cannot be provided for these people.  There is nothing to prevent any Government from bringing in legislation to this House&mdash;when the local authority have not the power to do it&mdash;to give the people in the area in question their lands free of rates.  There is nothing to prevent the Minister for Lands from bringing into this House a Bill to bring about a measure of relief for these people by leaving them their land free of rent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely, when, as a result of flooding, the lands of these people are rendered useless, these people should not be obliged to pay the heavy rates which they are paying at present&mdash;and I fail to see why they should have to pay anything to the Land Commission.</P>
      <P>We are told that a comprehensive drainage scheme cannot be carried out on the Shannon.  As we all know, the Shannon is the principal river in this country.  I fail to understand why the Shannon was not tackled many years ago.  As well as the people on the banks of the Shannon being seriously affected, we must consider the fact that the townspeople of Banagher and of Shannon Bridge have been very seriously affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Very little relief or sympathy has been extended to those people.  At their meeting in January, the Offaly County Committee of Agriculture, being aware of the seriousness of the situation in that area, passed a resolution asking the Government to include the Shannon valley area of Offaly, from Banagher to Bloomhill, in the development schemes proposed to be operated for the benefit of the western area.  The request of the Offaly County Committee of Agriculture to the Government was by no means unreasonable. We are told that, under the Act, the Minister has power to include any areas in which he sees, <Col N="1214" /> knows or has evidence that distress prevails.  There can be no district in the Gaeltacht or in any part of Ireland in which there is more evidence of distress, destruction or disaster than in the area from Bloomhill to Banagher.</P>

      <P>I hope the Government will consider some scheme to alleviate the hardships suffered by the people in the area in question.  I do not care what type of scheme it may be so long as some action is taken to relieve the plight of the farmers there.  The Minister for Lands has told us that the Board of Works and the Land Commission have been in conference with each other on this issue.  The Minister for Lands knows, as well as every Deputy in this House, that the slowest institution in this world to-day&mdash;and the world is a big place&mdash;is the Land Commission. He told us that they were undertaking a survey of the Shannon, that they were going to examine the situation and were going to arrange for the enlargement of holdings in the area by the removal of holders of certain lands to lands elsewhere.  I understand that the survey has started.  The Minister made no estimate and gave us no information as to when the survey would be completed or in whose lifetime it would be completed.  It is only right that the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary, if they put their heads together on this issue, should call together the officers of the Land Commission who are going to work on that survey and say to them: &ldquo;We are giving you a job now in the <Col N="1215" /> Shannon area.  We will give you two years to complete that survey, to submit proposals to us.&rdquo;  If a time limit is not put on this work I am afraid that we shall have no result of the survey in our lifetime.  The people in the Shannon valley district have, for a number of years past, been endeavouring to bring together the Department of Agriculture, the Office of Public Works, the Land Commission, the Electricity Supply Board and other parties concerned in order to hammer out a solution to this problem.  My request cannot be styled as unreasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the statement made in this House last week by the Parliamentary Secretary that the Land Commission had been asked to make this economic survey in conjunction with the engineers of the Office of Public Works.  I ask him, as a business proposition, to put a time limit on the work so that the people in the Shannon area may know when they may expect a measure of relief.  I hope the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary realise that this motion was not tabled for any political purpose, and that it has no political significance whatsoever.  The Parliamentary Secretary is quite well aware of the keen and active interest which I have taken in this problem since I first entered this House.  I considered that a discussion on the matter would be helpful both to the Government and to the Opposition.  I considered that as a result of the discussion that would take place in this House the people that are affected would benefit.  I hope and trust that the problem, which I consider of the gravest importance, will be remedied.  I am prepared to welcome any suggestion which the Government may put forward and I am prepared to support and cooperate with the Government, both the Minister for Lands and the Parliamentary Secretary, in any measure of relief they may have in mind for the unfortunate people in this area.  We all know that these surveys cannot be carried out in a hurry, but I appeal to the Minister and to the Parliamentary Secretary to put a time limit on the investigations <Col N="1216" /> in this case, so that the people in this area may see some ray of hope of getting out of the serious plight in which they have been for so many years past.  The position is very bad, and I hope that something will be done to relieve it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFinan" hpid="Mr. Finan Mr. Finan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess to no little disappointment at the statement of the Parliamentary Secretary with regard to this matter.  I had hoped that some proposition might be forthcoming which would bring good news to the Shannonsiders, but when he tells the House that he sees very little hope in our lifetime of the drainage of the Shannon being carried out, I am afraid they will be sorely disappointed.  As far as I can recollect, he gave no reasons why that should be so except to point out that the drainage of the Shannon would cost something in the nature of £12,000,000.</P>
      <P>It would appear, therefore, that the only reason for postponing the drainage of the Shannon is the cost.  I do not think that is a sufficient reason. £12,000,000 is a lot of money but I want to remind the Parliamentary Secretary that, when his Government was in office five or six years ago, they contemplated spending that and much more on the erection of a new Parliament House.  I put it to him: Was it just or was it common sense to propose spending £12,000,000 or £13,000,000 on a new House for the Dáil and to begrudge spending a similar sum to bring some measure of relief to people who have been suffering over a long period, and, indeed, to preserve and put into use the results of the labours of these people along the Shannon side?  Which was the more sensible proposition?  I leave the people who are the victims of this flooding to judge what sympathy there can be in the minds of a Government which looked with indifference upon the sufferings of these people and still were prepared, if that measure were tabled here, to spend an amount that would give them relief on the provision of palatial buildings and comfort for themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad, however, to know that the Parliamentary Secretary has made some recommendations to the Department of Lands in the matter.  I hope <Col N="1217" /> his efforts will be more successful than mine with that Department.  Not so long ago I made representations to the Department of Lands in connection with victims of the Shannon flooding in the parish of Moore.  It was a very small matter that I requested of them. Some 28 years ago the Land Commission provided a boat for the tenants in that parish to reach their allotments on Devinish Island.  That was their only means of access to the allotments which the Land Commission gave them on Devinish Island.  After 28 years one would expect that it was not asking too much of the Land Commission to provide a new boat.</P>

That is the consideration which I submit to him.  The mere expenditure of £70 or £80 on a boat to enable these people to reach their land on that island would not be made. That is callous indifference to the people to whom you will go down to-morrow and ask, now that the country is in an emergency, to produce the maximum amount of food.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that the Government should take immediate steps to introduce proposals for legislation which will ensure that the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1950, will be amended so as to provide that the housing subsidy will be increased to a figure not less than £350, and that the ceiling value will be increased from £2,000 to a figure of not less than £2,500 in view of the greatly increased building costs and especially to facilitate persons who are desirous to avail of loans under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts.</P>
      <P>This is a motion in the names of Deputy Rooney and myself asking the Minister to introduce proposals to increase the grant on private houses which comply with the regulations governing the subsidy.  We are also asking the Minister to raise the ceiling which at present prevents local authorities from lending money under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts. It is felt by the building trade and also by the public who are anxious to become owners of their own homes that the time has come when the Government should introduce proposals to raise the ceiling which governs the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts. We are asking him to increase the present grant given on houses built by private enterprise in the Dublin district.</P>

      <P>As I was saying before the Minister came in, this motion, which is in the name of Deputy Rooney and myself, asks the Minister to introduce proposals to increase the grant on private houses which comply with the regulations governing the subsidy.  We are asking him also to increase the ceiling which prevents local authorities from lending money under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act.</P>
      <P>It is definitely felt in the building trade at the moment, and by the public in general who are anxious to acquire their own homes, that the time is ripe now when the Government should consider an increase in the grant given on houses built for private ownership. Several local authorities throughout the country give a grant of not more than £275 in addition to the grant which is given by the Department of Local Government.  This makes a total subsidy of not more than £550.  I suggest to the Minister that the present grant, in view of the sharp rise in the cost of building materials and wages in the building industry, should be increased from £275 to £350.  I am asking him to give this his careful consideration&mdash;that an increase in the grant is warranted in view of the cost of building over the last two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be argued that a grant of £350 on private dwellings might be too big, but I suggest that if facilities, such as this, were provided for people to enable them to acquire their own homes, the enormous lists of applicants for corporation houses in the City of Dublin would be greatly decreased.  At the present time, in the City of Dublin, there are 30,000 applicants for corporation houses.  I suggest to the Minister that that list of applicants could be decreased by approximately 50 per cent. if a larger grant were given for the building of houses.  For example, in the Philipsburgh Avenue area, where the Dublin Corporation built over 200 houses to be rented to tenants at an economic rent and with a small deposit of £50, approximately 3,000 applicants applied for these <Col N="1220" /> houses.  These houses would create no drain whatever on the local authorities. If Dublin City and County paid an additional grant, as some local authorities do, I suggest that would be too great a drain on the local rates in view of the amount of building carried on in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Of more importance, however, is the immediate necessity for increasing the ceiling of £2,000 in relation to small dwellings loans.  At present, local authorities cannot give a loan on a house which is valued at more than £2,000.  I would suggest that it is well-nigh impossible, with present charges, even for local authorities to build houses with an over-all cost of over £2,000.  In the City of Dublin, at the moment, there are approximately 500 carpenters idle.  They are idle because it is impossible for people to purchase their own houses.  There are certain cases in this city where there is a great deal of uneasiness caused to intending purchasers by the fact that they cannot apply for a small dwellings loan on their houses in view of the fact that the houses they have purchased are, at the present time, valued at nearly £300 more than a similar house was valued 12 months ago.  I would suggest to the Minister that an increase in the ceiling of at least £500 should be made without any delay.</P>
    <P>It is a well-known fact that social reformers throughout the world are stressing the need for larger houses for the working people in the different countries.  It is essential that sufficient accommodation be provided for the segregation of the sexes making up a family.  I will conclude now with the hope that the Minister will give these points his serious consideration.  I make the request to him to consider the matter carefully.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>In sponsoring this motion with Deputy Belton, I should like to express the hope that it will be accepted by the Minister.  We realise the need for encouraging amongst our people a desire to provide their own homes.  We realise that it is desirable, in present circumstances, to encourage them by making available to them the maximum amount of finance and the best facilities we can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1221" /> I do not propose to go over the ground already covered by Deputy Belton.  People interested in the building of their own homes know very well the problems which confront them, and know also the methods which could be adopted to ease the position for them. We suggest that if the Minister accepts this motion by increasing the grant from £275 to £350 in respect of a serviced house, and also if he agrees that the ceiling valuation shall be not less than £2,500 in respect of a house which will qualify for a small dwellings loan, that will be a progressive step towards the achievement of what it is desired to procure in this motion.</P>
    <P>This particular class of house is required by those who are described as white-collar workers, the people who by reason of their circumstances are unable to qualify for the tenancy of a local authority house and who, at the same time, again by reason of their circumstances, can to a certain extent finance the establishment of their own homes by the deposit of a small amount of money.  We know that in relation to building costs and having regard to the fact that only 90 per cent. of the actual valuation can be given, it requires a fairly substantial deposit on the part of these people before they can arrange to have houses built for them. If the ceiling is raised to a figure of not less than £2,500 the difficulty in relation to the rise in building costs will be offset and these people will then be in a position to qualify for the building of houses under the Small Dwellings Acts.</P>
    <P>There are very few houses now that can be built for less than £2,000.  If houses cost more than that figure, excluding the amount of grant, they will not qualify for a loan from the local authority, whether it be the corporation or the county council.  People, therefore, who would consider establishing their own homes must forget about them.  If the ceiling is raised a new impetus will be given to the building trade because these people will once more consider the question of establishing their own homes despite the high building costs, and it would be better to encourage the building of these houses now rather than wait until <Col N="1222" /> a later date when costs might rise even higher than they are at present.</P>
    <P>It is desirable that we should encourage this housing programme in order to ensure that all our people will be accommodated in decent homes at the earliest possible date.  I believe that many people who are now obliged to apply for local authority houses would and could avail of these grants and these loans if the terms of this motion are accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ColmGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this motion has a great deal to recommend it.  Any effort to encourage people to purchase their own homes should be supported. In relation to this suggested £350 grant and the raising of the ceiling to £2,500, it is possible to build quite a good house to-day for £2,500.  There is one point that neither Deputy Rooney nor Deputy Belton referred to and that is that, if we raise the ceiling to £2,500, it means that those who are proposing to buy their houses will have to apply for a much larger loan and their repayments will, therefore, be higher.  We have to ask ourselves whether people can afford to buy houses for £2,500.  On that figure the repayments would be in the region of £2 10s. per week plus rates.  Where will we find the white-collar worker who can meet that?</P>
      <P>The Dublin Corporation is at the moment building houses in or around the £2,000 mark.  As Deputy Belton has told you, we have such houses in Philipsburgh Avenue.  I understand they are costing in or around £1,800 to £1,900.  They are good houses, built of the best materials available and by first-class tradesmen.  The repayments are in the region of 35/- a week.  The people want repayments they can meet and that is what we should aim at.  We should aim at producing houses on which the ordinary people can meet the repayment in relation to rates, taxes, rent, insurance and everything else. They cannot afford to meet £2 10/- or £3 per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason why the Dublin Corporation has 3,000 applicants for 204 houses is because their repayments are low. Some time ago I heard Deputy Dillon make a very good point&mdash;one in which I thoroughly agreed with him.  It is the exception rather than the rule to <Col N="1223" /> find anyone on the Fianna Fail Benches agreeing with Deputy Dillon, but he did say he would like to give the reputable person the full loan if possible; at the same time he emphasised the point, provided he could meet his repayments.  If my memory serves me correctly, he also said that the repayments should be as low as possible.  I think he mentioned a term of 35 or 40 years for repayment&mdash;anything to keep it within the man's pocket.  That is what we should aim at.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to Deputy Belton and Deputy Rooney that they should leave this to the Minister when he brings in his new housing Bill.  I think £275 is a bit small at the present time and there are grounds for raising it to £350.  The Department of Local Government, both under the Coalition Government and the last Fianna Fáil Government, has made every effort to help the housing drive.  I have said time and again that we should not play Party politics when we are dealing with housing.</P>
    <P>It is a big job and it should have the co-operation of everyone, Deputies, trade unionists, builders and workers. Every encouragement should be given to the housing drive.  I want to emphasise that what the people want is something they can meet.  I have had some experience in this matter during my ordinary day's work, and I appeal to the Minister to meet the points that have been made when he introduces his new Bill.</P>
    <P>If there is another big housing drive I feel that some builders at any rate will try to get their cut out of it.  They will not be satisfied with a small margin of profit.  I think the builders should clip their wings and add a little more to the drive.  The workers should do likewise.  Complaints have been made that the workers are not putting their backs into the job. Deputy Belton stated there are 500 carpenters idle.  If they go back to work now and put their shoulders to the wheel, and put more into their work and if the builders do with a little less profit, that will encourage the drive a good deal and help to bring down the overall cost of houses.  I think we need a little more effort on <Col N="1224" /> the part of the worker and the tradesman, and more co-operation from the builder.  There are many honest builders but there are always some black sheep who try to get rich quick. I know a few of them myself.  We should not encourage those.  We should wipe them out if possible.</P>

If there is a slump in building now, I think there is a chance for the tradesmen to put a bit more into it.  The same applies to the builders who should allow their profits to come down a bit more.  I think the Minister should increase this grant somewhat and try, if possible to meet Deputy Hickey's point by getting money cheaper, but where he will get it I do not know.</P>

      <P>I was dealing with a particular case to-day, that of a four-roomed house costing £1,975.  The man who is buying the house will get only a loan of about 80 or 90 per cent.  That happens in certain areas.  In this particular case, the individual will have to find £200 or £300.  I should like the Minister, in his new Housing Bill, to get the valuers to increase the value of the houses.  This would help the workers a good deal.  From my experience in dealing with applicants for housing loans both from the county council and building societies, the biggest difficulty experienced by applicants is to find the amount of money between the amount they will get to build a house and the amount they will have to procure themselves.  I find that is the biggest millstone round the necks of the people who are trying to procure houses.  If the Minister could overcome that difficulty in any way I should like him to do it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another aspect of this matter to which I should like to refer.  I do not want to use this House nor have I ever done so in order to say anything about anybody outside it, but I have my suspicions about houses advertised by builders.  The house costs so much, minus the free grant.  I am wondering whether in certain cases, as has been stated by <Col N="1226" /> my colleague, Deputy Colm Gallagher, greater advantage is not taken of this than heretofore.  That is a hard thing to say about these men but, nevertheless, this grant is always shown up. The grant for a serviced house is £275 and for a utility house it is £280.  You can judge the house from whatever standard you like, but the fact remains that the costs have gone up a good deal.</P>
      <P>I feel that the position generally has definitely got worse instead of getting better.  What I wish to bring to the Minister's notice is the hardship experienced by a house purchaser in trying to find the amount to put down on a house.  I should like if building society and county council loans could be stepped up in that respect. I know that some years ago Deputy Belton had a lot of trouble in this respect and I am sure that Deputy Rooney has the same experience with people who come to him from time to time.</P>
      <P>While I agree with the motion, I cannot see that it is going to solve the big problem to which I have referred. The further sum of £75 will not bridge the gap.  It is only making the matter more tempting but it will not bridge the gap at all.  The sum of £75 is far from solving the problem.  The man purchasing the house will have to find more than £75.  He will probably have to find a few hundred pounds.  That is a problem which we all have to face in this House.</P>

      <P>Surely, the Deputies who have moved this motion are entitled to hear something from the Government Bench as to what the attitude of the Minister and the Government is upon the motion?  The fact that Deputies Colm Gallagher and Burke spoke from the Government Benches in favour of the motion does not mean that the Government is accepting it.  This is a problem which is not easy to solve.  Deputy Hickey, in his interjection, struck one of the very important points and that is the question of the rate of interest on money lent for housing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>The big problem in the building of houses is the question of the amount of repayments either to the local authority or to the building society.  Remember that there is a yardstick for measuring what a rent should be.  Any person's rent should be one day's wages in the week. One-seventh of his total income is the yardstick that measures what the rent of any house should be.  If you are paying more than a day's wages, then you are in trouble from the start. When you have to pay a rent of £2 or £2 10s. 0d. a week on repayment of a loan, then the rent is too high. No person can maintain a family and pay that rent.</P>
      <P>Somebody may ask you who set that figure?  But the maintenance of a family has ever been measured by certain standards and a day's wages&mdash; the week's wages divided over seven days&mdash;is supposed to represent certain aspects of the family's life, housing, clothing, food, protection for savings and so on.  Indeed, you should not only be able to pay a day's wages in rent, but you should be able to save for what is known in the country as &ldquo;the rainy day&rdquo;, when it comes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, a day's income, whatever is the normal income; that is a figure.  I have intervened in this debate to stress the importance of good housing for the people not only in the cities, where, I regret to say, most of this building is done, but in the country as well.  I do stress the necessity of dealing with the rural areas in a more extensive way than has been done up to the present.  When the Land Commission, a public utility society or a local authority is building a house in the country it should have <Col N="1228" /> the same amenities as a house in the city.  It should not be the same as a house built a hundred years ago.  We complain about the people running away from the land, but why should they not go when they are left with little better than the tents of the days when we were all migrants and itinerants?  Like Deputies Rooney and Belton, I would finish by asking the Minister to let the House know his intentions in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to deal with money matters about which Deputies Rooney and Belton were so anxious to ask the Minister.  Is there anything wrong in suggesting to the Minister or to Deputy Belton that a house costing £2,000 should have a normal existence of 70 years?  If so, the rent would be 28/11 per week.  I am also quite conscious of the fact that a house has to be kept in repair and insured, and I would allow £13 per year to keep that house in decent repair.  That is another 5/- per week, bringing the rent to 33/11.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why should anybody be compelled to pay for a house in 30 years when the normal life of a house is 70 years?  I am not saying that this Deputy or that Deputy has a knowledge of finance, but we must first tell the people who claim to know about finance where they stand as far as the housing of our people is concerned.  We are building houses in Cork and the interest and charges for a five-roomed house are £78 per year. I would ask Deputy Gallagher to work that out in rent and then say whether I am talking sense or nonsense or whether I have a knowledge of high finance.  For our four-roomed houses the loan charges are £69, and that is about 25/- a week in rent.  If the Minister were to bring in a Housing Bill dealing once and for all with the financial aspects of housing instead of suiting the money-lenders by paying back loans in 35 years he would be doing a good day's work.  I want to tell Deputy Gallagher that the money lenders receive more than the workers who build the house, the merchants who supply the materials, the owner of the land which is purchased and professional fees all added together.  I <Col N="1229" /> could work that out in figures but the Chairman would not allow me to do it.</P>

Recommendations have been sent up by various county councils and Mayo County Council suggested certain supplementary grants.  Would the Minister tell the House in his reply whether he is prepared to sanction these grants or not because there are many people in the country particularly in my native county who are anxious to know what he has in mind.  I think it is time he made an authoritative statement.  I very much regret that I am not allowed to elaborate on the question of soliciitors' charges with particular reference to county council solicitors who are also State solicitors.</P>

      <P>There is no doubt that one could get many useful suggestions from Deputies on all sides of the House as to the way to tackle this problem.  If effect were given to them all, instead of being difficult the problem would be a very simple one.  If we could for example start off, as <Col N="1230" /> Deputy MacEoin suggested, by saying that the rent of the house should be so much and that nobody should be asked to pay more, if we could increase the grants to whatever point we liked; if we could, as Deputy Hickey suggested, borrow money with the greatest ease and make the repayment period as long as you like&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;if we could adopt all these useful suggestions very simply thrown out by those who contributed to this debate, then what has been admitted to be a difficult problem with present-day costs would be a very simple matter indeed.  But somehow Ministers for Local Government do not find it just as easy as that.  They have not found it as simple as that in the past and I not only suspect but I know that they will not find it so easy in the future.  All I want to say now is that the matters referred to here, the question of the provision of grants and the raising of the ceiling, are matters that are appropriate to the discussion on a Bill which will be before the House, I hope, in a short time. While not anxious to express my view on the two questions raised here, I want to assure the House that I will have no hesitation in doing so when that Bill is before the House.  The House will then be free to examine it, to criticise it, to suggest amendments to it and speak in their favour, and we can then have the decision of the House upon them.</P>

      <P>The Minister has said he is not accepting the motion, but that does not debar me from saying something about it, nor does it <Col N="1231" /> debar any other Deputy who desires to speak.  The fact that the Minister does not accept the motion does not close the debate.  The Minister has told us, and it is very useful to know because of the serious problem confronting all local authorities in connection with housing, that a new Housing Bill is being prepared, and will be before the House in a very short time, and that the two matters raised in this motion can be dealt with then, when the Minister will be in a position to indicate his views on the increased grant and the raising of the ceiling in respect of the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts.  I suggest to Deputy Belton and Deputy Rooney that if a Bill covering these matters which will give an opportunity for discussion of these points is to come before the House in a short time, there is no necessity, this evening or this day week when we come to conclude this discussion, to divide the House. If the Minister did not intend to bring in a Housing Bill in a very short time, the matter would be on an entirely different basis.  Everyone agrees that there is a very big problem by reason of the increase in the cost of building materials, and Deputy MacEoin in referring to one-seventh of a week's income as being apportionable to rent has a not unsound idea.  I think that one-seventh is probably too high, that a better proportion might be one-eighth, one-ninth or one-tenth.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that. I always had the idea that the rent of a house should be approximately one-tenth of the income.  Under the differential renting system in Dublin, we have it at one-sixth, but there are certain deductions and certain offsetting allowances, and a special committee, which has been considering the matter, are of the opinion that the one-sixth is not too high.  Looking at what the cost of repayment under the Small Dwellings Acts, as they are at the moment, is in respect of an advance of, say, £2,000 on the basis of either of the figures&mdash;8/4 or 8/8 per £100, because one figure applies to the <Col N="1232" /> city and the other to the county, and, I am sure, to the country outside&mdash;it means that the rent, exclusive of rates and ground rent, is something approximating £2 per week.  In order to pay that, a family must have an income of £14 or £16 per week, or even more. That presents other problems.  How many families at present have incomes of £14, £15 or £16 per week?  If they have incomes of that amount, is the Small Dwellings Act the proper machinery for financing housing?</P>
      <P>The Small Dwellings Act in Dublin City has a splendid record of success. The number of defaulters in a period of 20 years has been almost negligible. That is the record in Dublin, and, if that is the general experience all over the country, then undoubtedly the purchase of houses by means of advances under the Small Dwellings Act is to be commended.  The rates of interest about which Deputy Hickey has spoken are smaller under the Small Dwellings Acts than on advances from building societies.  I think that that is accepted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>To-day I put down a question to the Minister, No. 42, asking him if he would publish the rules under which the Referee defines active service under the Military Service Pensions Acts, 1924, 1934 and 1949, and if he was aware that applicants find it difficult to present their case.  In his reply he stated he <Col N="1233" /> was not aware that they experienced any difficulty in presenting their cases owing to the absence of published rules defining active service.  Then he went on to say that the interpretation of the term active service was one solely for (a) the Board of Assessors under the 1924 Act and (b) the Referee under the 1934 Act.</P>
      <P>I admit that as the Act stands that is so, that the assessors under the 1924 Act are the people who interpret the words &ldquo;render active service&rdquo; and what constitutes it; and that the Referee under the 1934 Act himself defines or interprets the meaning of the words &ldquo;rendering active service.&rdquo; While that is so, knowing the Board of Assessors and the many Referees in the many years since 1934, I know that they have a set of rules which they apply when assessing the service of an applicant before them.  I put it that the applicant is under a grave and serious disadvantage when he does not know what he has to prove.  Let me give this example.</P>
      <P>In the Act of 1934 it is laid down that that Act applies to a person who at any time was a member of the Executive of the Volunteers or a member of the Headquarters Staff of Oglaigh na hEireann, or who was on the Intelligence Branch of any of the forces, and so on.  That is a definition in itself. Yet applicants who came within that definition, when they applied, were rejected by the Referee on the grounds that they had not active service.  One of these applicants went to court and the High Court held that that person, as he was a member of the Executive of the Volunteers, was dispensed from the responsibility of proving service and was automatically entitled to a service certificate, and he got it. Therefore, the Referee had to change the rules which he then had.  He submitted certain rules at that hearing but he had to alter them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Later, another applicant, who rendered service in 1916, applied.  He was mobilised, he marched out and he did not, as he admitted, fire any shot, but he was out a certain length of time. The Referee declared in that case that he was not a person to whom the Act <Col N="1234" /> applied.  He took an action to the High Court and it was tried by three judges, and they found that, because he was mobilised and because he obeyed the orders he received and was out during the week, he had rendered service as laid down, in their opinion, in the Act.  Then the Referee granted him the certificate.  When that happened the Referee had to change his rules again.</P>
    <P>Regarding the Board of Assessors under the 1924 Act, I admit that they decided that, for the purpose of defining &ldquo;active service&rdquo;, you had to have so many&mdash;at least two&mdash;major engagements; but then they found that that did not work properly, and they put in what was known as the time lag &mdash;&ldquo;how much time did you spend or did you give any service?&rdquo;  The whole question that arose was what constituted service and what this House meant when it was laying down those words, &ldquo;rendering active service&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Now, the phrase, &ldquo;rendering active service&rdquo;, has, in my submission, a specialised meaning.  Membership of the organisation, it was held, was not sufficient to qualify; but I feel, and I have always held, that it did&mdash;because membership of the organisation here was membership of an Army which was then in face of the enemy, and once you were opposed to the enemy, as such, you were then on active service. Some of the Referees held, and the High Court held, that the applicant should not have to be in the front line of battle or that the applicant who was in the front line of battle was on active service, but that the man who was out of the smoke and bustle of battle, but was holding the rear, was on service; but they went further and said he must have general service.  Then the question arose as to what constituted &ldquo;general service&rdquo;, and again the Referee has a set of rules which lays it down as to what constitutes general service.  Let me be clear on that.</P>
    <P>The Minister to-day asked me did I charge any Referee with being dishonest. Under no circumstances do I do any such thing.  I do assert this, that the Referee or the Board of Assessors, if they so desire, could at <Col N="1235" /> the moment ask an applicant certain questions which, by his answering &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;, can disqualify him for a certificate and, equally, they can ask him a series of questions that, by his answering &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;, would qualify him.  If the applicant had the set of rules which govern the interpretation of &ldquo;active service&rdquo;, he would know what constituted the service and what evidence he should tender to prove that.</P>
    <P>As a matter of fact, I know applicants who went in.  Certain questions were put to them.  It was then put like a police report, in the form of a statement; and the applicant came out and said: &ldquo;Oh, the man who examined me was the decentest fellow in the world; all I had to do was say &lsquo;yes&rsquo; or &lsquo;no.&rsquo;&rdquo;  But the applicant got the surprise of his life a couple of days afterwards when he got a notice that the Referee proposed to report within 21 days that he was a person to whom the Act did not apply.  Then he was wondering what happened.  Again, some of the witnesses did not know what they had to prove and if those rules were available there would be no such difficulty.</P>
    <P>In the courts there are court rules for practically every action that might be taken before a judge.  The solicitor and counsel know the set of rules under which they can operate.  They know what questions can be asked by their opponents or by the judge and what constitutes the rules of evidence; but in this&mdash;which is a very important court and which has the equivalent in power of the High Court&mdash;there are no published rules.  If they were published, this difficulty would be avoided of one man having a certain type of service and another having the same and the two applicants going in but, because of the way the evidence is tendered, one succeeds and the other fails.  That creates difficulty for everybody concerned.</P>
    <P>The rendering of active service has many definitions.  Unfortunately, we had not one here of our own, and it was, more or less, taken from either British, American or French army <Col N="1236" /> services.  Generally speaking, a British soldier serving at home in England was not regarded as on active service; yet, if he were sent out to Gibraltar or anywhere else overseas, he would then be declared to be on active service although he may not have fired a shot.</P>
    <P>In England during the Napoleonic war and during the 1914-18 war, when there was a likelihood of invasion, the soldier at home was deemed to be on active service.  However, it was held later that a soldier serving in the armed forces did not necessarily have to be on anything but training to be on active service, and death while on training was held to be active service. The judges so held in Britain and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that it is not his responsibility to make the rules, and to-day I thought he was rather ungenerous when he said I was Minister for a certain length of time and did very little about it.  Since the Act was established in 1924, I have been arguing this in season and out of season, and I will continue to argue until justice is done.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, in Government and out of Government.  When I was Minister for Defence one of the first things I did was to ask the then Referee to publish the set of rules.  I asked him had he the rules and he said: &ldquo;Of course I have.&rdquo;  There are the rules that are defined already in the Act, that is, those referring to people who are members of the Executive of the Volunteers.  That is defined in the Act and adjudicated by the courts.  Those people who are on the Headquarters Staff of Óglaigh na hÉireann are automatically dispensed from the obligation of proving that they fired a shot.  All they have to do is to prove they were members; similarly with the Intelligence Branch.  This was laid down by statute.  All they have to do is to prove membership of that branch and they automatically qualify.  But then, the first Referee ruled that you had to have at least two engagements; the assessors also ruled <Col N="1237" /> that you must have two engagements. Then they came down to the amount of time.  That continued under the 1924 Act plus general service.</P>
      <P>Under the 1934 Act you had to have in some brigade areas at least two major engagements; in other brigade areas you had to have only one and then general service.  It was argued that there was no method of getting over that.  Another Referee decided that he would bring in a new rule in which he would establish that people who rendered what he considered &ldquo;keyman&rdquo; service would be regarded as on active service.  The question then arose what constituted a keyman? In one case the Referee decided that a certain type of service constituted keyman service, and in another case that it did not, although the service was practically the same.</P>
      <P>That was all right until they started to examine applications from members of Cumann na mBan and Fianna Éireann.  Could you expect a member of Cumann na mBan to go out into the front line and take part in an attack, say, on a barracks?  Could you expect any member of that organisation to take part in an ambush and fire shots? No, and yet there was no definition of active service; the Referee decided that certain types of work, such as carrying despatches, retaining of arms and ammunition, the maintenance of dumps and so on, constituted active service, and I think that was right.</P>
      <P>As everybody is equal before the law why not apply that to the Volunteer who rendered the same service, and remember that when he was rendering that service he was rendering it in face of the enemy.  Therefore, he was carrying out duties which were assigned to him by his commanding officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I asked the Referee to publish these rules.  He said he would rather not publish them at that time, that he was only a short time in and would like to see how they would operate before he would publish the rules.  He asked me to raise the matter with him again. Unfortunately the people decided that a new Minister would come in and the month passed by too rapidly for me. <Col N="1238" /> Even though you say I did nothing during that time, at least I had started the work by which the whole of the cases in which injustice was done were re-opened.  I feel very strongly that as the Headquarters Staff, the members of the Executive and the members of the Intelligence Branch have their service defined by statute, at least the people who did the fighting, the people who went through the hardship, the ordinary rank and file, should have their service defined so that they would know what their rights were.  If a member of the Executive of the Volunteers did not know his rights under the Act and did not go to the High Court he would be without a certificate of service and that would be an injustice because the rules decided that he should get it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to-day, and I am not appealing to him as an ex-Minister or as a Deputy except in so far as I have a Deputy's rights, but as an old comrade in arms, to see that justice is done to our comrades wherever they are.  The only way that can be done is by asking the Referee to publish these rules as to what constitutes his interpretation of active service. Then everybody is protected; the applicant is protected and the State itself is protected because nobody can get through who does not meet that definition.  In this way everybody is bound to be satisfied that justice is done and this House will then have secured what, in my opinion, they intended to secure, fair play for <Col N="1239" /> the people who served this country in the hour of need.</P>

      <P>Whatever terms of reference existed in respect of the guidance of referees in regard to active service appear to have satisfied both the Board of Assessors under the 1924 Act and the four or five referees who were elected under the 1934 Act. Deputy MacEoin mentioned that he approached the Referee, that he asked him if he had any rules governing the term &ldquo;active service,&rdquo; and that the Referee said that he had.  The first Referee was the late Judge O'Connor and he defined, I suppose to satisfy himself, what he would regard as active service.  He operated that.  I do not know whether he ever had reason to alter it or whether any of those referees who succeeded him and who adopted his definition had any reason to alter it either.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It seems to me that all these referees were satisfied that the rules regarding active service were satisfactory, both from the point of view of the applicants who had to make their case and from the point of view of the board which had to deal with the case.  In my term of office, which ran into a period of something like eight years, I never, in any circumstances, approached a Referee on any particular subject; more especially did I never approach him on a question as to definition of anything in regard to his duties in deciding cases.  I would regard it as wrong for me to do it, just as wrong as I would regard it for anyone to approach a judge judging a case in the civil court.  If the Referee is to be trusted at all, surely he can be trusted to do justice to the applicants for pensions just as he would be expected to do justice to the applicants who came before him to apply for pensions.</P>

      <P>I have only been allowed ten minutes to reply, and if I am going to be engaging in cross-talk with Deputy MacEoin, I will not be able to make the case I wish to make. Deputy MacEoin started off by telling us that certain cases were decided by the Referee and that they were taken then to the High Court.  He spoke, I thought, rather dogmatically on these cases.  If the Deputy had been quoting from newspaper reports or from documents, I might have been more impressed.  I am only relying on my memory, and I suppose that is what the Deputy was doing also.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>This is what happened in the case of the person the Deputy described as being a member of the Executive of Óglaigh na hÉireann.  My recollection of that case is that the question in dispute was not whether that individual had active service or not, but whether, in fact, the Army Executive existed at the particular critical date which was in question.  The Referee apparently decided that the Army Executive was not in being on that occasion, and he, therefore, decided that the person in question was not entitled to serve as a member of the Army Executive.  The decision of the High Court, as far as I remember&mdash;I am quoting from memory&mdash;was that the Army Executive was not, in fact, disbanded, and might be regarded as being still in existence, and on that technical point the particular individual won his case.</P>
      <P>What Deputy MacEoin says about the individual in Galway whom the Referee turned down on the question of active service is not, in my opinion, correct.  My recollection of the Galway case is that the individual was examined by officials and not by the Referee and that when the case was brought to the High Court the judge held that, because the individual was not examined by the Referee personally, he was not heard&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If they are not correct it will not make any difference as I am only endeavouring to put what I believe to be the case to the House as against the case which the Deputy has made.  According to Section 2 of the Military Service Pensions Act, 1934:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  A person shall for the purpose of this Act be deemed to have been serving in the Forces while such person was rendering active service in any of the bodies which constitute the Forces and, in the case of a person who served as a member of the Irish Volunteer Executive or of the Headquarters Staff of Oglaigh na hÉireann (Irish Republican Army) or in the Intelligence Branch of any of the bodies which constitute the Forces, while such person was so serving.</P>
      <P>(2)  The following circumstances shall not be deemed to constitute a breach in the continuity of service in the Forces for the purposes of this Act, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  absence from duty following arrest, imprisonment, internment or deportation under the Defence of the Realm Act, 1914, the Restoration of Order in Ireland Act, 1920, or any regulations made thereunder;</P>
      <P>(b)  absence from duty following arrest, imprisonment or penal servitude in respect of sedition, treason or treason felony prior to the 11th day of July, 1921;</P>
      <P>(c)  absence from duty by reason of duties necessitating such absence undertaken at the instance of or on behalf of the Cabinet of the First Dáil Éireann or of the Second Dáil Éireann;</P>
      <P>(d)  absence from duty while under arrest, as a result of activities as a member of the Forces.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mere membership of the Army Executive, according to that, would not entitle the individual to service unless he was continuing on duty.  That is, <Col N="1242" /> I feel, the grounds upon which that decision was based.</P>

      <P>Naturally, I probably know more on this subject than most Deputies because of the fact that I was so long associated with the Department of Defence and that I was involved in pensions legislation.  The fact of the matter is, and this has been argued long enough, that if there had been a definition of &ldquo;active service&rdquo;, a very large number of persons would be ruled out by reason of the fact that the Referee would be guided by the narrow definition given him; because he had not to work within that narrow definition it was possible for the Referee to give, in a large number of cases, the key service to which the Deputy himself refers.  That was service which did not necessarily entail going into action or using weapons.  They got it on mere membership and because of the fact that they served in a given capacity and were, from that point of view, of considerable value to the Forces.</P>
