      <P>I tried last night as coldly and as calmly as the circumstances and the Opposition permitted to prove to the House that the warnings we had issued to the people in regard to the alarming trend which was developing in our external trade and balance of payments had been justified by the event.  I should not like the House, however, to conclude that this trend was something which had occasioned uneasiness on the part of the Government for the first time in the year 1951.  I had in fact touched on that aspect of the matter and for the information of those Deputies who were not here on 2nd May, 1951, I recalled what the then Minister for Finance had to say in regard to the position as he had noted it for the year 1950 and the beginning of 1951.  Perhaps I might again refresh Deputies' memories with the then Minister's, Deputy McGilligan's, statement. He said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The present position of external account is by no means satisfactory and if it continues to develop unfavourably the application of corrective measures will be called for.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I have to apologise to the House for the fact that I was not able a minute ago to give the exact column from which I was quoting.  I wish to be candid with the House.  I do not wish to mislead the House in any way.  Therefore, I referred to the fact that the statement appeared in the last Budget statement presented to this House by my immediate predecessor, Deputy McGilligan.  I said that the quotation read:&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The quotation is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The present position on external account is by no means satisfactory, and if it continues to develop unfavourably the application of corrective measures will be called for.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That statement was made by the then Minister for Finance&mdash;the Fine Gael Minister for Finance&mdash;on 2nd May, 1951.  It was clearly a warning, a very grave warning, that if the position continued to develop unfavourably, corrective measures would be called for. The position did continue to develop unfavourably&mdash;so unfavourably that at the end of the year the deficit on our balance of payments was more than twice as much as it had been at the end of 1950.  1950&mdash;the year which Deputy McGilligan had reviewed and had viewed with such grave apprehension. 1950&mdash;the year which manifested a trend that he regarded as by no means satisfactory, a trend of such a grave nature that he warned the House if it were to continue, then corrective measures would be called for.  That was the position with which we were faced when we took office in 1951.  This trend was continuing&mdash;not <Col N="2087" /> merely continuing but continuing at a greatly accelerated rate.  Our job was to apply those corrective measures which Deputy McGilligan had clearly forseen when he was speaking in Dáil Éireann on 2nd May, 1951, a few days before what might be described as the panic election of that year was declared.  Later in his speech&mdash;I shall quote now from column 1884&mdash;he pointed out the main cause for this grave trend, for this unsatisfactory position which would call for corrective measures, when he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;. . . there still continues to be a substantial use of past savings merely to lever up standards of consumption. Making all allowance for the exceptional conditions now obtaining it is to be feared that we are not producing and earning enough to pay our way.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What, in fact, did that mean except that we were living beyond our income?  When a nation lives beyond its income it is exposing itself to precisely the same risks as a man does who lives beyond his income.  Any man who does that will, one day or another, inevitably be called upon to pay the penalty.  It is just the same with a nation.  If a man lives beyond his income and has to pay the ultimate penalty of bankruptcy then, of course, he surrenders&mdash;and everybody knows it&mdash;a very large part of his individual independence.  He becomes the servant of somebody else where, perhaps, previously he had been a master.  He becomes a slave.  His future is mortgaged. He is no longer in a position to act according to his own desires and to his own wishes.  He has, as I have said, mortgaged his future.  That is precisely the position in which a nation that lives beyond its income will find itself.  It must bind itself ultimately to its creditors.  That is the fate for which this country was heading when this Government took office in 1951 and that is the fate from which we have been concerned to save it no matter what the risk to the popularity of our Party or to our personal prestige.</P>
    <P>This grave question of the deficit on our balance of payments is not a new one.  It was not raised by the present <Col N="2088" /> Government for the first time in the year 1951 nor was it raised by Deputy McGilligan for the first time in the year 1950.  I am going to quote now from Volume 112 and in order that Deputy Mulcahy may not have an excuse for again intervening to interrupt me I shall give him the exact column in that Volume from which I propose to quote. I shall quote from columns 2145 and 2146 and I shall quote from the speech which the then Taoiseach made on the trade agreement with Great Britain. This is what Deputy J.A. Costello had to say, as Taoiseach, in regard to our balance of payments problem in the year 1948:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The third big change which has taken place in the intervening years from 1938 to 1948 has reference to our adverse trade balance.  When the 1938 agreement was being negotiated the adverse trade balance between this country and Great Britain was such as not to cause any anxiety or certainly very little anxiety.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Perhaps I might digress for a moment to point out the compliment which the then Taoiseach paid unwittingly to the Fianna Fáil administration which had been in office here from 1932 to 1938, when he said that when the 1938 agreement was being negotiated&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Do not remind us of the period 1932 to 1938.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the adverse trade balance between this country and Great Britain was such as not to cause any anxiety or certainly very little anxiety.  Now, if my memory serves me correctly, the anxiety which was then expressed, that is, in 1938, on the part of the Fine Gael Opposition in regard to this matter of the balance of payments which is, of course, linked very closely with the use of our external reserves, was that we were repatriating our external assets too rapidly and that, consequently, we had not a sufficiently large surplus on our balance of trade to please the then Fine Gael Opposition. However, let me continue with Deputy Costello's statement which he made as Taoiseach on the 5th August, 1948:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2089" />&ldquo;In the intervening period, the adverse trade balance has gone to an extent which must cause anybody who thinks about it for one moment, or who looks at the figures, the utmost alarm for our economic and financial stability.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Perhaps I might, at this stage, say a word about the factors which had produced this increase in the deficit on our balance of payments.  The increase was due mainly to one fact, that over the period from 1939 to 1945, by reason of the world war, the normal economic development of the country had been brought almost to a standstill.  It was impossible for us, no matter what our reserves were, no matter what our desire may have been to induce our people to bring back the assets which they held abroad and invest them in this country, to get either the plant or the materials to enable us to carry out the programme of economic industrial development which we had mapped out for the years from 1932 to 1948 and which we had carried out during part of that period despite the opposition of the then Cumann na nGaedheal Party.  The consequence of this position was, as everybody knows, that we built up a very much larger mass of external investments than we normally should have.  When the war ended, however, and particularly during 1945, 1946, 1947 and up to the beginning of 1948, the then Government re-embarked on the policy of industrial development which was the policy that had demarcated it from the Opposition Party in this House, the policy that had demarcated it from us to keep our young men and young women at home, making the things which could be made here in Ireland and employing persons who otherwise would be idle in growing things which could be grown on the land of this country.  That was the sharp dividing line which separated us from the then Opposition.</P>
    <P>Therefore, after 1945, as soon as the opportunity presented itself to us, we began to restock our factories and our workshops with the materials which had been denied to them during the emergency period.  We began to build <Col N="2090" /> up stocks that had been depleted during the war years.  We began to bring in the plant, the equipment and the machinery which were essential if our industries were to be put on an economic and efficient basis.  Because of that, as Deputy Costello pointed out when he was Taoiseach in August, 1948, our adverse trade balance had increased considerably.  We never had an adverse trade balance prior to 1938-39.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>You always had an adverse trade balance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Sorry.  The Deputy will permit me to correct the slip which I have just made.  We never had a deficit on our balance of payments prior to 1938-39.  We were always able to pay our way in this world by means of our visible exports and our invisible exports.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>We launched a housing programme and carried it through and reconstructed over 100,000 houses in this country in six years.  We did that without trenching on our external reserves by one penny piece.  Not only that, but we lifted the burden which had been imposed on the community by the secret agreement of 1923.  We got back the ports and we re-equipped and built up the Defence Forces of this country.  Once again let me say we did that without having to encroach on our external reserves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Then came the time, as I have said, when after six years of stagnation imposed on us by the war, after six years when we had to try to keep the people of the country alive, <Col N="2091" /> when war was raging around our shores and we had to preserve the people of this country from the terrors and the vicissitudes of war, there came a time when we had to restock.  As I have already said and I wish to emphasise that did involve a considerable increase in the deficit on our balance of payments.  It was to that deficit that Deputy Costello was referring when he spoke on the 5th August, 1948.</P>
      <P>Let me continue to quote from it:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In the intervening period the adverse trade balance has gone to an extent which must cause anybody who thinks about it for one moment, or who looks at the figures, the utmost alarm for our economic and financial stability.  The balance of payments between this country and Great Britain has, in recent years, become completely disordered.  When we took office some months ago and became aware of the actual position in regard to the adverse trade balance and the nature and the alarming extent of that adverse trade balance it was one of the problems that gave us the greatest possible cause for dismay.  We felt that it was essential, if this country was to retain its economic stability, that steps must urgently be taken to redress that adverse balance of trade and to try and restore order into our disordered balance of payments.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Mark the words, and mark the circumstances. Let me remind the House of them again.  There was, admittedly, over the periods 1946, 1947 and 1948 what might be described as an extraordinary increase in our importations. It was due to the causes which I have already mentioned, but let us see what Deputy Costello had to say regarding the repercussions and reactions of that considerable increase upon our financial and economic stability.  He said that:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;...it was one of the problems that gave us the greatest possible cause for dismay.  We felt that it was essential, if this country was to retain its economic stability, that steps must urgently be taken to redress that adverse balance of <Col N="2092" /> trade and to try and restore order into our disordered balance of payments.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There we have Deputy Costello telling the country that steps must urgently be taken to try and restore order in our disordered balance of payments if this country was to retain its economic stability.  Now, if those words were true when they were uttered by Deputy Costello, they were equally true to-day.  They were particularly true in the year 1951, because in that year the actually realised deficit on our balance of payments was more than double the deficit on our balance of payments in the year 1947-1948. Therefore, it would be an understatement, it would be a considerable understatement, to say that, at least, the urgency was twice as great as it was in the year 1948, and that the danger was at least twice as grave as it was in the year 1948.</P>
    <P>When I say that that would be a considerable understatement, the fact of the matter is that this deficit upon our balance of payments was one of the most pressing problems which this Government had to face up to, one of the most urgent problems and one of the problems that brooked no hesitation and that brooked no timidity in dealing with it.  It called for resolution and courage, and I think that the people of this country have great cause to be thankful for the fact that this country was led during the year 1951 by a man who stands unparalleled for the resolution and courage with which he has faced up to all the difficult problems during the lifetime in which he has led this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I will soon have disposed of this question of the balance of payments if I am allowed to continue. I was saying that in the year 1948 the then existing deficit on our balance of payments was sufficient to cause the greatest possible dismay to the then Taoiseach and to the Government of which he was the head, if that expression pleases the Opposition. I concede that I have always doubted whether there can be in a Coalition an effective Taoiseach and effective leadership, but that probably is beside the point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Very much so.  That is for the people to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>What we are really concerned with is the fact that, in the year 1948, this question of the deficit on our balance of payments was causing, as I have said and must repeat again, the greatest possible dismay to the Government of the day.  It caused them dismay but they took no steps to deal with that problem, so that three years later, in 1951, the then Minister for Finance, Deputy McGilligan, had to come into this House and say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The present position on external account is by no means satisfactory and if it continues to develop unfavourably the application of corrective measures will be called for.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>But these corrective measures ought to have been taken much earlier. They ought to have been taken in the year 1948 when, according to the then Taoiseach, the deficit on the balance of payments was causing the Government of the day the utmost dismay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, that ends one sorry chapter.  This problem was foreseen in 1948 and nothing was done about it through the year 1949-50.  Therefore, <Col N="2095" /> in 1951, the Coalition's Minister for Finance had again to come to this House and express the concern of the Government of which he was a member at the fact that the deficit on our balance of payments still continued.</P>
    <P>The situation was bad in 1948.  We had had an adverse trade balance of £30,000,000 in 1947, I think, and it was bad in 1950 when we had an adverse trade balance of £30,000,000.  What was the position with which we were faced in June of 1951?  The White Paper which has been attacked disclosed the position to the people so far as we were able to forecast it.  We estimated on the basis of the figures and facts then available to us that at the end of the year 1951 the deficit would have risen from £30,000,000 to £70,000,000.  That was, thank God, an overestimate because in actual fact the realised deficit was of the order of £62,000,000&mdash;£61,600,000 to be exact. In less than 12 months the rate at which that deficit was accruing had doubled.  That was the reason, when Deputy Dillon was talking about wood and timber, playing the babe in the wood and trying to shatter the timber, in the debate upon his motion condemning the White Paper as tendentious nonsense, I said that the position had been largely created by, that the problem had been certainly aggravated by, the panic importations which had taken place for which our predecessors had been responsible.</P>
    <P>Since we have had to face criticism because of the fact that the Government has had to take measures to deal with this very acute problem, perhaps I will be allowed to show how the problem was, in fact, aggravated for us by the policy which had been pursued by our predecessors.  In order to do that I must begin with a quotation from the then Taoiseach, Deputy Costello, in July, 1950.  I am quoting from Volume 122, column 2008. Speaking in the debate on the Estimate for his own Department, the then Taoiseach, Deputy Costello, said this:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Peace and order have since the change of Government reigned over the land and we earnestly hope that they will continue to do so.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2096" /> That is a prayer in which we can all join.  I wish, however, there were more substance in the statement that peace and order had in 1948 &ldquo;since the change of Government resigned over the land.&rdquo;  You can have apparent peace and order if you are prepared to wink at law-breaking and disorder.  The then Taoiseach went on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Abroad the war clouds are lowering over the world.  Nevertheless the Government has decided that it must base its plans on the hypothesis of peace.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I should explain that I think there is a misprint in the text I am reading because the phrase &ldquo;it must base its plans on the hypothesis of peace&rdquo; is printed as &ldquo;it must face its plans on the hypothesis of peace.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Otherwise, we would be stultifying our efforts and putting a brake on the economic progress that the country so much desires, and which the Government is confident of achieving.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mark that this statement of Government policy was made by the head of the Government on 14th July, 1950, and it expressed the policy which the Government had been pursuing during the whole of the period that it had been in office.  It was basing its plans on the hypothesis of peace, notwithstanding the fact that the then Taoiseach himself was constrained to admit that abroad the war clouds were lowering over the world.  Therefore, we have here in this phrase of Deputy Costello's the justification and the explanation for the policy which our predecessors pursued.</P>
    <P>Every one of us knows that during that period they were concerned to liquidate the reserve stocks of essential materials which had been so carefully built up by the Fianna Fáil Government. They were squandering the capital resources of this State.  They were contracting crushing foreign debts at such a rate indeed that they had doubled the net burden of the national debt in three years.  They were discouraging the tillage policy of the previous Government; they had sold out the transatlantic aircraft; they had shut down the chassis factory and <Col N="2097" /> stifled the development of a heavy engineering industry, all projects which the Fianna Fáil Government had adopted and were pushing forward because they knew that peace had not yet been firmly established in the world and that there was a grave danger that we might find ourselves once again in the midst of a world war.</P>
    <P>These projects and these undertakings which we had embarked upon as a result of the sorry and dreadful experience which we had undergone during the six years that the world war had lasted were, every one of them, stifled and liquidated by our predecessors, because, notwithstanding the fact that the international situation was as threatening as the then Taoiseach himself admitted, they were planning on the hypothesis of peace. That was their policy.  That was the hypothesis on which they based their policy in 1948.  That was the hypothesis on which they had persisted in that policy, notwithstanding the fact that international tension was mounting, so that even in July 1950 the then Taoiseach was still maundering in these terms.  They were basing their planning on the hypothesis of peace when war had already broken out in Korea, basing their planning on the hypothesis of peace even when the Communist hordes were besieging Pusan.</P>
    <P>When it looked as if this hypothesis of peace was no longer a tenable one, however, when the cold reality of the situation struck them and drove them out of that spirit of complacency which has created such grievous problems for this nation, then they were no longer planning on the hypothesis of peace, they were subjected to a mental hurricane, and in this brainstorm they were thrown from one extreme to another, the fatuous complacency engendered by the hypothesis of peace was swept away in an equally unreasonable panic, and when prices were soaring on the world market these men who had depleted the national reserve, these men who had denuded this country of essential materials, went into the markets of the world, started to buy, and enjoined upon everybody to go in and buy, even <Col N="2098" /> when prices were soaring.  The consequence was that we had to replace at inflated prices the reserves which should have been carefully husbanded but which were frittered away during the three years of the Coalition.</P>
    <P>That was the primary reason why we were faced with this doubled deficit on our balance of payments in 1951. Remember, as I pointed out yesterday, that, in so far as any increase was manifested in the physical volume of stocks, it amounted to about £12,000,000 worth and that the rest of the increase represented panic buying at inflated prices in order to make good the mistakes, in order to redress the situation, which had been created by this misguided policy of basing the Government's plans on the hypothesis of peace.  We are still very far from peace.  Indeed, we may be even nearer war than when General MacArthur drove the Chinese to the Yalu River or when Berlin was isolated.</P>

This Government is composed of men who remember that in the year 1938 when we got back the ports, when we freed the people from the irksome and dangerous obligations which the Treaty of 1922 imposed upon them we were told that it was quite unnecessary to put these ports in a state of defence and were attacked because we asked the Irish people to spend £600,000 on the defence of those ports.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It cannot turn its back on the world as it stands to-day and think that by turning its back and by burying metaphorically speaking, its head in the sand, like an ostrich, it will escape the consequences of war if war breaks out and the consequences, <Col N="2101" /> as we know, may be grave and terrible indeed.  I referred to 1938 merely in order to show how this Government acted, in order to justify the stand which this Government was taking, in order to justify the measures which this Government is taking in order to ensure that if war should break out in this year, next year or in 1954, this country will be in a better position to face the circumstances and conditions which will then obtain, than it was during the period from 1939 to 1945. That is all I want to say.  I am saying it again.  We are not planning on the hypothesis of peace but on the basis that our danger is great and that our position is precarious.  But we are not acting in a panic.  We are not activated by the unreasoning panic which moved our predecessors to rush into the world markets in the latter half of 1950 and the beginning of 1951 in order to try to repair the damage which they had done to the economy of this nation over the preceding three years.  We are coolly grappling with the situation to the extent of our resources and we are making such preparations as we can to face the worst if it should come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is our position.  It differs radically from the foolish complacency which determined all the actions of our predecessors.  It differs radically in this fact, that we are not prepared to squander the resources of this country in order that we may buy a few votes to keep ourselves in power. We do not sit here because we desire office or because we like office.  We sit here as men who have always recognised their national duty, as men who have been prepared&mdash;perhaps I should not say it&mdash;to give to this country the leadership which it requires.  Whether the people accept or reject that leadership, whether they think our actions are wise or foolish, we shall act and we shall advise the people in all good faith and to the best of our judgment as to what we believe to be the interests of the common people, of the whole people of this country and as to what we believe will ultimately secure for our people that measure of peace and happiness, that peace which our <Col N="2102" /> comrades died in order that they might enjoy.</P>
    <P>I think, Sir, I have disposed of the attack which has been made upon me because of the measures which the Government has felt compelled to take to redress that deficit in our balance of payments, which, according to Deputy Costello, was already causing the greatest possible dismay to him and his Government in the year 1948.</P>
    <P>May I now come to another aspect of Government policy for which I am supposed to bear a particular responsibility? I should like, however, to say here that in so far as anything has been done by me or by any of my colleagues in the Government, it has been done for and on behalf of the Government as a whole.  We accept fully and give full effect to the principle of collective responsibility.  Every member of this Government shares responsibility for everything that every other member may do.  It may be that we accept a particular responsibility, by remaining in office, in respect of the things the Government does.  I accept a particular personal responsibility for the Budget.  If the Government had not been prepared to support me in the Budget I would have been unworthy to remain Minister for Finance holding the views which I do, but, as I say, we, all of us, act together.  We are a united team.  We have not, for instance, the spectacle of the Minister for External Affairs going out and preaching one particular line of financial policy and the Minister for Finance upholding another.  We all stand together accepting collective responsibility for the policy of the Government as a whole.  This Government has one policy, and that is to preserve the political and economic independence of our people and, to the extent to which our resources will permit it, to prepare the people to face the future, whatever it may be, with such assurance as Divine Providence will afford to us.</P>

      <P>I should like to come now to this particularly vexed question of credit policy.  I understand, and I think you will recall, Sir, that when <Col N="2103" /> we were discussing the motion which stands in the name of Deputy MacBride dealing with the question of the Central Bank, it was suggested that the debate might be continued on this token Estimate.  I do not know whether it is worth while going into the merits of Deputy MacBride's motion. Quite obviously it has been put down on the Order Paper by a Deputy who is ill-versed in the matter of which it proposes to treat.  It looks very learned. Quite obviously it has been drawn up by a lawyer but, I think, by a lawyer who has been badly briefed.  It has already been in large part disposed of by Deputy Vivion de Valera.  It contains a number of statements which, to borrow a phrase of Deputy Dillon's, could only be described as &ldquo;tendentious nonsense.&rdquo;  It has all this jargon about &ldquo;in so far as,&rdquo; and so on, and so on, but what does it all come down to in the end but an attempt to intimidate the governor and directors of the Central Bank from putting before the people their views on the situation in which we find ourselves?  It is an attempt to muzzle the governor and directors of the Central Bank because they have drawn certain conclusions which seem to reflect unfavourably upon the policy which was pursued by our predecessors.</P>
      <P>If the governor and directors came out and slapped Deputy MacBride, Deputy Dillon and the Coalition Government on the back, and said: &ldquo;You are fine fellows.  You are doing very well; you are spending the nation's money at an unparalleled rate; you are in fact, according to your own Minister for Finance, using your reserves in order to lever up the present standard of living; you are creating a highly unfavourable position in regard to our balance of payments, a position which your successors will have to face but, notwithstanding all this, you are fine fellows; you are to be commended; the people need not be alarmed,&rdquo; then we should not have had any of these intimidatory motions on the part of Deputy Dillon or Deputy MacBride.  On the contrary, I suppose they would hold a special beanfeast in order to express their gratitude to the governor and directors of the Central Bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2104" /> Because these independent men, men who have been placed in a position of independence by the deliberate act of this House, have the temerity to express the conclusions at which they have arrived as to the ultimate effects of the policy which was being pursued by the Coalition Government during its term of office, they are being hounded, they are being held up to public odium and contempt by Deputies like Deputy MacBride whose every utterance betrays a fundamental ignorance of the most simple aspects of this matter.  They are being told that they are pro-British.  Some of them served in the I.R.A.  Some of them stood beside James Connolly. Some of them helped to found the Labour movement.

      <P>As I have said, the purpose of these attacks, the purpose of these motions, has been to divert public attention from the report of the Central Bank and to concentrate it upon the personality of the governor and directors.  The intent has been to divert public attention from the fact that the bank's reports have pointed out what would be the ultimate consequences if this country were to continue to pursue the policy which our predecessors had embarked on when they were in power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No member of the Coalition Government can claim that he recognises more keenly than we do, or feels more deeply than we do, that we must develop the industrial arm of this country, that we must develop our natural resources to the fullest extent.  We blazed that trail.  We were the pioneers and we had to do that when we were told that our new industries, our infant industries, if you like to describe them in that way, were backroom industries and were being carried on in kitchens <Col N="2106" /> and cellars.  That was the sort of misrepresentation which we had to face in the early stages.  So far as we are concerned we wish, and it is our earnest purpose, to develop the industrial arm of this country but we wish to do it, as all sound good businessmen would do it when they are dealing with their own concerns, prudently and providently.  We do not want window dressing.  We do not want flamboyant displays.  We want ultimate results in sound economic and profitable industries, industries which will be founded on a competitive basis, which will be able to sell their goods on merit alone and which, because of that, will give secure employment to our own people.</P>
    <P>Therefore, Sir, so far as our credit policy is concerned and so far as we have any dealings with the ordinary commercial banks of this country, we will deal with them on the basis that we regard it as their first duty to foster and develop Irish industries and Irish resources.</P>

We have got to shape, alter, and, if necessary, replace, by new installations and by new organisations, the concerns, the institutions and the undertakings which we took over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me try and put to Deputy MacBride what I regard as the fundamental <Col N="2107" /> factor which has determined very largely the steps which successive Governments have taken to deal with this banking and currency problem since 1927, since the earlier Banking Commission of 1924 or 1925.

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the <i>Irish Statistical Survey</i> 1950-51 and I would direct the particular attention of Deputies who may be interested to Table B.2 on page 60.  There they will see an analysis of our balance of international payments with different monetary areas in the year 1951.  If they look at that they will see that the vast bulk of our trade was carried on with the sterling area with, in fact, one customer.  That has been our experience, our fate, our fortune or our misfortune for a great number of years.</P>
      <P>Those of us who were in office during the period 1932 to 1938 will remember the attempts which we made to try and secure alternative markets for the produce of our farms.  We were not able to do that during that period, and I regret to say that we have not been able to do very much to improve it since, although it is true that in the present year developments have taken place which, if they continue, will put us in a very much freer and unprejudiced position to deal with those contradictions which seem to agitate the mind of Deputy MacBride.</P>
      <P>If you look at the table you will see that our total current receipts from the sterling area amounted to £134,000,000 and our total current expenditure with the sterling area amounted to £133,000,000.  The corresponding figures for the total of all countries was £157,000,000 and £219,000,000, respectively.  What does that show?  It shows that the bulk of our trade is carried on with one customer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have incidental transactions with other countries in other parts of the world but our payments are made mainly through that one customer or through the facilities and organisations which he happens to possess and which we do not and which hitherto we have not had any need to possess <Col N="2109" /> because of the fact that our trade, export and import, has been largely confined to one channel.  That is the fundamental fact in our whole economic set-up.  It determines virtually the price which we will receive for our produce when we export it and the price at which we will be able to buy produce when we import it.  It is the fundamental factor in our whole economic and financial set-up.</P>
    <P>What is the natural corollary to that?  It is a simple one.  If virtually your whole trade is with one customer then you and he should agree upon a common unit of account&mdash;a common unit of account on the basis of which your obligations to him will be computed and his to you will be computed as well.</P>

It is a factor which determines very largely, not wholly, the policy which not only the Central Bank but the ordinary commercial banks of this country must pursue. The fact that our trade is largely with one country and that for the purpose of facilitating that trade, for the convenience in short of ourselves and of that customer, we must have one common unit of account so that he will freely accept our money in settlement of our obligations to him and that we shall freely accept his in settlement of his obligations to us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally, I was hoping to hear a case being made for this motion. So far, only Deputy Keane has spoken and he has spoken only for about 15 minutes.  He was giving something in the nature of an historical review of the Volunteer movement and dealt only very briefly with the motion, towards the conclusion of his speech.  I did not hear anything that would provide me with any matter for replying.  However, in the course of his remarks he suggested&mdash;I have not seen his speech and I do not want to misquote him&mdash;that no Government had done justice to the Old I.R.A. Deputy MacEoin knows, of course, that that is not correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1924 an Act was passed to deal with sections of the Old I.R.A. and there were in addition, at a later date, disability pensions Acts brought in that dealt to some extent with Old I.R.A. men who became disabled.  I am not quite certain whether they dealt with disease and wounds or only with wounds or only with disease.  Anyhow, an effort was made to do justice to the men who had <Col N="2111" /> fought in the War of Independence. Since that the Military Service Pensions Act of 1934 provided pensions for persons who, not having served in the National Army or the Defence Forces, were not eligible under the 1924 Act.  Something like 12,500 persons secured pensions under that Act.  A very much larger number took advantage of the Act.</P>
    <P>Under the Acts of 1924 and 1934 all receipts from public moneys were abated, but with the passage of the Military Service Pensions Act of 1945 only sums over £250 a year caused any abatement, so that was another attempt to bring relief to those Old I.R.A. men.  Almost 3,000 pensioners under the Acts of both 1924 and 1934 benefited by this alteration.  Then, by a series of amending regulations, the latest date of application for service certificates was extended so as to enable anybody to apply where he could give a reasonable excuse for not having done so.  A further extension up to the 8th June, 1953, will also be effected shortly.</P>
    <P>In addition, by the Act of 1949 provision was made for petitioning against previous refusals to award a certificate, and 13,800 have availed of this privilege.  There were also more than 3,000 new applicants&mdash;that is, persons who did not apply under any of the previous Acts who came in under that particular Act.</P>
    <P>Then there was the Army Pensions Act of 1932 which provided for wound and disease pensions in respect of Pre- and Post-Truce I.R.A. service and also for allowances and gratuities to widows and children of persons covered by the Act.  Earlier Acts covered only Pre-Truce service and service in the National Army or the Defence Forces. Under the 1932 Act, 80 per cent. disablement was necessary for a disease pension.  The 1937 Act made it possible to get a modified pension in respect of disablement of not less than 50 per cent.  In addition, it provided pensions in respect of wounds or disease aggravated by military service, as distinct from the earlier position under which they had to be attributable to military service.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2112" /> There was also the Army Pensions (Increase) Act 1949, which provided increases in disability pensions and allowances.  There has been the system of special allowances.  That was first introduced in 1937 under the Army Pensions Act brought in in that year, when what were described as &ldquo;special dependents' allowances&rdquo; were provided for dependents of deceased persons covered by the 1932 Act.  The dependents were either mother, father (over 60 or invalided), permanently invalided brother or permanently invalided unmarried sister, and the appropriate annual sum was £40.  By the Act of 1943 provision was made for special allowances for persons with 1916 service who possessed a service certificate or a disability pension.  A recipient has to be permanently incapacitated and the appropriate annual sum is fixed at £78 for a single person or a widowed person, and £97 10s. 0d. for a married person, with £10 8s. 0d. for each child under 18 years of age.  The Act of 1946 enabled special allowances to be paid to persons with service in respect of the period commencing 23rd April, 1921, and ending 11th July, 1921, and duly awarded a medal in respect of such service.</P>
    <P>The Act of 1949 made holders of 1916 medals and holders of service certificates in respect of any period between Easter Week 1916 and the 11th July 1921 eligible for special allowances.  It also extended the date for application for medals from 1st January, 1947, to 30th January, 1950.  The following number of special allowances has already been sanctioned: Under the 1943 Act&mdash;the Act dealing specifically with 1916 men&mdash;106; and all others, 2,895, a total of 3,001 persons who have benefited under the Special Allowances Act.</P>
    <P>In addition, we provided for a special type of employment in the various barracks throughout the country for Old I.R.A. men who were in receipt of pensions of less than £50 a year and almost 200 persons were given employment in these cases.  That provided a reasonably good means of livelihood for these people, in addition to the £50 or whatever the pension was. When Deputies, in the course of their remarks on the question of dealing <Col N="2113" /> fairly with the Old I.R.A., refer to nothing being done, they should remember that these at least are some of the things that have been done, some of the efforts made to alleviate distress amongst these men, so far as possible. One of the finest measures introduced here, so far as my experience goes, is that which provides for special allowances for those persons who are incapable of earning their own livelihood or who have exceeded the age of 70 years.  That is governed by a means test and in many cases the persons applying, by reason of the fact that they have certain means which are evaluated by the same officer as deals with old age pensions, may not receive the full amount, but they are entitled to an amount which will be the equivalent of the special allowance; that is, the amount of their means, plus the amount granted under the special allowance scheme will at least come to £78 in the case of a single man and £97 10s., in the case of a married man, with £10 8s. for each child under 18 years.</P>
    <P>The various Governments have done what they thought was possible, always having consideration for the public purse which must at all times be given consideration.  In the course of the past month or two, I have replied on two occasions to Dáil questions and I have intimated that I hope, as I still hope, to introduce a Bill before the session closes which will deal with certain claims that have been made recently.  The House will naturally understand that it would be wrong for me to discuss any of these decisions, until such time as I can introduce this Bill and make it available for examination and discussion by every Deputy when the proper time comes. My difficulty in speaking now is that which I referred to in my opening remarks.  I have heard only Deputy Keane's case, which I must say was a very fair case, and the type of case that one would expect from a man who has given service to the country as Deputy Keane gave.  I had been hoping to hear other cases before replying but, as Deputy MacEoin asked me to make these few remarks, I have obliged him by doing so and all I can say is that I will naturally take note <Col N="2114" /> of what may be said in the discussion which follows.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for the courteous manner in which he has accepted the invitation I extended to him to address himself to this problem.  It is true that Deputy Keane had not concluded when the debate was adjourned, but my invitation to the Minister was given in the hope that, notwithstanding his difficulty, he might give an indication as to what the Bill he proposes to introduce might contain.  If he were able to give the House an indication of what his proposals were, the debate on this motion could perhaps be terminated and there would be no necessity to make any further case.  The Minister says that he feels that at the moment he cannot give any indication of what his proposals will be.  This motion and any other motion which any of us might put down would be designed to try to get some foreshadowing of the nature of the legislation and, therefore, we have to make our case in face of just as great a difficulty as that which the Minister has referred to.</P>
      <P>We are making a case for what has already been put to the Minister by the various organisations.  I know well that the Minister has received this document from the Old I.R.A., as I have received it, and the Minister, being a member of that body himself, knows thoroughly what the position is. Let me say that the Minister's recitation of the efforts made by the various Governments on behalf of the Old I.R.A. was a factual one, but what does that mean?  At no time, could I, or did I, accept the view that any of the Governments gave justice to the Old I.R.A.  They never did.  The first Government defended the paucity of their efforts on the grounds that, owing to financial stringency, it was the best they could do.  It was argued, and properly argued, that that was not much.  When one considers the time at which that Bill was brought in and the mistaken hostility there was to it, the Government of the day was hedged round with all sorts of restrictions despite their anxiety to meet the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to comment now on the <Col N="2115" /> attitude of any section in this House at the time, but I do say that the introduction of the abatement clause was an outrage.  That was forced on the Government of the day on the grounds that if one was re-employed by the State one should not at the same time draw a pension from the State. That was argued by people who pretended they knew what the usage and practice was in the case of the British Government in relation to matters of this kind.  It is obvious now that they did not know what they were talking about though they pretended to know.</P>
    <P>The result was the abatement clause was included and once one was re-employed, even though it might only be as a clerk or a pioneer, one could not get a pension.  That was altered subsequently in the 1934 Act.  When the 1934 Act was passed, however, there was not a proper appreciation of the situation and the Government at the time had nearly as much pretence as the Government that brought in the 1924 Act.  That situation tended to prevent the Government from doing justice.</P>
    <P>I do not want to speak on this matter as a former Minister but I believe that in 1923, in 1924 and in 1934 the dark hand of finance was stretching out all the time over the Minister for Defence in his effort to do the right thing for the Old I.R.A. We have now reached a stage at which we can look at these things dispassionately. The Minister has the support of every section and I hope he will take a confident, fair and just stand for the Old I.R.A. and do the right thing for them.</P>
    <P>This motion is not an easy one to handle.  I think I would have worded it somewhat differently.  I asked the Minister whether or not he accepted the principle in the motion.  He did not answer the question.  I think he could say he accepted the view expressed even though that would not be sufficient.  While I do not wish to amend the motion I think an increase at the same rate as that given to other State pensioners would be very inadequate in a great number of cases. What is the point in increasing a pension of £6 10s. a year by 20 per cent.?  What is the point of increasing <Col N="2116" /> it by 50 per cent.?  It is true that people like the Minister and myself who have a pension of £100 or £200 a year would get a substantial increase if the pension was raised by 50 per cent, but the man with the small pension would still have a small pension, and a very small pension.</P>
    <P>The approach to this matter is from the wrong direction.  The whole system of pensions should be examined in the light of the present-day value of money.  That applies not only to military service pensions but to disability pensions, special allowances and dependents' allowances.  I have always thought that the widows of those who died either from wounds or as a result of disease from service in our Defence Forces have been badly treated.  The Minister should keep these in mind in his proposed legislation and he should be fair to them.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that special allowances are of great benefit.  They certainly keep those who served the country well out of the workhouse.  But that is all they do.  The £70 or £80 a year which these people get is very small.  If they have any other means these means are taken into computation in calculating the rate of allowance.  I raised a case here where a man was living in a labourer's cottage.  Before he joined the Volunteers and the Army he had a good position in life.  After leaving the Army his position deteriorated.  He lost the very fine appointment he had before he entered the Army.  His son is apprenticed to a plasterer.  There are no means in the house but the plasterer's apprentice was assessed by the pensions officer at the princely figure of £240 a year.  Deputy Burke would not believe me when I cited that example on a previous occasion.  He asked me to get him the particulars.  I did.  In that case the father is assessed with the earnings of an apprentice.  That is utter nonsense.  No apprentice ever received such a sum.  No apprentice could really be described as an earner until he would have served at least three years.</P>
    <P>In another case an old volunteer went to live with his brother.  He is not able to work and is admitted to be 100 per <Col N="2117" /> cent. disabled.  Because he is living with his brother and told the pensions officer that his brother fed him well and gave him a good bed the officer assessed that bed and food at £200 per annum.  That is the value of the support his brother is giving him in the officer's estimation.  What will happen is that the brother will throw him out and then this permanently disabled old volunteer will get his £80 per annum.</P>
    <P>The principle is quite wrong.  There is no justification for that.  In another case a man's wife has an income of a couple of hundred a year.  She gives her husband none of it.  However, because she has it&mdash;even though he does not know precisely how much she has&mdash;he is refused.  That sort of assessment, while it may be accurate in law, is not fair.  I suggest that, whatever amendment to the legislation is necessary, the Minister should cut all that out and leave it to the board set up to examine the case to decide the matter.  If a person has no means whatever, he should get what it is intended to give him so as to prevent him from being a burden on his relatives whether it be his wife, his father, mother, brother or anybody else or on the local authority.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that he is bringing in legislation.  I want to make this appeal to him.  When a person has applied for a certificate of service under any of the Acts the application should include and be taken to include an application for a medal.  I have argued here time after time that the application for the major includes the lesser&mdash;and the medal is less, in a sense, than the certificate of service. Therefore, when a man has applied for a certificate of service that should automatically mean an application for a medal, that is, if the applicant does not succeed in getting the military service pension.  Medals are being issued and when they are granted the applicant is informed: &ldquo;This does not entitle you to the special allowance.&rdquo; For goodness' sake, stop issuing the medals if it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do.  I appeal to the Minister, in these circumstances, to stop issuing them until he amends the Act.  I assert, however, that it is possible by regulation to govern the point that if, say, I applied in 1934 for a certificate of service that was also an application for a medal.  In other words when an application is made for a certificate of service that application should be deemed to include an application for a medal.</P>

      <P>My point is that, having failed to get a certificate of service, he should not have to make a new application for a medal.  The one application should do for both a certificate of service and a medal.  In that application the applicant sets out his service.  The procedure is that I fill up a form for a military service certificate and I set out particulars of my service.  If it is found that I am not entitled to a certificate of service I contend that, without having to make a further application, that same application should be taken as an application for the lesser, to with, the medal.  A man should not have to start all over again and have to give particulars identical to those which he has already given on oath when applying for the certificate of service.  The one application should suffice.  If it is found that that application and that service entitles me to a medal then I submit that that medal has all its rights&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Not exactly.  The Minister was kind enough to say that he proposes to introduce legislation at an early stage and that he wanted a case to be made upon the whole question of pensions.  The Minister pointed out that he was in a difficulty in that he had not any case to answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2119" /> He gave a history of the legislative and administrative acts by the various Governments on behalf of the Old I.R.A. more or less to counter Deputy Keane's point that the Old I.R.A. were not being properly treated.  The Minister made the case that they were fairly generously treated as far as the Governments could go.  I think that is a fair interpretation of what he said. He summarised all the legislation.  I am appealing to the Minister that the new legislation will be the last one. The best that those of us who were in the Old I.R.A. have left now is 20 years, and that is an optimistic estimate. For the remaining 20 years during which you will have us I appeal to the Minister to do the decent thing once and for all.</P>
    <P>The Minister is a member of the Old I.R.A.  He occupied a very honourable and important post in the national struggle.  He knows our requirements just as well as I do.  I knew them when I was a Minister, and so does the Minister.  The Minister has particulars of the case made by the various organisations.  There is no point in my repeating it now and putting it on the records of the House, though if anybody thinks I should do so I will do so.  In these circumstances I do not think that there is any necessity for people like me to make the case, except in so far as to show our support of the Minister.  That will help him when he is resisting and fighting the hands of the Department of Finance&mdash;hands that have their grip round his throat just as they have their grip round the throat of anybody who attempts to do anything for the Old I.R.A.  I regret to say that there are some people in the Treasury Department of this country who have never forgiven the I.R.A. for the &ldquo;dirty work&rdquo; which they did in 1920-21 and changed the history of this country.</P>

      <P>As Deputy MacEoin has said, we are in rather a difficulty in regard to this matter to-day because we do not know what the terms of the <Col N="2120" /> new Bill will be.  When moving his motion the other night, Deputy Keane said that these pensioners should have been included in the general increase in pensions in 1950.  I think that they were the only class of pensioners who were omitted.  So far as the present Minister is concerned, I think that Deputy Keane is pushing an open door in trying to get help for the Old I.R.A.  He confined his motion to military service pensions only.  As Deputy MacEoin pointed out, there are various other facets of the case for better treatment for the Old I.R.A.  I hope that the new Bill which the Minister has stated is being prepared will cover all these points.  I think myself, having regard to the stage we now have reached, that Deputy MacEoin is right in expressing the hope that this should be the last effort to deal with the claims of the Old I.R.A.  It has been left perhaps too late having regard to the present age of many members of the Old I.R.A.</P>

      <P>I hope, as I have said, that this will be the last Bill of this character and that a real effort will now be made to meet claims that have not been dealt with in previous years. Deputy MacEoin stated that in the first Act the Government were forced to accept the abatement clause.  I must say that I cannot understand that statement.  I could never see what reason there was, or what argument could be made, for the abatement clause.  I have challenged it on a few occasions in this House before and how the Government could have been forced to accept it, as Deputy MacEoin says, I cannot understand. Unfortunately, that clause has been incorporated in the other Acts that followed.  I hope that the new Bill will make an honest attempt to deal with that clause and the only honest way to deal with it is to wipe it out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The special allowances means test is certainly a source of irritation but I am afraid that, no matter what we may do, so long as there is a means test cases will always arise that one will think have not been dealt with <Col N="2121" /> fairly.  There have been some rather remarkable cases, cases in which one could not see how any investigating officer could have taken the line he did.  As I have said, however, I expect these cases will arise so long as inquiry is necessary into the means of applicants.  I agree with Deputy MacEoin that if it could be so arranged, the application for a certificate should be taken to cover the application for a medal.  It would save an awful lot of trouble.  The fact that we have now cases of people who have got medals that do not entitle them to the special allowance has complicated matters very much.  I think it was a terrible mistake to have issued medals which did not carry the same rights as other medals.  That was done during the period of office of the previous Government and I think it was a very bad mistake.</P>

      <P>I was not present unfortunately when the Minister made his statement but I assume it was to the effect that something was about to be done for the people covered by this motion.  I think that was the gist of the statement.  I think it must be a cause of shame to this House and to various Governments over the last few years that military service pensions are at such a low level.  It would be I suppose futile to go back as far as <Col N="2122" /> 1916 and right up to 1921 in an attempt to remind this House and remind the country again what we of this generation owe to the men who made sacrifices in 1916 and over the subsequent five years.  Personally, I think we treated our pensioners in a very shabby fashion, especially when some of us are aware of how Governments of the country across the water have treated their ex-servicemen, including, as I am reminded by Deputy Davin, ex-servicemen of Irish extraction.</P>
      <P>From 1916 on to 1921, in fact for a period of seven or eight years, a small band of men including many who are, and who were, on the far side of the House and on this side of the House willingly gave their services in the fight for independence.  Thousands died that we might live and it is a very sad reflection on the Governments that we have had in this country for a number of years past to say that the average military service pension awarded for active service is less than £31 per year &mdash;£31 a year in this year of grace, 1952, when everyone is clamouring about the increased cost of living.  I make these remarks bearing in mind that the Minister has given an assurance that an attempt will shortly be made to deal with the claims of these men.  I assume that he will make a big effort to grant a substantial increase to these people who have been treated so shabbily in the past.  I know that many of those in receipt of military service pensions and of special allowances have been criticised and have been the objects of sarcastic sneers by many people who were traditionally, and who still are, opposed to the idea of a free united Republic of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hear many sneers about people in receipt of pensions or special allowances, and against whom it is alleged they did nothing and that, possibly, they were not in a particular locality at a particular time.  We have sarcastic gibes about other people against whom it is alleged that they were not even in the country during the troubled period from 1916 to 1921. It may be that there are one or two who did not deserve the pensions they got.  I do not suggest that is the fault of any Minister for Defence that we have had in this country since the <Col N="2123" /> State was set up.  There is one thing that we must remind ourselves of, because very often it is too easily forgotten, and that is that we would not be sitting in this House to-day and would not have a native Government if it were not for the sacrifices made by the people who are now appealing to us, to the Minister and to the Government to come to their assistance and help them to reach a somewhat better standard of life.</P>
    <P>There are many individual cases that could be mentioned.  I could give examples of how hard it is for those folk to exist on their present pensions or allowances.  I shall mention one case which is typical of many.  It has happened in the last few months and is not peculiar to the individual I have in mind.  The circumstances in the case apply to many persons in receipt of military service pensions.  This is the case of a man who was in receipt of a pension of £109 per annum.  By reason of the fact that he was a married man with a family, he came under the Social Welfare Act of 1952 and got an increase of, I think, 35/- per week. While the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Dr. Ryan, gave him that increase, the Minister for Defence took £45 off him.  That may not have been a deliberate act, but it is certainly due to an oversight, and I think that we and this House must hold ourselves guilty of that oversight as it applies to those Old I.R.A. men in receipt of military service pensions.</P>
    <P>I may say that they are becoming very cynical about the tributes which have been paid, which are being paid and which will be paid to the services which they rendered to the country in the past, especially when they remember what now happens under the Social Welfare Act.  They get something on the one hand under that Act, and on the other hand something is taken from them by the Minister for Defence. Is it any wonder that they are cynical when something like half the amount of their military service pension is taken from them, and in some cases their disability pension?</P>
    <P>I should like to make an appeal, not to the Minister but to those who were <Col N="2124" /> commanding officers from 1916 to 1921. In support of what I have to say, might I refer to the appeal for unity which was made by the President of our country some weeks ago?  It is to be regretted that we still have many prejudices down the country.  There are people who still remember the Civil War.  That is unfortunate, but everyone knows that an applicant for a military service pension must, as a prerequisite, have a military service medal.  When he asks his former commanding officer to certify that he was an active member of the Old I.R.A. up to July, 1921, he refuses to sign, because the two men concerned were on opposite sides in the Civil War.  That is widespread through the country.</P>

I do not think it would be totally irrelevant to suggest that Old I.R.A. men of different political persuasions should co-operate in a matter of this kind and make this gesture in the cause of unity by being fair to their former fellow-members of the Old I.R.A.  I am suggesting that they should forget their prejudices arising out of the Civil War period, and should be prepared to sign for a genuine Old I.R.A. man whether he was on one side or the other during the Civil War.  The attitude that I have referred to arises, in my opinion, from pure spite and prejudice, and I am not accusing one side more than the other so far as that goes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Breanndán Mac Fheórais</NameTxt>
      <P>I bow to your ruling, but I still suggest that it is relevant to this motion in the name of Deputy Keane which endeavours to ensure that all Old I.R.A. men will get a fair deal not only in respect of the military service pensions which they are in receipt of, as well as those who, ordinarily, would be due such a pension but who, owing <Col N="2125" /> to the prejudice of some person or persons, are not given them.</P>
      <P>I humbly suggest to the Minister that he should go even further than Deputy Keane suggests in this motion. He asks the Dáil to express the opinion that the pensions of Old I.R.A. men should be increased on a par with the increases given to other pensioners in the Republic of Ireland, and that as this increase is overdue it should be retrospective from the operative date of the increases given to other State pensioners.  I assume that Deputy Keane does not mean by his motion that the increase in the military service pension should be the miserable sum that was given to old age pensioners under a recent Act.  I hope he does not mean that the increase should be on the same scale as that given to widows and orphans or that it should be on a par with that given to pensioners under local authorities.  I support the suggestion that was made by Deputy Colley and Deputy MacEoin that the Minister should try to be fair and just with the Old I.R.A. men and bring their pensions up to such a figure as will enable them to enjoy a reasonable standard of living.  Many of us know that many of them are living in abject poverty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The special allowance that has been referred to is defined as a maximum figure, and that maximum figure is far too inadequate.  The fact is that so many conditions have to be complied with before one can qualify for it that it means absolutely nothing.  For example, if an Old I.R.A. man has a son working in England there is a certain deduction from the allowance. If he has a son working at home who makes some small contribution towards the upkeep of the family, that also is taken into account and the allowance is cut.  We, at least, ought to be able to do as much for our Old I.R.A. men as Britain is doing for her ex-servicemen who were in the 1914-1918 war, the Boer war and in the war of 1939-1945&mdash;the number in the latter case running into hundreds of thousands.  I suggest that since it is 30 odd years since we had a war, we surely ought to be able to do as much <Col N="2126" /> for our ex-servicemen, or as we call them, Old I.R.A. men, as Britain is doing for her ex-servicemen.</P>
    <P>In my home-town of Wexford, there are men in receipt of disability pensions arising out of their services in the 1939-1945 war who go to their clubs or wherever they meet and wave cheques for substantial amounts in front of unfortunate Old I.R.A. men who can only show cheques the average of which is £31 per year.  It is a very shameful position for our Old I.R.A. men when the British Government can afford to pay hundreds of thousands of ex-servicemen from their army substantial weekly or monthly amounts.  I suggest that inasmuch as the struggle which went on from 1916 to 1921 was of far greater and more significance to this country we should make an endeavour to see that the Old I.R.A. men can hold up their heads and that we, as representing the people of the country, and the Government responsible for the affairs of the country should do proper justice to these people who made it possible for people like the Minister and myself and the rest of us to sit in this free and independent House to-day.</P>

      <P>It is not often that we get this House as a forum to fight on behalf of the old Republican Army, and when we get the opportunity it is only right that we should make the best of it.  I am glad that there is always a happy, healthy atmosphere here when the claims of the old Republican Army come up for debate. I am also glad that after 30 years we have many old militant watchdogs able to plead on behalf of the Old I.R.A. men.  That is heartening to the people down the country who are looking forward to something being done.  On the one side we have the Minister for Defence and on the other side Deputy MacEoin standing four-square on behalf of these men.  That is something for which our people will be glad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I expect that this is the last opportunity we will have of dealing with this matter before the Bill is brought in.  I hope the Bill will bring justice to these men and that we will be able to write finis to this matter.  We know <Col N="2127" /> the circumstances of the last few years when things were not too happy as we had taken different roads.  But now we find that there is a plea for national unity and that our people are hearkening to that plea.  The greatest response to it we could make is to see that these people who gave us the right to sit here should get every consideration. These people gave us the right to sit here and they should get the consideration which they need very badly.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister when he is bringing in this Bill to put a final touch to it and see that the Department of Finance or nobody else will stand in the way; that he will fight the Department of Finance in the same way as he fought for his country in the past; that he will brace himself up and see that nothing will stand in his way.  We know the position of the people who formed the rank and file of this movement.  They are drawing from £6 to £15 a year as pension.  It is humiliating for them at the end of the quarter to get only £2 or £3 for the services which they rendered to the country.  They feel humiliated when they have to accept such a despicable sum.  Many of them are in sore need and want the few pounds badly.</P>
    <P>When the Bill is brought in I hope that every effort will be made to see that the lower grade pensioners are stepped up, not by 100 per cent. but by 700 per cent. so that they will be in a position of having a reasonably good living.  Those of us who are in the upper grade are in a better way of life and do not worry so much whether our pensions are increased or not. Many of these other men have big families of five or six children and they have to earn their living in a hard way and we should do everything we can for them.  Now that we have a happy atmosphere and that all sides of the House are in agreement, I hope that something will be done for them and that we will be able to write finis to this bickering which has been going on for years.  I know several people who were in the Black and Tans and who fought us bitterly and who are living in this country on handsome rewards <Col N="2128" /> from the British Government for services rendered against this country. They treat us with contempt.  It is humiliating to see these men with £4 £5 or £6 a week pension living in the same area with Old I.R.A. men drawing, not £6 per week, but £6 per year as a pension.  We should decide to change that.</P>
    <P>This motion has been on the Order Paper for a long time and it is only now that is has reached the light of day.  I am glad that it has done so before the final effort is made.  It will place the Minister in a stronger position to face the Government in order to get these grievances righted.  I know that he welcomes it, because every time we speak on behalf of these people it helps to strengthen his hands.  I know that he is one of those who feel sorely about the position of the Old I.R.A. men because he was one of the leaders of the organisation. He wants us to make a case from this forum so that we can strengthen his hands and we are glad to do it.</P>
    <P>For years we have been hearing that the Department of Finance was the trouble and that the country could not afford this.  Look at what the country has afforded over the last 30 years and the waste of millions of pounds which took place.  We could not afford to spend £2,000,000 or £3,000,000 in 1924 or 1927 when our squabbles ended.  If we had spent that and left these people in the position that they would not have to worry, all our troubles would have been forgotten.  Instead of that, we brought in Bill after Bill giving all types of allowances.  There would be no necessity for these allowances if a decent, honourable pension was given to these men.  They would not have to ask the State then for anything else.  I hope that the nation will respond to their claim now at the latter end of their lives.</P>
    <P>I can understand that over the long period of years when bitterness and hatred and spite were rampant in the country very much could not be done. We have left that period behind and we have now unity in the House and almost unity in the country and a desire to march in the right direction in the near future.  There is, therefore, no excuse for bringing in a pittance <Col N="2129" /> of a pension.  I hope that a satisfactory Bill will be brought in so that we will not have to say to the Minister: &ldquo;You did not do this or you did not do that.&rdquo;  The Minister should not let the Department of Finance stand in his way.  I know that they will stand in his way if there is not strength behind the drive.  We have the Old I.R.A. men all working together.  We have the Minister and members of all Parties ready to work with these people.</P>
    <P>There is, therefore, no excuse and this should be the final Bill and one which will do justice to the men who for 30 years have been fighting for justice but got nothing but contempt, insults and hardship.  If they only got a day's work on the roads or in the sandpits, their pension was whittled down.  Service pensions given to Irishmen for service to their country should be given and no more about it. There should be no whittling down until they go into their graves and do not want them.  I would make a final appeal to the Minister to do the big thing, to see that the Department of Finance does not stand in his way and if he does we will say: &ldquo;God bless you.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>It has been said on all sides of the House that there is complete unanimity in the request now being made to the Minister and I want to join in that appeal.  I have reason to know that in certain of our Dublin Corporation houses at the moment Old I.R.A. men are in difficulties about their rent and are threatened with eviction because they are not able to pay.  One man went so far as to give his name and ask me to use it in the interests of the others.  he served at one time with a soldier known as Oscar Traynor.  I think he was in the same battalion.  That soldier is now the Minister.  This man's name is Owen Meade, formerly of the North Strand, now of Cabra.  He has a miserable pension and is now broken in health. He had a pension of £90 a year but when his son got a job, an ordinary small job in some industry in the city, the pension was reduced to £10.  Subsequently, <Col N="2130" /> on appeal to the Minister, it went back to something better than £10.  What it is to-day I do not know. All I know is that Owen is broken down in health and in difficulties with his rent.  He told me to say something. I want that clearly understood. I do not think it is right to give people's names but when a man gives me his name so as to help others and to get them out of difficulties I feel I can mention his name.</P>
      <P>A complete overhaul of legislation is required.  Suppose an Old I.R.A. man gets a job with a local authority or as an usher in this House or a messenger. If an Old I.R.A. pension has been allotted to him it is stopped completely when he goes on the payroll of the local authority with a moderate workman's wage.  That is shameful. The county owes these men something better.  They should have something to fall back on as well as the weekly wages which they are earning at the present moment.</P>
      <P>I know a good many of these men. Deputy Harry Colley knows that I know a good many of them on the North Strand.  I would go so far as to say that the North Strand and the parish of St. Laurence O'Toole's was responsible for the foundation of this State, that it was in that area that everything which led up to the formation of this House took place.  Some day some writer will write about it and I hope that it will not be left too long.  I know some of these men who served in 1916 who are on the unemployed list.  I have here a letter from George Gavan Duffy addressed Gray's Inns and dated 16/6/1917, giving me certain names, asking me to do something for them and to get him some evidence to help in their defence.  I have another letter addressed St. John's Road, Oxford, dated 27th December, 1916, and signed P.N. Count Plunkett and Countess Plunkett.  I have another document addressed to Alfred Byrne, Esq., M.P., the House of Commons, from the Irish prisoners at Frongoch dated 26th October, 1916.</P>

      <P>I think it is.  It is a report from Frongoch and 1916 men are named in it.  The next names are Richard J. Mulcahy, Leader No. 3 Room and T.D. Sinnott, Leader No. 5 Room.  I knew them.  I visited them at Frongoch, at Oxford, at Reading, at Wandsworth, at Knutsford and at Aylesbury.  Some of them were women prisoners at Aylesbury.  What about the women?  I hope that the motion means the women too who served in those days gone by.  I have known women who rendered great service in those days.  I visited them in Aylesbury Jail.  I met them in prison cells.  I do not know how they are doing now.  There may be some who succeeded in business but there are probably others who did not.  The Old I.R.A. men are dying rapidly. Their time has arrived.  They are beginning to drift out.  Every week it will cost the State less and less to give them a decent means of livelihood.  A complete overhaul of legislation is now needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My authority was questioned.  I was asked why I asked about the Old I.R.A. men.  I was supplied with official documents by the Mansion House Committee.  They want unity. Any time I put a question, I want to assure the Minister it was as a result of an official request to join in this campaign and show him and the House that these men should get decent treatment.  I would join, then, with the others in asking the Minister to do something quickly and not to wait until to-morrow, next week, next month or next year when another <Col N="2132" /> dozen of these men will have passed to their eternal reward.  Give it to them now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>As an Independent Deputy, I want to endorse the appeal made from all parts of the House for an improvement in the pensions and allowances given to members of the Old I.R.A.  I think that the main obstacle to doing justice to these men has come from the Department of Finance and has arisen from financial considerations, but I think that every Deputy in the House will realise that the passing of the years has reduced the financial burden on the State in that connection.  It is most urgently necessary that something big should be done at this stage.</P>
      <P>I think it is now admitted that it was a pity that something big was not done in earlier years and that a fairly large sum was not set aside, perhaps not to provide annual pensions but to establish in life men whose lives had been disrupted by service to the State. If in the early years money had been set aside to establish on farms or in some independent way of life the men who had served the State, less expenditure would have been involved than has now occurred, as a result of the efforts, well meant efforts perhaps, at financial cheeseparing down through the years.  However, what has been and what has not been done cannot, I suppose, be rectified now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the House is unanimous in asking that the allowances and pensions provided for the men entitled to them should be increased.  I have not been requested by anyone to mention this and I do not know whether it would be a feasible proposition at this late stage to offer in exchange for the pension where the men so desire a lump sum to set them up in some business. Many, I know, the vast majority, now are past the age when such an alternative to a pension would be feasible.  There are still some men who, if given a lump sum of money, might be able so to invest it as to benefit themselves and their families.  I would like the Minister, when he is dealing with this matter, to give consideration to that alternative.  It is <Col N="2133" /> satisfactory to know from the Minister's statement that he does intend to introduce legislation at an early date.  All we can do at this stage is to wish him God speed.</P>
    <P>As far as special allowances are concerned, I think that in cases where men are disabled and unable to earn a living, the means test should not be too rigid.  I think also that there should not be too much delay in considering their particular cases.  I know men who served in the British army for only a short time during the 1914-18 war and, having suffered slight disability, have been drawing pensions since 1918.  Some of those men who were merely privates in the British army are at the present time in receipt of a pension of £200 and in some cases £250 per year.</P>
    <P>That treatment compares very unfavourably with the treatment which the Irish Government has afforded to its soldiers.  No matter what considerations may be submitted to the Minister in regard to the cost of providing at least some measure of justice, he will see how necessary it is to override those considerations in this particular matter, and see that justice is done even at this late hour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fanning</NameTxt>
      <P>Being one of the new members of this House, I am glad to say I am in full support of the remarks made from both sides of the House.  I know the circumstances of some of those people down my way, and the hardships they must suffer because of this meagre pension, which is far too small.  The biggest insult that was ever offered to those people was to give them the small sum of £6 or £7 per year.  There should be no great difficulty in having those pensions increased.  Considering the large number of Old I.R.A. men who have gone to their eternal reward, it will not be very costly.  In conclusion, may I say that respect is due to those people?  By their heroic efforts they have made the road for people like us. They deserve our gratitude and respect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Deputies Colley, MacEoin, Giles and every other <Col N="2134" /> Deputy who has encouraged the Minister&mdash;although encouragement is, I am sure, unnecessary so far as he is personally concerned&mdash;in connection with the promised amending legislation which, it is hoped, will clear up and settle all the genuine, outstanding cases.  I regret personally that the motion is limited in its scope, but I know that is not the fault of Deputy Keane, who is responsible for putting down the motion.</P>
      <P>As an officer of the Labour Party, I am fairly fully acquainted with the history of the original Military Service Pensions Act, and particularly with the history of the Act which came into operation after Fianna Fáil took office for the first time in 1932.  If the Minister is in any doubt about my knowledge of what happened at that particular period, I think his colleague, the Minister for Justice, who was then the Chief Whip of the Fianna Fáil Party, will be able to enlighten him on our point of view as expressed at that particular period.  At that time the Fianna Fáil Government were depending upon our votes to get into office and to remain in office for the short lifetime of what was the 1932-33 Dáil. In putting the Labour Party point of view to the Minister and his colleagues, through the present Minister for Justice, at that particular period, we expressed a very definite opinion that any pension scheme that would be brought in by the Fianna Fáil Government should be in an upward direction rather than a downward direction.  I personally, and every one of my colleagues, regret that the Act of 1934 had not provided pensions at least as good as were provided for those who qualified under the Act of 1924.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is now an opportunity, through this amending legislation, to rectify what I regard as a blunder.  The men who qualified under the 1934 Act are entitled, particularly for their pre-truce service, at least to the same treatment, although it is not very generous, as those who qualified under the 1924 Act. If that can be done by the Minister even under the new amending legislation&mdash;and I am sure it is his wish and his will&mdash;it will help, at any rate, to give further support to the appeal for <Col N="2135" /> unity that was recently made by our respected President when he was unveiling a monument to the Old I.R.A. men in County Limerick.</P>
    <P>I suppose it is only natural that in respect of people who gave similar service in pre-Truce days in their own respective areas, they would be jealous, one of the other, where one is getting a pension which averages half what his colleague got.  If that can be rectified I would encourage the Minister to do it.  Every one of us here who knows the courageous history of the present Minister for Defence and Deputy MacEoin, an old colleague who sits on this side of the House, can have no doubt about their sympathy or their desire to do the right and the just thing in a matter of this kind.  I agree with Deputy MacEoin, because his view is based upon some knowledge, that it is most unfortunate that whatever is amiss in regard to this whole matter is due to the overpowering influence of civil servants who sit in high seats and who apparently are able to modify, through the legislation that comes before the House, the views expressed by a Government on a policy matter.  I remember an occasion, and so does the Minister, when a policy decision was taken during the last emergency that any policy decisions taken in regard to the strengthening of our national defence forces at that time should not, and as far as I am concerned were not, interferred with by civil servants, whether they were in high or in low positions.</P>
    <P>The same attitude should be adopted by the Government in this matter and I hope the Minister will see to it that whatever power he has been given by way of a policy decision in this connection, whatever kind of cases he has been authorised to clear up, whatever results he has been authorised to effect in the way of levelling up the miserable pittances that are now being paid will be put down in plain language in the different sections of whatever amending Bill comes before the House, and that no civil servant, no matter how highly placed he may be, will be allowed to interfere with a policy decision of the Cabinet on this matter.</P>
    <P>A very large number of the Old <Col N="2136" /> I.R.A. men have passed to their reward.  I suppose under the amending legislation that those who qualify now, 35 years after they have given this service, will not get the benefit of retrospective legislation.  They are going to be made suffer because their cases were not dealt with at the time they should have been dealt with. Deputy Keane calls, in his motion, for an increase in the existing pensions. I am not satisfied that pensions of £6 a year should be doubled.  A pension of £6 a year to any man who gave any kind of service, who wore the uniform and went out even on one occasion, is an insult.  I have always taken the view that, if there was any justification for the thousands of pensions under £20 a year that are being paid to men who qualify, the pensions should be commuted and a lump sum given to the individuals concerned that would be sufficient to enable them to do something for themselves rather than wait from year to year for a miserable pittance of £6, £10 or, as in the majority of cases, pensions under £20 a year. Deputy Keane could have spoken at length on that aspect of the matter from his personal knowledge and experience.</P>
    <P>I suppose the circular that I received was sent to every Deputy. In that circular we have it from the representatives of the Old I.R.A. that the average pensions under the 1924 Act are almost double the pensions provided for under the amending Act of 1934.  There is something radically wrong there which I hope will be rectified. I am sure the Minister would desire to do so in fairness to everybody concerned.</P>
    <P>As a Deputy, I have never sought out grievances of Old I.R.A. men or any section of my constituents.  I do not canvass for grievances for the purpose of advertising them in the House as political propaganda, but I am not satisfied with the manner in which the Military Service pensions Act is being administered.  I hope something will be done to tidy up the administrative side when the promised legislation comes into operation.  It is a disgrace that a genuine applicant should have to wait 12 months or more for a decision <Col N="2137" /> in connection with his application for disability pension.</P>

The Minister will find unanimous accord in this House with any effort he makes to solve this problem finally.  When I spoke yesterday on another Bill catering for former Directors or Ministers of the Provisional Government, I made a case that I could repeat now.  I do not wish to do that.  Let the Minister's effort this time be a full effort.  Let him approach the matter with the <Col N="2138" /> assurance that there will be a unanimous Dáil behind him.</P>
      <P>I am not at all enamoured at the terms of the motion.  I have discussed with the Minister over a number of years cases that will not be met by this motion.  I would make an urgent appeal to the Minister to bring the legislation in forthwith.  We would be prepared to make available any time that the Government wants to get this legislation through.  As Deputy Alderman Byrne said, the numbers are rapidly decreasing.  It would be a comfort to us, particularly to the newer generation, to feel that we helped to give justice to these people by our acknowledgment of their service to this country, irrespective of what may have subsequently happened. In all sincerity I say that the newer generation would have satisfaction if this Dáil could make a gesture to these people that might give them a measure of justice commensurate with the extraordinary service and sacrifice that made our membership of the Dáil possible.  I put it as bluntly as that.  I have referred to that generation as a generation of achievement. As a younger Deputy, born at the period when this service was given to the State, I would feel it not only a duty but a privilege and honour to be able, with my voice in the Dáil, to see that whatever satisfaction and justice the State could give was accorded to them.</P>
      <P>I know that the present Minister is anxious to do that and that he is as conscious of their grievance as I am. From personal contact with the Minister in this connection, I know of his interest in the matter and I feel that I am pushing an open door.  I make this appeal not in any Party spirit or for political purposes.  I make it as a young man conscious of his debt to that generation.  I say to the Minister: &ldquo;God speed.  Make the effort a good one.&rdquo;  I feel proud that I am able to play my part in asking the Minister to make that effort.</P>

That was not through any fault of their own.  It may have been due to bad health or to the locality where they lived that they were not able to take advantage of the legislation.  I have in mind a particular case which I have brought to the notice of the Department on a few occasions, of an applicant who applied for a medal.  I understand that a medal can be given, at the discretion of the Minister, but that does not entitle the applicant to the special allowance.

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of Deputy Oliver Flanagan, I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that all main and trunk roads should be maintained from State funds, as local authorities find it impossible to maintain them with present State aid; and that, as turf-producing counties have increased road traffic, and should have increased road grants for county roads, the Government should formulate a scheme for the provision of special road grants to all county councils who are engaged in turf production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2140" /> This motion deals with two particular problems&mdash;first of all, problems which arise in all counties relating to the maintenance of main and trunk roads and, secondly, the particular problem that arises in turf-producing counties in relation to road maintenance.  The motion asks that more assistance be given by the Government from Central Funds for these purposes.  I would like, first of all, as a Deputy for a large turf-producing constituency, to deal with the particular problem which faces turf-producing counties.  In part of my constituency, in County Offaly, a very considerable contribution has been made over the years to turf production. County Offaly engaged, particularly during the years of the emergency, largely in the production of hand-won turf, and to aid in that a considerable amount of local authority effort was diverted from road maintenance towards turf production.  In addition, the main and trunk roads in the county had to bear considerable lorry traffic, not only on account of turf production within the county but on account of the turf transport from the West of Ireland towards the City of Dublin.</P>
    <P>By reason of all this, the problem of road maintenance there became extremely acute at the end of the emergency. Roads began to deteriorate, through this heavy lorry traffic within the county and crossing the county from Roscommon, Galway and other counties west of the Shannon.  In the later years of the emergency, during 1947 and 1948, while county council turf production was still in operation, the Government, conscious of its responsibility in relation to the maintenance of main and trunk roads throughout the country, made substantial road grants to different county councils.</P>
    <P>In Offaly, as I am sure also in the case of other turf-producing counties, these grants were not used.  The large grants-in-aid in 1947 and 1948 for the maintenance of main and trunk roads could not be utilised by Offaly County Council because all their employees were engaged in turf production. Accordingly, the grants directed by the Minister for Local Government for County Offaly could not be spent.  That was caused by the real and substantial <Col N="2141" /> effort being made in Offaly to add to the pool of turf in the country.  I mention this matter to illustrate the particular problem in Offaly and how it has arisen.</P>
    <P>The present position, with which the motion deals, is that in this turf-producing county&mdash;and to a certain extent also in County Laois&mdash;the local council finds it impossible to make up the leeway caused by the effort made during the emergency.  The problem now facing them is so immense that it cannot be dealt with by any local finance that may be raised by a charge on rates.  Accordingly, one part of this motion asks that, in regard to any turf-producing county, conscious of the heavy burdens which turf production brings to main and trunk roads, the Government should regard the maintenance of those roads as a national charge.  That case in relation to turf-producing counties is not a case that can be answered.</P>
    <P>With regard to the second branch of the motion, which deals with main and trunk roads generally, I suppose it is arguable whether or not local rates should be called on to contribute to road maintenance.  The fact is clear, however, and it will be accepted, that the country's main road arteries running from Dublin to the South, to the North and to the West transcend in importance any matter of local consideration.  We realise now that, whatever the cause may be, we are passing from the days of the iron road, from the days when the railroad connected the capital with provincial capitals and with other parts of the country.  We will become more and more dependent on the main road artery as the means of inter-communication and as the big mode of carrying heavy freight and other heavy traffic. Accordingly, the situation is quite different to the situation that obtained, say, at the passing of the original Grand Jury Act which provided for a poor rate and a rate for the maintenance of roads.  In those days, 100 years or so ago, the local road was merely a county road which connected up different parts of the county.  It was incidental that a county road running across Laois or Offaly happened <Col N="2142" /> to join up with a county road running across Carlow or Kildare. That was incidental.</P>
    <P>I know of one road in Laois where the road builders failed to effect a proper junction and it took some time before the two county roads were joined together into a main or trunk road.  Conditions have changed and the importance of main and trunk roads to-day is quite different to their importance 100 years or so ago.</P>
    <P>We still operate in this country the same method of financing road maintenance. Agreed that the Central Government does to a certain extent recognise its responsibility by making grants-in-aid out of the Road Fund for the maintenance of main and trunk roads, but that is always a problematical matter each year because neither the amount, the extent nor the conditions of these grants are constant. There is very little assurance to a local authority that road grants will be continued over a period of years at a certain figure and subject to certain well-known conditions.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, in relation to road maintenance each year, when the rate has to be struck, there is a period of waiting to know what the Department of Local Government will do and what grants will be made available.  I think that the present situation is not satisfactory.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks this Dáil has substantially increased the method of financing the Road Fund.  It has done that, but I suppose it would have done it anyway.  It was done and accompanied by an assurance from the present Minister that the Road Fund would never again be dissipated for purposes other than that for which it was formed.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that he should accept the principle of making the four or five main arteries in the country a national charge and that he should finance the maintenance of these main road arteries out of the Central Fund.  By doing that we will have uniform roads.  We will have the same road policy applicable throughout the country and generally.  In a country depending, as this country does, to a large extent upon a tourist <Col N="2143" /> trade we will be able to give better service to road users.  For these reasons this motion has been put down and it is for those reasons that I urge its acceptance by Dáil Éireann.</P>

      <P>While seconding this motion, I think it is one that the House should consider with certain reservations.  The mere fact of the State taking over the main and trunk roads as a national charge does not shift in any way any portion of the burden of road maintenance from the local authorities to the State.  It is possible, under present circumstances, for the State to make a smaller contribution towards the maintenance of the entire road system by taking over the main roads and leaving the reconstruction of all the country roads to the local authorities than if they were to proceed along the lines the Minister has envisaged.</P>
      <P>I think it is a mistake that this motion should come at a time when we, as a House, are trying to make additional contributions to the local authorities for the reconstruction and the improvement of our county roads generally and of our road system.  I think it is an opportune time to discuss in an earnest and objective way the whole policy of road construction and improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a time when we should consider objectively whether road reconstruction and improvement should be left entirely to the local authority or whether it should be taken over by some central authority as a permanent policy.  These are matters which will require serious consideration.  There are, I suppose, three avenues open, <Col N="2145" /> one to nationalise our entire road system and something might be said for that.  The second is to leave it entirely in the hands of the local authority and the third is to group a number of counties together, as has been suggested in this House, for the purpose of higher efficiency in road construction.</P>
    <P>I do not feel too enthusiastic about the proposal embodied in this motion to separate road construction into two categories.</P>

I do not think there is much in what Deputy O'Higgins says about the central authority undertaking the construction of even the really arterial roads.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dunne has given notice of his intention to raise the manner in which the Minister for Local Government supplied prior information to a Deputy of the House of his sanction of the proposal to increase road workers' wages in County Dublin, which he withheld a few days earlier in response to a Dáil question. I am allowing Deputy Dunne to raise that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to call in question the covert and reprehensible manner in which the Minister conveyed to a Deputy of his own Party the knowledge that he was about to sanction, or had, in fact, sanctioned, an increase in wages for road workers in County Dublin.  In doing this, I consider that I shall be successful in exposing what is nothing less than a political racket.  I am concerned not just with the question of what has occurred in this case.  I am concerned with the standards that guide any <Col N="2146" /> Cabinet Minister or member of any Party who indulges in political chicanery of this kind, and I am concerned on behalf of the people with the knowledge of the kind of mind that lies behind the present Administration which permits, connives and manoeuvres small, mean and petty things such as this action.</P>
      <P>I want briefly to give the background of this situation so that the position may be clear.  On 13th May this year, the union representing these workers, the Federation of Rural Workers, addressed a letter to the Dublin City and County Manager wherein they submitted that, because of the substantial increase in the cost of living brought about by the Budget, the road workers in County Dublin, like all other workers, were entitled to an increase in wages.  That step was taken by the union representing the men on 13th May.  On July 2nd of this year, a conference took place in the City Hall between representatives of the men's union and the City Manager.  Certain proposals were made to the men's representatives on that occasion, which proposals were rejected because of their inadequacy.</P>
      <P>On 8th July, a special meeting of the Finance and General Purposes Committee of Dublin County Council was summoned in order to consider what was to be done in the situation in which the road workers were claiming an increase which the manager was not willing to concede.  The Finance and General Purposes Committee of Dublin County Council came to a certain conclusion in regard to that matter, and Dublin County Council met on July 14th and again considered the position of the road workers in their employment, and, as a result of that discussion, a special meeting of the Finance and General Purposes Committee was called on Wednesday, 23rd July.  On July 24th, the union representing the men had a further meeting with the Manager and, after negotiations, on August 21st and 25th and September 1st, correspondence ensured between the Manager and the union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It immediately becomes manifest that the principal body in this context was Dublin County Council, the premier county council of Ireland.  This <Col N="2147" /> body had decided by a majority vote, which was eventually converted into a unanimous vote, to increase the wages of the road workers by 15/- per week. That proposal was not acceptable to the Manager, who sent forward a recommendation to the Minister stating that he was prepared to increase the wages of the workers by 10/- a week.  That was all perfectly in order and as it should be, but I want to emphasise that Dublin County Council was the body chiefly concerned in this whole affair.</P>
    <P>On 29th October I put the following question to the Minister for Local Government:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If he will state with regard to the proposals which have been submitted to his Department by the Dublin City and County Manager concerning the wages of road workers employed by the Dublin County Council, the nature of such proposals, and if it is proposed to approve of them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The reply was:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have received a proposal to increase the wages of the Dublin County Council road labourers from 95/- to 100/- a week from the 1st April, 1952, and from 100/- to 105/- per week from 5th July, 1952.  The proposal is under consideration.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On 12th November, I asked the following question:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To ask the Minister for Local Government if he has yet reached a decision in relation to the recommendation of Dublin County and City Manager for increased wages for County Dublin road workers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The reply was:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The matter is still under consideration.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That question was asked two weeks after the first question, so that it was a fortnight under consideration.  The latter question was asked on last Wednesday week.  On Friday evening, there appeared on the streets one paper, the <i>Evening Mail,</i> and to and behold, what did we read?  Nothing less than a statement that an announcement had been made to a Deputy of the Minister's Party to the effect that he <Col N="2148" /> had now decided to sanction an increase in wages for road workers.  That may appear funny to some, but I wonder if this will amuse them.  The Dublin County Council, who provide the money, were not informed by the Minister until yesterday morning.  I wonder will they laugh that off so easily.  This is just another example of what occurs in many other spheres, as the presence here of Deputy Gallagher reminds me.  He took occasion very recently to question the right of a public representative to receive and publish information from a public organisation, Córas Iompair Éireann.  It was obvious that Deputy Gallagher was concerned with gaining votes in NorthWest Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with a particular incident and the Deputy should keep to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply given by the Minister for Industry and Commerce was that he looked with disfavour on that kind of activity, that he considered that matters of that kind should be made public by means of a public statement and he inferred that he thought it was a positively disreputable practice for the Deputy in question to have written a letter and received a reply in a perfectly normal, legitimate and decent manner, with regard to a subject with which he had been dealing, not just this year but over many years, in County Dublin.</P>
      <P>Here we have a case where there is the most flagrant evidence and an abundance of evidence of collusion between the Minister and his friend in order to try to score what was in fact no more than a petty political point.  I am not, however, concerned about that.  It will not matter one jot in County Dublin.  Deputy Burke, when taking part in this little conspiracy, this pseudo-smart political trick, overlooked the intelligence of the people with whom he was dealing. He forgot that he is regarded by the men affected in this case as an unconscious comedian and this was just one of the more doubtful jokes perpetrated by him on my constituents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2149" /> Are these the standards upon which the country will be run?  Is an important local authority, such as the Dublin County Council which has to provide the money&mdash;a very substantial sum of money&mdash;to meet these increases to be brushed aside for the sake of presenting one of the backbenchers of the Minister's Party with what was thought to be a little advantage?  Is that the standard upon which the country will be run? Apparently it is.</P>
    <P>This action was disreputable.  It cannot but be condemned by those who hope to see a proper standard of conduct established in public life for public men.  It seems to be forgotten at times that when people are elected to this House a certain responsibility is thrust upon them and that responsibility does not rest merely in walking into the Division Lobby in order to bolster up whatever Administration may be in power.  That responsibility extends to every action of every member of the Government.  It is their duty to act with decency and integrity and without any suggestion of political connivance or the kind of political trickery that is in evidence here to-day. We have seen other cases of that.  On a previous occasion the same Deputy&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I must be forgiven if I make reference to his henchman now and again.  I raise this matter because of representations that were made to me by various people who said: &ldquo;We knew politics was a queer game but we did not know it was quite as low as this.&rdquo;  Someone once said that &ldquo;politics was the last refuge of a scoundrel.&rdquo;  We should not try to justify that cliché.  We should rather try to prove that the work in which we are engaged will be carried out honestly and without our endeavouring, for the sake of a few paltry votes, to score an advantage.  But this piece of trickery has not even achieved that effect though that is what it was designed to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I may make some excuse for <Col N="2150" /> the attitude of some members of the Minister's Party I can make no excuse for the Minister and I will be interested to learn how the Minister justifies this. When I am speaking of this matter I am sure I am speaking on behalf of all the members of the Dublin County Council.  I am quite certain that the members of the Minister's own Party on that council will take a very dim view of his action in this regard. Supporters of the Minister's Party have already represented their views to me upon what has been done.  The action was petty.  It was small, but it is at the same time an indication or a pointer to the general attitude of the Administration that is now in office here.</P>

      <P>I try to be, and I hope I am, a responsible Deputy representing County Dublin, being, as I am, a member of a Party concerned with the welfare of all sections of the people. A number of the road workers concerned have been in here in the Dáil making representations to me and asking me to get the Minister to expedite sanction of the increase in County Dublin.  Instead of putting down a parliamentary question, I asked the Minister at every opportunity I got to expedite sanction for an increase in the road workers' wages in County Dublin.  Because of the large number of road workers coming in here to me I was concerned for their welfare and I pressed the Minister very hard.  I would do the same to-morrow with any other Minister.  I make no apology for it.  I am here to serve the people to the best of my ability.  Deputy Dunne's lament&mdash;I must try to set it to music some day when I have a bit of time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Had that answer been given there would not be one word to-day.  The Minister would be a grant fellow.  The Deputy referred to me here in a way that is worthy of him but I will not descend to that level. The people of County Dublin have returned me twice at the head of the poll and I do not want to play this mean political game one way or the other.  If in the same circumstances anyone again asks me to do what I believe to be my duty here, I will do my duty.  When I pressed this matter with the Minister I was only doing my duty.  For three years I saw the misrepresentation that went on.  I never raised a question about it.  To-day has been a lesson to me.  A good deal of misrepresentation went on in so far as honour and decency are concerned in public life.  I will not hang my head for anybody because of my actions.  I am grateful to the Minister for acceding to my request on behalf of the road workers in County Dublin.  I hope they will appreciate the Minister's action.  There was no connivance. There was just plain representation and nothing else.  Naturally when I got the good news I did what any other Deputy would do.  Instead of writing out 100 letters I told the Press about it and let them give the good news immediately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry I have been the cause of butting in, as it were, between Deputy Burke and Deputy Dunne in the methods they employ in publicity matters.  I would like to remind Deputy Dunne and other Deputies that the increase in wages was a matter that had to have my consideration, not only in relation to County Dublin <Col N="2152" /> but in relation to other counties as well.  Proposals for increases reached me from Carlow, Kildare, Laoighis, Tipperary North and South Ridings, Kerry, Kilkenny and Wicklow.  Some of these proposals were in my Department for many weeks before the County Dublin proposal reached me in October.</P>
      <P>As I explained here, correspondence was necessary as between my Department and the county managers to enable me to come to a uniform decision in connection with these proposals. Deputy Dunne was not the only Deputy who asked me a parliamentary question in relation to the wages paid to County Dublin road workers. Deputy Cosgrave, on the same day, asked a similar question.  Deputy Spring asked a question in relation to County Kerry.  It was, in fact, the delay in securing information from the Kerry County Council, through its manager, that caused the delay in dealing with all the other proposals.</P>
      <P>I repudiate the suggestion that it is only Deputies who table parliamentary questions here who are entitled to approach a Minister and make recommendations to him as to what they think he should do in connection with these matters.  As long as I have been in political life, it is an accepted practice that Deputies supporting a Government should not avail of the Order Paper for the purpose of eliciting information from Ministers.  That practice was departed from for three years. It is a practice that should not have been departed from.  The Order Paper should be available to Opposition Deputies at all times.</P>

If, having made a decision, a Deputy stops me in the corridor and asks me if I have dealt with it, I would naturally inform him on the matter.

I gave a decision and, having given it, I was asked by a Deputy who was interested in the proposal in regard to one of these counties if I had come to my decision. I said I had.
